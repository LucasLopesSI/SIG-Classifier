Taking a map too seriously may lead to pernicious reification: map and world are conflated. As one family of cases of such reification, I focus on maps exuding the omphalos syndrome, whereby a centred location on the map is taken to be the world navel of, for instance, an empire. I build on themes from my book When Maps Become the World, in which I analogize scientific theories to maps, and develop the tools of assumption archaeology and integration platforms. Here I argue that excavating assumptions helps fill cartographic silences, showing the limitations of perspectives often at war. Furthermore, integrating perspectives permits resisting imperial central or master images. A worthwhile future project would be a repository of world-navel maps, critically annotated with cultural context and imperial information. Mutual understanding may result from such an integration platform, perhaps implemented online or in a museum. © 2019, © 2019 British Cartographic Society.;"assumptions; cartographic representation; cartographic silence; Omphalos syndrome; philosophy of science; reification";"archaeology; cartography; culture; imperialism; Internet; map; museum";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85087572863;1

WebGIS platforms are responding to this demand by delivering cost-effective, relatively easy to use compared to desktop GIS software, and increasingly sophisticated tools. The continued advancement of webGIS platforms highlights the necessary, but tricky, integration of these platforms into university curriculum. In this paper, we develop an evaluation framework for users to assess, compare, and benchmark the cartographic capabilities of four webGIS platforms–ArcGIS Online, Carto, Mapbox, and GIS Cloud–against standard GIS functionality. The webGIS platforms studied offer advanced data management and some spatial analysis capabilities, but in contrast, they have limited cartographic capabilities for creating static maps. Recognizing that platforms change, and change often, this study serves to benchmark the capabilities of webGIS platforms, while reflecting on the observed challenges to teaching neocartography tools. © 2019, © 2019 British Cartographic Society.;"cartographic standards; desktop GIS; evaluation metric; neocartography; neogeography; WebGIS platforms";"ArcGIS; benchmarking; cartography; comparative study; curriculum; software; spatial analysis; teaching";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85087563018;1

Evocative places are places that evoke an especially emotional response in terms of images, memories and/or emotions. We aim to contribute to a better understanding of emotions in relation to places. Our study concentrates on Ames, a small university town in the Midwest in North America. The collected 192 locations show two areas with high concentrations of evocative places, specifically the university campus and Ada Hayden Heritage Park. This study opened up challenging research questions related to fuzzy or non-existing boundaries of places, a variety of shapes of places, and questions related to the challenges of modelling emotions as objects or attributes in a geographic information system.

The continuous development of the Austrian system is compared to the more gradual evolution of the Polish system, the development of which was more complex because of the historical and political developments in this country’s turbulent past. However both systems have common roots with the Franciscan Cadastre. The investigation is based on development of the legal instruments, the institutional settings, the technical procedures, and the final products of the respected countries. The comparison of the development in the two countries and the results of the investigated quality assessment of cadastral maps clearly document that the smooth development of a cadastre requires a stable political situation. The Austrian cadastre had already almost finished the period of consolidation, harmonization, and completion in 1938. This allowed a new area of further development to evolve after 1945. In Poland, the unfinished tasks of homogenization and harmonization in 1939 and the significant changes in the political system in 1945 delayed consolidation, harmonization, and completion of the cadastral system and impeded the continuous development of the system for the next decades. © 2020, © 2020 British Cartographic Society.;"Austria; cadastral information system; cadastral map; Franciscan Cadastre; Galicia; land book; Poland";"cadastre; historical cartography; map; political development; political system; Austria; Galicia [Poland-Ukraine]";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85078455751;1

Fictional maps are maps of imaginary territories. This type of map is now common in fiction, but they arose relatively late, in the second half of the nineteenth century, and are considered an independent branch of cartography today. They stand out through the way they are published because they are component parts of books and not independent cartographic works, and therefore their creators are not cartographers but rather the authors of these books. Fictional maps are mostly subordinate to the story, but they serve to give a sense of historical authenticity and draw the reader into the story. Without networks of coordinates and with labels such as ‘the end of the world’, they are spatially indeterminate, but they establish a connection between the fictional landscape and its identity. This study deals with 89 fictional maps from recent children’s and young adult literature. First we present a historical overview of these works and fictional maps, and then a cartographic analysis of fictional maps. We examined seventy-seven books with fictional maps and evaluated the maps according to five groups of standard cartographic elements: natural elements, built elements, toponyms, mathematical elements, and explanatory elements. We discuss the differences between cartographic representation of fictional maps and historic maps, and build a cartographic model based on the frequency of cartographic elements to put fictional maps into historic and geographical contexts. © 2019, © 2019 British Cartographic Society.;"cartographic analysis; geography of fiction; history of cartography; human geography; Maps";"cartography; comparative study; history of geography; human geography; mapping method; nineteenth century; reconstruction";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85075973915;1

It does so by collecting spatial material, i.e. attestations of place names and other location-based data from medieval vernacular manuscripts, early prints, and runic inscriptions from fictional, non-biblical, and scientific texts dated to before 1530, and providing free access to these spatial references through a tailored back-end MySQL database and an interactive end-user interface with mapping via Leaflet and Leaflet.markercluster. This paper discusses how geocoding can be problematic when applied to pre-modern materials, as the concept of space is a temporal and social variable, especially when dealing with ideas about places abroad. The geospatial visualization employed by the project has no ambition to represent a historically correct worldview as understood by medieval Scandinavians. Rather, it is an anachronistic tool for managing and obtaining an overview of the spatial references in East Norse texts. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Visual variables are used to transform information into visual forms that are perceived by the powerful human vision system. However, previous studies of visual variables focused on methods of ‘drawing information’ without considering ‘intelligence’ derived from balancing ‘importance’ and ‘unimportance’. This paper proposes semantic visual variables to support an augmented geovisualization that aims to avoid exposing users to unnecessary information by highlighting goal-oriented content over redundant details. In this work, we first give definitions of several concepts and then design a semiotic model for depicting the mechanisms of augmented geovisualization. We also provide an in-depth discussion of semantic visual variables based on a hierarchical organization of the original visual variables, and we analyse the critical influencing factors that affect the choice of visualization forms and visual variables. Finally, a typical application is used to illustrate the relevance of this study. © 2019, © 2019 British Cartographic Society.;"augmented geovisualization; degree of abstraction; degree of interest; focus and context; level of detail; Semantic visual variables";"cartography; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85063146752;1

The question of how to style map legends is a topic which has often been addressed by cartographic academics and practitioners. Nevertheless, the question of where to position a map legend has only hardly been discussed. Principles of cognitive sciences allow the assumption that a legend positioned to the right of a map field can be read and decoded faster than a legend on the left side. This study investigates the impact of legend positioning on legend decoding. It involves an experiment based on a recognition memory paradigm and the registration of eye-movements. The results show that, in less time, a legend positioned to the right of the map field (compared to a left legend) can be decoded faster. The same accuracy of a cognitive representation of geographic space can be achieved in spatial memory. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.;"Cognitive cartography; empirical cartography; eye-tracking; legend; legend position; spatial cognition";"cartography; cognition; thematic mapping; tracking";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85057561191;1

However, such mapping suffers from low efficiency due to computational redundancy when similar symbols are used to visualize spatiotemporal point features. This paper presents a similarity-based approach to predict and avoid computational redundancy, which improves mapping efficiency. First, to identify computational redundancy, the similarity of point symbols is measured based on commonalities in symbol graphics and symbol drawing operations. Second, a similarity-enhanced method is proposed to comprehensively predict and avoid computational redundancies when mapping spatiotemporal point features.

As a part of that effort, a need of maritime survey of the Adriatic conducted by the joint forces of the Austro-Hungarian and Italian hydrographic offices appeared. The purpose of this endeavour was to enable the production of modern charts based on a comprehensive survey covering the whole sea surface area, from coast to coast. Under the supervision of Commander Tobias Ritter von Oesterreicher and Counter-Admiral Duke Antonio Imbert, the survey started in 1866 and, by the end of 1873, resulted in a general chart of the Adriatic, 4 course charts of the Adriatic Sea, 55 coastal charts as well as number of harbour plans. This paper presents an analysis of the course of the survey, its products as well as its impact on the subsequent cartography of the Adriatic Sea. © 2019 British Cartographic Society.;"Adriatic sea; Hydrographic Institute of the Italian Navy; Hydrographic Office of the Austro-Hungarian Navy; national identity; sovereignty at sea; territory";;Article;Article in Press;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85091801919;1

Stories, like maps, are a method for documenting and explaining, for meaningfully abstracting our experiences, for communicating and sharing, and for asserting a particular worldview. I argue that visual storytelling offers an entry point for hybridization in cartography, uniting technology with praxis, product with process, and design with critique while opening rich new avenues for transdisciplinary research and design. I begin by introducing influences on map-based visual storytelling and review ten recurring themes that make visual storytelling different from traditional perspectives on cartographic design. I then offer three of potentially many ways to articulate and organize the design space for map-based visual storytelling: foundational narrative elements and their adaptation to geographic phenomena and processes, visual storytelling genres delineating different story experiences, and visual storytelling tropes used to advance narratives across text, maps, images, and other multimedia. I conclude with a call for future research on visual storytelling in cartography, including visual design, visual ethics, and visual literacy. © 2020 British Cartographic Society.;"Cartographic design; data journalism; geohumanities; spatial narratives; story map; visual storytelling";;Article;Article in Press;Open Access;Scopus;2-s2.0-85088247041;1

The use of school books, atlases and web maps all play an essential role in the development of geographical knowledge of adolescents. This research examines the impact of the educational system versus web maps on the adolescents’ mental map. Through a specially designed web application, university students and secondary school pupils estimated the real proportion of countries and continents compared to Europe. Participants with a more theoretical background or wider knowledge about map projections and its distortions estimated the real proportions more accurately. This research also found that the Robinson projection, commonly used in schoolbooks and atlases, is the best-known map projection among adolescents. However, the influence of web maps could not be proven since no Mercator effect was found.

Based on information from a set of 466 1:50 000-scale Soviet military topographic maps of Denmark, this article examines the Soviet mapping practices related to the large-scale mapping of Denmark. Results show that the Soviet military compiled large-scale topographic maps of Denmark between the 1950s and the 1980s. The maps were initially based on Danish maps, but later the Soviets began to prefer remote-sensed data from satellite imagery. This allowed the Soviets to capture information about concealed military infrastructure.

The use of cartograms is intended to supplement traditional cartographic representations of the hazards in order to highlight the severity of an upcoming event. Cartogrammetric transformations are applied to forecasts of floods, heatwaves, windstorms and snowstorms taken from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) forecast archive. Key cartogram design principles in standard weather forecast visualization are tested. Optimal cartogram transformation is found to be dependent on geographical features (such as coastlines) and forecast features (such as snowstorm intensity). For highly spatially autocorrelated weather variables used in analysing several upcoming natural hazards such as 2m temperature anomaly, the visualization of the distortion provides a promising addition to standard forecast visualizations for highlighting upcoming weather-driven natural hazards. © 2018, © 2018 ECMWF Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;"Cartogram; data visualization; early warning; natural hazards; weather forecasts";"cartogram; early warning system; natural hazard; severe weather; visualization; weather forecasting";Article;Final;Open Access;Scopus;2-s2.0-85067629698;1

While the added dimension allows the display of attributes that vary with time, it is difficult to display rapidly varying temporal data given the limited display height. In this study, we adapt 2D cyclic point symbols to construct 3D surfaces designed along a helical path for the space–time cube. We demonstrate how these complex 3D helical surfaces can display detailed data, including data reported daily over 100 years and data reported in four-hour intervals over a year. To create the point symbols, each value is plotted along the curve of a helix, with each turn of the helix representing one year or week, respectively. The model is modified by varying the radii from the time axis to all points using the attribute value, in these cases maximum daily temperature and four-hourly ridership, and then creating a triangulated surface from the resulting points. Using techniques common to terrain representation, we apply hue and saturation to the surface based on attribute values, and lightness based on relief shading. Multiple surfaces can be displayed in a space–time cube with a consistent time interval facing the viewer, and the surfaces or viewer perspective can be rotated to display synchronized variations. We see this method as one example of how cartographic design can refine or enhance operations in the space–time cube. © 2019, © 2019 British Cartographic Society.;"cartography; climate; Map design; ridership; space–time cube; spatiotemporal; temperature; visualization";"cartography; design; image processing; spatiotemporal analysis; two-dimensional modeling; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85066622585;1

MacEachren and Liping Yang, Department of Geography and Institute for CyberScience, The Pennsylvania State University, University ParkPA, United States; Yang, L.";With the widespread use of tag clouds, multiple map-based variations have been proposed. Like standard tag clouds (also called word clouds), these ‘tag maps’ all share the basic strategy of displaying words within a ‘geographic space’ and scaling the word size to depict frequency (or importance) of those words within some dataset. While some tag maps simply plot a standard tag cloud on top of a map, the subset of tag maps we focus on here are those in which the collection of words are displayed within bounded geographic regions (often of irregular shape) that the words are relevant for. For this form of tag map, map scale and polygon shape add constraints to word size and position that have not been considered in most prior approaches to tag map word layout. In this paper, we present a layout strategy for tag map generation that includes consideration of the shape and size of the geographical regions acting as containers for the tags. The method introduced here uses a triangulated irregular network (TIN) to subdivide the geographical region into many triangle subareas, with the centroid of each triangle being a potential location to centre a tag on. All the triangles are sorted by their area and all the tags are sorted by their weight value (e.g. frequency, importance or popularity). Positioning of tags is undertaken sequentially from most important (or frequent or popular) with potential locations being the TIN triangle centroids (tried from largest to smallest triangle). After each tag placement, the TIN is recalculated to integrate the tag centroid and bounding corners into the TIN creation. The limited whitespace in the geographical region, at any specific scale, is used fully by dynamically adjusting the font size along with the number and the direction of tags. The method can be applied to add tags within geographic polygons that are convex, concave and other more complex regions containing holes or islands. © 2019, © British Cartographic Society 2019.;"cartography; map visualization; Tag cloud; text layout; triangulated irregular network";"cartography; data set; mapping method; tagging; triangulated irregular network; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85063674551;1

Different forms of visual representation may require the employment of different cognitive strategies in order to solve a particular task; at the same time, the different representations vary as to the extent to which they correspond with an individual’s preferred cognitive style. The present study employed a Navon-type task to learn about the occurrence of global/local bias. The research was based on close interdisciplinary cooperation between the domains of both psychology and cartography. Several different types of tasks were made involving avalanche hazard maps with intrinsic/extrinsic visual representations, each of them employing different types of graphic variables representing the level of avalanche hazard and avalanche hazard uncertainty. The research sample consisted of two groups of participants, each of which was provided with a different form of visual representation of identical geographical data, such that the representations could be regarded as ‘informationally equivalent’. The first phase of the research consisted of two correlation studies, the first involving subjects with a high degree of map literacy (students of cartography) (intrinsic method: N = 35; extrinsic method: N = 37). The second study was performed after the results of the first study were analyzed. The second group of participants consisted of subjects with a low expected degree of map literacy (students of psychology; intrinsic method: N = 35; extrinsic method: N = 27).The first study revealed a statistically significant moderate correlation between the students’ response times in extrinsic visualization tasks and their response times in a global subtest (r = 0.384, p < 0.05); likewise, a statistically significant moderate correlation was found between the students’ response times in intrinsic visualization tasks and their response times in the local subtest (r = 0.387, p < 0.05). At the same time, no correlation was found between the students’ performance in the local subtest and their performance in extrinsic visualization tasks, or between their scores in the global subtest and their performance in intrinsic visualization tasks. The second correlation study did not confirm the results of the first correlation study (intrinsic visualization/‘small figures test’: r = 0.221; extrinsic visualization/‘large figures test’: r = 0.135). The first phase of the research, where the data was subjected to statistical analysis, was followed by a comparative eye-tracking study, whose aim was to provide more detailed insight into the cognitive strategies employed when solving map-related tasks. More specifically, the eye-tracking study was expected to be able to detect possible differences between the cognitive patterns employed when solving extrinsic- as opposed to intrinsic visualization tasks. The results of an exploratory eye-tracking data analysis support the hypothesis of different strategies of visual information processing being used in reaction to different types of visualization. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.";"avalanche risk; cognitive style; combined extensive–intensive research design; eye-tracking; Geovisualization method; Navon’s hierarchical figure";"avalanche; cartography; cognition; data processing; map; psychology; research method; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85058688474;1

Such symbols are of particular use in the design of animated maps and computer games. The authors examine three existing techniques of using dynamic point symbols to present quantitative data: blinking, pulsation, and rotation. The aim of the study is to compare their effectiveness with that of classical cartographic animation techniques. The results of the study show that in animated map design, dynamic point symbols might be used to present not only qualitative but also quantitative data with comparable effectiveness. The results may serve as the basis for designing dynamic point symbols to be as effective as the classical techniques used in animated cartography. © 2018, © British Cartographic Society 2018.;"animated cartography; cartographic animation; dynamic point symbols; map design; spatio-temporal data";"cartography; mapping; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; spatiotemporal analysis";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85058236403;1

These hitherto relatively unknown documents present evidence of an evolution of cartographic style towards greater topographic accuracy and hence cannot just be considered as simple drawings. In this seventeenth-century period of transition, the cartography of the city evolved from sixteenth-century aerial-view perspectives to the exhaustive planimetric maps of the eighteenth century, made by Spanish and French Military Corps of Engineers.

However, effective map symbology for humanitarian relief purposes entails several challenges, including consideration of the following: (1) taxonomy development, (2) symbol design issues, (3) promulgation and sharing of map symbols, and (4) standardization of symbols within and among organizations. This paper discusses these key challenges to the design and use of crisis map symbology through a review of the cartographic literature as well as results collected from a survey targeted at humanitarian organizations from around the world. The survey was designed to gather information on current symbology design and use practices in order to understand common challenges. Survey results confirm agreement in the persistence of these four primary symbology challenges, especially the importance of intuitive symbol design. Respondents disagreed most about the adequacy of current crisis map symbology standards as well as the ease in which standards may be implemented within and across organizations. Survey results suggest the need for expert systems designed specifically for symbology design to support humanitarian relief activities. © 2018 British Cartographic Society.;"Crisis mapping; Hazards; Humanitarian relief; Map design; Standards; Symbology";"cartography; design; hazard assessment; map; mapping; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85057306488;1

The authors focused on six public web mapping services, analysing them in terms of the graphical diversity of their buttons. What made the study innovative was the comparison of subjective user preferences regarding buttons placement with the layout of public web mapping services. The obtained results led to a conclusion that user preferences differ from the solutions applied on web mapping services. Adjusting the placement of buttons to fit those preferences would be a way of addressing the practical needs of people who use mobile maps application. © 2020, © 2020 British Cartographic Society.;"buttons; Graphical design; GUI; mobile map application; web mapping service";;Article;Article in Press;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85081372422;1

One of these works’ key features is the use of embroidery techniques learned from women of her village. She considers the Sardinian territory not only an object of representation but as an expressive medium of her work and a fertile space that generates new worlds. I argue that we can draw on Maria Lai’s work to conceive a particular form of deep mapping through which to explore the territory through its imaginative dimension. For the purpose of this article, I intend to describe how, inspired by Lai’s works, I built Emplaced Distance, a map of Cape Town through the Sardinian territory. © 2020, © 2020 British Cartographic Society.;"Cape Town; Deep mapping; emplacement; ethnography; Maria Lai; Sardinia";;Article;Article in Press;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85078416990;1

This problem is even more pronounced regarding large-scale mapping. Due to this motivation, we describe the method and related results that we have developed to propose a set of symbols for topographic mapping at large scales for the municipalities of Paraná, Brazil. We developed the study by considering cartographic principles and aligning them with the definitions of Brazilian systematic mapping. The first step in the research was making decisions about which elements should be part of the 1:2000 scale. We have also defined the meaning of each element, which were the basis for establishing classes and subclasses. Next, a symbology was designed. These results are essential for proposing a scientific framework for topographic mapping that benefits a large group of producers and users of urban maps in Brazil. © 2019, © 2019 British Cartographic Society.;"map symbology; Topographic mapping; topographic mapping standardization";"cartography; decision making; standardization; topographic mapping; urban area; Brazil; Parana [Brazil]";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85062412894;1

VR creates artificial worlds of sensory experience or immerses the user in representations of real spatial environments that might otherwise be inaccessible by virtue of distance, scale, time or physical incompatibilities of the user and the environment. The idea of VR is not new the first instances of VR were created in 1960s. But despite this, the issue of using VR technology in the aspect of existing topographic databases has not yet been researched by cartographers. The experiment was carried out on the Polish topographic database (BDOT 10k) in scale 1:10 000 to identify challenges in converting built-up areas into 3D VR geovisualization.

In this paper, an automatic method to derive monochrome Swiss-style rock hachures from a raster elevation model is presented. The proper placement and light modulation of the linear strokes depend on the availability of sound foundations for both terrain generalization and relief shading, for which two novel methods are introduced. The generalization applies line integral convolution along slope lines to the elevation values. The resulting smoothed raster has the footprint of its steep faces enlarged to increase the map space available for steep faces. The shaded relief is generated with the focus on terrain edges, unlike common raster cell-based methods. The rock hachures are modulated according to the grey values of the shaded relief. Finally, we present two topographic maps that demonstrate this new method of depicting relief. © 2019, © 2019 British Cartographic Society.;"analytical shading; cartographic rock drawing; Relief representation; Swiss cartography; terrain generalization; topographic maps";"automation; cartography; digital elevation model; raster; relief; shading; terrain; topographic mapping; Switzerland";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85062401277;1

Already weakened by centuries of wars, the Ottoman Empire, in its late phase of territorial regression, had to find a way to compensate the absence of its own mapping activities. That especially came to the fore when the interest of the Ottoman administration in the mapping of the European part of its empire was stimulated by the requirements of its military operations during the Russo-Turkish Wars, as well as by the consequent geopolitical changes that occurred with the independence of certain parts of the empire (Greece, Wallachia and Moldavia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria). The solution was found in translating European, mostly Austrian and Russian, topographic maps into the Ottoman Turkish language. This practice resulted in the production of topographic maps that met the military needs of the Ottoman army, but also in a gradual transfer of the Western science and cartographic practice to the Ottoman culture. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.;"military cartography; nineteenth century; Ottoman Empire; the Balkans; topographic mapping";"historical cartography; nineteenth century; Ottoman empire; topographic mapping; Balkans";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85062392402;1

Topographic mapping historically has been approached as a map factory operation through the period 1879–1990. During this time, data were field and photogrammetrically collected; cartographically verified and annotated creating a compilation manuscript; further edited, generalized, symbolized, and produced as a graphic output product using lithography, or more recently, through digital means. Adoption of geographic information systems (GIS) as the primary production process for topographic maps, including digital database preparation (1975–2000) and product generation operations (2001–present), has led to faster and more standardized production in a semi-automated process. However, the topographic product has remained the same static graphic. A new form of topographic map as an interactive, linked knowledge base is now being created. The appearance of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data allows the map to become an interactive knowledge base. In this current theory and implementation of topographic mapping, the map is a graphics-based interface to a triplestore knowledge base which includes a topographic feature ontology, semantics and relations, and instance data with geometry and topology available. The topographic map graphic becomes an interactive link to the knowledge base and additional linked data through the Linked Open Data cloud. ©, This work was authored as part of the Contributor's official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

The algorithm provides scope for implementation-specific interpretations, with different outcomes. This is inevitable and sometimes necessary and, it does not imply that an implementation is flawed. The only restriction is that the output must not be so inconsistent with the intent of the algorithm that it becomes inappropriate. The aim of this paper is to place the algorithm within the literature, and demonstrate the value of the teragon-test for evaluating the appropriateness of implementations; Mapshaper v 0.2.28 and earlier versions are used for illustrative purposes. Data pertaining to natural features, such as coastlines, are insufficient for establishing whether deviations in output are significant. The teragon-test revealed an unexpected loss of symmetry from both the Visvalingam and Douglas-Peucker options, making the tested versions unsuitable for some applications, especially outside of cartography. This paper describes the causes, and discusses their implications. Mapshaper 0.3.17 passes the teragon test. Other developers and users should check their implementations using contrived geometric data, such as the teragon data used in this paper, especially when the source code is not available for inspection.

We approached the problem of the double longitudes using linear regression, through which we wanted to examine the relation of Glavač’s longitudes to modern values. An essential part of the research was a comparison of Glavač’s map with maps by his predecessors and contemporaries which show approximately the same prime meridians. The maps analysed, with their written values for the longitudes of certain places, indicated that the selection of prime meridians at that time was not entirely reliable. A further problem seemed to be the knowledge of the position of islands chosen as points of departure for longitudes. We concluded that the points of departure for Glavač’s dual longitudes were Palma, one of the Canary Islands, and the islands of Corvo and Flores in the Azores. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.;"Azores Islands; Canary Islands; Cape Verde Islands; Glavač; linear regression; prime meridians";"cartography; map; regression analysis; Azores; Canary Islands; Portugal; Spain";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85055245501;1

Cartographic communication often suffers from undesirable colour inconsistency. This method models cartographic colour reproduction as a constrained transform problem, namely, adapting a map’s gamut to fit a device’s gamut while preserving the semiotic quality. First, the characteristics of the map’s gamut are investigated by considering cartographic principles, and the fundamental concerns of preserving semiotic quality are proposed. Then, the self-organizing map method is introduced to iteratively optimize the cartographic colour reproduction. We implement this method and evaluate it based on a series of thematic maps. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm offers better results than two alternatives in terms of facilitating cartographic colour reproduction. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.;"cartographic principles; colour reproduction; Map colour; self-organizing map";"algorithm; cartography; color; map graphics; optimization; thematic mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85048809838;1

Deploying a mobile, digital map-based platform addresses significant challenges–such as the sacrifice of context specificity and methodological applicability and depth. It also runs the danger of ‘gamifying’ the fieldwork, blinding the participant to their own agency and emergent encounters. Interactive and layered digital map interfaces have affordances that can potentially overcome such challenges. We claim that one such affordance is the ability to play through the map. In other words, maps–and digital maps in particular–offer the possibility of decoupling results-orientated actions from free-form serendipitous engagement with the field. Our argument is two-fold. First, that LBG toolsets such as Wherigo can provide a ‘common ground’ for students engaging in place-based interdisciplinary research, by providing a material, cartographic basis for playful investigation. Second, that they can facilitate the production of ‘spaces of epistemological failure’, allowing students to challenge taken-for-granted conceptual and methodological axioms within and across disciplines. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.;"field education; Location-based games (LBGs); mobile mapping; place-based knowledge; playful methodologies";"cartography; conceptual framework; digital map; education; fieldwork; interdisciplinary approach; learning; mapping; research work; student";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85036585603;1

Map projection patents are rare, many patentees did not attempt to develop their patents, and none who did seems to have made much money. An explanation for their decision to patent lies in recognition that the patent system and peer-reviewed scientific journals are parallel literatures, either of which can satisfy an innovator’s need for attention, as suggested by achievement motivation theory. Moreover, no single factor can account for the invention of a map projection that was patented: not mathematical expertise; not work experience as a draftsman, map publisher, or professional geographer; and not prior experience with the patents system. But for all but one of the 17 inventors for whom microdata research tools yielded basic details about their lives, at least one of these factors was present. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.";"achievement motivation theory; History of cartography; invention; John Parr Snyder; map projection; patents";"cartography; historical perspective; innovation; map generalization; property rights; theoretical study";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85049808030;1

The 1:50 000 survey of the areas occupied temporarily by Hungarian soldiers in the Soviet Union in 1941–1942 was an interesting event. The transformation of Hungary into a Soviet-type system was practically completed by 1950. Being part of the Warsaw Pact, the socialist countries systematically produced maps of the areas of NATO countries: 1:100 000 and 1:200 000 maps (and even smaller scale sheets of larger areas) were made. The topographic maps were completed with many city plans at larger scales. This type of city maps became a special product of Hungary: the Hungarians prepared maps of numerous cities lying outside the mapped area. The Hungarian army was thrown into open combat only once in the Cold War era when it took part in the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.

Many existing studies note that he was an Anglophile who served the short-lived British colonial government (1877–1881), a bureaucrat who operated within the settler republics that preceded and followed it, and a figure whose work extended beyond the realm of cartography narrowly. Very few, however, have considered his role as a passive and, at times, active agent who channelled information to the British government at least until his own death in June 1898. Based on extensive archival research, this essay highlights Jeppe's British connections to draw out a different, more partisan thread in the life and work of this meticulous mapmaker, one that had a direct effect on military intelligence just before the conflagration of the South African War in 1899. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.;"Boer War; cartography; compilation; Jeppe; nineteenth century; South Africa; Transvaal";"biography; colonialism; historical cartography; knowledge; nineteenth century; South Africa; Transvaal";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85049799566;1

Amongst them were the three Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Only a few years after finally gaining independence in 1918, five substantial statistical atlases had been issued in Riga, Tallinn and Kaunas. They offered for the first time a visual portrait of the new countries and their political, social and economic situations in an equally attractive and completely fact-based manner.

In other words, climate change communication seems to be largely failing so far. Among other communication tools, maps are widely used for explanatory purposes by scientists and the media. Here two questions arise: first, whether high map complexity may be too intricate to be understood and discourage people from deciphering the map; and second, whether personal interest in climate change can be influenced by the phenomenon depicted or the map’s scale. In a survey conducted among 109 students in the USA, 63% of respondents preferred a simple map, but a substantial subset, 37%, asked for complexity to receive more information. Regional phenomena evoked more concern than far-off phenomena (concern level index difference of 0.93 on a 5-ranked Likert scale). The advantage of maps showing local areas could not be statistically confirmed. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.";"climate change maps; complexity; concern; Empirical cartography; preference; scale";"climate change; communication; complexity; empirical analysis; map; preference behavior; survey method; United States";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85033713651;1

In the course of this development, besides studies into its potential for thematic-cartographic representations, the synoptic depiction of physical surfaces (‘geo[graphical] surfaces’) has been playing a significant role. In this context the innovative holistic display of complex morphological and topographical conditions is of particular interest. The simultaneous representation of various cartographic parameters at different depths will deliver an enormous surplus of information transfer in the field of thematic cartography as well as in physical/topographic cartography. This paper describes the methodological development and generation of an autostereoscopic hardcopy display of Antarctic topography. The purpose was the simultaneous depiction of the two superimposed surfaces of both the ice-sheet and the rock-bed and, in addition, of the surrounding seafloor, thus displaying a vertical drop of more than 12,000 m. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.;"autostereoscopic; hardcopy; lenticular foil technique; simultaneous viewing of overlaying surfaces; super-imposed geo-surfaces; True-3d";"bedrock; cartography; ice sheet; image processing; innovation; seafloor; topographic mapping; Antarctica; Southern Ocean";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85023190600;1

In the past, a number of studies have tried to assess the geometric accuracy of this map, but they all suffer from restricted technical capabilities for computing and visualizing the distortions, and most of them only focus on a limited number of the 275 map sheets. This paper therefore seeks to provide the first systematic and in-depth investigation of the map’s local geometric accuracy. Recently, two Belgian government agencies georeferenced the Flemish and Walloon part of the Carte de cabinet with a high level of detail, using some 30,000 ground control points to link the old map to the modern topographic map of Belgium. These data sets represent a new and unprecedented potential source of accuracy information. However, the high number of control points and our desire to compute distortions in an exact, local, quantitative and continuous way meant prominent techniques for studying the geometric accuracy of old maps, such as displacement vectors, distortion grids, triangular nets and the popular MapAnalyst software, were unsuited for this task. To meet all our requirements a new technique called Differential Distortion Analysis, which is influenced by the treatment of distortions in map projection theory, was used instead. Its advantages, structure and application to the Carte de cabinet are discussed in detail. The new technique allows calculating and displaying the map’s local angular and surface distortions with a very high spatial resolution. Consequently, it was possible to identify trends in the obtained levels of accuracy and to relate these to historical facts about the Carte de cabinet’s production process. This has resulted in important new insights into the map’s geometric accuracy. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.;"area scale factor; Carte de cabinet (1777); count de Ferraris; Differential Distortion Analysis; geometric accuracy; History of cartography; maximum angular distortion; thin plate spline";"eighteenth century; geometry; historical perspective; map; photograph; statistical analysis; Belgium";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85021785120;1

The main purposes of this hierarchy are to ease navigation of street maps and to provide more understandability and legibility of street features for map users. The hierarchy uses centrality measures along with functional classes of the streets to order features according to their spatial importance in each used zoom level. The calculation of a proper radius, to be employed in the calculations of centrality measures, is based on extracting proper field of view in the map user’s focus status. The used measures are integrated using fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process, yielding proper coefficients to create the hierarchy. The hierarchy is applied for the thinning process and later for using the styled layer descriptor to label street features. Quality constrains are implemented to make the street labels more understandable and readable. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.;"functional class; Generalization; labelling; multi-resolution; street network";"cartography; field of view; navigation; resolution; spatial data";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85019684168;1

Regional maps would be obtained, which, referenced through a system of meridians and parallel arcs, would comprise a complete map of the continent. The mechanism devised for this purpose was that of surveys, known as the Relaciones Geográficas (Geographic Relations). Each town would be sent a questionnaire with more than 50 questions that should also be completed with a map of the region. The majority of these maps, known as pinturas, lacked field measurements, and therefore also lacked both scale and geographical coordinates. Only a few cases were created following the standards of European cartography. Among these are the maps made by Francisco Gali. In this paper, we study the map of Tlacotalpa, one of the first examples of local nautical charting in Latin America. © 2018, © 2018 British Cartographic Society.;"Early coastal chart; Francisco Gali; map comparison; Mexico; Relaciones Geográficas; sixteenth century; Spanish America; Tlacotalpa";;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85019170917;1

Telling stories is, however, important to make information more personal and to arrest the map user's attention. This paper contrasts the map and the text media in order to understand why texts are good at telling a story but conventional maps are not. We demonstrate that, by a modification of maps, appropriate structural features of the text media can be transferred to maps, which makes them more suitable for telling stories.

Distributing the generalization process is the only way to make them scalable and usable in practice. But map generalization is a highly contextual process, and the surroundings of a generalized map feature needs to be known to generalize the feature, which is a problem as distribution might partition the dataset and parallelize the processing of each part. This paper proposes experiments to evaluate the past propositions to distribute map generalization, and to identify the main remaining issues. The past propositions to distribute map generalization are first discussed, and then the experiment hypotheses and apparatus are described. The experiments confirmed that regular partitioning was the quickest strategy, but less effective when taking context into account. The geographical partitioning, though less effective for now, is quite promising regarding the quality of the results as it better integrates the geographical context. © 2018, © The British Cartographic Society 2018.;"generalization; parallelization; partitioning";"automation; cartography; data processing; data set; map generalization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85042235332;1

As a consequence, the design of maps and atlases is developing in new ways. The hypothesis of this study could be formulated as follows: the use of digital and interactive elements in a thematic atlas improves and enhances the usability of the cartographic products for the visualization of architectural heritage (in this case of Tegucigalpa and Comayagüela), due to which it provides new ways and possibilities for interaction. The study, therefore, focuses on usability to evaluate thematic atlases in the design process, and examine the differences that potential users present to digital-interactive atlases and static-printed atlases; the first embodied in desktop computers, the second printed on paper. The three measures of usability: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction, were evaluated in the two atlases presented, by means of five tasks applied to 50 participants, each task with a purpose of special use within the scope of the atlas and architectural heritage. We also measured perceptions and emotions. Our findings suggest that printed and digital atlases complement each other because of their different kinds of uses and expectations. Usability metrics differ slightly; those related to success and time are higher in the digital atlas, whereas those related to satisfaction and perception are higher in the printed atlas. © 2018, © The British Cartographic Society 2018.";"atlas; digital; interactivity; printed; UCD; usability";"atlas; cartography; design; perception; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85042234660;1

The publication of atlases for schools is dated to 1800, when professor Ézsáiás Budai created his ‘New School Atlas for elementary pupils’. For almost 90 years the school atlases were mostly translations and adaptations of foreign (e.g. German) atlases. In 1890, a talented cartographer, Manó Kogutowicz founded the Hungarian Geographical Institute, which produced school atlases for the different types of schools in Hungary. The professional quality of these school atlases was recognized by prizes won in international exhibitions. Kogutowicz laid the foundations of the current Hungarian school cartography: three of his school atlases are presented in more detail in the second part of this article, to give examples of how the pupils were introduced to the basic cartographic concepts as well as how different innovative solutions were used on the maps. © 2017, © The British Cartographic Society 2017.;"Hungarian Geographical Institute; Manó Kogutowicz; school atlas; School cartography";"atlas; cartography; conceptual framework; institutional framework; student; Hungary";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85042218534;1

A design pattern presents a solution to a problem by describing solutions for the commonalities in problems to be solved. The commonalities of the cartographic design process are identified and MapDesign is described, a design pattern for generating a set of maps from big geospatial data. The MapDesign pattern allows increased map throughput through automation and distributed processing, which frees up time for cartographers and geographic information scientists to make sense of big geospatial data and to select and refine map designs.

This article explores expressed emotions related to power places, which are defined as places at which people can recharge and relax. At these places they can find their balance and inner power. Our research is based on empirical experiments in Germany and the USA in which the participants self-identified and mapped their power places. They described them and selected expressions for emotions that best describe how they feel at these places. The main goal of this paper is to compare the results gained on two different continents. Using Russell's Circumplex Model of Affect, we explore the cultural differences by mapping emotions in a two-dimensional circular place. We conclude the article with a discussion of the results and further research directions. © 2018, © The British Cartographic Society 2018.;"Circumplex Model of Affect; emotions; mapping places and emotions; power places";"cartography; empirical analysis; psychology; research work; Germany; United States";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85042214549;1

This understanding of geographic space often arises from experience with cartographic media representing topographic and topological information by graphic symbols. Learning spatial information from graphic media is influenced by different perception-based grouping effects distorting the accuracy of spatial object-positions and their relations. Such geometric inaccuracies can be softened by adding a grid layer, which regionalizes the map and can be used as an additional orientation pattern. This grid layer usually consists of solid lines and overlays semantic information. The present paper reports the results of two empirical studies on object-location memory (OLM) performance. In these studies, the amount of visual detail of the grid layer was reduced. By positioning the grid layer below specific urban topographic objects (study 1), the grid pattern was graphically interrupted. These interrupted grid lines were completed by cognitive completion mechanisms (illusory grid lines) described in the Gestalt principles of closure and continuation. The second experiment examined the maximum grid line gap that is closed by cognitive line completion and keeps an advantage for OLM (study 2). © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"cartography; cognitive cartography; cognitive line completion; empirical cartography; Gestalt principle of closure; Gestalt principle of continuation; grid lines; grids; object-location memory; recall; spatial cognition; spatial memory; topographic maps";"cartography; empirical analysis; topographic mapping; urban area";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84992154083;1

The main characteristics of the proposed method involve RGB-D cameras to collect colour and depth data and the evaluation of the visual variables colour hue and texture combined with visual aspects such as lighting and camera configuration for the symbolization of 3D indoor environments. High quality coloured point clouds of indoor environments are obtained with the Kinect sensor and then registered and processed in order to create 3D models. These sets of point clouds can be detected, recognized and classified under one of the three following main categories: ceiling, wall or floor. After classification is done, the resulting point clouds are properly treated as 3D triangular meshes in the MeshLab software. These meshes are then filtered to form complete surfaces which are then refined before being considered for visual variable application. We evaluated the proposed method on several indoor environments to show that it efficiently combines the colour and depth data obtained from RGB-D cameras with different parameters defined for the visual variables colour hue and texture for 3D symbolization of indoor environments. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"3D symbology; indoor environments; RGB-D data";"color; image classification; sensor; software; texture; three-dimensional modeling";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84991264112;1

A user study was conducted in which participants–with an expertise in cartography–had to execute four tasks in Google Maps, using only a panning operation. During the first two tasks, participants had to follow a predefined route; during the latter two tasks they had to locate Belgium on a less detailed scale level. A strong task-related interactive behaviour was revealed by the participants’ mouse action and eye movements. Furthermore, the attentive behaviour was influenced by the type of view (map or satellite) and whether it occurs while performing the panning operation. The georeferenced eye movements were imported in a GIS for spatial analysis. Based on these spatial queries, we discovered that the duration of the fixations was associated by their location on the map. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.";"attentive behaviour; eye tracking; geographic information systems; interactive cartography";"cartography; GIS; mixing; spatial analysis; triangulation; Belgium";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84981212345;1

This study investigates the use of supervised learning approaches for selective omission in a road network. To be specific, at first, the properties to measure the importance of a road in the network are viewed as input attributes, and the decision of such a road is retained or not at a specific scale is viewed as an output class; then, a number of samples with known input and output are used to train a classifier; finally, this classifier can be used to determine whether other roads to be retained or not. In this study, a total of nine supervised learning approaches, i.e., ID3, C4·5, CRT, Random Tree, support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), multilayer perception (MP) and binary logistic regression (BLR), are applied to three road networks for selective omission. The performances of these approaches are evaluated by both quantitative assessment and visual inception. Results show that: (1) in most cases, these approaches are effective and their classification accuracy is between 70% and 90%; (2) most of these approaches have similar performances, and they do not have any statistically significant difference; (3) but sometimes, ID3 and BLR performs significantly better than NB and SVM; NB and KNN perform significantly worse than MP, SVM and BLR. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.";"road network; selective omission; supervised learning";"accuracy assessment; cartography; comparative study; learning; logistics; map generalization; nearest neighbor analysis; performance assessment; regression analysis; road; support vector machine";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978532284;1

The existing population spatialization models have solved many problems for population distribution, but most of these studies have focused on a specific, single-scale approach and ignored the scale transformation for population spatialization. However, multi-scale visualization and the analysis of spatial information need multi-scale information. Meanwhile, the population distribution map as one kind of thematic map is always overlaid with the digital vector map or remote sensing map and visualized in the Web Geographic Information Systems (Web GIS), so it should adapt to the map scale showed in browser, when the user zoom in and zoom out. Hence adaptive multi-scale is necessary for population spatialization. Therefore, in this study, an adaptive multi-scale population spatialization model (APSM) is proposed with comprehensive factors constrained. These factors are residential area, land cover, public transport, hydrology, terrain, and climate. All of them are closely associated with population distribution. The overall methodology of APSM and the process for APSM are expounded in this paper. Meanwhile, with a case study of Russia, the processes of APSM for Russia are stated, and a population spatialization tool is implemented for expanding the application of APSM. The experimental analysis showed that APSM satisfied the requirement of geospatial analysis well and obtained a reliable accuracy. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"adaptive; multi-scale; multiple factors; population spatialization model";"accuracy assessment; digital map; GIS; population distribution; public transport; software; spatial analysis; thematic mapping; Russian Federation";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978505015;1

The curator discusses the criteria he applied when selecting work for the show. He wanted maps with politics, although not the region’s traditional sectarian politics. All the selected maps constitute arguments, critiquing problems in the lived environment or drawing attention to valuable things that may be at risk.

Original maps represent the territories within regional boundaries in approximate scale 1: 100 000. It is relatively problematic to extract spatial information from the maps based on precise geodetic control and well-known cartographic projection. A different approach must be chosen in case of old maps without geodetic control and identifiable cartographic projection. In such a case the identical points whose coordinates in the reference coordinate system are known must be identified in the old map and their cartometric coordinates measured. This is also the case of manuscript Müller’s maps. For creation of a transformation key the suitable input data must be selected. As the most frequented features on these maps are settlements it was decided to use this part of planimetric component. Several ways how to use the settlements for transformation were explored in order to find out the most appropriate way of localization of these rare old maps. For purpose of old maps localization the database of settlements (DBS) was used. This database is based on the Territorial Identification Register of Basic Settlement Units (TIR-BSU) which has been created in 1992–2004 and contains current coordinates of settlements. Furthermore, after transformation, the analysis of the visualization accuracy of watercourses was done. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"affine transformation; database of settlements; Jung non-residual transformation; old maps; TPS transformation";"cartography; coordinate; database; map; settlement pattern; territory; visualization; Bohemia; Czech Republic";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84995602490;1

The results of an internet survey conducted using a tablet at four locations in Poznan (Poland) allowed us to determine the following: threshold differentiation values for the analysed variables, indication of the dependence on the type of background displayed on the mobile device in augmented reality, and the advantage of using a combination of visual variables. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"augmented reality; differentiation threshold; mobile devices; point symbols; public users; visual variables";"cartography; landscape; pedestrian; urban area; Poland [Central Europe]; Poznan [Wielkopolskie]; Wielkopolskie";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84994835016;1

Along with depth contours and coloured depth areas, soundings are used for this task. All the soundings on a navigational chart are selected for a reason. Soundings contribute to the navigational chart safety aspect by alerting to all the threats and dangers. They also show all the attributes of a seabed relief without overcrowding it, thus maintaining the overall chart quality. Soundings are selected from a hydrographic survey and since it consists of a vast number of data, the process of sounding selection is a challenging and demanding task. It requires experience and knowledge from the nautical cartographer and is mostly done manually. Some types of software nowadays provide an automatic selection feature. This paper analyses a process of automatic sounding selection in the dKart Editor software. On the Croatian side of the Adriatic Sea, Šibenski Kanal (Šibenik channel) and Kanal Sv. Ante (St. Ante’s channel) are used as the study area. A hydrographic survey of the area represents the input data. The official navigational chart of the surveyed area is used as the basis for determining three different sets of parameters for the selection process. After the selection, obtained results are assessed based on geometrical accuracy and on the conservation level of navigational safety. For geometrical accuracy, the best results were produced by the third set that was divided in two subsets for each channel. It was determined that the nature of the seabed relief had an impact on the selection process. The same set had the best result for navigational safety assessment but it was concluded that all the sets undermined the aspect. Because of these crucial shortcomings noticed in all the tested sets of parameters, the feature is considered inadequate for serious usage as a completely automatic tool for the process of sounding selection on navigational charts. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"automatic sounding selection; nautical cartography; navigation charts; quality assessment";"accuracy assessment; assessment method; cartography; data quality; hydrography; navigation; seafloor; software; Adriatic Sea; Croatia; Mediterranean Sea";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978670368;1

Yet in spite of the emergence and success of PPGIS, open source geospatial tools, and the geoweb, access barriers recognized by proponents of PPGIS in the mid-1990s persist. As a result, PPGIS facilitators continue to be instrumental in addressing access barriers to geospatial technologies among resource poor organizations and marginalized groups. ‘Community geography’, is a growing area of academic geography that leverages university community partnerships to facilitate access to spatial technology, data, and analysis.

In this article I unpick the gnarly question of how the remote sourcing of information through cloud collaboration and satellite imagery jostles with grounded work encouraging local control of local geoinformation. My critical analysis of these projects explores: (1) justifications for action–what is being promised through digital mapping as aid or satellite salvation?; (2) forms of participation–the role of ‘hotties’ ‘nodders’ and ‘digital jedis’; and (3) contingencies of mapping practices and the assemblages of actors within which they are embedded–as the mysteries of the ‘missing maps’.

Geographic areas are often are represented by concave polygons which pose severe limitations on straightforward solutions due to their great variety of shape, a fact worsened by the lack of measures for quantifying feature-label relationships. We introduce a novel and efficient algorithm for labelling area features externally, i.e. outside their polygonal boundary. Two main contributions are presented in the following. First, it is a highly optimized algorithm of generating candidate placements utilizing algorithms from the field of computational geometry. Second, we describe a measure for scoring label positions. Both solutions based on a series of well-established cartographic precepts about name positioning in the case of semantic enclaves such as islands or lakes. The results of our experiments show that our algorithm can efficiently place labels with a quality that is close to the quality of traditional cartographic products made by human cartographers. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"Area lettering; Automated cartography; Automated label placement; Computational geometry; GIS mapping";"algorithm; cartography; geometry; GIS; mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978540803;1

Intelligent areal interpolation is used to construct two types of population density surfaces that are used as inputs for pycnophylactic interpolation of an isopleth surface. One is a target zone population density surface (TZPDS) and the other is a control zone population density surface (CZPDS). Results suggest that an inferred isopleth map with remote sensing control data is a better surface depiction than an isopleth map without any control data, and the quality of such an isopleth map is further improved by enhancing the remote sensing data with residential parcel information. A CZPDS-derived intelligent isopleth map also has more peaks and variations in population distribution patterns than does a TZPDS-derived one due to the larger scale of the control data. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"areal interpolation; choropleth map; dasymetric map; isopleth map; remote sensing";"areal interpolation; cartography; map; population density; population distribution; remote sensing";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978532562;1

In a between-subject design study, participants completed a set of map-reading tasks generated by approaches to a traffic problem. These entailed quick and correct decoding of graphically represented quantitative and qualitative spatial information. The tasks first involved the decoding of one graphic variable, then of two variables simultaneously. While alternative representations of qualitative information included colour hue and symbol shape, the quantitative information was communicated either through symbol size or colour value. In bivariate tasks, quantitative and qualitative graphical elements were combined in a single display. Individual differences were also examined. The concept of cognitive style partially explains the variability in people’s perception and thinking, describing individual preferences in object representation and problem-solving strategies. The data obtained in the experiment suggest that alternative forms of visualization may have different impacts on performance in map-reading tasks: colour hue and size proved more efficient in communicating information than shape and colour value. Apart from this, it was shown that individual facets of cognitive style may affect task performance, depending on the type of visualization employed. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"cartographic design; cognitive style; transport; usability";"cartography; cognition; design";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978516388;1

A main challenge is to enable a user to combine these services, not only from a technical perspective, but also from a cartographic one. One common use case for these services is to create mashups based on thematic polygons on top of background maps. In this study we compare four cartographic designs of thematic polygons: only boundaries, transparencies, hatches and icons. The aim of the comparison is to investigate whether the designs are good for identifying the extent of the polygons and if the design disturbs the reading of the background map. The comparison is based on an eye-tracking study, where 24 participants performed polygon identification tasks as well as background search tasks. The study revealed that hatches were more efficient than the other designs for polygon identification. Hatches had significantly shorter total fixation times as well as scanpath lengths, possibly since the participants were able to identify the extent of the polygon solely based on the interior (i.e. the hatches), while for the other designs the participants were extensively reliant on the boundaries. However, the results also indicate that the hatches design disturbs the reading of the background map more than the other designs; hatches also appear visually unpleasant for many users.

Project development roles of reliance held by the community, and managed by university agents, has shifted from cooperative to, in some cases, complete independence. The modern model of citizen participation includes a resident-planner toolkit with greater access to neighbourhood data and low- to high-tech analytical tools. Many community-led quality of life studies have a limited scope and focus on policy issues that do not serve a larger constituency. Many neighbourhood plans exclude self-reported neighbourhood knowledge and, due to the frequency of municipal reporting cycles, leaves gaps and data mismatch. Given this, the traditional public participation GIS (PPGIS) model may be less data driven due to a more mission-driven resident-led PGIS solution. Planners in practice and in academia have raised levels of concern about data standards, interoperability, reliability, error and metadata. How and why Citizen Science influenced the progression of PPGIS, participation GIS, crowdsourcing and now community-managed data in both theory and practice are provided. This paper will reflect on how top-down strategies to include neighbourhood knowledge are being reframed by the United States Federal Community of Practice. The future of data integration focuses on both the process and products of data development from both the bottom-up and top-down perspectives. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"citizen participation; citizen science; crowdsourcing; neighbourhood planning; public geographic information systems";"bottom-up approach; database; future prospect; GIS; local participation; top-down approach";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84994176756;1

The form and practice of PGIS continues to reflect its origins. At its core PGIS remains focused on integrating local knowledge that is multivalent, equivocal, and often conflictual within a reductionist GIS technology and extensive Spatial Data Infrastructure. Recent conceptual developments in deep mapping and spatial storytelling have the potential to advance the representation of community knowledge through participatory deep mapping. Deep mapping explicitly recognizes that social life is contingent, implicated, and unpredictable. In representing a critical engagement between Geographic Information Science (GISc) and community knowledge and representation, deep mapping potentially challenges the misalignment in representing community knowledge in GIS and in bending geospatial technologies to the needs of communities. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"boundary objects; deep mapping; knowledge representation; non-representational theory; participatory deep mapping; PGIS; spatial stories; umwelt";"geographical knowledge; GIS; mapping; participatory approach; spatial analysis; technological development";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84992061396;1

Later, when Robert Chambers and others introduced maps into Participatory Rural Appraisal, Participatory GIS and Public Participation GIS were also recognized by quantitative geographers as research methods and visualization tools. In the era of smartphones and global Internet coverage, applications such as FixMyStreet, ArcGIS Online, CartoDB and Maptioannaire allow users to cross the technology gap and become neocartographers without the need for GIS knowledge. GeoParticipation based on using spatial tools in order to involve citizens in community participation can be the future development of Public Participation GIS as it provides an easy-to-use environment and social engagement while creating the feeling of belonging to a certain social group or community. The paper presents a historical review of participatory approaches to the creation of maps, while focusing on the changing role of citizens; from being the objects of geographical research to being the creators of the agenda as well as decision-makers within their communities.

One of the ways practitioners articulate social change associated with PGIS interventions has been to qualify success using the term ‘empowerment’. This paper explores the extent to which PGIS academic literature has utilised, defined, measured, and analysed empowerment. This research will demonstrate the degree to which PGIS has, from 1996 to 2014, appropriately and adequately taken into account the causative and direct relationship between a PGIS intervention and empowerment. This article identifies works broadly dealing with PGIS, then searches within that subset of literature for the term ‘empowerment.’ The findings are both quantitatively and qualitatively assessed to explore the trends within the PGIS literature over time and to contextualise the ways in which empowerment has been identified, understood, and articulated. We conclude with a discussion on the extent to which future PGIS research and practice has the ability to disrupt power inequalities. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"empowerment; GIScience; participatory GIS (PGIS); PGIS; public participation GIS (PPGIS)";"empowerment; GIS; literature review; local participation; social change";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84990891497;1

While local government agencies have provided greater access to public data sets through their internet Geographic Information System (GIS) sites, data cannot always be downloaded and used directly by citizens. Past research demonstrates that data sharing at the local level can be a challenging task, mired by legal, institutional, and personal issues. Despite the hype about open data in government, its acceptance and implementation is slow at the local scale. The need for a centralized data repository system at the local scale is thus crucial. This research explores the recent groundbreaking effort to establish a state-wide geospatial portal among the 26 University of Wisconsin (UW) library systems. Through a survey and follow up interviews conducted among public land information professionals in Wisconsin, we find that GIS professionals in local and county governments are open to data sharing through a common geospatial portal. Simultaneously, the efforts to introduce open source GIS software and technical skills through workshops conducted by the library staff demonstrate new ways to facilitate Public Participation GIS (PPGIS). Our research thus demonstrates that university libraries can emerge as an effective model for advancing PPGIS through geoportals, web services, and data and applications in the cloud. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"data access; open GIS; public participation GIS";"GIS; Internet; local participation; software; spatial data; university sector; United States; Wisconsin";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84987923098;1

On the basis of a review of recent interrogations of the (Public) Participatory Geographic Information Systems (P)PGIS and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) approaches, a summary of five prevailing principles in participatory spatial information handling is presented. We investigate these five principles that are common to (P)PGIS and VGI on the basis of a framework of two dimensions that govern the participatory use of spatial information from the perspective of people and society. This framework is presented as a shared perspective of (P)PGIS and VGI and illustrates that, although both share many of these same principles, the ways in which these principles are approached are highly diverse. The paper ends with a future outlook in which we discuss the inter-connected memes of potential technological futures, the signification of localness in ‘local spatial knowledge’, and the ramifications of ethical tenets by which PGIS and VGI can strengthen each other as two sides of the same coin. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"Geoweb; local spatial knowledge; participatory geographic information systems; participatory practice; volunteered geographic information";"ethics; geographical knowledge; geography education; GIS; participatory approach; technological development; voluntary approach; World Wide Web";Article;Final;Open Access;Scopus;2-s2.0-84984914946;1

These mapping initiatives continue to be primarily associated with traditional land-use (TLU) studies and have deep roots in participatory methods that include aspects of participatory geographic information systems (PGIS). In the current context of encroaching industrial developments into indigenous homelands and the strengthening of Indigenous rights within Canadian Supreme Court rulings, the role of mapping TLU information is central. Who is conducting the research, what tools are used, and how this information is shared are all key questions being asked in the Indigenous context. As a result, the quality of spatial data has become a critical part of these engagement processes. This paper focuses on the intersections of new methods of TLU/IK data collection, namely a direct-to-digital approach that seeks to minimize misrepresentation and mistranslations of IK. From these intersections, the authors recognize the need to establish Indigenous-led quality indicators that directly address the introduction of new methods into the TLU/IK field. Indigenous geographic information and spatial data quality indicators will better address the current needs of Indigenous communities in the negotiation of resource developments in their territories, and provide a new path forward for enhancing the use of geospatial technologies in Indigenous communities. © 2015, © The British Cartographic Society 2015.;"cybercartography; Indigenous mapping; participatory method; PGIS; traditional land-use studies";"cartography; data quality; digital terrain model; GIS; indigenous knowledge; land use; mapping; spatial data; Canada";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978485284;1

A distinction must be made between the algorithm and its operational definition, which includes the metric used to drive it. When the algorithm was first introduced, it was demonstrated using the concept of the effective area of triangles. It was noted that alternative metrics could be used and that the metrics could be weighted, for example to take account of shape. Ordnance Survey (Great Britain) and others are using Visvalingam's algorithm for generalizing coastlines and other natural features, with complex parameter-driven functions to weight the original metric. This paper shows how free software and data were used to scrutinize the implications of one of Matthew Bloch's simple and transparent weighting functions. The results look promising, when compared with manually produced mid and small-scale maps; and encourage further research focussed on weighting functions and related topics, such as self-intersection of lines and model-based generalization. The paper discusses why weights were used in some projects. It comments on their range of applicability and reiterates the original guidance provided for the use of weights. It also demonstrates how weights can undermine the algorithm's capacity to draw caricatures with very few points.

Server map generalisation operators may be applied to solve this problem, including displacement. In this paper, we show how an optimisation algorithm, the snake algorithm, was used to displace multiple objects in order to resolve spatial conflicts and maintain important spatial relationships between objects during displacement. Two principles based on the snake algorithm are proposed in this paper. First, the truss structure mirroring spatial proximity relationships between buildings and between building and road is formed based on the weighted proximity graph derived from constrained Delaunay triangulations (CDT) in each map partition. In the weighted proximity graph, each connecting line is determined as a snake and as an element unit to assemble the global stiffness matrix in snake algorithm. Second, a buffer method that calculates force between a building and a road (or other linear features) or between pair of buildings is adopted in the snake algorithm. This avoids the imbalance phenomenon caused by different force calculation methods during the displacement. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated in obtaining real geographic data. Finally, the results are cartographically usable and in particular, the spatial relationships between objects are preserved. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"building displacement; conflict resolution; map generalisation; topographic structure";"algorithm; data processing; map generalization; matrix; optimization; topology; triangulation";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978512279;1

A case in point is the important Carte d’Afrique on a scale of 1∶2 000 000 which, during the last decades of the nineteenth century, was compiled by the French army officer Captain Richard de Régnauld de Lannoy de Bissy. The map made an enormous contribution to the history of cartography of Africa with regard to not only the discovery and exploration of the continent, but also the expansion of colonial control and the political rivalry between European powers. It was an impressive project to be executed by one man and at the time guaranteed a prominent position for the author in geographic and cartographic circles worldwide. Although afterwards superceded by many more accurate maps, Lannoy de Bissy’s map to date remains a lasting witness to the mapping of the ‘dark continent’ and of the fragile, hesitating progress made during the search for geographical knowledge before the advent of aerial photography and satellite imagery. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"exploration; French cartography; Lannoy de Bissy; mapping of Africa; Service géographique de l’armée; travellers";"exploration; geographical knowledge; historical cartography; mapping method; nineteenth century; Africa";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978511663;1

We utilized eye-tracking to complement the classical usability metrics; thus, we studied performance metrics such as effectiveness (i.e. success, accuracy), efficiency (i.e. time to answer, task completion time), and selected eye tracking metrics fixation frequency, fixation duration and scanpath speed as well as conducting an area-of-interest (AOI) analysis to understand the performance and strategy issues that may be influenced by colour distance and font size during map reading. The user experiment was carried out in a controlled laboratory where participants were asked to conduct a visual search task and mark the correct answer with a mouse click on a static map on a computer screen. Collected data was analysed through descriptive and inferential statistics.

It distinguishes the algorithm from implementation-specific issues to explain why it is possible to get inconsistent but equally valid output from different implementations. By tracing relevant developments within the now-disbanded Cartographic Information Systems Research Group (CISRG) of the University of Hull, it explains why (a) a partial metric-driven implementation was, and still is, sufficient for many projects but not for others; (b) why the effective area (EA) is a measure derived from a metric; (c) why this measure (EA) may serve as a heuristic indicator for in-line feature segmentation and model-based generalization; (d) how metrics may be combined to change the order of point elimination; and (e) how Tobler's rule-of-thumb is useful for scale-related filtering of EA.

Digital applications, developed in line with criteria related to these approaches, ask for a deeper understanding of users and their requirements. But, even though there is a wide range of methods available, the creation of user-centric applications with good usability and user experience still poses great challenges for developers. This is also true for web maps, i.e. web map applications, which today are ubiquitous on the Internet. They have evolved into an important information and communication tool and address users who do not possess any specific knowledge of Geoinformatics (GI) or Cartography. Despite the efforts made to meet the requirements and preferences of laymen, these users still often face problems when dealing with web map applications. This refers to aspects of design, content, and functionality. Here, participatory design, which is well-known in the field of Software and Web Engineering, might provide a suitable means. By engaging users directly and actively in the application development process, developers are able to gain a profound understanding of the users and their needs. However, there are several open questions regarding the use of participatory design for designing and implementing web map applications: What does the use of participatory design in web map development processes look like in detail? How and to what degree can users be involved in the development processes? Which added values exist? These questions are addressed by the project YouthMap 5020, whose main goal it was to create a prototype youth-centric web map for the Austrian city of Salzburg (zip code 5020). Applying the approach of participatory design, about 120 teenage pupils from several local schools were involved in all kinds of tasks related to the phases of generating the youth-centric Salzburg web city map. Experience and knowledge gained thereby allowed elaborating recommendations generally useful for generating youth-centric web map applications. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"participatory design; software development processes; the youth; usability; user experience; user-centric applications; web maps";"cartography; design; digital map; Internet; participatory approach; software; Austria; Salzburg [Austria]; Salzburg [Salzburg (STT)]";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978476634;1

Three dimensions of colour: Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV), are intuitive and most critical visual variables in map design. In this paper, we specifically focus on colour deficiency of red-green colour impairments. A controlled experiment was designed and conducted to explore how three colour dimensions (HSV) affect the abilities of people with normal colour vision or with red-green colour impairments to distinguish colours in maps. An eye-tracking approach was applied to quantify the accuracy and response time by capturing user eye movements to analyse the effectiveness and efficiency. In this study, we used one section of the administrative map of Hebei Province to test participant responses to area features. Differences of effectiveness and efficiency across normal colour vision and red-green colour impairments were compared. Multiple comparisons among Hue, Saturation and Value were analysed. Results show that for both normal colour vision and red-green colour impairments, Hue is the most differentiable than Saturation and Value. Saturation and Value are at the same level to be differentiated and more difficult to be distinguished. Guidelines of designing maps for both normal colour vision and red-green colour impairments were derived. The results of this study can be helpful to improve the map designs for colour deficiency. © 2013, © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"effectiveness; efficiency; eye-tracking; HSV; red-green colour impairments";"cartography; color; GIS; map; China; Hebei; Simplexvirus";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978536179;1

This article introduces Projection Wizard, an online map projection selection tool available at projectionwizard.org that helps mapmakers select projections. The user selects the desired distortion property, and the area to be mapped on an interactive web map. Projection Wizard then proposes a projection, along with projection parameters (such as standard parallels). The tool also creates a preview map with the proposed projection, and provides the corresponding projection code in PROJ.4 format, if applicable. The automated selection process is based on John P. Snyder's selection guideline with a few adjustments. This article discusses the automated selection process, and the map projections suggested.

This is rather surprising, considering the importance of this type of cartography in the handling of the complex environmental problems of modern society. This paper analyses the development of thematic maps and spatial data focusing on the terrestrial environment of Danish landscapes. The paper is introduced with a review of the concept of environmental cartography, followed by a historical analysis of the development of environmental mapping in Denmark. Results suggest that there has been a change in the content and aim of environmental cartography in the twentieth century, from an initial focus on mapping potentials for land use improvement and optimization of the economic outputs from engagement with terrestrial ecosystems, to a focus on monitoring ecosystems and regulation of human intervention. Finally, the usefulness of the concept environmental cartography to frame analytical work dealing with the still increasing number of maps produced for environmental purposes within the history of cartography, is evaluated. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis, 2016.;"digital cartography; ecosystems; environment; environmental regulation; land cover; land use; landscape maps";"cartography; land cover; land use; landscape; spatial data; terrestrial environment; thematic mapping; Denmark";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978511575;1

The same concept can be generalized to any conformal projection, although the application of this technique to other analytical functions is less known. In this work, the general Lambert–Lagrange projection formula is proposed and the application of the modified coordinates is discussed on projections: stereographic, conformal conic and Gauss–Schreiber.

However, the planimetric accuracy of local and regional maps before the nineteenth century is often considered problematic. This paper proposes a method for the evaluation of these maps, through integration in multiple computer programs such as ArcGIS, MapAnalyst and statistical software (SPSS). This method has been tested on a sample of historical maps depicting coastal landscape change in an area at the present-day Dutch-Belgian border (ranging from the local to the supra-regional level and from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries), and variations in planimetric accuracy over time have been interpreted. Results point to an exceptionally high accuracy of earlier medium- and large-scale maps – scale being the first determinant of planimetric accuracy – since no significant rise in accuracy over time was found. Notwithstanding this overall accuracy, many maps display pronounced local distortions. However, rather than disqualifying maps for landscape reconstruction, systematic analysis of these distortions can help to facilitate the interpretation of the historical maps and their use for landscape reconstruction. Finally, a method for integrating map accuracies in landscape reconstructions based on multiple maps is proposed and illustrated. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"coastal landscape reconstruction; geographic information systems; historical maps; MapAnalyst; planimetric accuracy";"accuracy assessment; coastal landform; GIS; historical cartography; landscape evolution; map; nineteenth century; reconstruction";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978477203;1

Therefore research on effect analysis was carried out by capturing and analyzing georeferenced emotions from user-generated content. An approach was developed for extracting location-based emotions from the written language in the metadata of georeferenced Flickr and Panoramio photos, i.e. from their titles, descriptions and tags. Within this extraction approach various grammatical issues were considered, like negations of words or amplifications. Procedures were developed for modifying the affected emotions, for example for inverting or intensifying them. The approach was applied to the study area of Dresden, Germany. The obtained emotions were documented in emotional maps of geospace as well as in valence-arousal-space originating from psychology. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"affect analysis; emotional cartography; user-generated content";"cartography; mapping method; metadata; psychology; Dresden; Germany; Saxony";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978765875;1

With the development and popularization of mapping applications on mobile devices, efforts have been made to integrate analogue maps with location-based services (LBSs). Previous work in this area has mainly used points as georeferences to calculate positions on map images, but point-based geocoding does not achieve accurate and stable positioning results. This paper introduces a map signboard collage system (MSCS) to enable LBSs using copied images of multiple map signboards on smartphones. The system uses polylines as georeferences, improving the accuracy and stability of positioning results, and supports automatic egocentralization of map images with compass sensors in smartphones. In addition, it collages multiple maps to allow natural, smooth and dynamic map switching for inter-map navigation. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"distorted map image; location-based services; map collage; map signboard; mobile mapping; polyline-based geocoding";"cartography; collagen; map; mapping; mobile communication; navigation";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978761856;1

This paper focused on identification and utilization of their importance based upon land-use distributions and application themes. First, this importance was identified using a three-step method that links a diversity index, a multiple attribute decision model and a spatial association analysis. Second, with the importance, a mathematical function was designed to determine minimum area thresholds of land-use polygons as an example of generalization constraints. Third, the importance was used to assist in the selection of generalization operators and evaluation of generalization outcomes. Fourth, a land-use dataset at 1:10 000, describing the land use of a typical rural area in Hubei province of China, was generalized towards a 1:50 000 dataset to verify the effects of the presented method and function. Three additional tests were implemented to analyze the sensitivity of the importance of land-use types on setting the minimum area threshold and generalization operations. The outcome showed that the proposed methods and functions make land-use data generalization more adaptable for in-use datasets and applications. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"generaliation constraint; land-use data generaliation; land-use type importance; multi-attribute decision model";"cartography; data set; land use; map generalization; multicriteria analysis; numerical model; China; Hubei";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978708865;1

In recent years, a hypothesis have been advanced that this stretching can be explained as a result of the change in the value of the Earth’s circumference from a larger one proposed by Eratosthenes to a lesser one by Posidonius. This explanation has two necessary presuppositions: (1) that Ptolemy’s map is stretched out by a factor of ∼1·4 which coincides with the ratio between Eratosthenes’ and Posidonius’ values, and (2) that Ptolemy’s error in longitude grows almost linearly. This article argues that the situation is more complex and nuanced. In fact, the error in longitude on Ptolemy’s map (and the stretching factor of the map, accordingly) varies considerably depending on longitude, latitude, and region. In particular, the error grows most slowly in the Eastern Mediterranean, which is probably due to the fact that this region was the centre of the ancient world. Therefore, Ptolemy’s error in longitude cannot be explained by one universal cause, but only by a combination of different factors. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"history of maps; map comparison; Ptolemy; Ptolemy’s coordinates; Ptolemy’s Geography; Ptolemy’s maps; spatial distribution of longitude differences";"coordinate; error analysis; historical cartography; map; spatial distribution; Mediterranean Region";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978698577;1

Maps, as external representations of the environment offer intuitive ways to extend the capacities of the human cognitive systems. Operations such as planning a route can be performed on maps instead of in the environment. Question of how to design maps that support cognitive processes such as wayfinding in novel environments have been discussed in several disciplines. The research reported here addresses the question of how map alignment and the presence of landmarks in maps interact during wayfinding. For the purpose of systematically analyzing the relationship between map alignment and landmark presence, nine virtual environments were designed. Routes learned from maps with different alignments and different numbers of landmarks present at decision points were used. While generally landmarks are assumed to foster wayfinding performance, our results indicate that misaligned maps can cancel out positive effects obtained through landmarks. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"landmarks; map alignment; virtual environment; wayfinding; you-are-here map";"cognition; design; map graphics; mapping method";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978664155;1

As a result of the discovery of the new American territories, many topographic surveys were performed during the sixteenth century. These maps developed various empirical methods to represent terrain and relief. In this comprehensive corpus, we find three maps with surprising representations of terrain that depart from pictorial methods, such as hill profiles or aligned or grouped mounds (sugar loaf hills), that were used from the origins of cartography until the eighteenth century. The procedure used on these maps is, to a certain extent, an intuitive anticipation of the scientific method used by modern surveying, in which the land relief is represented in an orthogonal view by the contour lines. This method was not developed and systematized until two hundred years after the three maps analysed in this study were produced. © 2016, © The British Cartographic Society 2016.;"empirical methods; history of cartography; relief representation; sixteenth century; Spanish America";"historical cartography; historical perspective; map generalization; mapping method; relief; surveying; Central America; South America; Spain";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84978655852;1

The London tube map, called a schematic or topological map in some literature, has often been cited as an excellent example of a simplified map. Algorithms have been developed by researchers to automate the generation of schematic maps for road networks. However, it is found that there is still a lack of defined general principles and here four general principles have been formulated for schematiz ation – the.

This is evident within cartography and geographical sciences more generally, with the quality of volunteered geographic information (VGI) recognized as a major challenge to address if the full potential of citizen sensing in mapping applications is to be realized. Here, a means to characterize the quality of volunteers, based only on the data they contribute, was used to explore issues connected with the quantity and quality of volunteers for attribute mapping. The focus was on data in the form of annotations or class labels provided by volunteers who visually interpreted an attribute, land cover, from a series of satellite sensor images. A latent class model was found to be able to provide accurate characterizations of the quality of volunteers in terms of the accuracy of their labelling, irrespective of the number of cases that they labelled. The accuracy with which a volunteer could be characterized tended to increase with the number of volunteers contributing but was typically good at all but small numbers of volunteers. Moreover, the ability to characterize volunteers in terms of the quality of their labelling could be used constructively. For example, volunteers could be ranked in terms of quality which could then be used to select a sub-set as input to a subsequent mapping task. This was particularly important as an identified subset of volunteers could undertake a task more accurately than when part of a larger group of volunteers. The results highlight that both the quantity and quality of volunteers need consideration and that the use of VGI may be enhanced through information on the quality of the volunteers derived entirely from the data provided without any additional information. © The British Cartographic Society 2015.;"Accuracy; Citi en science; Neogeography; Thematic mapping";"accuracy assessment; cartography; data quality; thematic mapping";Article;Final;Open Access;Scopus;2-s2.0-84956663590;1

In the interim, courses and programmes in cartography at other colleges and universities have come and gone, and programmes focussing on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are widespread, but Glasgow currently offers the only programme in the UK to retain cartography in its title. © The British Cartographic Society 2015.;"Cartographic education; University of Glasgow";"cartography; geography education; GIS; higher education; teaching; Glasgow [Scotland]; Scotland; United Kingdom";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84952668625;1

The visualization of 3D geospatial information, however, raises the question how to represent the information in an effective way. Considerable research has been done in technology-driven directions in the fields of cartography and computer graphics (e.g., design principles, visualization techniques). Here, non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) represents a promising visualization category – situated between both fields – that offers a large number of degrees for the cartography-oriented visual design of complex 2D and 3D geospatial information for a given application context. Still today, however, specifications and techniques for mapping cartographic design principles to the state-of-the-art rendering pipeline of 3D computer graphics remain to be explored. This paper revisits cartographic design principles for 3D geospatial visualization and introduces an extended 3D semiotic model that complies with the general, interactive visualization pipeline. Based on this model, we propose NPR techniques to interactively synthesize cartographic renditions of basic feature types, such as terrain, water, and buildings. In particular, it includes a novel iconification concept to seamlessly interpolate between photorealistic and cartographic representations of 3D landmarks. Our work concludes with a discussion of open challenges in this field of research, including topics, such as user interaction and evaluation. © The British Cartographic Society 2015.;"3D information visualization; 3D semiotic model; Cartographic design; Real-time rendering; User interaction";"cartography; computer simulation; GIS; mapping; real time; software; three-dimensional modeling; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84948183651;1

This paper presents a strategy for automated generation of schematic network maps for different display sizes, based on a redistribution of line density. This strategy consists of three steps: (a) estimation of spatial density of the network maps, (b) automated redistribution of line density in order to improve map clarity, for different display sizes, and (c) automated generation of schematic representations. An experimental evaluation has been carried out by using two sets of real-life network data. The results indicate that this strategy is able to generate schematic maps with much improved clarity for different display sizes and well-preserved map recognition. © The British Cartographic Society 2015.;"Adaptive; Different display size; Schematic network map";"cartography; map";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84948179218;1

In France, 900,000 km of water pipe serves 99% of the population. A recent law imposes the mapping of these pipelines on a known geographical system with a planar positional accuracy from 0.4 to 1.5 m according to the age and type of the pipeline. Wireless sensors and models based on computational fluid mechanics (CFD) allow to study flow and to reconstruct parameters such as velocity, pressure and a chemical concentration at each point. This information can be used to detect leaks and to control the concentration of chlorine or other chemical products. However, this information is not easy to map on GIS due to the small width of water pipe and the very high quantity of points necessary for data flow computation. In this research work, we propose solutions to map this information at different levels of detail with other information such as roads and buildings. We first propose to use area symbols instead of punctual symbols to improve zoom-in visual effects. We also propose to generalize initial water data for zoom-out processes. We use the axis of the water pipe as basic geometry and we segment it. We then compute a generalized value of pressure, velocity or chemical concentration for each segment with specific function adapted to the property we wish to study. We propose a conceptual data schema that describes the required information to map this data at different levels of detail. The solution has been fully implemented on experimental data and illustrated by means of a dedicated web mapping that proposes a set of GIS functions such as the selection of the data, zooming functions but also the animation to see the propagation of a chemical product in the water pipe. © The British Cartographic Society 2015.;"Generalization; Geovisualization; Pollution; Semiotics; Smart city; Water data";"drinking water; map generalization; mapping; pipeline; visualization; water flow; water quality; France";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84948173806;1

However, this dynamic process often results in maps that are not easily readable when the underlying data are automatically represented at smaller scales than the original data were intended for. Fortunately, the SLD rules can be decoded, the symbolization rules translated into geometrical features, and cartographic conflicts detected and partially solved. The conflicting features can be identified based on the use of few basic geospatial analysis functions. After a solution that minimizes these conflicts emerges, new SLD rules are generated that attempt to visually solve the cartographic conflicts. The new SLD rules can then be applied on-demand by a cartographic proxy server that rewrites the incoming GetMap requests to use the new SLD rules. The process for improving the WMS cartographic output has several stages, grouped into preparatory steps (basic automatic generalization methods, rough scale-dependent SLD symbolization) and real-time processing steps (detection of cartographic conflicts, conflicts solution and generation of new SLD rules). The entire process of detecting and solving cartographic conflicts in the maps produced by WMS through the use of overriding SLD rules is described in detail. Furthermore, it is conceivable to transform the conflicting features into spatial objects containing methods for discovering appropriate SLD values that minimize conflicts. Such approaches can bring the performance of automatic detection and correction of cartographic conflicts above the threshold required for interactive visualization, thus, making the process of dynamically solving cartographic conflicts in WMS servers a viable solution. © The British Cartographic Society 2015.;"Automatic generalization; Cartographic conflicts; Extended SLD/SE; Object-orientation; WMS";"cartography; conflict management; database; GIS; image resolution; international organization; Internet; map generalization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84948171098;1

The cosmographers identified, selected and re-edited information about hundreds of places from a variety of literary, iconographic and oral sources, and synoptically re-organized them in place names, cartouches, and drawings to be put on a map. This selection/aggregation process transformed the mappa mundi into a visual encyclopaedia (i.e. an all-around learning and thinking tool), where each geographical entry was able to generate narratives as a data gateway and an information hub for customs, commodities, and rulers of different peoples of the world. If we infer that the Renaissance people asked to the cosmographers to learn about the world as we go to search engines to find what we want, the reverse engineering of these works (as exemplified in this paper for the mid-fifteenth-century world map by Fra Mauro Camaldolese) can help to draw the connection between the traditional way to aggregate knowledge as a product (e.g. Fra Mauro’s mappa mundi) and the modern way of using search engines and related internet services (i.e. their map services) to serve a similar purpose but in a better and more dynamic manner, placing crucial question, such as: How the same networks/people can bring new wealth and development, or war and poverty?

We use a simulated annealing method to optimize the order of object rows at a specific time interval so that objects that are close together in space tend to be close together in the matrix. We also graphically represent the distance between objects and the general direction the object is travelling in the matrix, which is called Adaptive Relative Motion (ARM).

In this context, we introduce web-based environmental geospatial information systems (Web-EGIS) as a special case of Web-GIS, aiming to integrate the functionalities of geospatial information systems with the enormous quantity of specialized, distributed and highly heterogeneous environmental geo-referenced data and services. We define three main characteristics of the Web-EGIS. The first is a generic hypercube-based data organization and visualization. The next characteristic is a standard-based, threetier service-oriented architecture. The third and last characteristic is the traceability of the architectural and design decisions, for which we introduce the new concept of an ‘Environmental Application Context’, arguing that not only the functional but also the non-functional requirements (NFRs) have an important role in defining the architecture, software components and data services of such systems. In a nutshell, a Web-EGIS is characterized by a coherent user experience through the hypercube-based visualization concept, technically supported by a service-oriented architecture that is structured according to an extensive analysis of NFRs. On this basis, we introduce the Geodata visualization and interactive training environment (GeoVITe) Platform for Interdisciplinary Environmental Research as a reference implementation of a Web-EGIS with its basic design requirements, integrative hypercube-based visualization for heterogeneous data sources, extended web cartography functionalities, and its de facto system architecture. The concept of the hypercube-based visualization is better transferred to the system architecture by understanding the ‘Environmental Application Context’ of this particular Web-EGIS, which also makes it easier to maintain and enhance. The resulting system is a support platform for research activities in the environmental domain. © The British Cartographic Society 2015.;"Design decisions; Environmental application context; Hypercube-based data exploration; Non-functional requirements; Web-EGIS";"cartography; GIS; spatial data; visualization; World Wide Web";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84948131412;1

Drainage density patterns for these networks can be derived to characterize local landscape, bedrock and climate conditions, and further inform hydrological and geomorphological analysis by indicating areas where too few headwater channels are represented. Natural drainage density patterns are not consistently available in existing hydrographical data bases for the United States because compilation and capture criteria historically varied, along with climate, during the period of data collection over the various terrain types throughout the country. This paper demonstrates an automated workflow that is being tested in a high-performance computing environment by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to map natural drainage density patterns at the 1:24,000-scale (24K) for the conterminous United States. Hydrographic network drainage patterns may be extracted from elevation data to guide corrections for existing hydrographic network data. The paper describes three stages in this workflow including data pre-processing, natural channel extraction, and generation of drainage density patterns from extracted channels. The workflow is implemented in parallel fashion by simultaneously executing procedures on multiple subbasin watersheds within the U.S. National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Pre-processing defines parameters needed for the extraction process. Extraction proceeds in standard fashion: filling sinks, developing flow direction and weighted flow accumulation rasters. Drainage channels with assigned Strahler stream order are extracted within a subbasin and simplified. Drainage density patterns are then estimated with 100-m resolution and subsequently smoothed with a low-pass filter. The extraction process is found to be of better quality in higher slope terrains. Concurrent processing through the high-performance computing environment is shown to facilitate and refine the choice of drainage density extraction parameters and more readily improve extraction procedures than conventional processing. © The British Cartographic Society 2015.;"Concurrent processing; Drainage density; Elevation-derived streams";"drainage network; elevation; hydrographic survey; mapping; parallel computing; stream channel; United States";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84948130995;1

The participants were given mapping tasks to complete using iD and observed with the thinking aloud method as well as screen recording and mouse/keyboard logging. Additionally, the test persons were interviewed after each test. The data gathered were analysed with regard to key usability criteria such as learnability, efficiency, error tolerance, and subjective user satisfaction. The outcome of this study is the identification of usability issues from which possible improvements of the tool have been derived.

Subjects were asked to perform two sets of tasks using two thematic maps with different legend layouts. While latency and accuracy of answers for the first set of tasks did not differ significantly between users of the different layouts, users clearly preferred legends that were simple or familiar. The thinking aloud protocols from the second part of the study revealed different patterns of legend comprehension for each legend design. In addition, the study identified four problem-solving strategies that were adopted by the subjects.

One of its main purposes is to guarantee safety of navigation. As a consequence, the construction of a nautical chart follows very specific rules. The cartographer has to select and highlight undersea features according to their relevance to navigation. In an automated process, the system must be able to identify and classify these features from the terrain model. This paper aims therefore to define ontologies of the submarine relief and nautical chart that will be at the root of a model-oriented generalization process. To the best of our knowledge, no ontology has been defined to formalize the geographical and cartographic objects for nautical chart representation. Thus, a bottom-up approach was developed to extract and model knowledge derived from standards established by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and cartographers’ expertise. The submarine relief ontology formalizes undersea features describing the submarine relief. Four concepts (composition, morphometric class, shape value and depth value) are introduced to describe properties and relationships between undersea features. The cartographic representation ontology of nautical charts will define several concepts (chart, features, isobathymetric lines and soundings) for the representation of undersea features on the chart. © The British Cartographic Society 2015.;"Nautical chart; Ontology; Representation; Submarine relief; Undersea features";"bottom-up approach; cartography; hydrographic survey; navigation aid; seafloor mapping; shoreline; submarine";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84924282448;1

It is manifested in some examples worth mentioning, such as virtual walks, visualisations of 3D objects and panoramas. In order to assist users in the perception of such presentations, they are supplemented by typical cartographic elements, such as fragments of maps or city plans. One kind of such cartographic works, recently slightly forgotten, but still worth attention, are the socalled panoramic maps of 'panneau' type. A panoramic map of 'panneau' type is a form of a view panorama of 360u horizon, projected on a flat plane in the form of a closed circle. Landscape 'panneau' presentations are usually produced for characteristic points of observation, mainly in mountainous areas, but also at points of observation in cities (e.g. the Arch of Triumph in Paris) and they are located on special viewing platforms. They are additional tourist attractions and perform an educational function. 'Panneaus' are usually engraved or etched on special metal plates, on china or they are printed on other media, for example, on paper. The objective of such imageries was to allow users to familiarize themselves quickly with the landscape which may be seen from a given point of observation, directly at that point - and thus to provide them with the possibility to locate and identify (by name) such geographical features as mountain peaks, passes, localities and other characteristic points. This paper presents the principles, methodology and technology used to create panoramic images of 'panneau' type using digital techniques. The starting point to create the 'panneau' is a 3600 rectangular panorama of a given horizon. Depending on the image type, which should be obtained, appropriate technology of image recording is applied. Panoramic images acquired with the use of a standard analogue or digital camera are photomontages combining individual photographs that belong to a series of images encompassing the entire scene. Single shots must be geometrically and tonally matched, so that it should be difficult to differentiate them. In digital techniques, special software tools are applied for combining individual images, such as Panorama Factory or Panorama Maker. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Cartography; Panoramic maps; Visualisation";"cartography; digital image; photograph; software; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84896898207;1

Hachuring was developed into strict and mathematically grounded planimetric method during the eighteenth century. Established by Lehmann in 1799, topographic hachures flourished during the first half of the nineteenth century and then were gradually replaced by contours. Today, hachures are still popular in presentation of anthropogenic relief on archaeological and topographic maps. Some elements of hachuring can be found in geomorphometric and hydrometeorological mapping, where flowlines and arrows are used to show the intensity and direction of the flow on the surface, or its aspect and slope. The study aims to reveal the potential of hachuring in further development as surface presentation method. Automated implementation of all original requirements for hachure construction is provided for the first time by new algorithm using vector flowlines. Then an advanced hachuring technique called 'slope and aspect hachuring' is presented which depicts slope, aspect and flow direction of the surface simultaneously. Slope and aspect hachuring is compared to traditional area colours to reveal its advantages and shortcomings in sight of morphometric mapping. Some applications of the method and directions of future research are suggested in concluding part. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Automation; Cartographic relief presentation; Hachures; Morphometric mapping";"algorithm; automation; cartography; mapping method; morphometry; topographic mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84896883734;1

Two studies were conducted to compare the readability of the current United States Geological Survey (USGS) 'US Topo' map series with two original designs incorporating orthoimagery and shaded relief. The studies examined reader design ratings after completing tasks that required analytical use of maps with varied map designs, using maps of diverse locations in the USA. The studies indicated that readability varied with map location to a greater degree than with map design, though design influence on ratings was detected in interaction with location. This variation with landscape is discussed from the perspective of recent theory in landscape aesthetics and preferences. Also, it was statistically demonstrated that either of the two new designs had improved readability over the existing US Topo. These studies reveal that user evaluations of maps are dependent on landscape preferences as well as on design, and demonstrate the importance of national topographic map design evaluation across a wide sample of national landscapes. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Cartographic design; Landscape preference; Orthoimagery; Readability; Realism; Relief shading; Topographic mapping";"cartography; geological survey; landscape; orthophoto; relief; topographic mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84896871892;1

An ideal solution is only updating the large-scale map with other smaller scale maps undergoing automatic updates. This process may involve a series of operators, among which selective omission has received much attention. This study focuses on selective omission in a road network, and the use of an artificial neural network (i.e. a back propagation neural network, BPNN). The use of another type of artificial neural network (i.e. a self-organizing map, SOM) is investigated as a comparison. The use of both neural networks for selective omission is tested on a real-life road network. The use of a BPNN for practical application road updating is also tested. The results of selective omission are evaluated by overall accuracy. It is found that (1) the use of a BPNN can adaptively determine which and how many roads are to be retained at a specific scale, with an overall accuracy above 80%; (2) it may be hard to determine which and how many roads should be retained at a specific scale using an SOM. Therefore, the BPNN is more effective for selective omission in road updating. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.";"Artificial neural networks; Map generalisation; Road updating";"artificial neural network; back propagation; map generalization; mapping; road";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84896851482;1

This paper explores the role of news maps in geopolitical discourse with reference to the potential super-power status of key states, specifically China and Russia as members of the BRIC group (Brazil, Russia, India and China), and in the case of Russia, the NORCs (Northern Rim Countries - Canada, Russia, several Scandinavian states and the USA). It also explores references to 'threats' to a stable interstate system (resource wars, regional instability, 'rouge states'). The paper argues that the concept of the state as 'power container' provides a key to understanding how maps operate as a significant element within geopolitical discourse. Maps provide spatial and geostrategic context to the narratives being deployed by news providers on such matters as China's projection of power.

Labels are one of the most important elements on the map as they can provide more information than other symbols can. The design of the labels does have to stress the theme, shape and functionality of the associated objects, which results in a more efficient interpretation of the map content by the user. How the label designs can enhance the map readers' efficiency (and thus the quality of the maps themselves) is the main objective of this study. A user study was conducted in which the participants were asked to locate a target label on a map. Different label designs were implemented across the trials. The participants' reactions times were registered to measure their efficiency and statistically analysed using a one-way ANOVA. Two different users' characteristics were considered: gender and expertise. Related to the size, shape, orientation and texture of the labels, a number of significant differences (P,0.05) and trends were located. Differences in efficiency between males and females, on the one hand, and between novices and experts, on the other hand, were also described statistically. Consequently, recommendations can be formulated regarding the design of labels in order to obtain more efficient maps, keeping in mind the map users' characteristics. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Label design; Label efficiency; Visual variable";"cartography; design; gender; map graphics";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84896835198;1

Despite the popularity of imagery basemaps, few strategies have been suggested to enhance their readability. Here, we describe a controlled experiment leveraging the eye tracking method to explore the potential of enhancing remotely sensed imagery when used for cartographic presentation. Specifically, 20 participants had their eye movements recorded as they visually searched for areas of interest in either an unmodified image (such as typical in web mapping services) or enhanced image (using image processing routines common to Remote Sensing). By interpreting the eye movement fixations and saccades of participants using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis, we found that the image enhancements improved both the effectiveness of and efficiency in identifying areas of interest, particularly those previously concealed in more visually complex areas in the image.

Little empirical evidence exists, however, providing support of the potential advantages of such complex visual space–time displays. This research aimed at filling this gap.An empirical study was carried out to obtain insight on how multi-component animated maps are used to explore dynamic spatio-temporal phenomena. We examined which particular components attract users’ attention and in what sequence, and whether display effectiveness can be characterized by users’ viewing behaviours. Based on behavioural data collected with the eye-tracking method, we find that component size, and employed dynamic variables attracted users’ attention most. We are also able to identify visual behaviour patterns that result in performance differences between participants, using multi-component animated map. Finally, we highlight component layout design issues that should be further examined empirically, in order to reduce potential split attention effects. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Cartographic animation; Eye-tracking; Map usability; Multi-component animated map; Multi-component dynamic cartographic display";;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84920103715;1

It has become a design icon despite the fact that it eschews topography (other than the River Thames) and focuses on the simplified depiction of the topology of the Underground rail network. Beck’s map, designed in 1931, and first made available to London commuters in 1933, has become the image of the geography of London and, generally, the mental map that defines how London ‘works’. Station names have become synonymous with the aboveground landscape and the network is such that most of London’s landmarks can be readily located through the map. Navigating between them is a simple process and while the city above is a socio-economic and cultural soup, the simplicity of the map brings a sense of order, structure and sensibility. It is a perfect counterpoint to the chaos at street level. In cartographic terms, Beck’s map works and marries form with function perfectly. It retains the status of ‘the’ map of London and manages to simplify the network, be harmonious, coherent, balanced and all with minimal topographic distortion. The symbols are clear and well crafted; the composition and layout, though somewhat challenged by network changes since 1933, remains useful; and the design has remained relatively unchanged over the last 80 years which creates stability in appearance and breeds confidence in its use. However, this paper asserts that Beck’s map is over-used in myriad ways beyond the reason for its invention. The effect of such abuse has perhaps been to dilute its own place in cartographic history. There have been many official iterations that have not always successfully married Beck’s design ideas with network changes; other metro maps have often tried to imitate but with mediocre success; and the map is perpetually used as a template for mimics and alternatives.

Rock faces, trenches, gullies, faults and other rock features relevant for orientation and navigation in mountainous areas are shown as seen from the ground instead of from an orthogonal perspective. The density and dimensions of hachures change with the exposure to a source of illumination to generate a shading effect that highlights the terrain’s threedimensionality. The generation of rock drawings in Swiss style is time-intensive and requires an eye for the artistic rendering of the terrain’s third dimension as well as an understanding of different rock types and their morphology. Design principles have not yet been documented in a detailed and comprehensive manner and only rudimentary algorithms exist for the digital generation of simplified representations. This paper discusses the defining characteristics and specific design principles of Swiss-style rock drawing based on figures and unpublished documentation from the Swiss Federal Office of Topography swisstopo. We identify three main types of hachure-based rock drawing and discuss graphical elements for the most common type. We also discuss the combination of rock drawings with contour lines, their generalisation and the drawing process. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Relief map; Rock drawing; Swiss maps; Terrain map";;Article;Final;Open Access;Scopus;2-s2.0-84920064040;1

Hence, one might easily lose track of what 3D means in a particular context. 3D is just a generic term which the authors are trying to classify into different groups. An overview of the technical status of 3D technologies serves to explain the importance of the three-dimensionality in cartography. Solid landscape embodiments as well as pseudo-three-dimensional and truly three-dimensional autostereoscopic visualisations on planar displays are treated. Starting with the reasons for the advantages and the necessities for true-3D representations the article deals with the classification and explanation of the different true-3D visualisation techniques so far materialized for geodata, in particular at the Institute for Cartography of the Dresden University of Technology. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Autostereoscopy; Cartography; Geodisplays; Geovisualisation; Terminology; Three-dimensionality; True-3D";"cartography; terminology; three-dimensional modeling; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84919451247;1

Until recently, this has mainly been applied to static and non-cartographic stimuli, but due to technological developments and reduced cost of equipment, interactive and cartographic applications are now feasible. Li et al. (2010) suggest a new analysis method which applies Ha¨gerstrand’s Space-Time-Cube (STC; Ha¨gerstrand, 1970) to eye movement data. However, in an interactive three-dimensional STC, identifying and exploring key behaviours can be difficult. In order to ameliorate these difficulties, we propose a variation of the STC method, which uses two-dimensional projections of the STC onto the XT and YT planes. These two-dimensional projections are found to facilitate rapid identification of significant patterns in the data set. A prototype implementing this and other dynamical methods has been developed, and is presented with examples illustrating the benefits of working with two-dimensional projections of the STC. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.";"Analysis tools; Cartography; Eye movement analysis; Eye tracking; Interactive space-time-cube";"cartography; technological development; three-dimensional modeling; two-dimensional modeling; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84919433926;1

In the present study, the effect of three different visualizations of elevation information oneye movements and performance was investigated in visual search, area selection, and route planning tasks. The results showed that the visualization of relief information affected the performance and eye movements in the visual search task.Overall, the eye movements differed between the search and area selection tasks, as well as between the search and route planning tasks. The result showed that the relief shading did not slow down the performance, either in terms of response time or eye movement measures. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Contour lines; Eye movements; Fixation; Map visualization; Oblique view; Relief shading; Saccade; Spatial frequency; Task effects";"cartography; contour map; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84919424435;1

In spite of these achievements, the country, by the 1930s, still lacked reliable topographical maps. One reason for this was that the secondary and tertiary triangulations of the country were still incomplete; another was that the decision-making process as regards surveys and mapping rested with a variety of statutory bodies instead of just one. In 1934, A. D. Lewis, Director of the Department of Irrigation, committed his department to execute a general topographical survey of the country and  produce a topographical map on a scale of 1: 500 000. Lewis’ decision met with much resistance from within the country and abroad, but the project was completed in a record period of 4 years. Published just before the Second World War, the map was of inestimable value to the South African Defense Force. It not only became the standard topographical map of large parts of South Africa for many years, but its contents also figured in the first map series of the TSO. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.";"Contour map; Geodetic survey; Secondary triangulation; South Africa; Topographical map; Topographical survey";"contour map; decision making; geodetic network; historical cartography; topographic mapping; triangulation; South Africa";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84919419662;1

This is because colours and the relations among them influence not only the aesthetic impression a map creates but also its overall utility. In addition to Newton’s spectral colour theory, today theories with origins in artistic technique are gaining ground in cartography. This article introduces J. Itten’s colour theory (first published in 1961 in The Art of Colour [Kunst der Farbe]) with special attention given to his concept of seven colour contrasts. The article also discusses the suitability and unsuitability of their application in practical cartography, and it contributes original examples employing thematic maps, a discipline with broad possibilities for the application of these inventive methods by today’s mapmakers. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Colour contrast; Colour in cartography; Colour theory; Johannes Itten; Thematic maps";"cartography; color; thematic mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84919416354;1

Through a qualitative analysis of reported incidents in WikiMapia and OpenStreetMap, a typology of this kind of vandalism is outlined, including play, ideological, fantasy, artistic and industrial carto-vandalism, as well as carto-spam. Two families of counter-strategies deployed in amateur mapping communities are discussed. First, the contributors organize forms of policing, based on volunteered community involvement, patrolling the maps and reporting incidents. Second, the detection of carto-vandalism can be supported by automated tools, based either on explicit rules or on machine learning. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Carto-vandalism; Commons-based peer production; Crowdsourced cartography; Digital commons; Online vandalism; OpenStreetMap; Volunteered geographic information; WikiMapia";"artificial intelligence; cartography; digital map; GIS";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84919413148;1

However, manual shading is time-consuming and its results depend on the cartographer and as such difficult to replicate consistently. For this reason there is a need to create an automatic method to standardize its results. A crucial aspect of manual shading is the continuous change of light direction (azimuth) and angle (zenith) in order to better highlight discrete landforms. Automatic hillshading algorithms, widely available in many geographic information systems (GIS) applications, do not provide this feature. This may cause the resulting shaded relief to appear flat in some areas, particularly in areas where the light source is parallel to the mountain ridge. In this work we present a GIS tool to enhance the visual quality of hillshading. We developed a technique based on clustering aspect to provide a seamless change of lighting throughout the scene. We also provide tools to change the light zenith according to either elevation or slope. This way the cartographer has more room for customizing the shaded relief representation. Moreover, the method is completely automatic and this guarantees consistent and reproducible results. This method has been embedded into an ArcGIS toolbox. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Azimuth changes; Clustering; Dynamic light change; Hillshading; Multiple light sources; Shaded relief";;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84911416725;1

Those range between very detailed descriptions within parts of a city to spatially spread events within a country, or long journeys across continents. Depending on the fictional texts, fictional action often concentrates on a few main places, resulting in high information density - in the form of various individual settings. As well, they are also embedded in a larger environment. When interactively analysing or choosing a section to print a literary map with individual spatial elements, the user has to choose a map scale, which will result in the output of either a detailed representation of a main place or the geographical overview of the fictional space having a small level of detail. However, it would be a great advantage to receive as much information as possible from one single map view. In order to achieve this, this paper presents a method that allows increasing the representable amount of information, depending on its density. Our method makes use of the diffusion algorithm that is used to create value-by-area cartograms. This algorithm is applied to an auxiliary density grid derived from the distribution of individual settings of a literary map that are to be displayed. The resulting distortion is subsequently transferred to the data of the literary map. Unlike the usual use of area cartograms, we do not aim to represent a statistical value; instead information density is used to provide space for the depiction of the information itself. Various parameters such as grid resolution, scale factor and a smoothing filter visually influence the final map distortion. On the basis of several map examples taken from the 'Literary Atlas of Europe' project database, distortion results generated from the application of different parameters are visually examined. Using this process, we improved the proposed approach and generalised an appropriate initial configuration for the automated generation of distorted maps through the usage of its information density. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.";"Automatic distortion; Cartogram; Cartographic visualisation; Literary geography; Variable map-scales";"algorithm; cartogram; cartography; database; smoothing; visualization; Europe";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84903196182;1

It focuses upon a critical reading of five different architectural atlases and argues that their construction and design reveals how 're-cartographies' can narrate novel stories about places. The narrative power of these atlases is traced back to a focus upon relations between phenomena, and a careful consideration of how to map the mutability and dynamism of the built and natural environment. They offer new kinds of selection, classification and symbolisation; deploy hybrid forms to destabilize taken for granted binary distinctions between nature and culture; use montage and juxtaposition to reveal scalar linkages; re-imagine figure-ground relationships to reveal functional city forms and processes; and explore the potential of meta-structures in the relations between different maps in an atlas layout.

More specifically, the paper considers the scope for digital video technologies to reshape, contest and 'ground' spaces of urban representation and the 'spatial stories' these bring into play. Basing my analysis on the mediation of the events surrounding the abduction and murder of the 2-year-old boy James Bulger in 1993, I examine the case as a constellation of spatial narratives within which I weave my own spatial story in the form of a video mapping of the abduction route (in Bootle near Liverpool) and the responses and issues this further mediation has provoked. Methodological reflections on the map-making process are discussed alongside narratives generated by the video on YouTube. The paper argues that, by adopting practices of wayfinding, and by being critically attentive to the ways in which film and video-making practices are also spatial practices, moving image cartographies can provide insights into lived and embedded spaces of memory, and the hidden or muted spatial stories to which they play host. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Cinemapping; Cinematic cartography; Dark heritage; James Bulger; Liverpool; Spatial practice; Wayfinding; YouTube";"cartography; digitization; film; media role; spatial analysis";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84903188710;1

This is approached from a map making perspective. Throughout the process of editing this special issue, we have identified two main types of relationships. Firstly, maps have been used to represent the spatio-temporal structures of stories and their relationships with places. Oral, written and audio-visual stories have been mapped extensively. They raise some common cartographic challenges, such as improving the spatial expression of time, emotions, ambiguity, connotation, as well as the mixing of personal and global scales, real and fictional places, dream and reality, joy and pain. Secondly, the potential of maps as narratives and the importance of connecting the map with the complete mapping process through narratives is addressed. Although the potential of maps to tell stories has already been widely acknowledged, we emphasize the increasing recognition of the importance of developing narratives that critically describe the cartographic process and context in which maps unfold - the core idea of post-representational cartography. Telling the story about how maps are created and how they come to life in a broad social context and in the hands of their users has become a new challenge for mapmakers. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.;"Literary maps; Mapping process; Narrative cartography; Post-representational cartography; Story maps";"cartography; map generalization; map graphics; mapping method";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84903178724;1

We reason that the photographers typically capture a scene or a moment because they want to remember or share it, thus these scenes or moments are meaningful to them. Various scholars suggest that the human experience (i.e. this meaningfulness) is what separates a place from the mathematical descriptions of space. While this notion is well known in larger geographic literature, it is under-explored in cartographic research. We respond to this research gap and reconstruct static and dynamic patterns of photo-taking and -sharing behaviour to assist in capturing the implicit meaning in the studied locations. These locations may be meaningful to only a certain group of people in certain moments; therefore, studying group differences in spatial and temporal photo-taking patterns will help building a collective and comparative story about the studied place. In our study, we focus on experiences of foreign versus domestic visitors, and in the process, we examine the potential (and feasibility) of georeferenced photographs for extracting such collective narratives using qualitative and quantitative visual analytical methods. © The British Cartographic Society 2014.";"Flickr; Narrative; Place; Tourism; Trajectory; Trajectory network; UGC; User-generated content; VGI";"comparative study; photograph; quantitative analysis; reconstruction; spatial analysis; visualization; Switzerland; Zurich [Switzerland]";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84903151637;1

However, these methods are not efficient for virtual globes because the effect is only visible from one view point and this restricts interactivity. By using synthetic image techniques in order to generate stereo-paired images, we can produce visible effects from any view point. In this paper, we present a comparative study of stereoscopic techniques in virtual globes supported by a test carried out among 51 participants. Three devices were used: anaglyphs, an autostereoscopic screen and a quadbuffer system. The aim was to determine which one of the three devices causes a deeper feeling of immersion and which one can be more efficient in a virtual globe. Results show considerable differences between the quadbuffer system and the other devices. The mentioned system causes in the user a stronger feeling of depth and immersion in the virtual globe. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"3D visualisation; Stereoscopy; Virtual globe";"cartography; comparative study; photogrammetry; three-dimensional modeling; topography; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84888799526;1

This research emphasizes the cartographic aspects of TVWMs through evaluating their visual variables. Currently defined visual variables including basic, dynamic and motion variables are investigated and some suggestions are made to improve their application on TVWMs. The rates of the represented visual information within different frames and the related standard deviation are proposed as measures to improve the performance of the 'duration' dynamic variable. The concept of 'visual expressions' is introduced, and their applications at the organisational level of map design are discussed. Such expressions (including background, boundary, spatial order, zoom and overview maps) are examined as tools for 'user orientation' in particular, and their role as dominant parameters in TVWMs' cartographic communication is considered. Their incorporation in TVWMs of a number of global news channels is evaluated. Firstly, the concepts of visual design parameters are utilized as a foundation for an analytical evaluation, then an empirical evaluation is carried out based on a statistical investigation of a sample of TV viewers. The resulting ranking order and correlation coefficients for each of the elements shows a firm agreement, corroborating views on the importance and proficiency of the visual elements in communicating weather information. As a result, TVWMs of well-known global TV channels (BBC, Euronews, France24, PressTV) are ranked with respect to the effectiveness of their designs. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"Cartography; Television weather maps; User orientation; Visual variables";"cartography; empirical analysis; map; television; visual analysis";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84888782910;1

Recently, however, indoor cartography has increasingly attracted attention both from the academic world and from commercial enterprises. Indoor cartography calls for markedly different visualisation strategies. Frameworks for describing map communication and use exist for general maps. But so far, no such framework exists for indoor maps. This article presents and discusses several map types for indoor spaces found in the literature and commercial products. The different characteristics of each one are identified and described. On this basis, a framework for indoor maps is developed and presented. Arbitrary indoor maps can be described by their properties using the framework.

Aerial photographs of 2003, 2006, and 2009 were made available by the Hydrological Service of the Regional Government of Salzburg, the Federal Office of Metrology, Surveying and Mapping, Vienna, and the Regional Government of the Tyrol, respectively. High resolution multi-temporal digital elevation models and digital orthophotos of the area of interest were derived using digital photogrammetric methods to provide a sound basis for glaciological research. Glacier outlines of the three glacial stages were mapped interactively. Temporal change in area and surface height of the glaciers mapped clearly document glacier retreat. Glacier mass balance based on the geodetic method was calculated for Stubacher Sonnblickkees (Glacier). Mean annual specific net balance amounts to -656 mm w.e. for the time period 2003-2009, with a mass balance gradient of 324 mm w.e. (100 m)-1 and an equilibrium-line altitude of 2995 m a.s.l. Digital orthophoto maps and other thematic maps, e.g. showing surface height change, were prepared to support further data interpretation. Both the study area and its spatio-temporal change were visualized with special emphasis on the glaciers in a computer generated video film.

Traditional handcrafted construction methods provide quality results, but are extremely labourintensive and therefore costly. Modern methods using digital terrain models (DTMs) and computer numerical control (CNC) milling are fast and accurate, but the finished models are visually less than optimal. Solutions are proposed using DTMs and CNC milling to create landscape models in which the initial shaping is done mechanically and the fine details are carved by hand. This 'balanced approach' to landscape modelling combines the time- and cost-advantages of modern digital technology with the quality of traditional handcrafted techniques resulting in highly accurate landscape models which still retain the artistic 'feel' of the human touch. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"Art; CNC; DTM; Solid landscape model; Stereolithography; Topographic relief";"cartography; digital terrain model; landscape; modeling; numerical model; topography; twenty first century";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84881648934;1

In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of 4D maps (three spatial dimensions plus time) for cartographically illustrating spatio-temporal environmental phenomena. The presented approach focuses mostly on explorative research rather than on enhancement and extension of existing methods and principles. The user study described in the paper shows that 4D cartography is not a well-explored research area and that many experienced map users try to apply their knowledge from 2D maps to 4D dynamic visualisations. Thus, in order to foster the discussion within the community, we formulated several basic research questions for the area of 4D cartography, which range from methods for representing time in 4D visualisations and understanding the temporal context to finding generic methods to achieve optimized temporal generalisation and a consistent definition of graphical variables for 3D and 4D. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"4D cartography; Digital Earth; Dynamic maps; Lightning events; Spatio-temporal maps; User study";"cartography; four-dimensional modeling; lightning; map; optimization; spatiotemporal analysis; three-dimensional modeling; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84881648301;1

Unlike traditional maps or globes, most relief models are unique, vulnerable hand-made objects. Digital archiving is an important step in their preservation. There are special tools for this task, but these equipments are rather expensive, and libraries or other institutes that usually own these models cannot spend too much. The authors examined various on-line tools to create digital 3D representation of relief models using a set of photographs as source. These tools create point cloud and textured triangle mesh based on matching patterns on the photos. A workflow was developed which uses these web services and produces the digital 3D version of relief models. This paper introduces the method, discusses the details of successful photographing, the possible post-processing of the results. A new web site, using the X3DOM technology to show the digitized models to the general public, is also introduced. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"3D modelling; Archiving; Digitizing; Relief models";"cartography; digital map; landscape; photograph; three-dimensional modeling";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84881646011;1

These techniques could expand the cartographic 'tool box' drastically, implying that 3D is no longer limited to the well-known representation of landform characteristics. Major map design aspects of multi-image models have been analyzed and evaluated regarding their use in thematic cartography. For map design using lenticular foil technology empirical findings are necessary to position layers adequately along the z-axis of a 3D depiction. Hovering layers may generate additional information values, which seem to be able to compensate the shortcomings in 2D maps. Several parameters or dimensions of cartographic contents can be displayed simultaneously. True-3D display techniques must be implemented in a differentiated manner to achieve positive impacts on cartographic communication. However, lenticular foil technique opens perspectives for more diverse products in thematic cartography. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"3D monitor; Digital map; Lenticular foil technology; Thematic cartography; True-3D";"cartography; digital map; thematic mapping; three-dimensional modeling; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84881645295;1

One of these worlds is the world of National Atlases: collections of complex, high-quality maps presenting a nation to the geographically interested. The second is the world of National Spatial Infrastructures: highly organized, standardized and institutionalized large collections of spatial data and services. In the paper, we describe the two worlds and their fundamental differences and we present the theoretical framework in which these worlds could be united. We introduce a test bed we are using to try out the theoretical framework in a real-life use case. In the architecture of that test bed, we introduce a National Atlas Services layer and describe how we have created an Atlas Map Viewer component, using the Open Web Platform.

It is sometimes referred to as 'America's birth certificate' and was purchased by the Library of Congress in July 2001 from Germany. Johann Schöner (1477-1557), a Nuremberg astronomer-geographer had acquired an edition of the first printing, binding it into a volume with other maps. In 1901, Joseph Fisher, a Jesuit historian, who was conducting research in the library at Wolfegg Castle, Wurttenberg, Germany, discovered Schoner's book and the famous Waldseemuller Map. The copy at the Library of Congress is the only known survivor of the 1000 copies of the map believed to have been printed. Owing to the extreme rarity of this precious map, the Library of Congress undertook two major initiatives to ensure its preservation. The exchange between the German Government and the Library of Congress required that the map always be on exhibit for anyone to view, and a large anoxic visual display encasement was designed to maintain a 20-30 years' hermetic seal, protecting the document from environmental risks. Before to encasement for display, the Library conducted hyperspectral imaging to capture extensive historical information for access by researchers and scholars. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"Anoxic encasement; Library of Congress; Spectral imaging; Waldseemüller 1507 World Map";"cartography; environmental risk; imaging method; map; spectral analysis; Germany";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84881639335;1

However, automated methods for schematisation are mostly restricted to straight lines. We present a generic framework for topology-preserving curved schematisation that allows a choice of quality measures and curve types. The framework fits a curve to every part of the input. It uses Voronoi diagrams to ensure that curves fitted to disjoint parts do not intersect. The framework then employs a dynamic program to find an optimal schematisation using the fitted curves. Our fully-automated approach does not need critical points or salient features. We illustrate our framework with Bézier curves and circular arcs. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"Algorithm; Curves; Schematisation; Topology preservation";"algorithm; automation; map; topology";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84881637118;1

These terrain visualisations should be more understandable for users without cartographic education, which are not familiar with contour lines. Within the study, two eye-tracking experiments and online questionnaire were used for investigating the difference between user cognition of classical two-dimensional (2D) visualisation with contour lines and perspective 3D view. Questionnaire was focused on maps understandability, suitability and aesthetics. Results of the questionnaire shows, that the majority of participants prefer 3D visualisation. First eye-tracking experiment was designed as a pair of maps in one stimulus. One shows 2D visualisation, the other 3D visualisation. No significant differences between user preferences of 2D and 3D visualisation were found, but the results were influenced with the order of the maps in the stimuli. Because of that another experiment was designed. In this case stimuli contained only one of two possible visualisations (2D and 3D). ScanPath comparison of this experiment results confirmed that users have different strategies for cognition of 2D and 3D visualisation, although statistically significant difference between both types of visualisation was found in the ScanPath length metric only. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"3D; Eye-tracking; Terrain; Visualisation";"cartography; map; terrain; three-dimensional modeling; two-dimensional modeling; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84881626870;1

However, little is known about whether the cube is truly efficient and effective to satisfactorily display complex movement datasets. The limited usability research that has been done did not lead to details on how the STC content should be designed and whether the cartographic design influences the exploration process. The conceptual framework that is proposed in this paper offers an approach to the evaluation of the STC content with special attention for design aspects and the environment in which the STC has to function. Systematic usability studies have to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the STC under different conditions. Therefore, the framework contains phased studies in which real-world data of four use cases of different complexity are used. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"Research framework; Space-time cube; Usability";"cartography; complexity; conceptual framework; data set; methodology; research";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84881622629;1

Such patterns depend on the spatial and temporal resolution of the available data. Here, we study a particular spatio-temporal pattern, namely, synchronisation, and how this is affected by different temporal resolutions and temporal heterogeneity. Twenty years of daily temperature data collected in 28 Dutch meteorological stations are used as case study. Given the complexity of the analysis, we propose a geovisual analytic approach based on self-organizing maps (SOMs). This approach allows exploring the data from two perspectives: (1) station-based, in which spatially synchronous weather stations are grouped into clusters; and (2) year-based, in which temporal synchronisation is analysed using a calendar year as basic unit and similar years are clustered. Clusters are identified using the SOM U-matrices and maps. Next, the spatial distribution of synchronous stations is displayed in the geographic space. Trend plots are used to illustrate trends in every cluster and the temperatures of stations and years are compared with the corresponding cluster representative values to identify anomalies in the temperature records. The analysis is repeated at daily, weekly and monthly resolutions to study the effects of different temporal resolutions on synchronisation. Also daily spatial synchronisation results for all years with those for groups of daily synchronous years are analysed to study the effects of temporal heterogeneity. Results show that synchronisation results are different at different temporal resolutions. Monthly results are the most stable ones both in station-based and year-based. It is also observed that spatial synchronisation results are simplified when considering temporal heterogeneity. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.";"Different temporal resolutions; Self-organizing maps; Synchronisation; Temporal heterogeneity";"map; self organization; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature anomaly; trend analysis; Netherlands";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84881618125;1

The forest map design is based on the use of individual tree data, which is detected from airborne laser scanning data and colour-infrared orthophotos. Several generalisation and symbolisation approaches have been tested in order to use the tree data set for cartographic purposes. Our generalisation method differentiates between trees in dense forests and tree structures in open areas, such as isolated trees, tree groups, tree rows and sparsely scattered trees. The tree symbols are integrated visually with the other map content. The results show that the production of attractive and useful maps requires an advanced generalisation method due to the massive amount of tree objects extracted from the laser scanning data as well as a generalisation level and a symbol type for the trees that are carefully chosen according to the map scale. Furthermore, sophisticated visualisation methods are needed for composing the maps. The created maps are part of a project that aims at supporting outdoor activities using multi-scale maps as part of a multi-publishing service. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"Cartographic generalisation; Map design; Multi-publishing; Point symbols; Tree detection";"cartography; data set; design; forest; lidar; map; orthophoto; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84875896408;1

Traditionally, conflation is being carefully carried out and evaluated by experts. Yet there are practices that involve occasional users who will look up the information in mobile devices without the intention of keeping a copy. Evaluation will be carried out? with different criteria, involving the Human Visual System and perhaps even the characteristics of the physical devices?as well. In this paper, we coin the term 'Ephemeral Conflation' to characterize that context and the procedures to evaluate it. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"Cartography; Conflation; Ephemeral cartography; Ephemeral conflation; Strong metrics; Weak metrics";"cartography; geometry; GIS; infrastructural development; spatial data";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84875886662;1

One such MS pattern is composed of a graph that uses spatial data to represent statistical data. A preliminary study revealed major problems with users' perceptions and understanding of the symbol. These problems present obstacles to the presentation objectives. We are therefore interested in studying the human factors that contribute to the visual perception of graph symbols. We predict that the graph symbols currently in use are too complex for viewers to fully understand what they are intended to represent. This research aims to study the mechanisms and behaviours of human visual perception that are necessary to understand cartography MSs and to determine a more effective prototype symbol that presents and conveys information to viewers more efficiently. The prototype design is based on a basic cartographic symbol and includes the characteristics and properties of the original patterns of graph symbols via a study of their pros and cons. Graphic structures and properties were modified to create a more effective symbol. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"Global visualisation; Location-based graph symbol; Multivariate symbol; Visual perception";"cartography; mapping; multivariate analysis; perception; spatial data; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84875885494;1

The said map contained comprehensive cartographic information on the forms of environmental protection and degradation, made to a scale of 1: 50 000. The thematic scope of the map has already been modified twice: in 1997 and in 2005, with the ensuing changes presented in corresponding manuals: Sozological Map on a Scale of 1: 50 000, in an Analogue and Digital Form (Chief National Geodesist, 1997) and Technical Guidelines GIS-4. Sozological Map of Poland, Scale of 1:50000, in an Analogue and Digital Form (2005). Many years' worth of experience gained since the launch of this cartographic system points out to the need for broadening the presented content and improving the map's scale. Thus, attempts have been made at rescaling the map to 1: 10 000. Increasing the degree of detail is particularly necessary for presenting areas of intensive human activity. In this paper, the authors propose technical and graphical solutions for the 1: 10 000 scale. ©The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"GIS; Sozological map; Thematic cartography";"cartography; digital map; environmental change; environmental degradation; environmental protection; GIS; thematic mapping; visualization; Poland";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84875882008;1

A compass and maps are the basic tools of orienteering, and orienteering requires specialized maps that have been adapted and standardized to guarantee fair competition. Mapmaking for orienteering has become a highly specialized cartographic task. This paper aims to answer three main questions: What is an orienteering map (o-map)? How should we categorize o-maps?

Furthermore, this information largely reflects the process of social development, which makes it valuable to both professional research and public awareness. However, this information cannot be easily expressed and visually utilized because it is often hidden in the text of historical books. Aiming to better realize the potential value of such abundant information derived from historical books and bridging the gap between historical research and geographic space, a feasible and appropriate approach is explored in this article, to guide the transforming process from historical books to historical maps. The hope is that providing the scenarios of historical events will benefit related historical and social research. First, the integral framework of the approach was introduced, and the detail of building the specific spatiotemporal framework for information matching was discussed. Based on the spatio-temporal framework, the specification for the representation of historical books was designed. By extracting the spatio-temporal data from historical books, organizing them according to the specification and matching them with the spatio-temporal framework, the scenarios of historical events in the book (e.g. wars, migration, diseases, natural disasters, mass movement, etc.) can be visually transformed into historical maps. As the most critical writing of the Chinese Twenty-Four Histories, the Records of the Grand Historian (also known as Shiji) was employed as an example to test the proposed approach. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"Historical book; Historical map; Shiji; Spatio-temporal data organisation; Spatio-temporal information extraction";"historical cartography; map; research; spatiotemporal analysis; textbook; China";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84875875565;1

We employ techniques that are centred around the concept of shape simplification and graph layout and that allow iterative abstraction of 2D maps. We use data from publicly available sources and show how we can iteratively generate aesthetic renditions of these maps. These renditions do not have the goal to allow for navigation tasks, but instead show the map data in a distorted manner. The techniques used to create these images apply simplification, abstraction/generalisation, and displacement operations to the map elements in varying orders and add stylistic shading to produce aesthetic renditions for print or electronic displays. The degree of abstraction/generalisation can be individually chosen and determines the characteristics of the distorted map: whether components retain their shape, degenerate, or are processed in a manner that the abstraction becomes the focus of the image rather than the underlying map data. The renditions can be further personalized by choosing shading and colours for this shading. Together, the presented techniques allow for playful and creative exploration of aesthetic renditions of 2D map data. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"Abstraction; And simplification; Generalisation; Illustrative rendering; Map stylisation; Non-photorealistic rendering (NPR)";"cartography; color; design; map";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84867634648;1

The central goal of this contribution is the development of a systematic and comprehensive framework that considers the particular properties of sound phenomena. This framework is structured according to the acoustic quantities that shall be represented and consists of recommendations for their cartographical encoding. A proof of concept is given through the application to official strategic noise maps in the course of the Environmental Noise Directive. Those maps suffer from several weaknesses from a cartographical point of view (e.g. concerning colour schemes or band-like illustrations) which can be eliminated by applying some of the mentioned recommendations. Finally, it will be possible to derive valuable knowledge from our results for multimodal encoding and value transformation between senses. © The British Cartographic Society 2013.;"Multimedia maps; Noise mapping; Phonometric tints; Sound visualisation";"acoustic method; cartography; map; mapping; noise; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84888793129;1

After a second sign viewing, this time without turn decisions, participants repeated the mapping task. For the first mapping task, participants who viewed signs with spatial information presented cartographically produced more topologically-accurate maps than those viewing conventional signs. These differences faded after the second sign viewing.

An online survey was created testing: (1) map readers' inclination to believe the data being shown on the four maps; (2) the impact the representations had on personal views regarding nuclear power; (3) map reader trust in the maps; (4) fondness for the maps; and (5) memorability of the maps (i.e. how likely a map would be recalled).

Cultural and language differences among multiple countries can hinder the exchange of information during dynamic emergency response. With increasing international threats and the explosion of near real-time data availability, the emergency response process has become mired in complex communication practices. Maps have the potential to provide an intuitive medium for communication and means for establishing situation awareness during emergency events. The development of map symbol standards is one method for improving communication efficiency.

The construction of a taxonomy of these basic interaction primitives is considered the 'grand challenge of interaction', as such taxonomies provide a consistent lexicon for describing map-based interaction strategies and interface designs, inform the design of scientific experiments to investigate the nature of cartographic interaction, and ultimately lead to design and use guidelines for interactive maps. The purpose of this research is not to offer a new framework of interaction primitives - as there are many in existence - but to organize and synthesize extant strategies for parsing interaction within Cartography and the related fields of Human-Computer Interaction, Information Visualisation, and Visual Analytics into a logical framework. Norman's stages of action model provides a useful foundation for conceptualizing interaction primitives, with organisation of extant taxonomies by the model resulting in three dominant approaches for parsing interaction: (1) an objective-based approach, compartmentalizing cartographic interaction according to the kinds of tasks the user may wish to complete with a cartographic interface; (2) an operator-based approach, compartmentalizing cartographic interaction according to the unique cartographic interfaces that make manipulation of a cartographic representation possible; and (3) an operand-based approach, compartmentalizing cartographic interaction according to characteristics of the digital/virtual object with which the user is interacting. Extant interaction primitive taxonomies representative of each of these three approaches are treated in turn, synthesizing key themes within each approach and identifying important concordances and discordances across the associated taxonomies. © The British Cartographic Society 2012.";"Cartographic interaction; Human-Computer Interaction; Information Visualisation; Interaction primitives; Interactive maps; Objectives; Operands; Operators; Stages of interaction; Visual Analytics";"cartogram; cartography; compartmentalization; computer system; conceptual framework; experimental design; mapping method; numerical model; visual analysis; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84874608555;1

Age, diabetes, macular degeneration, cataracts and glaucoma result in eye defects including an acquired form of CVD. Inherited CVD is marked by a difficulty in discerning red from green, while acquired CVD is marked by a difficulty in discerning blue from green. A recent review of the cartographic literature revealed a deficit in studies on accessible maps for readers with the acquired form of CVD. In addition, research on accessible maps for readers with the inherited form of CVD was restricted to the design or pre-publication stage. An approach is needed to render maps already in circulation accessible to an audience with CVD. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to provide the reader with some background on acquired and inherited CVD; second, to introduce a potential approach to improve the accessibility of maps post-publication. Image re-colouring is a method of altering an image's colour composition in such a way as to make it accessible to a colour vision deficient audience. An innovative algorithm is presented that produces a re-coloured map that can be perceived by both red-green (inherited) and blue-green (acquired) deficiencies. Although the algorithm has yet to be tested on human subjects, it performed well on an edge detection analysis. © The British Cartographic Society 2012.";"Image re-colouring; Inherited and acquired colour vision deficiencies; Map";"algorithm; cartography; eye disease; health status; heritability; image processing; literature review; map; mapping method; perception; vision";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84874598262;1

Galbraith's 1897 railway mail service training maps. Galbraith's maps make extensive use of humorous cartouches intended to serve as mnemonic devices for learning railway mail service routes. Poisson and quadrat point pattern analyses are performed on all eight maps in the series to determine whether the mimetic symbols are clustered along the railway mail routes or dispersed throughout the mapped spaces to achieve better graphic balance. Evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the placement of the mnemonic symbols was primarily driven by design considerations.

This paper discusses an IconMap-based visualisation technique that enables multiple geospatial variables be represented in a single raster layer. This is achieved by extending the conventional pixel-based image structure to the three-tiered iconic design. Thereby the spatial pattern generated by the interaction between multivariate geographic variables can be disclosed, and the goal of geospatial data mining is achieved. A visualisation case study on soil organic matter and nutrients for the Shuangliu County of Chengdu City, China, was performed using the proposed approach. The result shows that the static IconMap can better display the distribution tendency of the high-end and low-end soil organic matter and nutrients, and that the dynamic IconMap can both reflect the interaction between the organic matter and the nutrients variables, and display the soil fertility levels in a comprehensive way. Thus, the IconMap-based visualisation approach is a non-fused, exploratory analytical approach for multivariate data and valuable for visually analyse the soil fertility condition. © The British Cartographic Society 2012.;"Icon; IconMap; Multivariate geographic data; Soil nutrients; Visualisation";"data mining; GIS; image processing; multivariate analysis; pixel; raster; soil fertility; soil nutrient; soil organic matter; spatial data; visualization; Chengdu; China; Sichuan";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84867739314;1

However, a lot of people are not aware where administrative boundaries lie, limiting their appeal for educating the public on important issues such as poverty and inequality. This paper seeks to utilize a well-known cartographic map design, the London Underground map, to aid data dissemination of the complex issues surrounding inequality and deprivation in London. A discussion of the relevance of this approach to researching inequality in London, as well as how this fits in with previous approaches to mapping poverty is provided. An example using the recent release of the Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2010 shows the usefulness of this design.;"Cartography; London underground; Mapping poverty; Representation";"cartography; mapping; poverty; spatial data; England; London [England]; United Kingdom";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84867736653;1

The procedure requires a digital elevation model (DEM) and involves the following steps: visibility mask computation; the respective multidirectional altering of the azimuth and elevation angle; the generation of continuous grid MVIs that indicate upper/lower views, quasi-slope, and relative relief; and an appropriate visualisation of the relevant MVI as a standalone technique or in combination with standard hill-shaded relief.

A label placement method with an improved algorithmic efficiency is presented. Since this algorithm has an influence on the actual placement of the name labels on the map, it is tested if this efficient algorithms also creates more effective maps: how well is the information processed by the user. We tested 30 participants while they were working on a dynamic and interactive map display. Their task was to locate geographical names on each of the presented maps. Their eye movements were registered together with the time at which a given label was found. The gathered data reveal no difference in the user's response times, neither in the number and the duration of the fixations between both map designs. The results of this study show that the efficiency of label placement algorithms can be improved without disturbing the user's cognitive map. Consequently, we created a more efficient map without affecting its effectiveness towards the user. © The British Cartographic Society 2012.;"Eye tracking; Interactive maps; Label placement; User study";"algorithm; cognition; mapping; tracking";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84867733841;1

This work shows that TM is potentially advantageous in visualizing and querying imperfect time intervals, and its analytical power can be better exploited when it is implemented in a computer application with graphical user interfaces and interactive functions.

Virtual digital (3D) models play an important role in recent research and publications on cultural heritage. The globes discussed in this paper were made by Gerardus Mercator (1512-1594) in 1541 and 1551. Four techniques for the digital representation are discussed and analysed, all using high-resolution photographs of the globes. These photographs were taken under studio conditions in order to get equal lighting and to avoid unwanted light spots. These lighting conditions are important, since the globes have a highly reflective varnish covering. Processing these images using structure from motion, georeferencing of separate scenes and the combination of the photographs with terrestrial laser scanning data results in true 3D representations of the globes. Besides, pseudo-3D models of these globes were generated using dynamic imaging, which is an extensively used technique for visualisations over the Internet. The four techniques and the consequent results are compared on geometric and radiometric quality, with a special focus on their usefulness for distribution and visualisation during an exhibition in honour of the five hundredth birthday of Gerardus Mercator. © The British Cartographic Society 2012.;"3D modelling; Comparison; Globes; Keywords; Mercator; Virtual reality";"cultural heritage; digital mapping; historical cartography; image processing; photograph; three-dimensional modeling; virtual reality; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84862336936;1

Research in computer graphics has focused primarily on creating illustrations with cross-hatching that conforms to the three dimensional surface of virtual objects. Cross-hatched shadow maps apply cross-hatching to shadowed areas, with the length of these hatching lines based on the distance shadows are cast from point illumination sources at a number of discrete inclinations above the horizon. Thickness of lines increase within areas remaining shadowed at greater inclinations.

In accordance with the level of geographical knowledge, map scales and technical possibilities of the time, Mercator provided a relatively detailed depiction of basic geographical features on these maps. His interest in mapping Croatia was probably motivated by the fact that the Venetian Republic, the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire had fought over this area in the sixteenth century, contributing to the fragmentation of the medieval Croatian State, while at the same time facilitating economic, religious, linguistic, artistic and scientific communication between Central, South East and Mediterranean Europe. Mercator paid special attention to toponyms that enabled geographical objects to be identified and the decoding of cartographic contents. Research into Mercator's maps has shown that geographical names, among other things, clearly indicate the sources of spatial data that he used. Additionally, geographical names on Mercator's maps are significant indicators of the linguistic and cultural contacts that were particularly prominent in border areas, for example, along the eastern Adriatic coast, or the courses of the Danube, Sava and Drava. © The British Cartographic Society 2012.;"Cartography; Croatia; Mercator; Toponym";"cartography; map; mapping; Ottoman empire; toponymy; Croatia";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84862315147;1

To resolve these issues, several alternatives reducing the problem or enhancing pattern detection have been suggested. Despite being successful in some aspects, they have their shortcomings such as partial representation or misrepresentation of geographical movement and difficulty in interpreting visualized results. In addition, flow mapping functionality has yet to be fully implemented in modern geographic information systems (GIS) applications. Given these problems, this paper proposes the new designed symbols for improving the traditional flow mapping and develops a flow mapping module implementing them within a commercial GIS software package. Application results demonstrated that the developed module can represent gross, net, two-way and location-specific flows from a single dataset efficiently and can make better flow maps with the alternative symbols. The alternative symbols successfully reduced the visual overlap of symbols and improved the estimation of values. ©The British Cartographic Society 2012.;"Alternative symbols; Geographic information systems (GIS); Geographical movement; Tobler's Flow Mapper; Traditional flow mapping";"data set; estimation method; GIS; mapping; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84862309451;1

Detecting geometric conflicts, existing within an individual polygon and between polygons, is a primary step for polygon generalisation. This paper designs an inward-outward-buffering approach to detect narrow conflicts within an individual polygon. The approach not only detects the existence of narrow sections but also indicates their exact locations inside polygons. Another approach is presented to detect proximity conflicts in between polygons with two main steps. The first step associates buffering with an optimized proximity index to explore possible polygon clusters and spatial contexts around a problematic polygon. Based on the detected polygon clusters, the conflict regions are identified by combining outward-inward-buffering with topological operators. The tests with a real landuse dataset and two maps from other papers demonstrate that the presented approaches not only detect geometric conflict effectively, but also provide useful information for the selection of subsequent generalisation operators. © The British Cartographic Society 2012.;"Buffering; Geometric conflict detection; Narrow conflict; Polygonal map generalisation; Proximity conflict";"data set; design method; geometry; mapping; optimization; polygon; spatial data; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84863355498;1

An appreciation of map design and the aesthetic underpins our fascination with how each and every mark works to create a display with a specific purpose. Yet debates about what constitutes design and what value it has in map-making persist. This is particularly acute in the modern map-making era as new tools, technology, data and approaches make map-making a simpler process in some respects, yet make designing high-quality maps difficult to master in others. In the first part of a two-part paper, we explore what we mean by map design and how we might evaluate it and apply it in a practical sense. We consider the value of aesthetics and also discuss the role of art in cartography taking account of some recent debates that we feel bring meaning to how we think about design. Our intent here is to reassert some of the key ideas about map design in cartography and to provide a reference for the second part of the paper where we present the results of a survey of cartographers.

Also it was verified what user's attributes influence the performance. To achieve this, a quantitative statistical analysis with a random user sample was held, with tests carried out remotely. Results showed that previous map experience and higher educational levels may influence positively the manipulation of the interface and that there is not a clear indication that the presence of the spatial analysis tools analysed had a positive influence on the tasks' results. For the other side, users that choose to use these tools had significantly better performance than those who did not use them. © The British Cartographic Society 2012.;"Evaluation; Interactive web maps; Spatial analysis tools; Use and user research";"mapping; performance assessment; quantitative analysis; spatial analysis; statistical analysis";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84858730207;1

In the second part of our paper to reassert the relevance of design in cartography, we present the results of a survey of cartographic experts drawn from the academic and professional world. The survey asked participants to present their top ten most expertly designed maps from throughout history. Here, we share the most frequently cited maps that emerged from that survey and describe why they exhibit design excellence. By showing map-makers a range of high-quality cartographic work, we aim to provide exemplars that demonstrate how design affects a map and expertly marries form with function. The techniques on display are well executed and create products that are both well suited to their purpose and have an aesthetic quality that invites people to take notice. They are all, in their own ways, beautiful examples of the art of design in cartography. We have deliberately avoided a 'top ten' approach and, instead, offer three examples in a range of map categories. The examples are neither definitive, nor exhaustive and should act as a starting point to explore design in cartography from those who have managed to set the bar high. © The British Cartographic Society 2012.;"Aesthetics; Cartography; Design";"cartography; design method; esthetics; mapping method; theoretical study";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84858728705;1

The earliest approaches focused on static visualisations, several of them with great success (Monmonier, 1990; Friendly, 2002; Tufte, 2006). With the digital age, dynamic and animated maps have become possible. Much work has gone in to the design and study of perception of both of these map types (Harrower et al., 2000; Midtbø, 2001a; Midtbø et al., 2007; Fabrikant et al., 2008) Several very effective animated maps have been developed and rigorously evaluated. Both static and animated visualisations have their distinct qualities. Static maps are able to provide the user with unlimited viewing time of the information, allowing the level of detail to be high. On the other hand, static maps do not have the intuitiveness of visualizing temporal information due to their inherent static nature. Animated maps are often more intuitive in their representation of temporal information. Displaying frames of information in rapid succession is perceived as more intuitive representation of the temporal information. However, the fact that the frames have a very limited viewing time often hinders the user from perceiving and gaining knowledge from the information (Harrower, 2009). There has been a sharp distinction between animated and static maps in cartography. Evaluation of either two has been following this distinction and often compared animated against static maps. In this article, we propose moving beyond the sharp distinction of animated and static maps by combining the qualities of both in one new representation method. To emphasize the concept's qualities from both static and animated maps, we call this concept, semistatic animations. The core idea of the concept is to make all information visually available to the user at any given time of the animation. This allows the user to look both back and forth in the animation, while it is playing without interaction. The design draws inspiration from both static multiple map displays and diagram maps - qualities from both of these are integrated in an animated representation. A proof-of-concept implementation has been made using weather map animations. In order to assess the perceptual performance of the concept, a web experiment has been conducted. Realizing that the maps do not necessarily support all usage scenarios, a task-oriented approach was applied on the experiment. In total, the experiment included 240 participants. Results from the experiment revealed that the semistatic concept significantly increases the performance on several of the tasks compared to the equivalent traditional animated map. However, for some of the tasks, the semistatic approach did not improve the performance, or worsened it. This illustrates the importance of evaluating not only on a general level but delve further in different user tasks. The results obtained additionally motivates for further investigation of the semistatic concept as well as user behaviour. © The British Cartographic Society 2012.";"Animations; Cartographic animations; Cartography; Static and dynamic integration; Visualisation";"cartography; design method; diagram; experimental design; implementation process; performance assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; static response; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84858719231;1

The work for this Carte de Cabinet was carried out by artillerists under the guidance of count Joseph de Ferraris, who was commissioned for the task by the Habsburg government. At the time that the map was designed, no modern legend was included. This paper tries to fill that gap by presenting a legend that was constructed more systematically than any of its predecessors.

We argue that in this influential text, Tolkien offers a fictional exploration of sustainability. Combining an application of Geographic Information System techniques with textual analysis and interpreting text and spatial data in conjunction, we show that there is a systematically varying distance between our real world and the physical features of Tolkien's ""Secondary World"", as regards climate and vegetation patterns. There is an emphasis on land degeneration, a ""missing forest problem"" which prompts a closer look at the role of woods and trees in Tolkiens work.

While charting this affair between Norway and one of its national cultural treasures, this article also exposes the transmission of an aesthetic heritage. Network visualisations of the Nordic productions of Et dukkehjem reveal an unbroken connection between productions of the play from 1879 to 1991. Oral transmission of production knowledge concerning canonical texts is commonplace in most national theatres, but this is the first study to document the phenomenon within the interpretative history of a single play.

This characterisation applies both in terms of its dissemination and in terms of its narrative subject matter. How crime fiction novels convey local, touristic and geographical knowledge throughout the world, modify it, and create topographical fiction, is described. The maps of cities, countries and neighbourhoods that provide a pictorial element to crime fiction novels are symptomatic of the transformation of the genre from a literature of crime into a literature of geographical and cultural orientation. The evolution of the genre makes possible the drafting of a crime fiction world map in order to examine the international range, examples of gaps and significant clusters. A crime fiction atlas can, in addition to this, form a collection of fictitious and narrative descriptions of localities. © The British Cartographic Society 2011.;"Crime fiction; Crime novel; Internationality; Literature";"crime; esthetics; literature review; mapping; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84255186077;1

Which culture is it then, one wonders, that reveals itself through a reading of Håkan Nesser's Inspector Van Veeteren series? Unlike Mankell's Wallander, who generally operates within the greater Ystad area in southern Sweden, Van Veeteren lives and works in a geographically unspecific location somewhere in Northern Europe, coded with place names reminiscent mainly of Flanders and The Netherlands but also incorporating references in the form of personal names and geographical denotations that could best be described as pan- European. Whereas the specificity of place is integral to - arguably even the defining characteristic of - the crime novels of Swedish writers such as Mankell, Sjöwall-Wahlöö, Liza Marklund and others, Nesser invents the fictional town of Maardam and its surroundings for the settings of his Van Veeteren stories. Where Nesser's stated aim in locating his novels in fictional settings is a stripping of geographical connotation in order to create possibilities for readers to engage in their own poetic practice of image-creation - one neither based on nor burdened by geographical knowledge or accuracy, we find some of these readers compelled towards acts of compensatory cartography that reflect a drive to establish an environmental orientation even within geographically indeterminate literary worlds. Nesser speaks of a reading group formed around another of his novels, 'Kim Novak Never Swam in Genesaret's Lake' ['Kim Novak badade aldrig i Genesarets sjö'], whose members 'sketched out maps and sent them to me. ""Is this what it looks like?"" they wondered'. This article explores the ways in which these texts initiate reflection on the nature of the relationship between fictional texts and the 'real' world from which they simultaneously emerge and ontologically differ; the function of geographical indeterminacy in Nesser's crime fiction as a whole; and evaluate the author's stated claims about precisely what 'freedoms' such indeterminacy allows - both from the perspective of an aesthetics of production, as well as for those readers seeking to orient themselves in fictional worlds. © The British Cartographic Society 2011.";"Cartography; Crime fiction; Geography; Håkan nesser; Literature; Space; Sweden; Van veeteren";"crime; esthetics; geographical knowledge; literature review; visualization; Liza";Review;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84255186073;1

This paper provides an overview of an extensive systematic evaluation of the literary space and proposes a practical implementation of literary spatial data into a database. In this process, specific properties of literary spaces are identified: the narrated spaces are fragmentary; they have vague boundaries and are often hard to localize, if at all. Furthermore, they can be transformed and remodelled by the author and can be linked to any time period. Considering these properties of fictional data, it becomes clear that visualisation of inherent uncertainty is necessary. The main challenge of this research is developing appropriate visualisation methods that visually satisfy those above-mentioned inherent rules of individual literary places. Therefore, visualisation methods for several specific properties are suggested and subsequently implemented to allow automatic map generation. © The British Cartographic Society 2011.";"Cartographic information system; Literary cartography; Literary geography; Uncertainty visualisation; Vagueness";"cartography; information system; interdisciplinary approach; literature review; research work; spatial analysis; uncertainty analysis; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84255186062;1

This theory is then applied to maps which are both reproduced within and generated by Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons (1930): an adventure novel for children which is predicated upon a conflation of actual and imagined geographies. The article goes on to propose that the critical understanding of the processual intertextuality of literary cartographies might be further enhanced by the use of a suite of geo-location technologies; and, ultimately, it suggests that the future of critical literary cartography might be founded, at least in part, upon in-the-field digital mapping practices. © The British Cartographic Society 2011.";"Arthur Ransome; Authorial and reader-generated mappings; Critical literary geography; Digital mapping practices; Lake District; Literary fieldwork; Processual intertextuality";"cartography; digital mapping; interdisciplinary approach; literature review; research work; theoretical study; Hirundinidae";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84255176122;1

Apart from the presentation of the specific locations and spatial distribution of literary places, we are also interested in the spatial pattern such places form, the boundaries that separate the literarily populated from the void regions and the varying density of the literary space. From a GIS point of view, the elements of the literary space correspond to point, line and area data types. However, the established method used to calculate the spatially varying density-the method of density estimation-is restricted to point data only. In this paper, we will present an improved method that is able to estimate the density regardless of the underlying data type. Our approach aims at adopting the typically radially symmetric kernel function to approximate also linear and areal features. We claim that this method treats point, line and area data in a consistent way by taking equivalent density contributions into account. The different steps of the improved method can visually be examined by the accompanying map examples. © The British Cartographic Society 2011.;"Cartographic visualisation; Density estimation; Kernel function; Literary geography";"cartography; estimation method; literature review; mapping; spatial distribution; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84255160613;1

The New Base Map project has been launched in order to produce a flow line for topographic maps from a vector geographic database, and decrease costs of topographic map production. The project aims also to automate the extraction of contour lines, and take advantage of the high-resolution digital terrain model (DTM) data recently available in the agency. These data come from automatic correlation, or they are produced using new sensors (lidar or radar). The highresolution DTM is a breakthrough to extract cartographic elements such as the cartographic contour lines, the points of mountain pass and the summits. In a precedent paper, we presented a research for producing cartographic contour lines from DTM. Since then, the method has been developed and implemented at the IGN in order to have a production tool for the contour lines. The first part of this paper provides technical details regarding the extraction of contour lines with the problems resolved during the implementation. The second part will introduce our method for extracting the mountain pass and summits from high-resolution DTM.

The idea behind a multi-publishing service is that the service is able to deliver different kinds of outdoor maps through a number of channels and at varying scales and designs from a single data core. The data core utilizes integrated data sources, including the Finnish topographic and map databases of the National Land Survey of Finland, as well as datasets from the Nuuksio National Park test environment of the Finnish Geodetic Institute, including high-resolution orthophotos and digital terrain models based on airborne laser scanning (LIDAR). In contrast to traditional national park cartography, the multi-publishing framework sets new challenges for the map design. The paper summarizes the design process and gives examples of the in-house developed map design for so-called Topographic, Relief, Forest, Orthophoto and Winter maps.

In some cases, photos are precisely mapped as texture onto the geometric model, which then renders a realistic impression of the underlying environment. In other cases, the models are visualized in a more abstract way. This paper is dedicated to investigating the relation of level of abstraction, information density and storage capacity for the representation of a 3D city model. Increasing the level of abstraction usually leads to the decrease of information density to be processed. Accordingly, the general storage capacity will decrease as well. Since a higher level of abstraction is less bound to photorealistic aspects, it may allow further semantic information to be accommodated in the visualisation process. If the level of abstraction in a city model increases in a well-controlled way so that the characteristic features are enhanced while non-relevant information is inhibited, the user's cognitive load during task completion may be reduced. This implies an increased efficiency of information communication. Using image segmentation algorithms, the elements within a façade per unit of area are successively reduced while preserving the characteristic structures within the image. The segmented image holds the sufficient information to be recognized in the environment. We treat the three concepts, level of abstraction, information density and storage capacity, as fundamental variables for the visualisation of building facades. To deal with these concepts, we organizing them on a continuum, which enables us to find a tradeoff between a potential loss of information and the level of usage for various tasks. © The British Cartographic Society 2011.;"3D modelling; City models; Perception";"algorithm; geometry; information processing; perception; three-dimensional modeling; typology; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-79959493891;1

This paper explores the suitability of this approach as a hermeneutic for stylistic diversity, the persistence of nationally-specific conventions and problems of symbol standardisation. After reviewing earlier treatments of map language as analogy and metaphor in cartographic theory, we consider the construction of cartographic meaning and its role within a semiological system and suggest how variations in denotation and connotation allow a deeper understanding of the cultural significance of state topographic map symbologies. In treating topographic cartography as a natural visual language for communicating place, a new paradigm is proposed through which problems of international collaboration concerning the portrayal of transnational landscapes (especially at larger map scales) may be approached and potentially overcome.© The British Cartographic Society 2011.;"Cartographic language; Cartographic style; Europe; INSPIRE; Symbol standardisation; Topographic maps";"cartography; map; standardization; topographic mapping; Europe";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-79958134757;1

The commonest strategy to do so consists in displaying visual information in a hierarchical way that is, making it some elements to appear as being more important than others. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that people also pay attention to configurational information, or information about relationships among elements appearing in a map, to retrieve hierarchical information of it. This is the topic of this paper. It aims to investigate the role of metric and configurational information in enabling people to retrieve hierarchical information from maps. The main problem consisted in identifying 'the main street' of different layouts whose paths were sometimes widened to make them appear more important. The main findings show that people retrieved hierarchical information by paying attention to a combination of metric and configurational factors. One of the main challenges that cartographers face is to transmit information in a way that is simple to understand for everyone. The most frequent strategy for this is to display the information in a hierarchical way; that is, by exaggerating the size or width of specific elements and thus assigning them a greater degree of importance. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that when reading maps, people also read configurational information. This is the topic of this paper.

The symbols used in situation maps in this kind of an environment should be culturally independent and value-free in order to be properly understood. However, designing culturally independent symbols is difficult because the cultural background of an individual is complex and influences the interpretation of symbols in many ways. In this paper, we discuss the influences of different cultural background factors on both the design and the comprehension of map symbols. Cultural influences are considered as conventions in code systems, definitions in formal and informal conceptual models, and conventions in aesthetic judgments. As examples in the discussion, we use findings from a symbol design project for situation maps in international crisis management. © 2010 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.;"aesthetics; code systems; cultural influence; map symbols; symbol design; symbol testing";"cartography; conceptual framework; crisis management; design method; esthetics; map generalization; map graphics";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-78650557541;1

This study evaluated the benefits of a sonification extension to ArcGIS which represented the positional accuracy of address locations using piano notes. The approach was assessed by 49 survey participants via a computer-based task and subsequent discussion. Two factors that influenced successful interpretation were the proportion of values requiring detection and the presentation method. Knowledge of the data source also appeared relevant.

The study described in this paper was conducted as part of ongoing research projects aiming to develop mobile and web applications for outdoor activities. The research describes the aims of finding new kinds of ways of communicating spatial information, even to those who are visually impaired, and, in general, to provide map users with a profounder use experience. The paper reviews previous studies and describes the sonic map implementations accomplished to date. The implementation examples presented cover a hiking use case in a national park.

The data that are contributed to VGI projects do not comply with standard spatial data quality assurance procedures, and the contributors operate without central coordination and strict data collection frameworks. However, similar to the area of open source software development, it is suggested that the data hold an intrinsic quality assurance measure through the analysis of the number of contributors who have worked on a given spatial unit. The assumption that as the number of contributors increases so does the quality is known as 'Linus' Law' within the open source community. This paper describes three studies that were carried out to evaluate this hypothesis for VGI using the OpenStreetMap dataset, showing that this rule indeed applies in the case of positional accuracy. © 2010 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.;"Linus' Law; OpenStreetMap; positional accuracy; spatial data quality; volunteered geographical information";"accuracy assessment; cartography; data acquisition; data quality; data set; GIS; mapping method; positioning system; software; spatial data";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-78650534933;1

This process of generalisation necessarily requires us to handle large volumes of data which results in high processing overheads. One way of managing this is to partition the data. When geographically partitioning data, we need to partition in such a way that each partition can be generalized without having to consider regions outside any given partition. The focus of this paper is to explore partitioning and generalisation methodologies that can be applied to digital elevation data - the ambition being to derive generalized descriptions of morphology at the National Scale (for the UK). The paper describes and compares two solutions to this problem, and demonstrates how it is possible to apply generalisation algorithms to national coverages. © 2010 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.;"generalisation; landscape visualisation; morphology; partitioning";"algorithm; cartography; data set; digital elevation model; landscape; map generalization; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-78650531206;1

In traditional raster methods, the buffer target is traced and scanned using a 'brush', the width of which is equal to the buffer distance. During this process, the brushed raster grids are marked. Then by carrying out dynamic calculation on these marked grids, the buffer zone, constituted of grids, would be generated. Finally, the desired boundary of the buffer zone could be obtained through vectorisation. Considering the obvious drawbacks of raster data in computing efficiency and storage capacity, this paper puts forward the idea of storing raster data by means of run-length encoding, on which the raster-based operations are carried out. In order to improve the spatial precision, the borderlines of each run-length unit are recorded in the data of real type. The tests and analyses indicate that this algorithm has integrated advantages with respect to time complexity, space complexity and computational accuracy. © The British Cartographic Society 2010.;"buffer construction; geographic information system; run-length brush calculation algorithm; run-length encoding";"accuracy assessment; algorithm; buffer zone; data processing; GIS; numerical method; precision; raster; vector";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-77958191959;1

Owing to the mainly three-dimensional perception of people, this technique, in print as well as on screen, offers the possibility to introduce autostereoscopic, i.e. three-dimensional views in cartography. On the basis of true 3D, it has already found its way into the visualisation of relief relations. Moreover, it also opens perspectives for the more widespread products of thematic cartography (thematic maps). Multi-layered representation becomes possible on the basis of three-dimensional or sequentially differentiated depictions of spatial phenomena. Thus, several parameters or dimensions of cartographic content can be displayed at the same time.

The character of mountain environments lends itself particularly well to the panoramic representation which creates aesthetically pleasing representations that have become the de facto standard for trail mapping in ski resorts. Using them for navigating on mountain is not always easy since conditions, map perspective, orientation and the illustrative form often make reading the map awkward. Here, an alternative to the traditional trail map is designed by reducing a mountain and its trails to topological primitives. Harry Beck's famous London Underground provided inspiration to depict ski trails as a schematic network for the primary purpose of navigation. The schematic map illustrates the 176 trails in Breckenridge, CO, USA, derived from GPS tracklogs and incorporates a range of other datasets and a panoramic inset to provide context. The map has been tested at Breckenridge ski resort and results of this usability study are reported showing that there is value in this alternative way of depicting ski resorts though the panoramic style is well established, trusted and unlikely to face serious competition from alternative approaches. © The British Cartographic Society 2010.;"navigation; panoramas; schematic maps; ski resort mapping; trail maps";"cartography; data set; esthetics; GPS; map graphics; mapping method; mountain environment; navigation";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-77958169099;1

The pressure to reduce production cost in particular hassled to the development and use of new approaches. Traditionally, separate datasets and models have been used to produce topographic maps of different scales and even the sources of data often differ. As a consequence, the derived datasets on different scales are usually inconsistent and thus cannot be updated in a common process. With the transition to GIS-based cartography, these disadvantages will be overcome. The research and development presented here have been carried out within an application-oriented research project of the University of Zurich in cooperation with the company Axes Systems. The focus has been on improving automated generalisation for topographic map production. A multiple representation database with extended linkage information was first implemented. These so-called vertical relations enable the storage of meta-information, which is needed to make the generalisations used during incremental updates. Second, a data model of horizontal relations was developed, to model contextual information explicitly. Examples of applications are the subdivision and partition of datasets, and the modelling of feature groups. Third, a service-oriented architecture was established, enabling a platform-independent development and the provision of generalisation functionality. In addition, an embedded workflow management system was introduced, consisting of a workflow editor and workflow engine, to support the interactive configuration of the generalisation process and the automated execution of generalisation services. © The British Cartographic Society 2010.;"map generalisation; multiple representations; relation modelling; web services; workflow management";"cartography; data set; GIS; map generalization; modeling; research and development; topographic mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-77958168841;1

Mapping of coastal areas has often been unreliable, inconsistent and a low priority. One feature which has been mapped periodically is the line of the high and low water lines of the tides. Tidal line mapping has periodically been carried out by the Ordnance Survey throughout the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries; data were largely recorded using land survey techniques. The Ordnance Survey was legally obliged to map and print the tidal lines of coastal areas as they represented the seaward edge of the parish boundary. Tidal lines are transient features and were often difficult, if not dangerous to record in the field. As a result, from 1947 onwards, the Ordnance Survey experimented with photogrammetric techniques in an attempt to improve the consistency and reduce the costs of tidal surveys. This paper reviews the mapping of tidal lines and in particular discusses the evolution and development of photogrammetric mapping techniques by the Ordnance Survey as applied to tidal line surveying. © The British Cartographic Society 2010.";"coastal cartography; geomorphology; high-water mark; low-water mark; photogrammetry; stereo-plotting; tidal survey";"cartography; coastal morphology; data set; geomorphology; mapping; nineteenth century; photogrammetry; stereo image; twentieth century";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-77958160224;1

It has two main types, i.e. distance cartogram and area cartogram. Area cartogram is a transformed map in which areas are resized in proportion to an attribute value. A number of techniques have been developed for the generation of area cartograms. Some researchers consider cartogram as a very effective technique for visualisation of spatial data, while others doubt about the effectiveness because of the possible distortion in shape and/or disconnectivity in topology. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of area cartogram for visualizing spatial data. In this study, two comparative experiments have been conducted. One is the comparison between thematic maps and cartograms, and the other is the comparison among different types of area cartogram. Two sets of data with different characteristics are used, i.e. 2005 China population data and 1996 US election data. Results show that cartogram is more effective in the representation of the 1996 US election data which provides a qualitative result (i.e. in binary form or nominal data), but thematic map is far more effective in the representation of 2005 China population data which provides a quantitative result (in classes or ordinal data). It is also found that among different types of area cartogram, pseudo-cartogram is the most preferred technique and Dorling cartogram is the least preferred one. © The British Cartographic Society 2010.;"area cartogram; effectiveness; spatial representation";"cartogram; conference proceeding; data set; geographical distribution; spatial data; thematic mapping; visualization";Conference Paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-77953896043;1

B. R. King and F. W. Shotton remotely generated water supply maps at a scale of 1:50∈000 for coastal areas of northern France eastward from the Cherbourg peninsula to Calais: The first series of British groundwater development potential maps. These maps guided drilling of at least 30 boreholes, needed to supply water to British installations in Normandy following the Allied landings that commenced on D-Day, 6 June 1944: Part of the infrastructure necessary to facilitate the ensuing mobile campaign. Additionally, between April and September 1944, Shotton and King assisted by the Cambridge academic Maurice Black similarly compiled maps but 1:250∈000 in scale for northern France eastwards from Brittany into Belgium. These guided emplacement of at least 20 Royal Engineer boreholes in Belgium during late 1944 and early 1945, part of the infrastructure for the final advance of Allied troops into Germany. Between November 1944 and May 1945, maps also at 1:250∈000 and of similar but developing style were prepared for much of northern Germany by W. R. Williams and J. R. Foster-Smith, also temporary Royal Engineers officers but of the Inter-Service Topographical Department, easing the pressure of work on Shotton and his colleagues generated by campaign momentum. One of these maps guided emplacement of the few British boreholes sited in western Germany by May 1945, as the war in Europe came to an end. Overall, British military maps were innovations distinct in style from water supply maps compiled for contemporary German or US forces.

On one side, advocates of a free data policy have been vocal in their criticism of the current model and claim significant additional social and economic value would be generated from free map data. On the other, Ordnance Survey has had to defend such criticism due to the requirement for cost-recovery its status as a Trading Fund demands.

Not surprisingly, actual maps or at least remarkably detailed layouts of the geographical framework play a significant role. In other words, counterfactual spaces can be mapped with words or cartographic symbols; they can be both told and visualized.

Seven Poor Men of Sydney is held to be one of the most accurate and vivid representations of Sydney in modern Australian literature, but by focusing attention on where action actually takes place in the novel, this paper argues for a more nuanced understanding of Stead's literary geography. It shows how only a relatively small part of Sydney is actually described and how imprecisely described and vague locales occupy more textual space than the city itself, thereby throwing into contention accepted understandings of the relationship between Stead and her fictional settings. © 2009 The British Cartographic Society.;"Christina Stead; Literary geography; Seven Poor Men of Sydney; Sydney";"geographical knowledge; literature review; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-77949472033;1

Such excentric space is shot through with other spaces functioning in relation to and interaction with other spaces. In addition, these new spaces both produce and are produced by our active and continuous interchanges with sophisticated technologies in real time and virtual time, which themselves constitute spaces that are unbounded, heterogeneous and fluid, making spatial orientation indeterminate and jagged, ruled by chance and contingency. How can such territories be mapped? What do these cartographies of the future tell us about our present technosocial world? What relationship between the map and its territory do they suggest? That is what this contribution discusses by examining Mehretu's high-velocity urban charts which not only embody these indeterminate, jagged and indeed chaotic facets of spatial orientation and situatedness. Despite their bleakness and the uncertain future emerging from these hybrid fragmented maps, the stor(ies) they tell suggest poetic ways for agents to create new sensibilities and sensualities that do not rely on consumerism or consumption but evoke the potential for collective action and social change. © 2009 The British Cartographic Society.;"Cartographic art; Cognition; Diagrams; Fragmentation; Hybridity; Multidimensionality; Psychogeography; Technosocial spaces";"cartography; collective action; map; social change; spatial cognition; territory";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-77949464869;1

He plots the journeys, bicycles, boats, planes and his two feet provide him mobility, and geography is the precept, all of which are mediated by the communication infrastructure. Land, water, air and the engineered environment of places determine the routes, are the medium within which his body moves and are the settings where he performs his traces. Time, location and established measurement standards, along with geodetic models, radio signals, software, the language of culture and place, encode the narrative voice. GPS is his cartographic rendering tool: it is what points, traces, locates and recounts. Cartography is his narrative mode: it is that which conveys his personal narrative. This article is about a series of conversations mediated by telephone, Skype, email and online chat functions. We discussed Wood's personal cartographies, how these journeys tell him where he is, has been and potentially where he is going. These are personal cartographies, the result of individual journeys that he is assembling. His GPS tracings make us privy to his personal data, which tell us something about him while questions about science, cartography and technology also become conspicuous. The focus is on the Data Cloud outdoor installation, the Meridian performance and Lawn Mowing experiments. Wood's work is playful, yet it also critically foregrounds the fallacy of technological accuracy and the imprecision of stories. Where he is and where things are positioned are inaccurate from a GPS point of view, since GPS is engineered imprecision. This lack of specificity changes the location of things in space ever so slightly, but just enough to confound physical reality as we see in the Data Clouds outdoor installation. However, are stories ever definitive accounts of an experience? And what of the models by which we understand the world? What if we are between spatial models and some spaces are nowhere to be seen? Does that mean the place does not exist? What does it mean to be there but lost in space? What does it mean for a place to exist in the first place? His Meridian performance of the Herman Melville quote 'It is not down in any map; true places never are' elucidates this special conundrum in both literal and metaphorical terms. He traces the words along two meridians drawn according to two different but scientifically approved mathematical models of the earth, GMT and GRS80. Ironically, true places are written in Greenwich Park, the very same location where time and space were established as a standard in 1884. © 2009 The British Cartographic Society.";"Art; GPS; Personal cartographies";"accuracy assessment; art; cartography; GPS; map; numerical model; positioning; precision";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-77949457233;1

Architectural projects begin with sketches at a synoptic scale, which are gradually converted into detailed plans. Maps are generalized from detailed geographic data. Cartographers make intentional use of 'subjective' methods; however, they try to avoid too high a degree of subjectivity during the map design process by applying predefined design rules. The architectural designing process is influenced by the personal interpretation of the architect for the building task. The process then becomes more and more objective, taking regulations, structures, building technologies, etc., into account. Evidently, both cartography and architecture deal with contrary levels of scale and precision. Reversing scale and precision leads to a paradox.

In the age of mobile technology, maps are still very useful in a wide range of mobile applications such as logistic fleet management, navigation, tourist guide and so on. The traditional map design, however, is not suitable for display in mobile devices due to the restricted capability such as low processing power, limited storage, limited input capability and the small display area. Therefore, this research aims to design a map for effective display on mobile devices. In this study, a number of cartographic and technical constraints of mobile maps are considered. Cartographically, the map content has to be simplified vertically between different map scales and horizontally in each map scale according to users' cognition so as to make maps appropriate for small-screen display. Content zooming has been employed as a key technique. This is developed from the notion of how map users obtain the information in a textual address (i.e. separating the information piece by piece from general to detailed). On the other hand, progressive map visualisation, such as that deployed by Google Maps, is also applied to further increase the readability after content simplification. A prototype has been developed and an evaluation of the system has also been conducted. Results show that this system is very effective for production of mobile-based mapping products. © 2009 The British Cartographic Society.;"Mobile; Navigation; Zooming";"cartography; map graphics; mapping method; mobile communication; navigation; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-77949479192;1

Accordingly the generalization should be conducted while taking into account all the contour lines over the map, bearing in mind the three-dimensional object that they represent. The algorithm presented in this paper smoothes the contour line irregularities that generate flat and erroneous triangles in a Delaunay triangulation.

This study acquired 27 land use\land cover maps for the Valley or the urban portions of the Valley. Those maps vary greatly in their mapping parameters. The objectives of this study were to first conduct a cartographic comparison of the differences in the creation and content of the maps and then do an analysis of the urban changes in the Valley based upon the maps. The maps for the Valley have differed in their source materials, the amount of field work involved, scale and minimum mapping units, classifications used, definitions of classes and coordinate systems. Source materials have included various scales and formats of aerial photography and different satellite systems. The most difficult issue in comparing the maps is the varied classification systems and definitions. The same feature will be classified differently from map to map. This is particularly an issue for institutional features such as temples, palaces, educational facilities, open public space and governmental sites. Definitions of residential areas are also not consistent. Even with the differences in mapping parameters, considerable useful information can be obtained by comparing these maps. These include a simply documentation of the urban extent and the generally resulting loss in agricultural lands. There was an increase in urban extent from 22 to 83km2 between 1955 and 2000. Urban expansion has also changed from occurring on the upland river terraces or tars to the floodplains. Finally, while not directly documented in these maps, the tremendous pace of urban growth has resulted in multiple infrastructure and environmental challenges. © 2009 The British Cartographic Society.;"Cartography; Kathmandu; Land use; Mapping; Nepal; Urbanisation";"aerial photography; cartography; geological mapping; land cover; land use; mapping method; urban area; urbanization; Kathmandu Valley; Nepal";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-77949437660;1

This paper describes an investigation to classify and analyse stylistic diversity in the official 1: 50 000 topographical mapping of 20 European countries. The method involves the construction of a typology of cartographic style, based upon the classification of distinct graphical legend symbols into mutually exclusive thematic categories. In order to identify stylistic similarities between national symbologies, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to compare the relative proportions of symbols within each category. This was complemented by a qualitative analysis of various aspects of cartographic design: colour, 'white' space, visual hierarchy, and lettering. The results indicate a high degree of stylistic diversity throughout Europe, with the symbologies of Great Britain and Ireland demonstrating the strongest example of a supranational style. The typology of cartographic symbologies is shown to be an effective method for determining stylistic association among maps of differing geographical (and potentially historical) origins and it is suggested that the cartographic language paradigm should be revisited as a means for understanding why national differences persist in state cartography.

This argument is first developed through a discussion of the emergence of animated maps in docudramas of the 1910s. These early cinemaps were followed by more sophisticated examples that foreshadowed the structure and design principles of 'modern' cartography. The cinemap that appears in the movie M (Fritz Lang, 1931) can be considered the first 'modern' map as it prefigures many of the current functions of contemporary digital cartography such as the combination image/map, use of sound, shifts in perspective and spatial analysis. The remaining functions of digital cartography, including zooming and live data rendering, were conceptualized in cinema by the 1960s, as illustrated by examples from movies such as Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove and Goldfinger. When professional cartographers were creating their first animated maps, most of the functions of contemporary digital cartography had already been implemented in cinema. Building on these results, the paper anticipates the future incursion of mapping technologies into interpersonal, confidential and private spaces through the study of contemporary cinemaps. © The British Cartographic Society 2009.;"Cinema; Cinematic maps; Digital cartography; Virtual globes";"art; cartography; map";Review;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-65549146722;1

But, maps alone are not enough to appreciate the realities that one would experience by actually being there. The ability to be informed about 'real reality' is impossible. How might individuals better understand what it is like to actually live in a place, to endure hardships, or to enjoy the pleasures provided in a particular landscape. It is argued that through the use of the theatre metaphor, rich media artefacts can be provided as adjuncts to maps, whereby their use can provide users with experiences related to the emotional and experiential background information that 'hides' behind the map representation of geography. These theatre-guided artefacts can provide powerful insights into places when cinema is applied to telling 'stories' about geography, through personal and collective stories. This additional representation of geography extends typical geographical information displays by making the visualizations more personal, and thus providing a deeper representation of geography. As well, these artefacts can be built according to models of storytelling, whereby the resultant film can be used to portray the emotive elements in representations and give credibility to information that is not usually available through 'standard' mapping techniques. This paper explores how the Theatre metaphor can be employed to enable everyday activities, life in general and items specific to certain topics, to be depicted in ways that allow viewers/users to go deeper into the meaning behind representations of geography. Artefacts produced can complement and enhance the 'surface' geographical representation that maps offer. By integrating geographical artefacts designed and produced under the umbrella of the Theatre metaphor with the map metaphor, users can be provided with a more powerful integrated media tool than if a 'just maps' approach was followed. © The British Cartographic Society 2009.;"Cartography; Metaphors; Theatre";"artifact; cartography; landscape; map; mapping; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-65549138456;1

The 'mapping impulse' is less about the presence of maps in a certain visual landscape and more about the processes that underlie the understanding of space. In our analysis, we will therefore pay less attention to the symptomatic presence of maps in films, focusing instead on what we call 'cartographic shapes': panoramas, atlases and aerial views. The point of the matter is that a strong visual and rhetorical connection between cinema and cartography is not as surprising as it might initially appear. © The British Cartographic Society 2009.;"Aerial views; Atlas; Cartographic reason; Cinema; Film; Mapping impulse; Panoramas; Visual culture";"atlas; cartography; cultural landscape; mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-65549133263;1

The end of the Second World War and the advent of the Cold War had caused many of the world's borders to be redrawn. Cinema played a vital role in bringing forward the dilemmas that came with these shifts. Film noir offers a singular cartography of cinema: it dislocates its viewers through its 'mental maps' that call into question the specific times and places of their settings. Its force owes much to two conflicting cartographies: one, that is psychic, is at odds with another, which is geographic. Two films (The Killers and The Crooked Way) are studied to show how the mapping agency that prevails as of the end of the Second World War finds its most precocious and enduring formulas in the conventions of this cinema. © The British Cartographic Society 2009.;"Amnesia; Cartographic cinema; Film noir; World War II";"cartography; map; mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-65549093144;1

The geometry of the map is compared quantitatively with that of the first edition (1852) Ordnance Survey 6-inch (1 : 10 560) map. The Saxton map is found to have a scale of 1 : 5140, leading to the conclusion that the perch used in the scale bar represents 71/9 yards or thereabouts. The areas quoted in the written survey are consistent with acres based on this value. The positional accuracy of points on the map is found to be ∼20 m, and areas of typical plots determined from the map are uncertain by between about 4 and 12%. The relationship between these two facts can be understood through a detailed study of the statistics of the errors in separations of points on the map. The written survey is found to omit a substantial number of plots of land from its listings.

Although sound is a major component of any environment, its cartographic representation is limited mainly on noise mapping and in urban or sub-urban areas. Soundscape is a term that describes the acoustic relation between the environment and the individual in a landscape context, considering all kinds of interactions between space, sound and humans. The representation of the soundscape at a spatial level would support many applications such as geographic analysis, ecosystem evaluation, environmental education, landscape management, urban or rural planning and protection of sonic particularities.

The approach is based on the following steps. First, a window with size of 5 × 5 pixels is moved over the image to calculate the features: mean (x1), standard deviation (x2), skewness (x3) and kurtosis (x4). Then, the roads are identified based on the converted features to the specific fuzzy sets of the linguistic variables. The used linguistic variables are Mean, Standard deviation, Skewness, Kurtosis and Grey-scale with trapezoid and triangle membership functions. Next, the skeleton of the identified roads is extracted using two structure elements from the mathematical morphology. Finally, a snake model is employed to extract the road vector form from the skeletons. The results of the accuracy evaluation demonstrate that the developed road extraction approach can provide both good visual and high positional accuracy. The approach is tested over the samples of SPOT-4 panchromatic images from areas in Iran. © 2009 The British Cartographic Society.;"Fuzzy modelling; Mathematical morphology; Roads extraction; Snake; Spot";"accuracy assessment; fuzzy mathematics; image analysis; image classification; numerical model; panchromatic image; pixel; satellite imagery; skewness; Asia; Eurasia; Iran; Middle East";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-70349838951;1

We identify and apply cartographic and cognitive principles to develop a solution in the context of state-of-art geographic information systems. The gap in the ability of these systems to render three-dimensional buildings into maps is addressed. At the core of our solution is a building facade modelling approach that supports varying degrees of abstraction. This is achieved by introducing a concept of 'facade waveforms' and representing building facades as combinations of these waveforms. A Fourier series approximation of the waveforms is used during the rendering processes resulting in an elegant solution to anti-aliasing. The formulation retains the semantic information in the representation that enables meaningful extensions like night time facade generation. The solution is implemented as a pixel shader and therefore leads to a large reduction in texture memory requirement compared with existing building rendering techniques.

Current construction theories focus on diagrams without taking georeferencing or interactivity into account. This paper presents a new methodology for the creation of two-dimensional geometric symbols and diagrams for the application in thematic maps. In this context, 49 diagrams found in cartographic literature were analysed and classified regarding their construction properties. As a result of this research, diagrams can be defined using cartographic primitives which are arranged according to six arrangement principles. Since the variation of the primitive's size according to the data values follows a certain geometric direction, each diagram can be explicitly defined based on the three construction properties 'primitive', 'arrangement principle' and 'data direction'. © 2009 The British Cartographic Society.;"Arrangement principle; Construction; Diagram; Map symbol; Primitive; Thematic cartography";"cartography; diagram; geometry; map graphics; mapping method; thematic mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-70349838945;1

Between June 1915 and November 1918, W. B. R. King served as a staff lieutenant at General Headquarters of the British Expeditionary Force deployed on the Western Front. He pioneered British development of water supply maps for parts of Belgium and northern France, in several different styles and at scales of 1 : 100 000, 1 : 250 000 and 1 : 40 000. These assisted planning for advances into enemy-occupied territory or the development of water supply infrastructure within the region held ultimately by five British armies: in total about 1,500,000 men with some 500,000 horses and mules, each man/animal requiring on average 10 gallons (45 L) per day of potable water. The maps guided emplacement of over 470 military boreholes to supply drinking water to British forces, especially in provinces underlain by Cretaceous Chalk: Picardy and Artois. German forces also made use of military geologists at the Front, but in much greater number: up to about 300 in total. Water supply tasks were given high priority, and German water supply maps were finally standardized like other medium scale German geotechnical maps at 1 : 25 000. Six geologists were deployed with the American Expeditionary Force late in the war, and for their sector of the Front compiled at least two water supply maps at 1 : 80 000, and 11 at 1 : 50 000 that were supported by explanatory reports. Wartime imperatives thus generated expertise in hydrogeology that became available for civilian use post-war, and laid the foundation for further military development during World War II. © 2009 The British Cartographic Society.;"Belgium; France; Groundwater maps; History of cartography; Hydrogeology; Military geologists; Water supply; Western front; World War I";"geotechnical mapping; groundwater; historical cartography; hydrogeology; mapping method; water supply; Belgium; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; France; Western Europe; Equidae";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-70349802361;1

In particular, we develop a partial collapse algorithm for linear features. A river is represented by lines and polygons depending on the width. To render features with scale changes, a symbol knowledge base is designed to specify scale ranges and symbols for each feature. Finally, a multi-scale rendering tool is developed and applied to the map of Camp Lejune, NC. The symbols in the knowledge base can be accumulated and adapted for various mapping applications. © 2009 The British Cartographic Society.;"Geometry generalization; Multi-scale rendering; Partial collapse; Symbol knowledge base";"algorithm; geometry; GIS; knowledge based system; linearity; map generalization; multicriteria analysis; polygon; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-70349789893;1

Conversely, imaginary places affect the way people perceive real places. 'Set-jetting', which transforms film locations into tourist attractions, is a perfect example of the increasing demand for connecting fictional spaces with real places. The interaction of imaginary and real places, which has been for years an operating function of fiction, is increasing both qualitatively and quantitatively. This is not limited to cinema but also affects literature and art. Once located on a map, the fictional place becomes attractive for tourists and a potential source of profit. The connection between imaginary and real places has been transformed by recent dramatic changes in communication and information technologies, and more specifically in the domain of geospatial technologies. These technologies offer more effective ways of georeferencing locations in films, books and art works. Many Web sites compile information on film shooting locations. Geoparsing techniques offer solutions for automatically georeferencing novels or short stories. New technologies allow visitors practicing set-jetting or cultural tourism to collect extensive information about films or books related to these places. Geospatial technologies contribute to the development of an intermediary territory, a space between the real world and the fantasy world. © The British Cartographic Society 2009.;"Art; Cinema; Georeferencing; Geospatial technologies; Literature; Set-jetting";"art; tourism; tourist attraction";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-65549088901;1

This model integrates symbolisation and design principles from print cartography, interaction strategies from exploratory geovisualisation, and web-map/web-feature service advances from GIS. The atlas has been implemented using a client-server architecture. It makes use of two open-source GIS tools PostGIS (as the system database) and GeoServer (to connect the database to the client mapping application). The client mapping application has been built in Macromedia Flash. The entire client-server architecture is described, then direct primary emphasis is focused on the Client mapping application. For this component of the system, the interface design strategy is detailed, the approach taken to implement this strategy in Flash is documented, and the mechanisms developed to build dynamic links from the client to the underlying database through the server are outlined.

At the detailed level, a map can show clusters of trees, tree types, tracks and paths; at the small scale, say 1:250 000, we can discern broad patterns of forests and other land use, which can inform planners and act as input to land resource models. Rather than store such information in separate databases (requiring multiple points of maintenance), the vision is that the information has a single point of storage and maintenance, and that from this detailed level, various, more generalised forms can be automatically derived. This paper presents a methodology and algorithm for automatically deriving forest patches suitable for representation at 1:250 000 scale directly ftom a detailed dataset. In addition to evaluation of the output, the paper demonstrates how such algorithms can be shared and utilised via 'generalisation web services', arguing that the sharing of such algorithms can help accelerate developments in map generalisation, and increase the uptake of research solutions within commercial systems. © The British Cartographic Society 2008.";;"algorithm; forest ecosystem; map generalization; topographic mapping; woodland";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-49249138986;1

The resulting maps have a large number of interrupts, but are (almost) conformal and conserve areas. A general approach is presented to decide where to cut the globe, followed by three different types of solution, These follow from the use of meshes based on the standard graticule, the use of recursively subdivided polyhedra and meshes derived from the geography of the earth.

In this paper that absence is explained by discussing reasons that have to do with the ornamental nature of waterlining, and by providing counterarguments grounded on its artistic, technical and past economic significance, after which it continues with a narrative on the development and demise of other cartographic representations of water, placing special emphasis on the art and craft of waterlining. In particular, an explanation is proposed for the survival of waterlining vis-à-vis the earlier retirement of other water markings. Additionally, the documentary proofs of a 19th century mechanical invention are studied as well as its puzzling lack of success beyond its native Ireland. Lastly, old and modern ways of waterlining are reviewed, mentioning in passing the roles waterlining can play, inter alia, in computer solutions to problems of pattern recognition and maritime boundary delimitations. © The British Cartographic Society 2008.;;"historical cartography; mapping method; maritime boundary; nineteenth century; pattern recognition; Eurasia; Europe; Ireland; Western Europe";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-49249130720;1

GHC allows for situations to be understood and reasoned with, often with aid of visual representations such as maps. This paper introduces a conceptual model of GHC that theoretically motivates a Geovisual Analytics application called the Context Discovery Application (CDA), which is also presented. The CDA is designed to aid in the production of geo-historical context by using computational processes to identify and extract potentially relevant context information heterogeneous, implicit situation information. This information can then be explored through visual interfaces to help users explain and understand the information.

The time wave combines the strengths of both the timeline and the time wheel and as such is able to represent linear and cyclic time simultaneously, even at different levels of granularity. The time wave can be used in its role as temporal reference system, as temporal data representation tool, and as temporal interaction tool.

Meanwhile, cartography is being popularised and people are creating and employing their own maps instead of relying upon cartographers. Critical cartography has begun to offer new ways of understanding this cultural and social change, but research into map use has so far not engaged with this critical turn. It is argued that an approach informed by critical cartography is becoming more and more appropriate, stressing the need to rethink map use as a set of everyday activities practiced in real-world contexts and arguing map use is best interpreted using methodologies from the social sciences, employing a mixture of ethnographic and textual methods. Using case studies of community mapping, the mapping of golf courses, map collecting and mapping art, this paper shows how different insights into the nature of map use can flow from rethinking mapping. It is concluded that networks of practice of map use depend upon relations between many different artefacts, technologies, institutions, environments, abilities, affects, and individuals. © The British Cartographic Society 2008.;"Art; Community mapping; Critical cartography; Culture; Golf mapping; Map collecting; Map use; Mapping practices";"cartography; culture; map generalization; mapping; methodology";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-49249102659;1

Today, such a design task is subject to three major challenges: the ever growing amount of geospatial data at various levels of detail, the diversified applications of that data, and the continuously expanding range of display sizes. In this work, the aim was to enhance the visualisation of relevant geographic information by focusing on utility and usability issues of designing geographic information representations. The relevance of information as an element of utility and its cognitively adequate visualisation as an element of usability was considered. To enhance utility, irrelevant data was separated from relevant data by implementing relevance as a filter and embodying relevance values as attributes of the selected objects. To represent these relevant objects and the context information design principles were formulated and a design methodology proposed that tends to facilitate a user's attentional capacities when processing geovisualisation. In order to design this attention-guiding geovisualisation, use was made of approaches and findings from relevance theory and cognitive psychology with emphasis on neuroscientific principles.

The maps make use of the original phase gradient approach to glacier rheology modelling based on repeat-pass ERTS SAR interferograms. Careful map design and, in particular, colour assignment allow the visualisation of the glacier dynamics in its locally changing velocity with an estimated accuracy of approximately 2.0 cm per day. Two map derivates - a differential interferogram showing the glacier velocity and another product displaying the glacier strain rate - have been designed. Moreover, maps displaying the glacier marginal changes within the space of four years have been generated. The strain rate maps evidence that spots with high values frequently correspond with crevasse-prone areas which are even detectable under thick layers of snow. In this sense, the latter visualisations can be seen as maps of crevasse danger zones. The Svartisen in Norway and the Hintereis Glacier in Austria served as testbeds for the development of these different types of maps which are at the scales of 1:25 000, 1:50 000 and 1:100 000. © The British Cartographic Society 2007.;"Crevasse-danger map; Differential SAR interferometry; Glacier dynamics; Glacier mapping; Glacier motion; Glacier rheology; Hintereis Glacier; Svartisen; Thematic cartography";"cartography; glacier dynamics; radar interferometry; rheology; thematic mapping; visualization; Austria; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-38649131777;1

Park St., Madison, WI 53703, United States;The potential of unclassed animated choropleth maps as a solution to false patterns of geographic change arising from data classification is investigated. Old concerns about unclassed choropleth maps may be mitigated through map interactivity that offers four advantages over traditional data legends, and previous insights from testing static choropleth maps do not necessarily translate to animated cartography. Data from user testing revealed unclassed animated choropleth maps neither help nor hurt the ability of map readers to understand patterns of geographic change. However, the unclassed map (1) appeared 'less jumpy' to participants and was perceived to run at a slower pace (despite running at the same number of frames per second), and (2) subtle geographic shifts (e.g., seasonal unemployment cycles) were more readily noticed on the unclassed maps. Preliminary results also suggest classed data emphasise stability over time - while their unclassed counterparts improve our ability to see changes.

The use of dynamics and animations in maps has increased, and new types of applications are emerging frequently. Recently, several map providers on the web have introduced zooming in maps as an animated operation. In this paper, we look closer into how the animated zoom is perceived by participants in an experiment, and compare these observations with a corresponding test where the map scale is changed in more abrupt steps. The results indicate significant preference for the animated zoom.

The characteristics of cartographic objects and the arrangement of map features have to be observed and preserved in a generalisation process. A method is developed for typifying drainages while preserving their structural characteristics, i.e. presenting the drainages with reduced number of rivers under the constraint of preserving the original structure in terms of the type and distribution of the rivers. We apply Töpfer's radical law to calculate the amount of the rivers to be retained on the generalised map. The drainages share the amount of retained rivers in proportion to the number of their tributaries. In each of the drainages, the shared amount is divided among the rivers based on the dendritic decomposition of the drainage. We implement and test the method in Java Environment. Results from case studies show that the method effectively preserves the original structures of the drainages on the generalised maps. © The British Cartographic Society 2007.;"Drainage; Map generalisation; Structural constraints; Typification";"cartography; drainage; map generalization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-38649093013;1

Petit was responsible for drafting the earliest plans and profiles of four castles in the north-west Highlands of Scotland (1714), as well as the earliest town plans of Perth and Inverness (1716). A consideration of their functions, particularly through the Board of Ordnance archives, allows a better understanding of these plans and their value as historical sources, as well as their accurate dating. Petit's work reflected national and international developments, including war in Europe and the Jacobite rebellions in Britain. His cartography illustrates the spread of new European military theories and practices, at a time when a professional corps of military engineers was being established in Great Britain. Through studying Petit and his maps we can gain a fuller understanding not only of the Board of Ordnance in Hanoverian Scotland, but also of the militarisation of cartography in the eighteenth century, and the emergence of standards relating to colour, scale and terminology. © The British Cartographic Society 2007.;;"eighteenth century; historical cartography; military application; Eurasia; Europe; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-38649090083;1

Whether it was a fear of the technologies replacing them or a misconception that cartography was all about production methodologies and final published result is unclear. Cartography will continue to be instrumental in the published mapping world, which, if managed properly, will have a strong future and will complement the new technologies just as newspapers have survived the birth of the Internet. However, the true value of cartography is in communication. Communication is the essence of cartography; it is the language by which we can best communicate the vast array of GI held in our database most effectively and efficiently for the needs of the user. The media is irrelevant, the output might be intended to have a long life such as a published paper map or it might be transient, living briefly on a PDA or computer screen; the application of good cartography ensures that the GI completes the task intended efficiently and effectively. For cartographers at Ordnance Survey to maintain their current renaissance they must also not just embrace emerging technologies but must be proactive in researching the opportunities that any technology advances in the GI field may bring them rather than wait for the developers to invite them to the table - the invitation probably would not arrive.";;"cartography; Internet; mapping; technological development";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-37749047680;1

The work strives to improve upon the standard 'wallpaper' fill patterns available in most GIS. Research focuses, specifically on automation of vegetation symbol placement for Ordnance Survey 1:50 000 scale maps. Algorithms are developed for optimising the diagonal grid and semi-random placement patterns, based on an analysis of the current mapping. The algorithms are tested on a large dataset containing woodland polygons. The initial results are evaluated by Ordnance Survey cartographers, the parameters are fine-tuned and the final output is demonstrated to be cartographically sound. © Crown copyright 2007.

In line with our role as a national mapping agency the approach is to do this, such that any data is part of a coherent range of products that are sympathetic with the terrain and existing 2D topographic data, are of national cover and are maintained. Such intentions create unique challenges to a mapping agency. These challenges include: 1. Specification determination and an appropriate capture methodology. 2. Data modelling and storage of 3D data. 3. Maintenance of the database. 4. Supply of products in a useful format. This paper will discuss those issues most pertinent to the development of a potential 3D product within Ordnance Survey. Subsequently, a better understanding of the complexity of implementing a 3D dataset into a national mapping agency's product portfolio can be achieved. © Crown copyright 2007.

Early reports were illustrated by pre-war geological maps reprinted by the Geographical Section, General Staff, (GSGS), later reports by new simplified geological maps, usually accompanied by one or more thematic maps. An airfield suitability map for Bulgaria and soils maps for both the Middle Danube region (Hungary) and Austria were printed as part of the GSGS Miscellaneous map series, and groundwater and soils maps prepared as tracing overlays for use with topographical maps for parts of Germany. Simplified geological maps were prepared by ISTD and printed by GSGS for Sumatra, Borneo, Formosa, the Kra Isthmus region of the Burma/Thailand peninsula, Siam (Thailand) and Indo-China, Java, Hainan, and the Hong Kong to Canton region of China. These were mostly at a scale of 1:1000 000 but in varying styles, to innovatively indicate terrain features of specific military significance. Airfield suitability maps were printed at scales between 1:250 000 and 1:1000 000 for many of these regions, based on ground features and predicted soil permeability. All these specialist maps were printed in small numbers, and few copies have survived the war - notably in the British Library, the National Archives, or the library of the Royal Geographical Society. The ISTD Geological Section constituted the larger of only two teams of British military geologists to be established in either World War, exercising a role in military intelligence that is seldom acknowledged. © The British Cartographic Society 2007.;;"geological mapping; military application; permeability; planning method; terrain; thematic mapping; topographic mapping";Conference Paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-34648814235;1

These data are also relevant in cartography. Land cover changes identified by the method mentioned may contain mistakes caused by over- or underestimation. The paper describes these mistakes. Overestimation (technical change) of the extent of land cover change is caused by adding the residual polygons (smaller than 25 ha) to neighbouring polygons. Underestimation is caused by the fact that discernible changes concerning areas larger than 5 ha which showed up in objects with areas smaller than 25 ha were not identified and, consequently, not included in either CLC90 or CLC2000 data layers; e.g. Dutch CLC_change database users' accuracy indicates an overestimation of 8.8% whereas the comparison of net change indicates a small, insignificant underestimation. In spite of the problems referred to, caused by overestimation or underestimation, the datasets on land cover changes in Europe for the 1990s and the year 2000 (± one year) can also be used for the compilation of land cover change maps at the regional, national and European levels. © The British Cartographic Society 2007.";"Cartographic data; Computer-aided visual interpretation; CORINE Land Cover Project; Land cover; Land cover changes; Overestimation; Underestimation";"cartography; computer aided design; detection method; land cover; polygon; satellite imagery";Conference Paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-34648814231;1

The National Mapping Agency is currently migrating its spatial data from a national level to an international level, liaising with other EU countries in various projects to contribute to broad professional development as well as addressing key technical issues in providing pan-European products. These developments are vital for Malta in order to meet its environmental commitments and obligations as well as the need to bring into line all our datasets in relation to regional and internationally similar products. MEPA is a key player in the development of a national spatial data infrastructure (NSDI) and seeks to embrace new developments. As SDI begins to migrate to interoperable technologies, standards and methodologies so even more diverse stakeholder communities can use geospatial data and services more effectively. MEPA, as an organization also offers a societal GIS, in which stakeholders utilize shared GIS services. This is based on a framework of common standards and policies that have been implemented. Key benefits of this approach include collaboration and information sharing, which are critical for effective governance. Significant cost savings can also be realized through the elimination of redundancy in data collection and management. This is especially so due to the lack of data on social issues such as deprivation, migration, affluence, etc. that have a direct link to land use issues, such as the need for social housing, openurban spaces and recreational areas, amongst others. MEPA also functions within the scope of directives issued regarding the re-use of Public Sector Information (2003/98EC) The main thrusts of this include the harmonization of rules across Europe and clarifying obligations of public bodies, creating a more dynamic information market and last but not least stimulating economic growth. Since its inception MEPA has promoted an open and participatory approach to decision making. Through its data sharing, it disseminates data on-line including legal requirements within the Development Planning Act, the Environmental Act, and the Public Sector Initiative, amongst others. The Development Planning Act sets out principles of access to information as well as encourages public participation in decision-making, through its publications, general meetings, presentations and direct public-interfaces. The Environment Protection Act emphasises the duty to collaborate and disseminate information to enable better decisions. Aarhus Convention compliance has enhanced this process. Statutory provisions for public consultation on policy formulation, as well as the broad availability of access to environmental information are evidenced in day to day operations of the organization. Information is frequently presented or communicated in geographic form. MEPA has been participating in different European geographical product developments and initiatives over the past five years and, in 2003, was formally accepted as an active member of one of the forty-six (46) National Mapping and Cadastral Agencies (NMCAs) from forty-one (41) European countries. MEPA's vision is to achieve interoperability of European mapping and other GI data as well as to assist public and private sectors develop good governance, sustainable growth and which benefits to the populus. To this effect, participation at an international level exposes GI experts to international developments in mapping and GIS and similarly allows sharing of best practice with our counterparts across Europe. Malta's National Mapping Agency is also an active participant in the production of diverse cartographic projects at an international level, including the EuroRegional Map (Figure 14), a product being developed as part of a pan European initiative by EuroGeographics. MEPA is also embarking on other national projects such as 'e-apps' - online applications for permitting development of environmentally sensitive operations as well as refining the services related to spatial data included in the e-government project. MEPA is active in promoting e-government benefits through use of spatial information, its backing of a new GI association born from a MEPA-employee initiative, the ongoing development and deployment of a fully-functional MapServer and the implementation of monitoring systems for both planning and environment areas. © The British Cartographic Society 2006.;;"cartography; data set; environmental protection; GIS; mapping; monitoring system; spatial data; Eurasia; Europe; Malta; Southern Europe; Populus";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-34447343828;1

After an initial discussion of the nature of complexity and its fitful study in cartography over recent years, an assessment is made of the potential for quantifying map complexity. A series of practical tests was devised and is described. These consider a wide range of metrics, including spatial statistical measures, entropy and image-based indices. Their application to both raster and vector mapping is investigated. Data compression shows promise as an index which can be used to characterize the graphical variation within the map face. The nature of digital data compression is described, with reference to raster map representations, and it is determined that a data-compression ratio can act as a simple and effective complexity measure. The paper concludes by listing some of the reasons why complexity, as measured by data compression, could be used in cartographic practice. © The British Cartographic Society 2006.;;"cartography; complexity; mapping; raster";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-34447272010;1

They have been produced to meet society's implicit need to fix the boundaries of international issues and the relationships of force between the various powers. These atlases clearly express established ideologies and allow us to determine various trends of thought; messages which the authors wish us to take on board by studying cartographic themes. This is the approach we will be taking in this article. In this paper, we aim to show the epistemological development of geopolitical atlases. The first part of the article gives the general outline of the epistemological development of geopolitical atlases, in which two main periods stand out. The first corresponds with the 1980s, which can be described as a realist decade. The state was a geopolitical player that could not be overlooked within a bipolar world; maps showing conflicts between the two major powers and thematic maps showing an ideological clash between them are typical of the period. The second period, corresponding with the 1990s, begins with the fall of the regimes in the Soviet bloc. This period can be described as having a neo-realist approach, where the threat from the East had moved to terrorism and drug trafficking. The atlases follow the geopolitical development of the world and describe international structural changes. In conclusion, the paper will return to the important educational and informative role of atlases and their effects on the ideas they are able to disseminate amongst the population. © The British Cartographic Society 2006.";"1980-2000; Epistemology; Geopolitical atlases; Maps; Public opinion";"atlas; geopolitics; ideology; thematic mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-34447271256;1

Maps of the landing beaches at a scale of 1:5000 indicated natural hazards to cross-beach vehicle mobility. Maps of northwest Europe at 1:1000 000 showed the varying suitability of ground for airfield construction, and larger scale maps guided the site selection and rapid construction of numerous temporary airfields. Hydrogeological maps were prepared as tracing overlays for topographical maps to guide enhancement of potable water supplies from new wells and boreholes - at a scale of 1:50 000 for coastal areas from the Cherbourg peninsula eastwards to Calais, and at 1:250 000 for most of northern France east into the Low Countries. A few 'soil' maps guided emplacement of depots for stores and vehicles, and at least two resource maps were prepared - to guide quarrying of material for road construction and sand for engineering work in general. Pioneering British military geological work on Normandy was extended for western coastal areas by large-scale American maps which included geological features for exit routes from the Omaha and Utah beaches. Bordering the eastern coast, at least two Canadian maps at 1:100 000 related geology to 'going' (cross-country trafficability). Printed in small numbers and great secrecy, few copies of any of these maps appear to have survived the war. The most extensive collection known is ! preserved in the Lapworth Museum of Geology, University of Birmingham. This is part of a unique personal archive, generated by Major F. W. Shotton when serving as Staff Officer (Geology) of the invasion force.

Previous approaches to mapping the results of GWR have primarily employed an equal step classification and sequential no-hue colour scheme for choropleth mapping of parameter estimates. This cartographic approach may hinder the exploration of spatial nonstationarity by inadequately illustrating the spatial distribution of the sign, magnitude, and significance of the influence of each explanatory variable on the dependent variable. Approaches for improving mapping of the results of GWR are illustrated using a case study analysis of population density-median home value relationships in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. These approaches employ data classification schemes informed by the (nonspatial) data distribution, diverging colour schemes, and bivariate choropleth mapping. © The British Cartographic Society 2006.;;"cartography; classification; mapping method; regression analysis; North America; Pennsylvania; Philadelphia; United States";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-33845758913;1

Selecting the right contour interval is a compromise between showing sufficient detail in flat regions, whilst avoiding excessive crowding of lines in steep and morphologically complex areas. The traditional way of avoiding coalescence and confusion across steep regions has been to manually remove short sections of intermediate contours, while retaining index contours. Incorporating humans in automated environments is not viable. This research reports on the design, implementation and evaluation of an automated solution to this problem involving the automatic identification of coalescing lines, and removal of line segments to ensure clarity in the interpretation of contour information. Evaluation was made by subjective comparison with Ordnance Survey products. The results were found to be very close to the quality associated with manual techniques. © The British Cartographic Society 2006.;;"algorithm; automation; contour map; mapping method; topographic mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-33845729925;1

The operations used in area generalization, will cause changes in the geometry and thematic attributes of area features and the topological relationships between them. Very limited quantitative measures, especially for semantics, are available to describe the effect of generalization when multiple objects are involved or when the entire map needs to be characterized. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide some quantitative measures for the changes (especially in semantics) that have occurred during generalization. A set of quantitative measures of data quality, i.e. accuracy, consistency, and completeness, has been developed to assess such effects.

Barriers to effective navigation, such as slope, surface type and dropped kerbs, differ for able-bodied pedestrians and wheelchair users. This study identifies and quantifies such differences, and develops a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) network model for the creation of accessibility maps for wheelchair users. The measurement of barriers uses Digital Elevation Models, calculation of rolling resistance, and surreys in the field using hand-held GIS. A spatial database has been constructed which contains the pedestrian route network and barriers to navigation. A GIS application runs the model, providing a user-friendly interface to define and calculate routes through the pedestrian route network that take account of impedances to accessibility. The model, application and interface has been tested with wheelchair users and the route selection provides a good correspondence with patterns of route finding already established through experience. The interface and individually tailored maps generated, provide a tool suitable to assist wheelchair users new to an area; to enable better navigation for existing users, and a means for planners to consider the way in which access is restricted for wheelchair users in their designs for more inclusive urban environments. © The British Cartographic Society 2006.";"Access; Dynamic segmentation; GIS; Mapping; Modelling; Network; Urban";"barrier (equipment); data set; digital elevation model; GIS; landscape structure; map; mapping; measurement method; navigation; survey; urban site";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-33845663588;1

This paper aims to evaluate a diversity of automatic line simplification algorithms in terms of positional accuracy and processing time. Past research studies for the performance evaluation were centred on measuring the location difference between a line to be simplified and its simplified version. However, the original line contains positional uncertainty. This paper evaluates performance of the line simplification algorithms using two comprehensive measures of positional accuracy of the simplified line. These two measures include one displacement measure and one shape distortion measure, both of which are able to consider (a) the displacement between the original line and its simplified version, and (b) positional uncertainty of the original line. © The British Cartographic Society 2006.";;"algorithm; measurement method; research work; vector";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-33845613986;1

To study the potential of these 1:63,360 maps for a quantitative analysis of land cover changes over a period of time, I have compared them to 20th century topographic maps. The map registration error of the PEF maps was 74.4 m using 123 control points of trigonometrical stations and a 1st order polynomial. The median RMSE of all control and test points (n = 1104) was 153.6 m. As a case study of land cover changes, the area of coastal dunes as shown on the PEF maps was compared with that shown on British Mandate 1:20,000 topo-cadastral maps from c. 1930. In five of the six areas analysed, the yearly dunes movement rate was above the estimated annual error due to data resolution (2.96 m/year). The rate of dune movement south of Acre was found to be between 3.9 and 6.3 mlyear (depending on the method used for map registration) between 1874 and 1930. Care should be taken when analysing historical maps, as it cannot be assumed that their accuracy is consistent at different parts or for different features depicted on them. © The British Cartographic Society 2006.";;"coastal zone; data set; dune field; exploration; land cover; land type; landscape change; map; quantitative analysis; resolution; topography; twentieth century; Asia; Eurasia; Middle East; Palestine";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-33845611522;1

Characteristic points of contours are defined in relation to the skeleton lines of the terrain and determined using the deviation angles at the contour points. Error bands for contours are constructed by means of the steepest slope lines and the mean square planimetric errors at the contour points.

The transformation of initial numeric data values into graphic values for visual display differs for classed and unclassed maps. Classed maps first group data into classification intervals and each interval is then assigned a graphic value usually using the principle of maximum contrast. Unclassed maps skip the classification step and directly assign graphic value based on the original numeric data value. The paper examines the differences in defining algebraic-to-graphic transformation lines for both classed and unclassed classed maps and especially the role of the maximum contrast principle in constructing classed choropleth maps. Results show that the maximum contrast principle increases the visual complexity of spatial patterns in a classed map over the level present in a corresponding unclassed map. © The British Cartographic Society 2005.;;"cartography; mapping method; spatial analysis; spatial data";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-27244444068;1

For Guernsey, maps at this scale were prepared to depict bedrock and superficial geology, and also maps which showed sites for building materials, water supply and features of military geology. For Alderney, maps at 1: 10 000 showed bedrock geology, water supply, building materials plus tunnelling conditions, and military geology. Only a few contemporary copies of these maps were produced, hand-drawn upon printed topographical base-maps.

The NetCDF tool described here, named NCWin and coded with Borland C+ + Builder, was built as a standard executable as well as a COM (component object model) for the Microsoft Windows environment. COM is a powerful technology that enhances the reuse of applications (as components). Environmental model developers from different modeling environments, such as Python, JAVA, VISUAL FORTRAN, VISUAL BASIC, VISUAL C+ +, and DELPHI, can reuse NCWin in their models to read, write and visualize NetCDF data. Some Windows applications, such as ArcGIS and Microsoft PowerPoint, can also call NCWin within the application. NCWin has three major components: 1) The data conversion part is designed to convert binary raw data to and from NetCDF data. It can process six data types (unsigned char, signed char, short, int, float, double) and three spatial data formats (BIP, BIL, BSQ); 2) The visualization part is designed for displaying grid map series (playing forward or backward) with simple map legend, and displaying temporal trend curves for data on individual map pixels; and 3) The modeling interface is designed for environmental model development by which a set of integrated NetCDF functions is provided for processing NetCDF data. To demonstrate that the NCWin can easily extend the functions of some current GIS software and the Office applications, examples of calling NCWin within ArcGIS and MS PowerPoint for showing NetCDF map animations are given. © The British Cartographic Society 2005.";"COM; Data processing; Model reuse; NetCDF; Visualization";"data processing; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-22944483447;1

Two experiments were conducted to compare two virtual city designs using the virtual model of Tel Aviv city. One design included highlighted urban elements from the residents' urban image, while in the second design no highlighted elements were included. The experiments proved that using the elements of the residents' urban image in a virtual city design enhances the performance of all participants in the wayfinding tasks, and especially those with a low level of spatial knowledge. Analysis of the trajectory patterns and the verbal reports of the participants during navigation showed that the urban image design facilitates a more intensive use of a position-based strategy, in addition to the path-integration wayfinding strategy, which was found to be dominant in the virtual model without the highlighted urban image elements. On the basis of these findings we propose principles for designing virtual cities from a perspective of wayfinding. © The British Cartographic Society 2005.;"Geovisualization; Urban image theory; Virtual cities; Virtual Environment design; Wayfinding strategies";"image analysis; urban design; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-22944456524;1

There are two approaches to coping with large amounts of data: data selection, when only a portion of data is displayed, and data aggregation, i.e. grouping data items and considering the groups instead of the original data. None of these approaches alone suits the needs of exploratory data analysis, which requires consideration of data on all levels: overall (considering a dataset as a whole), intermediate (viewing and comparing collective characteristics of arbitrary data subsets, or classes), and elementary (accessing individual data items). Therefore, it is necessary to combine these approaches, i.e. build a tool showing the whole set and arbitrarily defined subsets (object classes) in an aggregated way and superimposing this with a representation of arbitrarily selected individual data items. We have achieved such a combination of approaches by modifying the technique of parallel coordinate plot.

One source of these data is from multi-return airborne lidar, a type of laser that records multiple returns for each pulse of light sent towards the ground. Data from multi-return lidar is a vital tool in helping us understand the structure of forest canopies over large extents. This paper presents visualization tools to allow scientists to rapidly explore, interpret and discover characteristic distributions within the entire spatial field. The major contribution of this work is a paradigm shift which allows ecologists to think of and analyse their data in terms of full distributions, not just summary statistics. The tools allow scientists to depart from traditional parametric statistical analyses and to associate multimodal distribution characteristics to forest structures. Information on the modality and shape of distributions, previously ignored, can now be visualized as well. Examples are given using data from High Island, southeast Alaska. © The British Cartographic Society 2005.;"Density estimation; Geovisualization; Interactive visualization; Lidar; Mode finding; Probability density functions";"forest dynamics; lidar; probability density function; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-22944441927;1

This paper presents a multi-user mobile system to visualize environmental processes. This system enables multiple users to visualize and simulate environmental processes, and also retrieve additional information in real time, while moving through the environmental area under analysis. Each user is able to contribute to the simulation and assess the impact of adding or removing agents to or from the model, respectively. This system uses a modular approach, allowing its deployment through different platforms. Two main modules compose the system under development: a geo-referenced model and an Augmented Reality (AR) composition module. The geo-referenced model describes the environmental processes being modelled and tracks all users. The AR composition module allows users to visualize the geo-referenced model evolution and to interact with the model through two different views, namely animated map view and AR view. © The British Cartographic Society 2005.;"Animated maps; Augmented Reality; Environmental Processes Visualization; Interactive maps; Multi-user geovisualization";"cartography; map graphics; mapping; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-22944448041;1

Interactive geovirtual environments such as virtual 3D maps or virtual 3D city models, however, raise the question how to control geodata usage and distribution. We present a concept for embedding digital rights in geovisualizations. It is based on geo-documents, an object-oriented scheme to specify a wide range of geovisualizations. Geo-documents are assembled by building blocks categorized into presentation, structure, interaction, animation, and Digital Rights Management (DRM) classes. DRM objects allow for defining permissions and constraints for all objects contained in geo-documents. In this way, authors of geovisualizations can control how their geo-documents are used, personalized, and redistributed by users. The strengths of the presented concept include the ability to integrate heterogeneous 2D and 3D geodata within a compact design scheme and the ability to cope with privacy, security, and copyright issues. Embedded digital rights in geovisualizations can be applied to improve the usability of geodata user interfaces, to implement publisher-subscriber communication systems for geodata, and to establish business models for geodata trading systems. © The British Cartographic Society 2005.;"Digital Rights Management; Geospatial DRM; Geovirtual Environments; Geovisualization";"digital image; spatial data; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-22944440690;1

While cartographic animation has become a practical alternative, it is mostly used to depict both spatio-temporal and non-temporal changes. The paper concentrates on the use of dynamic symbols on a static base map. A visual test was carried out to obtain some perspectives about the cartographic communication of blinking point and line symbols. The results confirmed that dynamic symbols tended to attract the attention of the users in general and even in situations when the foreground-background contrasts were poor. Their effectiveness was more pronounced with symbols of a larger size but tended to diminish with an increasing number of blinking symbols. It was also observed that users were able to perceive differences in the frequency of flickering, particularly when the variation was large. The line animation method (marquee and grow-out) did not yield a substantial difference in visual responses in the case of blinking line symbols. © The British Cartographic Society 2004.;;"cartography; Internet; mapping method; visual analysis";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-13844292788;1

In this study, such knowledge is classified into two broad types, i.e. general knowledge and thematic knowledge. General knowledge covers the basic and common restrictions and specifications for generalization of geographic data. Thematic knowledge describes the special restrictions and specifications for a specific geographic data or application. The paper emphasizes the use of thematic knowledge in detail for land use data generalization. Three main types of thematic knowledge are identified, i.e. nature-based, culture-based and application-specific. Such thematic knowledge is then represented using the so-called production-rule method to become generalization rules. These rules are built in a prototype system to guide the implementation of land use data generalization. Real-life data have been used for testing and very promising results have been obtained from this system. © The British Cartographic Society 2004.;;"cartography; knowledge; land use; thematic mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-13844270909;1

This paper presents an approach that combines visual and computational analysis to make this process easier. This approach is based on the effective application of computational algorithms, such as the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). These are used to uncover the structure, patterns, relationships and trends in the data, and for the creation of abstractions where conventional methods may be limited. In addition, graphical representations are applied to portray extracted patterns in a visual form that allows for better understanding of the derived structures and possible geographical processes, and should facilitate knowledge construction. © The British Cartographic Society 2004.;;"data set; mapping method; spatial data; visual analysis; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-13844264522;1

In fact, driving a vehicle is a complex task as the driver has to control the vehicle as well as make decisions about getting to his/her destination. Too much information on the map (i.e. a complex map) would confuse the driver, while too little information would not be sufficient for the user to compare with the actual environment. Sufficient information but poorly presented would also result in confusion. This paper reports on a study of the design of dynamic maps for land vehicle navigation through an investigation of different designs with different levels of information contents and visual effects using various dynamic variables. Different colours were assigned to the road and building names according to the position of the vehicle, and blinking symbols were used to indicate direction restrictions. Also, a set of maps with different degrees of complexity was designed such that the users would be provided with different levels of contents and representation by zooming in and out. The effectiveness of the design was investigated in the map evaluation process. © The British Cartographic Society 2004.;;"cartography; mapping method; navigation aid; transport vehicle";Review;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-13844264521;1

In the geographic information industry new ways of collecting data, new provides and new users entering the industry, different ways of publishing maps and information, greater flexibility and ways of reaching all kinds of new users all examples where the boundaries have been pushed back more in the last 10 years than in the previous 100. Changes in the mainstream underlying computing technology have enabled and facilitated this so much so more than radical new methods from within the industry. The impact of change on mapping and geographic information is as great as much as any other industry or the change we witness in our own loves from day to day. However, when we stand back and consider what our overall goals are, better management of resources, better education, health and quality of life, greater care in the use of the environment etc. - these are much the same as they always have been. The difference today is that technology now allows us to really start to address the key issues we have before us. How then do we bring coherence to an apparently disconnected world? How do we prevent diffusion and potential chaos, especially when information integration is a critical success factor? How do we organize ourselves to do that? The paper will describe the concept of the Digital NationalFramework and how this is now developing to support such an infrastructure and how new technologies e.g. GML are facilitating its development. The paper propose that we have to start by simplifying the GI infrastructure and recognize the building blocks in developing that infrastructure. We need to incorporate methods that unite and integrate definite information. This in turn can be used to underpin all kinds of information in a joined-up way. Thereon it will support data sharing, decision making and problem-solving faster and more cost effectively than ever before. © Crown copyright 2004.;;"cartography; mapping method; technological development";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-12444323575;1

The revolution was spawned by the increasing power of the personal computer that enabled users to have access to large volumes of imagery converted into digital ortho photos. In the UK this revolution was driven by commercial companies who invested in creating large databases and have driven the resolution down to provide more and more detail. More recently the Ordinance Survey has entered the market with its own image layer as part of its Master Map product, the large scale digital database of the GB. However, unlike many other countries across Europe,there has been little experience of publishing aerial photography in the form of photo maps in Britain, with a few notable exceptions. With the increased availability of aerial imagery there is an opportunity to re-visit this form of mapping and produce new and innovative forms of ortho photos integrated with other geographic information. This paper briefly describes some of the experiences of creating photo maps in Britain and looks at the current potential for new cartographic products. © The British Cartographic Society 2004.;;"aerial photography; cartography; mapping method; orthophoto";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-12444289539;1

In the summer of 1940, its military geologists assisted planning for potentially the greatest amphibious assault to that time in history by preparing maps which analysed the terrain of southeast England in terms of coastal geomorphology, groundwater supply, quarry sites for construction materials and off-road trafficability. These specialist maps were generated at scales of 1:50 000, 1:100 000 or 1:250 000 by annotating topographical base maps, derived from the then current Ordnance Survey maps at most similar scale, with data derived from maps and memoirs published by the Geological Survey of Great Britain or larger-scale Ordnance Survey maps. They represent an early example of geotechnical mapping skills developed more fully in the German armed forces for operations elsewhere later in the war. © The British Cartographic Society 2004.;;"historical cartography; mapping; war";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-3142613199;1

It considers that positional uncertainty in a simplified line is caused by (a) positional uncertainty in an initial line propagated through the process and (b) a deviation of the simplified line from the initial line. In order to describe the uncertainty in the simplified line, the maximum distance is defined as a measure. This measure is further adopted to determine parameters to a line simplification algorithm. Therefore, this model makes a step forward in the implementation of an uncertainty indicator for the line simplification. As compared existing models, the proposed uncertainty model in this paper is more comprehensive in uncertainty assessment for line simplification. © The British Cartographic Society 2004.;;"algorithm; data processing; GIS; uncertainty analysis";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-3142611089;1

The author set up Describe Online in April 2000 to develop new solutions to this information gap through online text descriptions, improving accessibility of websites and revising product manuals to make them more informative to purchasers. Experience to date has revealed a spectrum of situations for which both tactile diagrams and text descriptions are both desirable and complementary. Whilst a tactile diagram should always be accompanied by some text annotation, at least to the extent of that which normally accompanies print diagrams, some text descriptions can be stand-alone and may be the only practical way to convey the necessary information. The converse is also true, there are many instances where text alone cannot convey the subtlety which could be presented via a tactile approach. The author wishes to explore this topic to see if criteria can be developed that could inform content providers of the extent to which these two complementary approaches should be adopted for each practical situation.;;information;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0742319877;1

A number of consistencies and inconsistencies are identified and we speculate on the extent to which the current state of tactile map production is likely to meet the needs of the client population. We describe the sample on which the report is based, the output in terms of quantity of maps produced, choice of production method, types of environment mapped and intended uses of maps. We also focus on issues of map design, such as the choice of map size and format, and choice of symbols.;;"cartography; mapping method; survey";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0742302279;1

This paper deals with a method that implements the whole graphic generalization process (roughly defined as the operators simplification, smoothing, exaggeration and displacement) called simultaneous graphic generalization. This method is based on constraints, i.e. requirements that should be fulfilled in the generalization process. The constraints strive to make the map readable while preserving the characteristics of the data, which implies that all constraints cannot be completely satisfied. This study was concentrated on finding the optimal compromise between the constraints in simultaneous graphic generalization by setting weights for the constraints. Four strategies for determining the weights are described and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The discussion is based on the following assumptions: the constraints are independent, and the weights are only dependent on constraint type and object type. A comparison of the strategies reveals that the strategy constraint violation is the most promising. One advantage with this strategy is that it is related to the quality requirements of the map, and another advantage is that it provides a numerical measure for quality assessment. The paper concludes with a case study of the constraint violation strategy, in which visualization of the numerical quality measure is used. The case study shows that the constraint violation strategy gives a sound compromise between the constraints.;;"cartography; graphical method; mapping; spatial data";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0742284986;1

During a three-phase project, visually impaired primary school children explored a route between a field studies centre and the village church. The first stage involved using non-visual senses to discover specific landmarks and the character of the parkland surroundings. Secondly, the children made their own tactile sketch maps of the route, and discussed the choice of symbols for a vacuum formed tactile map of the study area. Finally, a more detailed exploration of the route was accomplished with the help of a tactile map that set the path in the context of its surroundings.;;map;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0742284984;1

Initial research was carried out in order to find which of the sites mentioned by Ptolemy have an identified position today. A computation of the coordinates of the same sites was then made using a modern cartographic system. Finally, these two sets of coordinates (Ptolemy's and the modern ones) were compared and a mathematical model was developed to transform Ptolemy's cartographic data to the present-day coordinates. In this way, the combination of the mathematical elaboration of the available data together with research on historical geography may lead to useful data in removing the uncertainty of Ptolemy's coordinates in the regions under investigation.;;"cartography; comparative study; coordinate; historical cartography; numerical model; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Macedonia [Greece]; Southern Europe";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0742284982;1

In the course of work on this book, an important second theme emerged: the lengthy process by which British merchant ship masters gradually abandoned their long-standing preference for bluebacks and adopted the new and technically superior Admiralty charts. Admiralty charts were the work of a trained corps of specialist surveyors, using unprecedently accurate survey methods and backed by the resources of the largest navy in the world. They were finely engraved, printed on high quality paper, and by the second half of the nineteenth century covered a large part of the navigable waters of the globe. Furthermore they were sold for prices which took no account of the cost of production. In spite of this it was not until the early twentieth century, almost a hundred years after they first went on sale to the public, that they had become the preferred choice of the majority of British navigators and earned their well-known reputation, summed up in the expression 'by God and the Admiralty chart', and there were good reasons for this.;;"historical cartography; navigation; nineteenth century; United Kingdom";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0042814955;1

Land Surveying/Geo-Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong";"It has been widely recognized that, in order to automate the map generalization process, cartographic knowledge needs to be formalized. One method of knowledge acquisition is to analyse existing maps. Previous studies have concentrated on describing the phenomena on the surface. A typical example is the percentage change of the number of symbols or the percentage of open space on smaller scale maps. This study aims to go one step further, i.e. to analyse the association such changes with thematic attributes. In this study, road features on topographic maps of Hong Kong from 1: 1000 to 1:200 000 are studied; six types of thematic attributes, i.e. 'type', 'length', 'width', 'number of lanes', 'number of traffic ways' and 'connectivity', are considered; and two statistic parameters, Lambda and Somers' Delta, are employed. It has been discovered that the dependence of road elimination on these attributes occurs in the following order: type (0.73), length (0.53), number of lanes (0.48), number of traffic directions (0.41), width (0.36) and connectivity (0.19). If these numbers are normalized into percentages, then these values become: type (27%), length (20%), number of lanes (18%), number of traffic directions (15%), width (13%) and connectivity (7%). Such results could be used to formulate an overall weight to determine whether a particular road should be deleted, merged or combined in the generalization process, in order to retain a certain proportion of roads at a smaller scale.";;"cartography; map generalization; road; thematic mapping; topographic mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0036939386;1

The Definitive Map was mainly surveyed by volunteers from all walks of life working to non-compulsory guidelines. The resulting maps differed in accuracy of depiction and content. The inclusion in the national maps specification of information of variable standards caused cartographic design problems and major changes in policy for Ordnance Survey.

It is witnessing a move away from being merely producers of standard scale cartographic products. This research proposes an automated tool for the generalization of geological maps, which may assist the organization in meeting these demands. The research shows that in order to derive a coarse scale geological map from a fine scale geological database there is a requirement for contextual sensitivity. To achieve an appropriate result the interaction between the themes represented on the map must be considered and should reflect the interaction of geological objects in the real world. A case study is presented which illustrates how standard cartographic generalization operations can be combined, using a rule base, into a partially automated process to generalize a geological data set from 1:50 000 to 1:250 000 scale. Independent geoscientific professionals evaluated the results from the case study. The tool provides consistency and tracabilty in the generation of multiscale geoscientific data. The evaluation suggests that, with further research, higher levels of autonomous generalization are achievable. In its current form it is a highly useful tool as a testbed for defining generalization requirements in geological mapping, an aid to the production of standard scale maps and a basis for creating customer specific data sets.;;"automation; geological mapping; integrated approach; map generalization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0036937828;1

The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) has been responsible for the creation of the CORINE Land Cover Map of Great Britain (CLCMGB), using the ITE Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) as the primary input. Several of the CORINE land cover classes are more accurately described as 'land use' classes, (e.g. airports and construction sites). Since a land cover class (as identified on the LCMGB) could be related to several uses, the CORINE land use classes had to be identified separately from the CORINE land cover classes, within the generalization procedure. This was done using traditional methods of visual image interpretation, combined with the extensive use of ancillary land use information. The interactive creation of the land use classes described in this paper is the main component that did not use wholly automated methods; 95% of the CLCMGB was created using automated methods. This paper describes the mapping of the land use classes in detail.";;"automation; land classification; land use; mapping; United Kingdom";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0036077714;1

This paper presents a multi-criteria model for point feature annotation that examines the sometimes conflicting issues in the point labelling process. Based on a maximum labelling model, the primary goal is to place the maximum number of labels on the map, although secondary goals reflect other considerations such as point size, position preferences, and feature importance. By differentially weighting these separate factors, emphasis could be placed on each consideration in turn allowing the cartographer to assess the implications of each factor in the point annotation process. An application of this model to mountain peaks in Grand Teton National Park illustrates how it can assist a cartographer as a preliminary step in assessing the difficulty encountered in labelling point symbols as well as providing the cartographer with a choice of alternative scenarios upon which to base the final placement.;;"automation; cartography; map graphics; place name";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0036074571;1

The paper is aimed at users of LCM2000 and derived data who need to understand more of the map and its characteristics. The paper also outlines plans for making data available to researchers and applied users. The most important development in LCM2000 was the spectral segmentation of images to generate vector land parcels. Land cover was then identified by the spectral classification of the image data in these parcels. Classification used specially developed procedures which exploited known spatial, spectral and contextual characteristics of land cover. The resultant GIS incorporates, within its vector structure, detailed attribute data which record parcel-based land cover, plus information on class probabilities, data on within-parcel heterogeneity, information on landscape structure and context, cover information from LCMGB, together with a record of each parcel's processing history.;;"image classification; land cover; satellite imagery; segmentation; United Kingdom";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0036074570;1

An idealized forest decision support system is then proposed. The trend for spatial decision support system (SDSS) development is the integration of GIS. modelling and visualization. This paper classifies integration methodologies in terms of integration techniques applied and summarizes their advantages and disadvantages.

Two further design examples are produced combining desirable characteristics of the maps examined. The results show both that many of the designs translate well to 1:100 000 scale maps of the British landscape and that there is considerable potential for a topographic base at this scale providing a basis for a national series aimed at tourist and leisure users.;;"historical cartography; topographic mapping; United Kingdom";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0035667017;1

The industry has discovered the marketing potential of the Internet but in many cases has not yet fully exploited the extra potential of web maps compared to the traditional paper maps. Web maps can convey up-to-date tourist information very well but they have to be carefully designed to take account of the limitations of the medium. To be most effective, web maps should be basically simple and convey sufficient information interactively, on request. The map and symbol design should convey intuitively where and how this interaction can take place. This paper summarizes the typical faults found in tourist web map design and provides suggestions on good design practice.;;"cartography; Internet; mapping; tourism";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0035666373;1

Essential and desirable qualities for a cycle-touring map are enumerated, including the need to depict all rural routes available to cyclists: it is concluded that the optimum scale is in the range 1:100 000-1:126 720, and that relief should be shown by contours at an interval not greater than 30 metres. National mapping series in the optimum scale range which were published after 1945 are then reviewed, and reasons suggested as to why none has been kept in print. The mapping available for cycle touring in Britain in 2001 is critically described: it is noted that there is no national coverage in the optimum scale range that although the Ordinance Survey (OS) 1:50 000 Landranger series contains all the necessary information, it is too bulky to be suitable; and that most of the other maps published in the optimum scale range have inadequate relief information and all very limited geographical cover. The potential competition for the OS 1:50 000 from a national map series in the optimum scale range is acknowledged, and an outline specification for a 1:125 000 series is described, which seeks to minimize that competition whilst providing all the necessary information for cycle touring.";;"cycle transport; mapping; recreational activity";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0035665614;1

Sciences, University of Greenwich, United Kingdom;Fighting the 1914-18 war largely on enemy territory in both the east and the west, Germany was at a disadvantage compared to the Allies when it came to survey and mapping as it did not have access to much of the geodetic, topographic and cartographic data, relating to this terrain, necessary for modern warfare - in particular for artillery survey. Germany and Austria did, however, have a commanding lead in terrestrial and aerial photogrammetry, and the latter was to prove crucial in the production of accurate large-scale maps of enemy and occupied territory. Despite strong forces of conservatism in the high and field commands and in the artillery and military survey organizations, new air survey methods based on the photogoniometer and radial triangulation were rapidly developed. Through continual laboratory and field experimentation and testing, Germany was to increase her lead in aerial photogrammetry, and by the end of the war had not only set up a completely new air survey organization but was developing a new generation of optical mechanical stereoplotting instruments of great precision. German progress was not, however, evident in all fields of military survey, and this paper examines the approaches taken by Germany to survey and mapping on the Western Front, and briefly compares and contrast them with those of the Allies.;;"aerial photography; comparative study; historical cartography; mapping; military application; surveying; Germany";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0035575313;1

On 6 June 1944, after years of planning and benefiting from the topographical preparations for, and experience of, the landings in North Africa, Sicily and Italy, over 150 000 men landed from more than 4000 ships along 80 km of Normandy coastline. Careful examination of existing maps revealed that because of its relatively flat terrain and lack of obvious physical obstacles, the area was the most suitable for an Allied invasion. Vast quantities of new maps many drawn up from existing maps, postcards and photographs, and updated using aerial photos and intelligence from various sources had to be prepared. Montgomery subsequently commended the D-Day survey effort, stating that map supply never or failed or prejudiced operations. In turn, the planning and experience of the Normandy landings informed the preparations for operation Anvil, the landings in the South of France on 15 August 1944. This paper examines the development of Allied mapping and geographic support programmes during the two-year period of preparations for D-Day, and during the landings, establishment of the bridgehead and breakout.;;"historical cartography; military application; topographic mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0035572327;1

It appears that these grids can be well explained in terms of the Mecca-centred retro-azimuthal orthographic projection described in 1968 by J.E. Jackson. In this projection the lines of constant latitude reduce to a set of ellipses with their major axes parallel to the equator and the lines of constant longitude reduce to a set of non-equidistant straight lines parallel to the north-south direction. It is shown that the curves actually engraved on the instrument conform to this projection and can be fairly easily constructed. This interpretation of the grids on the Iranian instruments stands in contrast with another explanation, recently proposed by King (1999), which is based on medieval Arabic concepts such as the so-called 'method of the zijes'. Insufficiently accurate workmanship makes it impossible to distinguish between the two explanations through the study of the instruments themselves. The newly gained insight into the projection itself, however, shows that a direct relation between the Iranian maps and Islamic mappings known from the ninth century, as suggested by King, does not exist. Thus, it is concluded that it is as yet completely unknown when and where the very idea behind the Iranian cartographic grid was first conceived, and that the quest for their historical background is still open.;;"cartography; historical cartography; instrumentation";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0034458067;1

This paper addresses various mapping issues such as visualizing, analysing and exploring cyberspace from different aspects.;;"cartography; Internet; virtual reality";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0034457099;1

In this paper, the problem is approached by introducing a model for a multiple representation database (MRDB) system. The term 'multiple representation' refers to a database structure in which several representations at various scales of the same geographic object are included. This structure offers several advantages, one of which is that an MRDB satisfies the varying multi-purpose needs of geographic data in a flexible manner and offers a means for solving updating problems. The system can be supported by an object-oriented approach. However, the most central requirement for the system is that bidirectional connectivities are supported among the various representations. This requirement has been examined in a case study that was implemented in an object-oriented GIS environment. The differences between an MRDB system and a traditional map-product database system are illustrated and discussed.;;"cartography; database; GIS; topographic mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0034456796;1

The system has been developed as part of the Land Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) project. The goal of the system is to develop regional and global typologies of coastal zones using large multi-variable datasets. Our implementation brings together statistical clustering algorithms with visualization capabilities to allow easy analysis and comprehension of the results. The two main tasks of the visualization are to allow for discrimination of multiple classes and to show relationships between those classes. These are accomplished in two different visual presentations. In both cases, the system selects colors appropriate to the purpose. In the latter case - showing relationships - the system uses a novel iterative refinement algorithm to select the colors. The results show that the system is successful at both generating the classes and visualizing the relationships between them.;;"cartography; coastal zone; color; land-sea interaction; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0034456005;1

The automated procedure, based on the two operations known as waterlining and Medial-Axis Transformation, is shown to lead to results that should be similar to those achieved by a trained cartographer working with the traditional manual method. Three aspects of generalization are covered by the procedure: line simplication in general, and dropping and aggregation of features of simple configurations. As regards Perkal's original objective, this presentation proves that it can be achieved by a combination of waterlining operations. The Medial-Axis Transformation, a concept developed within Pattern Recognition, is proposed as the best choice for spanning Perkal's boundary zones. The six generalizations are offered as evidence that the method preserves the general shape of features for lower scale factors and yields simple and compact shapes for larger factors. However, two problems were encountered that suggest that the method still needs further development in order to maintain its fully automated character, Or, alternatively, the method may need to be interlaced with the occasional use of interactive aids. The first of those two problems is encountered in attempting to bridge boundary zones of complex configurations. The second problem arises from the specifications for an autonomous feature dropping procedure and with the need to invoke it. Both problems are considered in some depth.;;"cartography; map generalization; mapping method; Mississippi; United States";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0033791886;1

Philcarto and Philexplo for the Apple Power Macintosh are two such examples of this kind of software package. They are designed specifically to map spatially aggregated data for censuses (population and flats, agriculture, etc.) or specialized surveys (education, health, etc.) in which the 'national space' is divided up into spatial units (regions, departments, municipalities, etc.). Philcarto is an 'interactive cartomatic' program. Using two or three mouses clicks the user redefines the characteristics of the map which he wishes to obtain (the mode of representation, type of 'discretization', colours scales, symbols sizes, final annotations of the map, etc.). The value of this software does not lie with its methodological novelty, but with the ease of its use and the immediacy of displaying a map often compriising several thousand spatial units. Philexplo, by contrast, is a more innovative 'exploratory cartographic' program, the origins of which are based upon difficulties experienced in analyzing spatially aggregated data using 'traditional' statistical methods. The program uses linked windows to display various plots of the data, including a map window. Using various tools, all the displays can be dynamically explored: the plots can be transformed according to various actions of the user (selection of spatial units, 'colourization', etc.) and these transformations are displayed in all the other windows, in all the other plots.;;"cartography; data processing; mapping method; software";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0033788974;1

Recently, the major emphasis has been on 'democratization of cartography', where individuals can be empowered with electronic tools to analyse and visualize spatially referenced data (Morrison, 1994). But, an ordinary user can not effectively use the available GIS tools to visualize geographical data. Therefore, cartographers and/or GIS experts need to develop user-friendly map making systems to facilitate the democratization of cartography. A mapping system was designed using the advanced macro language (AML) and menus of ARC/INFO at the Curriculum for Evaluation and Management Centre (CEM) in Durham University to automate the mapping process (extending from spatial and non-spatial data extraction to the printing of a final map), so that any user can map pupils' locations of any school in the United Kingdom simply by entering some key information. The procedure followed to automate pupils' mapping is described in this paper. A similar programming approach can be helpful to automate mapping systems in a local network and on web.;;"automation; democratization; education; mapping; software; United Kingdom";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0033788864;1

This type of cartography is known as 'journalistic cartography'. Many of these maps are not the work of cartographers but instead the creation of graphic artists who possess a limited knowledge of cartography or have little cartographic training. Despite this the maps produced are often very innovative, unique, and aesthetically attractive. However, journalistic cartography has come under increasing scrutiny from professional cartographers, many of whom are openly very critical of the quality and design of the maps appearing each day in 'the press'. But, whilst it can be argued that some journalistic cartography has a similar role to that played by traditional maps and atlases, the aim and purpose of many of these maps as a communication medium is clearly very different. Furthermore, the role and success of this cartography is dictated not only by the nature of the material, but also by the medium and the context in which the map is to be displayed and used. It is argued that by attempting to make these maps more cartographically correct may serve to remove, or at worst destroy, the freedom of expression typically associated with the development and evolution of this type of cartography over the years, and indeed its success as a medium of spatial communication. The aim of this paper is to briefly examine some of the characteristics and constraints associated with journalistic cartography, and to question the need to impose cartographic tradition on these examples.;;"cartography; media role";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0033501807;1

The prototype system is based on object-oriented techniques and a multiple representation database. The latter consists of a master and a target data set together with connectivities between those objects referring to the same physical entities. The prototype is based on a conceptual framework of four steps: examination, propagation, generalization of updates and solution of spatial conflicts. The rules in these steps are triggered when an object is edited in the master data set. In the examination step it is determined which object should be created, deleted or modified in the target data set according to certain rules. In the propagation step the outcome of the examination step is executed. In addition, in this step the integrity of the multiple representation database is maintained, e.g. connectivities between related objects are set. In the third step the new or modified object in the target data set is generalized to suit the scale of the target data set. Finally, in the last step the constraint method is used to solve the spatial conflicts caused by the update. The paper concludes with a case study, where a map produced by the prototype system is compared to a map produced manually by cartographers.;;"automation; cartographic representation; cartography; data set; map generalization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0033494869;1

In the past, there has been some resistance to such mining and codification of expert knowledge. However, many cartographers now welcome highly interactive computer graphics, computer mapping, and virtual reality systems as providing them with new opportunities for launching cartography into a new creative age. Despite nearly thirty years of research on line generalization algorithms, the available algorithms are somewhat simplistic. This research, undertaken under the auspices of the BCS Design Group, explored the behavioural tendencies of cartographers engaged in line filtering. The results show that a carefully contrived, even if obviously artificial, exercise on the deconstruction of lines into meaningless forms can prompt cartographers to observe, record, and discuss their own cognitive processing.";;"cartography; geography education";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0032697425;1

Maps for road races, such as marathons, are often generalized representations of the route, studied beforehand but rarely required during the race by competitors, and used by spectators as well as entrants. They are often produced by graphic designers. Maps for cross-country events are needed for way finding, but tend to be drawn by amateurs. Their content often does not reflect the needs of the competitors and they are unsatisfactory as maps. The authors contend that professional map-makers are in a position to influence the design of race maps by asking users what their requirements are and producing basic rules which amateur mappers can follow. A survey was conducted to determine the map requirements of cross-country racers and sample maps produced as a result. The sample maps have been well received by runners.;;"mapping; navigation aid; sport";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0032697424;1

This is true if widely separated means at such a remove that one requires a map. We can find our way unaided throughout some neighbourhood of our homes, though its extent varies from person to person and, for one person, with time and conditions. For any person there are, moreover, a variety of partially overlapping neighborhoods, each associated with a particular mode of travel. A neighbourhood may be sketchy and primitive. In other cases neighbourhoods are extensive and known. Within a neighbourhood, orientation is an expression of one's familiarity with the surroundings. Beyond it, some additional device is needed. Such devices are referred to here as maps, or more specifically route maps. The definitions of neighbourhood and map are thus intimately connected. It is concluded that a map is needed whenever we leave our neighbourhood.;;"cartography; mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0032695729;1

The first procedure traces waterlines, the decorative device with which copper engravers differentiated water areas in maps before the introduction of screen-printing. The second procedure resorts to waterlines to perform the Medial-Axis Transformation (MAT), a centrelining operation originally proposed by Pattern Recognition workers. Both procedures are described at a rather high level. Noted as important is the passing on of pointers from the input shapes to the Medial-Axis via the waterlines. Those pointers are characterized as fundamental to the straightforward definition of the Medial-Axis from waterlines. The analogy between a well-known raster method and the vector waterlining and MAT are discussed and their relative merits compared. In this context, the thesis is advanced that the analogy is the reason for the universal applicability of the proposed vector method. Cartographic and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications, such as the delimination of sea boundaries and the centrelining of streams and streets, are illustrated and outlined in brief manner. Even briefer are the references to, as yet undeveloped, applications in those same fields. To conclude, some thoughts are ventured on the use of MAT in related disciplines, such as Pattern Recognition, Geology, and Mining.;;"cartography; computer aided design; mapping method";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0032695440;1

In cartography, the use of colour, in both a traditional and an electronic medium, has been widely discussed. With the growing use of a range of computer software (cartographic, remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and more recently the Internet or World Wide Web) as the main environment in which to design and create maps, and the availability of more sophisticated hardware, there is now an even greater opportunity and freedom of choice to make use of colour as a vital component in the communication of spatial information. The question is how to handle all these colours. This paper explores the importance of both the choice and use of colour in a paper and an electronic medium, and examines some of the ways in which more careful choice of colour can be encouraged in practice to ensure that the growing freedom of use considers the correct use of colour.;;"cartography; color; mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0032470221;1

Once a railway proposal had been approved by Parliament, the railway company had a statutory power to purchase any land which lay on its chosen line, subject only to 'limits of deviation' defining the margins of development allowed. Thus, railway companies were in a uniquely privileged position to redraw the map of British townscapes. Although maps of British towns from the middle decades of the nineteenth century all portray railway facilities to a greater or lesser extent, many of them were specifically designed to emphasise the relationship between the development of the railway infrastructure and the town. Much can be learned about railway development and its impact on the townscape from the combined study of maps relating specifically to components of the town's railway infrastructure and of large-scale town maps which successively portray transport developments within the urban landscape.;;"documentary source; mapping; nineteenth century; railway transport; transpiration; United Kingdom";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0032455618;1

The influence of modern technologies is still not yet significant. Nevertheless, digital cartography is gradually making an impact, especially in the petroleum oil industry. It was found that 76% of the cartographic products are produced manually, whilst 24% are produced in automated and semi-automated cartographic processes. Functionally, maps and spatial data are used in various fields and for different purposes. A variance analysis showed that there is a strong structural relationship between typology and functional use of cartographic products in Nigeria. At the organisational level, however, this relationship is not valid in public and private mapping agencies.

There is little doubt of Ptolemy's contribution to early geographic/cartographic practice or that his Geographia was remarkably reliable in recording most of the first century AD Roman world. However, our confidence in its interpretation to date could be greatly improved. So far, there has been no satisfactory explanation of the 'turning' of Scotland and the majority of Ptolemy's poleis (named places) in Scotland have remained unidentified. In arriving with some confidence at what I regard as an acceptable technical resolution of this problem (Strang, 1994), other conclusions followed.

The cartographic visualization process is changing: changing from being supply-driven to demand-driven. More people will be involved in making maps. More maps will be created, many of them only for a single purpose. These maps are changing from being final products presenting spatial information to interim products that facilitate our visual thinking. These changes require a different type of cartographer, someone who is an integral part in the process of spatial data handling. As well as tradiational cartographic design skills, cartographers must make their knowledge available to fellow geoscientists using interactive real-time maps to solve their problems. A challenge for cartographers is to create or improve mapping tools that allow exploration.;;"cartography; database; mapping; spatial variation; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0032423533;1

Cartography has provided both a pioneering application for the domain, as well as the established archive of paper maps which have been turned into data on the digitising table. The conceptual basis of the map, specifically the Boolean map, has also become fundamental to GIS. To better servce the many users, however, I argue here that GIS must move away from this model for data creation, storage and presentation, and as a result the relation between GIS and cartography must change. Although cartography has undoutedly provided an impetus to GIS initiatives, GIS must change to support real geographical information as it is recorded by domain scientists, and software tools needs to be developed to transform that data into intelligible views and exploratory tools. This can be done with current GIS, but it must be made much easier. With this change the need for cartographic design skills among GIS users will increase rather than decrease. To ensure that geographic information will be intelligible to the investigator and the user 'good' design will be paramount, and is currently noticeable by its absence in system defaults available within GIS.;;"cartography; database; GIS; methodology";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0032409686;1

I first met Helen in January 1971 when, as a postgraduate student, I gave a paper to the annual conference of what was then the Institute of British Geographers. It was in the early days of the application of computers to analyse large historical data sets and I was speaking about how this technology could help obtain information on land ownership from the parish tithe surveys. Re-reading that paper reminded me of what Helen said to me at the end of my talk: 'Don't forget that these tithe surveys were based on maps. Why don't you get your computer to tell us more about the maps? 'So, for the subject of my Helen Wallis Memorial Lecture I return to the tithe surveys of mid-nineteenth century England and Wales, not only because it was through these maps that I met Helen, but also because last year Richard Oliver and I published another monograph on tithe maps.

This paper describes a series of maps supporting the management of a forest area in Austria from 1872 until 1996. The last edition of this series marks the end of an era of forest mapping based on traditional surveying and manual cartography. The historical development of this map series is examined in terms of the type and amount of spatial information. It was found that the locational accuracy of the various maps does not significantly vary. Historical forest maps provide a record of past management practice and may therefore be usefully incorporated into spatial information systems to support current management. Several approaches to converting the forest maps of various dates to digital form were tested and found to give some improvement in metric quality. The remaining relative locational disagreements hamper the incorporation of these historical data in a GIS database.;;"forest management; historical cartography; historical perspective; map curatorship; map development; map series; mapping; Austria";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0031460925;1

These databases can also be utilised for the production of paper as well as electronic thematic atlases using the map design facilities available with ARC/INFO.

Eighty six primary children were interviewed and an assessment made of their identification and interpretation of map-located pictures. Picture recognition and interpretation without reference to any explanatory legend or text were found to be highly variable. Some characteristics of picture misinterpretation are identified and a number of aspects of children's reasoning about picture location are explored. Some tentative guidelines are presented for cartographers and illustrators as well as for teachers and parents.;;"atlas; cartographic communication; map interpretation; picture location";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0030425788;1

A condition of such maps is that each zone should have a different colour from each of its neighbours. It has been proved that a minimum of four colours is necessary for this, although applying these colours to a set of zones is likely to be a process of trial and error until a satisfactory solution is found. The problem is analysed and the procedure for finding a solution is described. In order to automate the task the solution is implemented using PROLOG, a declarative language well suited to this type of problem.;;"cartography; chromatic approach; political map; zonal definition";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0030423056;1

These results are synthesized to recommend the following pairs of hues for use on thematic maps suited to diverging color schemes: red/blue, orange/blue, orange/purple, and yellow/purple. These recommendations are robust because they may be communicated verbally and require no particular color charts or color measurements for use. These color pairs will aid in producing maps of differences and of changes that can be read accurately by all map users.;;"cartography; colour scheme; guideline; map";Review;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0030421112;1

He found distinct French, Scandinavian, and Dutch styles in addition to the classic style of public transport map. Rules are proposed to govern the choice of mapping method, based on the number of transport modes, number of transport services, amount of overlap, and the use of colour coding in the streets. Schematic maps, resembling the London Underground map, are preferable for underground railways, but are definitely not suitable for buses. Factors in the design which need particular attention include: amount of base map detail, map size and purpose, emphasising the name of the terminus, the problem of insets, panels at interchange points, and background colours. Types of maps, previously rarely used, which should now be economically feasible since the introduction of computer mapping, include: maps of subsets, stop-specific route maps, and 'octopus' bus maps of districts. For these proposals to be put into practice, GIS and graphics software, skills and data, found in different departments, will have to be brought together. A checklist is provided to ensure that the best results are obtained with the classic style.;;"cartography; map characteristics; mapping; public transport; transport map; Europe, (West)";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0030420579;1

In recent years, as computerised mapping systems have become widely available and easily accessed by a large community of users who are cartographically untrained, poorly designed maps have been noticed everywhere, in magazines, in newspapers, even in scientific literature. This is because the current software opens all the possibilities for symbol selection to the user.

Types and scales of maps which had formerly been available only to the military or planners are now being sold freely to the general public and to foreigners. Freed from the straitjacket of military requirements and censorship, a number of the former Eastern Block countries are also producing a much wider range of map types.

Existing work is examined and new views are expressed. First of all, the motivation of generalisation is discussed. It is then grouped into two types, i.e. direct and indirect motivation and it is argued that scale is the only element in direct motivation. Based on this argument, two fundamental processes in digital map generalisation are distinguished, i.e. transformation of reality in scale dimension (digital data generalisation) and digital-to-graphic transformation (graphic presentation). Finally, a framework is devised for both of these two processes. © 1995, Maney Publishing.;;"digital map; generalisation";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85047699419;1

Only two of the 95 respondents did not produce any map output. Both maps and tables were most commonly produced for on-screen display rather than as hardcopy. The majority of users produced maps from commercially purchased data. In most cases, the maps produced were not for publication, and there was a corresponding lack of attention to design quality.

Langstone Harbour on the south coast of Hampshire, England, forms the study area. The work is being carried out with the support of The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and Hampshire County Council. As it was found that existing topographic mapping would not provide a suitable topographic base for such an inter-tidal area, metric aerial photography and analytical photogrammetry were employed to create a detailed topographic base. The photogrammetric models were fitted within a control network established using a high precision differential Global Positioning System (GPS). Recorded three dimensional coordinates of archaeological finds and structures will allow the comparison between environmental and locational contexts of coastal archaeological structures. This will greatly enlarge the available archaeological data set, adding value to the data, as well as assisting the study of sea level change and wider coastal processes. Conversion and integration of other environmental data is adding further data layers of the GIS. © 1995 The British Cartographic Society.;;"aerial photography; archaeological data; archaeological evidence; environmental data; GIS; global positioning system; GPS; historical method; inter-tidal zone; photogrammetry; UK, England, Hampshire, Langstone Harbour";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0029527481;1

This paper critiques the use of the art/science dualism as a means of understanding cartography, particularly by those interested in reexamining the role of aesthetics, design, and visual expression in cartography. Two basic approaches to ‘art’ and 'science' in the context of cartography and information graphics are described along with their limitations. It is argued that the manner in which the art/science dualism has been used in cartography does not stand up under close scrutiny and that attempts to strictly differentiate art and science have ended in confusion while simultaneously demeaning both art and science. It is suggested that various and seemingly divergent trends including postmodern deconstruction, hypermedia, cognitive psychology, semiotics, geographical information systems, and visualization all point to a process oriented means of understanding cartography. Within this process, ‘art’ and ‘science’ serve a functionally similar role, informing the different ways in which we come to know and re-know our human and physical worlds. © 1995, Maney Publishing.;;"cartography; deconstruction; GIS; semiotics; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0029476022;1

An alternative approach has been developed which calculates profiles across the contour model, typically at about 1 mm separation at the visualisation scale, in the direction of an assumed illumination source. Intensity values are calculated for the profile swathes by considering profile gradient and local slope characteristics. The resulting shaded model gives an effective visualisation. Single light source images of shaded relief are often incomplete in their rendering because they favour relief trend lines in certain directions only. A technique has been developed to overlay generated shaded images from a range of illumination directions using a multiband approach, which has been found to enhance visualisation. -from Author;;"contour model; digital contour data; relief image; visualization";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0029499537;1

A possible alternative is to derive dasy- metric maps at a fine spatial resolution by making use of satellite imagery in a geographical information system. However, there are cartographic problems when these maps are displayed and further processing is needed in order to obtain approximations to a continuous density surface. Isarithmic maps of these density surfaces retain a high degree of spatial accuracy while providing pleasing and highly adaptable presentations. The methods used to generate dasymetric and isarithmic maps are readily implemented in most raster based geographical information systems. For example, the classification of remotely sensed imagery, the subsequent processing and integration of data, and most of the cartographic display, were all undertaken in this work using the low cost IDRISI GIS that operates on standard IBM PC compatible hardware. © 1994 Maney Publishing.;;"choropleth map; GIS; isarithmic map; mapping technique; population mapping; remote sensing; spatial distribution; article; audiovisual equipment; demography; developed country; Europe; Geographic Factors; geography; Northern Europe; population; United Kingdom; Developed Countries; England; Europe; Geographic Factors; Maps; Northern Europe; Population; Spatial Distribution; United Kingdom; Demography; Developed Countries; England; Europe; Geography; Great Britain; Maps; Population";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0028665603;1

By way of illustration fifteen different road conditions are modelled, for the 10 minute travel zone from the Leicester Royal Infirmary. The catchments at each state are then summed, and the resulting composite catchment is visualized as grey scale images, with zones of equal travel time appearing in similar greys. The observed pattern is of a core-periphery catchment, the core having high probabilities of being within a certain travel time, and the periphery having increasingly low probabilities. Four factors which may influence the size and shape of the zones are described. Finally, discussion centres on the shortcomings of both raster and vector data structures for completing the proposed procedure. © 1994 Maney Publishing.;;"catchment visualisation; core/periphery catchment; data structure; hospital service; service facility; spatial analysis; stochastic catchment; travel time; visualisation; UK, England, Leicester";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0028562027;1

This may be ascribed to the ‘Macintosh’ effect. This in turn led cartographic companies back to the core of their professional know-how: it is cartographers themselves who now develop the scope of their profession, utilising all the resources provided by the new computer technology. But, if cartographers want to keep playing a major role in the geographic information arena, they have to determine and develop the specific elements of their discipline: if technology mobilizes all forces to the detriment of theory, then the discipline progressively weakens and ends in being swallowed by another discipline. It is the cartographers’ task to transform the spatial information from its verbal, social and numerical form into visual form for visual thinking; this visualisation provides for cognitive functions, communication functions, decision support functions and social functions. In order for maps to perform these functions cartographers should continue, now with digital tools, to safeguard data quality by monitoring the compilation stage during which they have to see to it that the heterogeneous datasets in databases will be made comparable, both from a geometrical, semantical, updatedness and completeness point of view. This main aspect of the cartographer’s Job can be called its engineering part. The other main aspect will remain the map design part, that leads to proper communication of the spatial information. Both aspects will remain the cartographer’s domain if he/she succeeds in providing a theoretical basis for his/her work. © 1994 Maney Publishing.";;"cartography; geographic information; map design; visualisation";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0028553919;1

Graphic design toolboxes available with these systems provide virtually anyone with the freedom to make maps to be used either on-screen or as paper hardcopy. With many users possessing little cartographic background and knowledge, the resulting maps are, however, seldom carefully thought out cartographic products designed to communicate information effectively and efficiently. The problem at present is that there are few map design guidelines available to assist users in designing the cartographic output in an electronic medium. This paper seeks to re-emphasize the importance of cartographic design and, using the example of the visual variable colour to illustrate, focuses on some of the associated problems.

The threedimensional map is an example of such a representation. This paper deals with design aspects of the threedimensional map. Traditional cartographic textbooks acknowledge the existence of three-dimensional maps. However, they do not offer design tools for them, as they do for traditional two-dimensional maps. A discussion on the Why?, What? Where? of three-dimensional maps is followed by some design considerations. They involve three-dimensional perception, depth cues and possible presentation techniques.

Special attention is paid to line generalisation. Through analysis, the author emphasizes that ‘data reduction’ is applied when the scale change is not of concern, while generalisation is applied due to the change in scales. Therefore, data point reduction algorithms should not be used for generalisation purposes. Also different benchmarks such as the manually generalised versions of existing maps should be used for the purpose of evaluating line generalisation algorithms instead of always using the original feature. © 1993 Maney Publishing.;;"data reduction; line generalisation; scale change";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85047696951;1

Two coastlines are used to compare the performance of this, with that of the widely used Douglas-Peucker, algorithm. The results from the area-based algorithm compare favourably with manual generalisation of the same lines. It is capable of achieving both imperceptible minimal simplifications and caricatural generalisations. By careful selection of cutoff values, it is possible to use the same algorithm for scale-dependent and scale-independent generalisations. More importantly, it offers scope for modelling cartographic lines as consisting of features within features so that their geometric manipulation may be modified by application- and/or user-defined rules and weights. The paper examines the merits and limitations of the algorithm and the opportunities it offers for further research and progress in the field of line generalisation. © 1993 Maney Publishing.;;"cartographic line; Douglas-Peucker algorithm; line generalisation";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0027877110;1

Large-scale mapping really started after the beginning of the 19th century. The maps were meant for military use, though civilians have always admired them. Since 1970 all large-scale topographic mapping published since 1800 has been made available to the general public in facsimiles or as atlases which are sold in their hundreds of thousands in The Netherlands. Is this because The Nether¬lands is a densely populated country, because there is a cultural-historical tradition or because of the use of the right marketing techniques? With these atlases, map departments can easily fulfil their needs for basic topo¬graphic information, old and new. But the biggest advan¬tages are the availability of toponymie indexes and the ability to compare topographic data chronologically. © 1993 Maney Publishing.;;"atlas; facsimile; topographic data; Netherlands";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0027493725;1

From a cartographic point of view it is necessary to look at the implications of the use of animated maps. The paper concentrates on communicative aspects of the spatio-temporal map. In order to obtain some concrete evidence of the response of users to spatio- temporal map displays a map user test was carried out. Animated maps and the respective static ones depicting the same subjects were presented to the users and questions were asked. The results indicate that although the correctness of answers is not influenced by the type of map (i.e. static or animated), the users perceive faster from animated map displays. © 1992 The British Cartographic Society.;;"animated maps; cartographic communication; spatio-temporal map";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0027088008;1

The solution proposed is algorithmic, stepwise and works for vector data only. The steps include data preprocessing, area expansion and contraction, elimination, reselection, aggregation, displacement, integrity check, smoothing and reduction. Among the generalisation rules which were applied are: (1) emphasis on larger patches at the expense of smaller ones, preservation of the overall figure/group relationship, partial topological integrity, and (4) differential displacement according to patch area.

In most discussions of line simplification algorithms, it is assumed that the parameters for the simplification, such as the bandwidth or the percentage reduction in objects, have already been determined and are constant. There is rarely any discussion of how parameters are set. In this case, one enters the line simplification problem at the second stage, dealing only with the issue of determining which segments to retain. Although simplification operators exist to eliminate detail as map scale changes, there is little connection between scale and the bandwidth parameter. As scale changes, there are no established guidelines for setting a bandwidth. However, Topfer and Pillewizer's radical law states that the number of objects to be retained in a scale change is proportional to the square root of the scale change. This paper presents a method for combining the quantitative measure of how much detail to retain with a qualtitative measure of which detail to retain in an attempt to produce a better objective method for implementing the subjective rules of manual compilation. © 1992 The British Cartographic Society.;;"digital simplification; digitisation; line simplification";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0027059438;1

The objective is to ascertain which topographic information is needed, who should provide it, on what terms and through which mechanisms. Prior to making an attempt to answer these questions, the essential characteristics of Ordnance Survey (OS) are summarised as deduced from available documentary evidence1; the changing attitudes to information as a commodity, the growing competition in British mapping and the government’s stringent requirements from the Survey are also outlined as just three of the many complexities which affect OS. Building upon Smith’s classic 1979 paper and subsequent experience, the rationale for government involvement in mapping is examined. It is concluded that the Survey has a continuing vital role though there are a number of steps which the OS should take in order to adapt to changing circumstances. © 1991 Maney Publishing.";;"government involvement; national mapping; OS; topographic information";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85047696663;1

Such data may be compressed by detecting and storing the critical points of contour lines. When hand digitising a contour map, a trained digitiser operator would usually select points which visually appear to be critical points. Existing interpolation techniques often fail to restore the critical points, including turning points, to their original positions. This article illus¬trates the use ofsplines composed of quadratic Bézier curves with monotone curvature for rendering contour lines which are represented only by their turning and end points, such that the positions of the turning points are preserved. © 1991 Maney Publishing.;;"Bezier curve; contour line; interpolation; quadratic spline; turning point";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0026304807;1

This definition has its origins in an investigation made by the author in 1963 and 1964, though any credit (or blamej for the final wording must be given to the original Council of the British Cartographic Society.

World maps show the locations of and relative distances between places, but the cartographer’s choice of map projection system and geographic origin for the projection can significantly affect the apparent distances between places on the map. The study reported here was designed to investigate the relationship between the emotional involve-ment of a sample student population with hypothetical events in a number of world locations and the distance between ‘home’ and those locations as shown on different map projections. Results showed a consistent inverse relationship between interest and distance, with the interest level for the same cities changing as distances (projections) were changed. Other variables also influenced people’s responses. Overall, women expressed significantly higher emotional involvement with places than men, and certain regions produced a higher or lower level of response than would have been predicted by distance alone. © 1991 Maney Publishing.;;"distance-interest relationships; emotional involvement; gender difference; map projection; perception; place";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0026277099;1

To do so, we must consider the process of spatial knowledge acquisition, the role of maps in that process, and the content of cognitive representations derived. Research from psychology, geography, and other disciplines related to these issues is reviewed. This review is used to suggest potential new directions for research with particular attention to spatial problem solving and geographic instruction. A classroom experiment related to these issues is then described. The experiment highlights some of the implications that a concern for the process of spatial knowledge acquisition will have on questions and methods of cartographic research as well as on the use of maps in geographic instruction. It also provides evidence of independent but interrelated verbal and spatial components of regional images that can be altered by directed map work. © 1991 Maney Publishing.;;"classroom experiment; cognitive representation; knowledge acquisition; map; map usage; spatial awareness; spatial knowledge";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0026268530;1

This paper argues that the needs of such users are poorly met by the ‘mainstream’ model for GIS that is often presented in the literature. A PC-based system, equivalent in GIS terms to the spreadsheet, is described. It integrates simple data structures, limited map creation and editing, a powerful range of standard and spatially orientated statistical functions, and the ability to interactively present results through chloropleth, contour, proportionate symbol, or proximally shaded maps. It is par-ticularly designed to be easily accessible and to encourage visual interactive analysis. For some users such a system has acted as an adequate solution in its own right and for others it has provided a useful educational transition to more extensive and powerful systems. © 1990 Maney Publishing.";;"data structure; spatial analysis; visual analysis";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0025691999;1

Investigations have revealed that there is a lack of uniformity in the public information symbols used on tourist and recreational maps around the world. It is perceived that a need exists to develop a set of standardised public information symbols for this large group of map users. A range of theoretical and practical influences on the development of such symbols are examined to provide a sound basis for their design. As a result, a systematic pro-cedure is proposed for designing public information symbols. To test this procedure, a study was completed to develop a prototype set of public information symbols for use with computer (raster-based) generated tourist and recreational maps. This set of symbols is organised around the following classification: accommodation, cultural features, entertainment, facilities, recreation, services, transport, uniques features and warnings. This prototype of symbols could form the basis of a standardised set of com-puterised public information symbols. © 1990 Maney Publishing.;;"computer-generated map; mapping technique; public information symbol; recreation; recreational mapping; symbol standardisation; tourism; tourism mapping";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0025660408;1

The advent of reasonably-priced colour processors, such as the Pluto controller, has allowed the development of programs that produce images more acceptable to the landscape designer. This article describes briefly the nature of landscape design and discusses the part terrain modelling and perspective drawing plans in the design process. There then follows an evaluation of the methods by which computers depict living plant material. The article concludes with a description of a system that tries to reproduce more closely the type of graphics generally expected or sought by landscape architects. © 1990 Maney Publishing.;;"colour processor; computer technology; computer visualisation; design process; graphics reproduction; landscape architecture; perspective drawing; planning tool; Pluto Controller Colour Processor; technological application; terrain modelling; visualisation";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0025656072;1

Six map complexity measures (aggregation index, compactness index, boundary contrast index, fragmentation index, boundary index, size disparity index) described in literature are presented in this study. Correlation coefficients between these indices are calculated, using 90 different maps. It is shown that most of the measures are highly correlated and therefore redundant. Visual judgement of 13 maps by 28 subjects shows that four indices (aggregation index, compactness index, fragmentation index, boundary index) can serve as reliable indicators of map complexity. As a result, each of these measures can be used to compare pattern complexity among different maps. The fragmentation index seems to be the best choice in view of its simplicity and calculation ease. © 1990 Maney Publishing.;;"choropleth map; complexity measure; map";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0025624814;1

As a central component of the sport, therefore, mapping has assumed a prominent role in the thinking behind ‘The Forward Plan’, a study promoted by the British Orienteering Federation (BOF) and sponsored by the English Sports Council. The mapping component of ‘The Forward Plan’ suggests that extending awareness of mapping and encouraging technical skills are vital steps. The role of institutes of higher education (universities, polytechnics, colleges) in these areas is examined in this paper. The objective is to determine to what extent tertiary educational establishments can assist, in a non-commercial manner, in increasing production and improving standards of orienteering mapping. © 1990 Maney Publishing.;;"education; higher education; mapping; UK";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0025621408;1

A ‘mapping tool’ is developed for the manipulation and display of spatial information, which is a cost-efficient, self-contained utility system that is suitable for use on micro-computers. It has the ability to be integrated as part of any modelling or information system. Diverse applications using the ‘mapping tool’ are briefly described including resource management systems for planners, mass balance studies in urban catchments and data entry systems for physically based models. © 1990 Maney Publishing.;;"mapping; micro computer; raster; vector";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85047697203;1

Cartographic sources have largely been ignored in studies of industrial location, yet they have much to offer, illuminating the subject in ways which documentary sources cannot. The most comprehensive cartographic source of information on industrial location in England and Wales during the ‘Industrial Revolution’ is the family of large-scale county maps produced between 1700 and about 1840. Their worth as a source of industrial information has generally been underrated.

Although, when displayed, it does not provide an immediate visual three-dimensional image, it is useful in practical applications. It is tedious to manually draw or extract data from a contour map. The ability to store contour maps for computer processing is thus desirable. A contour map is conventionally stored in a computer as a set of polygons. This method unfortunately requires a large amount of storage and is not convenient for subsequent editing of contour maps. More recent techniques use cubic splines with mathematical continuity. Although such techniques require less storage than the conventional method, they do not provide a convenient means for subsequent editing. From recent reports on research in Computer Aided Geometric Design as well as in Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing, it seems that cubic splines with geometric continuity rather than mathematical continuity are more appropriate for computer graphics applications. This article examines the appropriateness of geometric continuity in the development of software for contour map editing. © 1989 The British Cartographic Society.;;"CAD; contour map; cubic spline; map editing";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0024783495;1

CAD provides the technology for mapmakers to integrate, at different degrees of sophistication, the many facets of map making into a linked information chain so that maps are easy to make, revise, view, understand and communicate. Implicit in the CAD concept is the recognition that maps, which represent the end products of the mapping cycle, are shared graphic databases to be used in other information cycles. The uses to which these graphic databases can be applied are only limited by the imagination of man. To harness the full power of CAD technology, standards for graphic interchange formats must be firmly established. This paper examines the problems of graphic database interchange standards from across the CAD spectrum: from microCAD to mainframe CAD, and looks at some solutions to these problems. © 1988 The British Cartographic Society.

Accuracy generally improved over time, but one map was found to be less accurate than expected, given its date. The direction of the error vectors tended to be aligned more with longitude than latitude. Segments of the coast with larger populations were generally more accurate than less populated areas.

The number of class intervals can be directly computed by means of appropriate statistical methods if the widths of classes are determined by t-test, i.e. when their difference is significant at a high level of confidence. A class narrower than this width would represent data in different categories due only to variance, however, the selection of wider classes leads to a certain loss of information. The class intervals determined this way should be positioned on the statistical data-set so that each category contains approximately equal number of data providing maximum information content of the output map.

In some instances cartographers need to consider projections on which continental shapes are closely preserved. The proposition offered here is that continental shapes are best preserved on the familiar orthographic projection. A world projection is devised by developing a composite of several orthographic views, each of which best illustrates the five major continents. Subjects were tested for judgments of continental centres, and these are used for orienting the oblique projections. The final composite world projection is new. This process demonstrates how the map projection and its selection is a dynamic part of overall map design. © 1987 The British Cartographic Society.

Capabilities in these areas continue to grow and improve but often are limited by comprehension on the part of producers and users, by lack of prudent planning, and by insufficient funds to accomplish identified objectives. In this complex situation, an important role is developing for cartographers with different skills than their predecessors, but with some similar functions: interpreting and representing spatial data for users, maintaining the spatial integrity of data and bringing expertise to the effective development of data bases responsive to a broad array of users.

Testings on two different types of such lines show that none of the current generalization algorithms most frequently cited in the literature preserves fractal dimension and statistical self-similarity in a consistent fashion. The walking algorithm used to measure fractal dimension is suggested as an alternative method for generalization. The method not only preserves fractal dimension, it also produces generalized lines whose average angularity and overall displacement are very much in line with the best results provided by other generalization algorithms. © 1987 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0023486928;1

Such systems are based on MARC records which nevertheless represent a national standard for bibliographic information interchange. However, the flexibility and im¬provement in efficiency of relational database systems offer enormous potential for new approaches to information management, including graphics-based data retrieval and automated graphic indexing. If they are to be widely used, and their potential realised however, it must be possible for them to store data in such a way that standardised records can be generated when required. The first stages in the implementation of a full-scale system of this kind for map cataloguing of sheets and their various editions within map series are described and the problems encountered discussed. The results of user-trials with the National Library of Scotland Map Room are assessed' and the place of such a system within a larger scheme of automated infonnation management for geographical enquiry is elaborated. © 1987 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0023482549;1

Focusing on the form of the final map product, cartographers developed totally distinct algorithms for the display of choroplethic and isarithmic maps. However, both types of maps can be stored as a digital image using a triangular data structure. A more general display algorithm is presented to transform the digital images into their respective graphic forms. © 1986 The British Cartographic Society.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0022854410;1

Subjects were asked to rank alternative symbols for 17 topographic map features. In addition, every subject was required to construct their own symbol for each feature. For all but three of the features, certain symbol choices were unambiguously better than other choices. Equally desirable symbols were found to vary from being very simple to being quite complex for a number of the features. A symbology was derived from these results and was evaluated in a second human-performance based experiment. Subjects viewed both monochromatic or chromatic maps that were constructed from either the derived symbology or a control symbology consisting of geometric shapes. The subjects were asked to identify (interpret) or locate (search) specified map symbols. It was found that performance with the derived symbology was better than with the geometric symbology for both dependent measures, regardless of whether colour coding was used. Thus, the derived symbology is a promising alternative to color topographic maps, such that color coding could be used to portray important dimensions of overlaid foreground information. © 1986 The British Cartographic Society.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0022839734;1

The effect of experience on topographic map reading was tested in an experiment in which subjects viewed ten maps while their eye movements were recorded, and answered questions on absolute and relative heights. Experienced readers performed better on the questionnaire test, especially for the relative height portion. For maps that had distinctive relief features, experienced readers had shorter fixation durations (indicating less processing difficulty) and higher numbers of fixations (indicating greater attention) to areas containing absolute heights. Visual search by experienced readers was apparently guided by familiar patterns of contour lines that they had developed through experience. © 1985 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84975023619;1

Through an examination of their application to discussions of cartography as a natural language and the problems of map learning and map complexity, it is concluded that current models have strong explanatory power.

Macrosigns (localized signs) are ultimately composed of minimal signs and in turn combine in texts. Accordingly, there are a local and a supra-local combinatorics (syntax), which are essentially different. Minimal expressions are jointly meaningful and distinctive, and distinction is differential or gradual. Signs are arbitrary or motivated, but motivation is a crucial trait of the system. Rules for linking expressions to contents are global or pertain to the individual map. Notwithstanding its semantic specialization, map symbolism is productive. © 1985 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0022251183;1

The British forces, which were marching toward Palestine, had no town maps of some of the key towns of Palestine. Towns situated beyond the front line, such as Gaza, Beer-Sheba, Ramleh and others were photographed by the Air Squadrons and maps of the towns were made. The first map, that of Gaza, was produced on 25 January, 1917 being probably the first town map ever made by the use of aerial photographs. Other maps, which were produced during 1918, like those of Nablus and El Kerak were maps which demonstrated a new solution to the problem of the use of aerial photographs for the purpose of mapping towns situated in hilly areas. Town maps for the Palestine Front were an immediate necessity, not an academic exercise and the war served as an immediate catalyst. The photographs and maps produced then are excellent historical documents, particularly because of their high quality and preservation. © 1985 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0022248868;1

The effect of experience on topographic map reading was tested in an experiment in which subjects viewed 10 maps while their eye movements were recorded, and answered questions on absolute and relative heights. Experienced readers performed better on the questionnaire test, especially for the relative height portion. For maps that had distinctive relief features, experienced readers had shorter fixation durations (indicating less processing difficulty) and higher numbers of fixations (indicating greater attention) to areas containing absolute heights. Visual search by experienced readers was apparently guided by familiar patterns of contour lines that they had developed through experience.-Authors;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0022213698;1

This paper presents an alternative approach to encoding choropleth maps where the neighbourhood relationships are encoded using the node as the organisational unit. The direct relationship between choropleth base maps and a Thiessen diagram enables the same triangular data structures developed to store a Delauney triangulation to be used to store a choro¬pleth map. Individual polygons are retrieved by enumerating the sequence of nodes that comprise their outline in a clockwise manner. The commonality among the data structures for storing different types of maps should permit the development of general purpose display algorithms. © 1984 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0021578760;1

It is possible to develop such lines which closely approximate ovals, regular polygons or rectangles, using the well-established complex-algebra transformation of the Stereographic projection. Since a map is usually bounded, by a rectangle, the use of appropriate transformation coefficients to achieve lines approaching this shape permits the design of conformal sheet maps with less distortion than that found on other projections. © The British Cartographic Society.

By comparing predicted patterns with their own, geographers can decide whether or not a map will portray the intended message. One way to accomplish this goal is to model the way in which readers combine symbols to form patterns. For this purpose, the mathematical technique of cluster analysis is used to simulate how readers visually cluster circles on graduated symbol maps. © The British Cartographic Society.

Results of many studies in experimental aesthetics suggest that the proportion of 1:1.6, the golden proportion, may have special universal appeal. A paired comparison experiment was conducted to determine whether people have any consistent preferences for the proportions and shapes of graticules. Elliptical and rectangular figures which ranged in proportion from 1:1.0 to 1:2.5 were used. A strong preference was found for ellipses over rectangles, but there was not evidence of a ‘golden graticule’ in the proportion of 1:1.6.

The technique can yield three types of maps: a map showing what land use will cause the least change in environmental processes, a map showing qualitative predictions of environmental impacts of proposed developments, and given certain developmental actions to be carried out and specific environmental actions to be controlled, a map showing the most and least suitable locations for those actions.

DAFSA is based on the variance spectrum and modulus ratio spectrum as the fundamental Fourier shape descriptors for analysis and interpretation. Any closed cartographic form can be decomposed into its respective harmonic frequency components which can be rationally interpreted in terms of the contribution that a specific frequency and related attributes of it are making to the shape in question. As such the DAFSA descriptors are independent of scale, translation, rotation and starting point of the figure. © 1982 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0019911972;1

The symbol dimensions and patterns in the legend should be as identical as possible with those used on the map to avoid confusion and reduce inefficiency in the information communication process. Re-designing standard legend formats so that legend symbols are seen in a visual context more closely resembling their actual situations within the body of the map may significantly improve the efficiency of map information processing. An experiment was conducted to determine whether map reading performance efficiency could be improved using a ‘natural’ legend design versus a standard or conventional legend design. © 1982 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0019909667;1

Clutter was investigated in an experiment using a 1:50 000 geological map. Twelve representative map reading tasks were used to compare map reading performance on maps which differed only in their topographic base. The aim was to assess the effect of removing topographic symbols which are of only minor importance to the map reader. This reduction in visual clutter significantly improved performance on a number of the questions. Some evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that line symbols clutter other line symbols, and point symbols clutter other point symbols, but there is little effect between the two. In practical terms the removal of minor point symbols and type led to larger improvements than the removal of minor line symbols, even though more of the latter were deleted. The relevance of the experiment to other geological maps, and to maps in general, is discussed. © 1982 The British Cartographic Society.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0020435945;1

Possibilities for cartographic communication have been greatly expanded with such interactive cartographic computer systems. A key concept in the power and flexibility of such interactive systems is that of real and virtual maps and transformations that can be made between them. One can now look past current interactive cartographic systems for display, analysis and map production to the potential of more powerful and flexible real-time interactive cartographic systems which can deal with more complex forms of cartographic situations and include the manipulation of a number of aspects of spatiotemporal dynamics. These include cartographic object manipulation and surface exploration, the display of cartographic data as it changes through time, and combinations of the above. © 1980 Maney Publishing.;;"display; interactive computer graphic systems; map production; surface exploration; transformations";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0019188504;1

Although literature from other disciplines suggests that less than massive amounts of information can overload the visual information processing system, there has been considerable debate in cartographic circles as to the applicability of these assertions. In the present study, a simple paradigm was utilised to investigate the relationship between amount of graphic information and the accuracy of processing-response during a map-like visual choice task. Four experiments are reported in which subjects had to quickly detect whether two circles at the ends of a row matched the size of a circle in the centre of that row. The presentation time was 100 milliseconds. Six sizes of circles ranging from 0.48 to 1.6 cm in diameter were used as stimuli. The end circles were presented at three different widths under four different conditions. In Experiment 1 the centre and end circles were the only stimuli presented. In Experiment 2 the same symbols were presented inside of 1.7 cm2 cells. In Experiment 3 the target symbols were presented as the end points of a row of boxes with additional information (other circles) between the central and exterior targets. In Experiment 4 these same rows were presented surrounded by 12, 20, or 28 cells containing some combination of circle sizes as extraneous information. The results of the experiment indicated that the introduction of additional graphic information (circles and cells) significantly decreased accuracy of response in respect to the performance recorded when no additional information was available. It is proposed that map readers are unable to ignore unwanted or irrelevant graphic information during a similarity task. © 1980 Maney Publishing.;;"accuracy; map readers";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0019151040;1

The reader must process these visual inputs into concepts and also blend these fixation based inputs into a composite of the original image in order to come to some conception of the displayed message. The numerous information processing activities thought to accompany this visually induced synthesis are examined from a cartographic point of view with particular attention paid to the roles of Brief Visual Storage, Short Term Memory and Visual Conspicuity. The processes that occur during visual search reduce the efficiency of sensory information and influence the ability of the reader to correctly interpret the mapped message. Many of the limitations on the reader's perceptual abilities appear to be organismic rather than of a cognitive nature and, therefore, may suggest absolute limitations on the ability to communicate visual information.

The interest of the map maker tended therefore to be restricted to projections whose properties facilitated accurate representation of direction, distance and area, to the neglect of other systems less well adapted to such purposes. The characteristics of the orthographic projection, formerly discounted, should now commend it for a greater role in cartographic communication especially in the space age. However, construction of the most frequently required oblique version by methods dependent on draughtsmanship, the camera or the computer may overtax either the patience or resources of the average cartographer. As an alternative, general mapping equations are derived and it is suggested that the pocket calculator can be used to evaluate these to provide sufficient co-ordinates for plotting useful graticules. Construction of some examples incorporating enlarged insets is discussed together with the plotting of great circle tracks and satellite orbits. © 1979 The British Cartographic Society.;;"cartographic communication; general mapping equations; great circle tracks; satellite orbits";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0018669904;1

Evaluation of the experimental results revealed that elements which could be related to the terrain, or were aspects of it, could be located more rapidly when shading was present. Only when the target could not be perceived easily with peripheral vision, did the visual noise in the relief depiction appear to adversely affect performance scores. Thus, while the value of contours is recognised, the graphic continuity and imageability of shading may provide perceptual advantages to the map user in performing a wide variety of map reading tasks. © 1978 The British Cartographic Society.;;"contouring; hill shading; map interpretation";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0018668279;1

Eye movement recording demonstrates that this search time depends on two independent factors: The number of names fixated with the eyes and the mean fixation time. Changes in map design usually affect only one of these factors. For example, typographic coding can reduce the average number of fixations but an increase in point size reduces mean fixation time. This discussion leads to some recommendations on type legibility. © 1978 The British Cartographic Society.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-7044265447;1

It provides facilities for interacting with the data on the screen, and also for creating accurate hard copy on microfiche. The plotting speed is fast, being more comparable to that of a small format storage display, than to that of a high-accuracy flat-bed plotter. Thus the Laser-display has many advantages over the more familiar storage and refresh displays or plotters. This paper describes the integration of such a display into a pre-existing system that produces maps by interactive graphics and other automated methods. Special emphasis is placed on its interactive use, although use as a plotter is also discussed. The display is evaluated as a cartographic tool. It is concluded that the display can be used to provide a faster and more efficient tool for interactive graphics in high-accuracy automated cartography. © 1977 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84975012721;1

These questions are examined through the perception of children and young adults, ranging from the sixth grade to the college freshman level. The results indicate that hypsometric maps using spectrally ordered colours accurately transmit data concerning topographic elevation, but also transmit inaccurate unintended information concerning vegetation, rainfall, and temperature. Little variance in the results occurs between the different age levels. © 1977 Maney Publishing.";;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84974990348;1

Apparent value rescaling of graduated circles has no inherent effect on visual cross-correlation, and another type of design modification is needed to improve judgments of similarity. Regression-based scaling is grounded in the linear regression model underlying the product-moment correlation coefficient and is a means for obtaining similar map patterns for highly correlated geographic distributions and dissimilar patterns for uncorrelated distributions. Although this design modification destroys the symbols’ ratio scale, value estimation tasks are not obstructed if legends contain representative ranges of circles sizes. © 1977 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-79951953287;1

The function of cadastral maps is to describe the boundaries of properties. In some systems, the information on cadastral maps is definitive whilst in others the map is only an indication of what may be found on the ground. The cadastre may be used for taxation purposes or for registering ownership but more recently there has been a trend towards the multipurpose cadastre in which a wider range of information may be recorded. © 1977 The British Cartographic Society.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84975022609;1

It was therefore decided to investigate the potential of computational tech¬niques to produce the required maps. This was performed by employing a d-Mac digitising table to generate the required coordinates and by processing the information on the Univer¬sity of Aberdeen's ICL system 4/70 computer, the output being on drum plotter. © 1976 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84974992825;1

It is now generally accepted that the study of how maps convey knowledge to a recipient, and therefore the study of the percipient as well as the process, are important areas of research. Various models of communication systems are analysed from the point of view of the inputs and transformations involved. The element of “noise”, characteristic of all systems, is examined as it relates to the map. The problem of assessing the amount of information included in a map and the efficiency with which geographical knowledge is evoked in a percipient is reviewed. Because a map is a two-dimensional presentation it is a very different form of communication from the one-dimensional linear forms that depend upon a temporal sequence, and consequently, the techniques of information theory are judged not to be directly applicable. © 1975 The British Cartographic Society.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84974987830;1

If a map is to be used in both colour and monochrome, special attention must be given to the choice of colours so that they will still be distinguishable after being transformed into shades of a single colour. This problem is especially apparent in the representation of quantitative data, where the chosen area symbols must maintain their apparent relative value order in both colour and monochrome.

Many of the questions showed large and statistically significant differences between the four types of map, but no single type of map was best for all purposes. The results demonstrate that the choice of an appropriate relief map has a very real effect on the map reader's performance, and that this choice must depend on the way the map is to be used. © 1975 The British Cartographic Society.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84974959875;1

The kit may be used to produce single copy maps but is more likely to be used to produce map-masters from which copies may be vacuum- formed.

Tests with dot densities and circles indicate that either rescaling of symbols (design) or the allowance of some feedback (reader training) will result in more accurate median estimates. The feedback approach, however, is associated with a greater dispersion in estimates, i.e. estimates are less clustered about the median. When both the rescaling and feedback approaches are used, both the medians and dispersion are improved. A different experiment, involving map comparisons, shows that a small amount of reader training can clarify the concept involved in that task and such clarification increases accuracy. While both design modification and reader training induce improvements in map communication, these improvements are different in nature; the two approaches are not substitutes for one another but are complementary. © 1975 Maney Publishing.";;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84974941526;1

Each site is then examined in detail by drawing the profiles of the terrain along scan lines radiating from the site. From these profiles any possible obstructions to the radar beams by the surrounding area can be determined. This consideration together with other factors such as site accessibility, will allow the choice of the optimal location to be made.

Comparisons were made between perceived dimensions and assessments of map efficacy and between pilots' and navigators' assessments. The perceived dimensions correspond to major known differences in cartographic content and coding and were associated with the assessments of map efficacy. None of the maps tested was ideal; and pilots tended to be more critical of the maps than navigators, perhaps because they have less time for map reading inflight. Pilots preferred maps with bold, distinctive layer tint colours for representing relief, and both groups preferred maps with reduced information content and less visual clutter. 1:250 000 scale maps for en route low altitude high speed flight should use smaller selection rates for features than on conventional 1:250 000 scale maps and should be designed to give a clear and unambiguous impression of features that are distinctive from the air. © 1974 British Cartographic Society.";;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0005047833;1

The necessary software was provided by programmers within the Department. The system has been developed, according to the special needs of the Survey Department, although it would be relatively easy to adapt to other types of mapping. Digital mapping is quite successful and now accounts for about 25 per cent of all mapping.

Accurate and inexpensive land use maps consequently can be produced directly by computer without recourse to a costly process of locational re-coding of individual land units.

Data, consisting of sampling site locations and the concentrations of some thirty elements in active stream sediments in part of Northern Ireland, were written on to magnetic tape in the proposed standard exchange format before being transferred from the AGRG to the ECU. Research indicated that proportional “wind-rose” symbols seemed to be the best compromise solution. Test maps using “wind-rose” symbols produced at varying scales and with different backgrounds by automated means. Evaluation tests were then devised and geochemists and cartographers used as test subjects. The results of these tests were low levels of accuracy in counting and estimating values; in addition, the effects of varying the cartographic parameters, such as map scale, were minimal.

The first method involves the use of the parallel perspective projection produced by coupling a photogrammetric plotter with the Perspektomat P-40 for the construction of three dimensional urban maps directly from aerial photographs. The second method involves the mapping of land use for each floor of the building on separate, stable transparent plastic sheets by means of pre-printed stick-on geometric patterns. By overlapping one sheet on top of the other, a superimposed pattern map of urban land use is produced. The advantages and disadvantages of these two methods are discussed and the significance of these methods to urban geographers and town planners is examined. © 1973 British Cartographic Society.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84974892903;1

Two hypotheses are tested. First, that the relative size (area) differences of graduated squares are judged on the basis of area, rather than on the basis of a linear dimension. Second, that the relative magnitudes are estimated accurately. The results of the research positively support the above assumptions. © 1973 British Cartographic Society.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84974883979;1

A map using progressively lighter shades of red waS most effective in conveying the concept of areas of greater and lesser temperatures to most students. A map similarly shaded in only blue colours was almost as effective, despite the supposed association of blue with coolness. The third map, using shades of both red and blue was least effective. These preliminary results demonstrate that the quantitative message inherent in a progression of darkness and saturation is far more potent than the warm and cool association known to reside in red and blue hues.

Cartographers are constantly striving to produce better maps, through more carefully composed ‘messages' and more easily decipherable symbolism. Many maps already fulfil most of the requirements of functional efficiency, making them ‘good' in a communication sense, but a breakdown in communication often occurs. Map users misuse, misunderstand and mistake the reliability of maps, and are therefore frequently responsible for this breakdown. Techniques of ‘consumer research' and human factors' analysis currently being employed to provide for improved maps, are examined and evidence is found which supports this indictment. Finally possible remedies, particularly in the field of education, are indicated. © 1972 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84974883700;1

It is suggested, therefore, that a systematic method based on Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) theory may be of value for evaluating the transfer of detail when planning map products. In order to maximise photomap detail the original photograph should be enlarged to a point where the MTF of the enlargement will not degrade the printing MTF. As the printing process is often limited by the method of screening the image, screening techniques which result in the retention of spatial frequencies to beyond 5 ljmm are required. Based on theoretical analyses of different types of imagery, enlargement factors of 4 to 8x for high-altitude aerial photography, less than lx for ERTS A imagery and from 10 to 20x for SKY LAB photographs will result in quality photomap products, provided suitable printing techniques are employed. © 1972 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84910157153;1

The specific hypothesis being tested in both experiments was as follows: That the use of the shaded relief technique of terrain representation decreases the legibility of all other symbols appearing on the map thereby making the information represented by those symbols less accessible to the map reader. This results in a significant increase in the time necessary to extract required elements of non-terrain information from the map. Results of the initial experiment confirmed this hypothesis. A replication experiment found a statistically insignificant difference between the two versions of the test map. © 1972 Maney Publishing.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84975016522;1

Subjects searched a variety of maps under several different conditions. There are four major conclusions from this research. For random search of the maps containing only one typeface, the typographic variation from map to map did not produce a significant effect on average search time. On mixed-type maps, search is slowed if the user has no correct expectation of the appearance of the type in which the target name will appear. On these same maps, search is greatly speeded if the user has a correct expectation of the target name appearance. Search time in a one-name task is less a function of typography than it is of many other factors. © 1970 British Cartographic Society.;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84975001922;1

In choosing the best route he needs to know for each available route the likely journey time, cost, safety, amenity, mental ease, physical comfort, certainty of following the route and the availability of services. the relevance to these needs of about 30 possible road classification criteria is discussed. Among the most relevant are availability, average overall speed, delay probability, accident rate, and ‘arteriality’, together with the marking of distances, tolls and road numbers, and the correct plan representation of the road. Use of the most relevant classifications may be prevented by the lack of published data, the cost of obtaining data from unpublished records or from road or aerial surveys, the need for simplicity, or the limitations imposed by representation. Some practical possibilities appear to be more specialised road maps; maps of typical speeds estimated from available data with the aid of traffic engineering theory, and perhaps presented in the form of modified mileage figures; and the collection of relevant data by government.

Existing topographic maps with overprints, used for visual navigation, were largely supplanted by special charts for navigation and traffic control from the ground. the various types of map and chart, according to their functions, scales and methods of presentation, are classified. After 1919 the development of international aviation brought about the need for international co-operation in cartography, in which the I.C.A.O. has played an important part. Great technical advances during and after World War II demanded reappraisal of the types of chart produced, and in particular the relationship of world chart series with other geographical map series. the need for series at smaller scales is examined. Cartographic aids to space exploration and the mapping of the moon have introduced an entirely new set of problems for modern cartography, and the methods devised will influence cartographic techniques in general. the analysis of air traffic by cartographic techniques is an important aspect of the thematic mapping of communication patterns. © 1966, Maney Publishing.

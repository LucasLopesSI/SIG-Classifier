Abstract
The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), the ﬁrst relatively high spatial
resolution near-global digital elevation dataset, possesses great utility for a wide
array of environmental applications worldwide. This article concerns the accuracy of
SRTM in low-relief areas with heterogeneous vegetation cover. Three questions were
addressed about low-relief SRTM topographic representation: to what extent are
errors spatially autocorrelated, and how should this inﬂuence sample design? Is
spatial resolution or production method more important for explaining elevation
differences? How dominant is the association of vegetation cover with SRTM
elevation error? Two low-relief sites in Louisiana, USA, were analyzed to determine
the nature and impact of SRTM error in such areas. Light detection and ranging
(LiDAR) data were employed as reference, and SRTM elevations were contrasted
with the US National Elevation Dataset (NED). Spatial autocorrelation of errors
persisted hundreds of meters spatially in low-relief topography; production method
was more critical than spatial resolution, and elevation error due to vegetation
canopy effects could actually dominate the SRTM representation of the landscape.
Indeed, low-lying, forested, riparian areas may be represented as substantially higher
than surrounding agricultural areas, leading to an inverted terrain model.

1 Introduction

In February 2000, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was ﬂown on the
Space Shuttle Endeavor for 11 days; the radar sensors acquired 12 terabytes of terrain
data, covering 80% of the Earth’s land surface from 60°N to 60°S (Farr et al. 2007).
Several years of processing by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the German Air
and Space Center culminated in the release of the ﬁrst relatively high spatial resolution
near-global elevation set. The ability to employ terrain analysis for locations world-
wide has beneﬁted scores of applied and scientiﬁc research projects (Zandbergen 2008)
that would have been impossible to conduct without this dataset. However, research
results are only as reliable as the data that underlie the analysis; this article is con-
cerned with quantifying SRTM error and associating it with land cover factors in
low-relief landscapes. Early sensing system-based evaluations of error sources and
magnitudes resulted in the speciﬁcation of a vertical absolute height accuracy of less
than 16 m (NASA 2002). Analysis across six continents along roadways using kine-
matic global positioning systems (GPS) data supported this assessment, with 90%
errors of less than 5 m (Rodriguez et al. 2006). Since the release of the research data
beginning in 2002 and the ﬁnished SRTM digital elevation model (DEM) in 2005,
additional studies have employed accuracy assessments of the product. Some have been
continental or global in scope, while others have focused on smaller regions with
existing high quality elevation reference data. In the following paragraphs ﬁndings in
two areas: the spatial properties of SRTM error and the association of vegetation cover
with SRTM error are reviewed.

It is well documented that digital elevation model error from a diverse range of
data products is spatially autocorrelated. This has important implications for error
propagation (Hunter and Goodchild 1997) and simulation modeling (Fisher 1998,
Holmes et al. 2000, Kyriakidis et al. 1999). Several recent studies have considered the
spatial properties of SRTM error in different regions. Hofton et al. (2006) do not
report directly on the spatial structure of SRTM error, but their maps indicate sub-
stantial positive spatial autocorrelation. Shortridge (2006) calculated a semivariogram
of SRTM errors and found autocorrelation persisting to 800 m. In their global assess-
ment, Rodriguez et al. (2006) identiﬁed both very long range and short range corre-
lation in SRTM height errors. At ﬁne spatial
they identiﬁed spatial
autocorrelation persisting for about 200 m. None of these studies considered the impli-
cations of spatial autocorrelation on subsequent analysis of SRTM error, including
sample design concerns.

scales

Vegetation cover appears to be a particularly important factor in SRTM error, due
to the tendency of the signal to reﬂect from the canopy. Elevations in non-vegetated areas
tend to be relatively accurately portrayed relative to elevations in forested and agricul-
tural cover classes (Bhang et al. 2007, Carabajal and Harding 2006). In a global study,
mean SRTM-satellite altimeter differences were found to vary on a continent by conti-
nent basis due to surface characteristics (Berry et al. 2007) and discrepancies were
especially pronounced between open and forest covered land. Bourgine and Baghdadi
(2005) identiﬁed a positive bias between the SRTM DEM and elevation data obtained
from laser collection methods over forested areas in French Guiana. Similarly, a regional
investigation of SRTM error structure in France determined that coniferous forests evince
a stronger upward bias than deciduous forest, and non-forested areas including crop
lands had lower average errors (Castel and Oettli 2008). Other studies have conﬁrmed

this positive relationship between elevation error (e.g. biased upwards) and height of the
canopy (Hofton et al. 2006, Shortridge 2006). Since dense vegetation cover effectively
screens the surface, ﬁne-scale topographic patterns may be obscured or missing in the
SRTM DEM (Valeriano et al. 2006).

This research extended knowledge about SRTM error properties in three impor-
tant ways. First, it considered SRTM elevation error properties throughout spatially
contiguous regions instead of at points. This perspective concentrated on understand-
ing the spatial structure of elevation error, which is critical for independent sample
designs, error propagation modeling, and evaluating the impact of error on derivative
DEM products. Second, this research considered the accuracy assessment problem
from a resolution-based perspective. Differences between elevations collected or pro-
duced at different resolutions may be due to spatial scale effects rather than absolute
error. That is, differences may be due to error in one or both datasets, or they may be
ontological: that the topography represented in one dataset, at one spatial scale, is
it
distinct from the topography in the other and not directly comparable. Third,
focused on error in the globally available SRTM 3 arc-second DEM using high accu-
racy light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-derived reference data, as well as additional
elevation and land cover datasets and products. In the United States, relatively high
quality elevation data are available from the National Elevation Dataset (NED); the
similarity of the NED product to SRTM was considered. Each of these contributions
was framed as a research question and is considered in more detail in the following
paragraphs.

It was hypothesized that SRTM error in low-relief regions is strongly positively
spatially autocorrelated, with important implications for spatial sampling designs,
for descriptive statistics quantifying DEM accuracy, and for modeling the spatial
distribution of error. The spatial properties of elevation error across two low-relief
study areas in Louisiana with distinct land cover and geomorphologic properties
were quantiﬁed. High-resolution, high-accuracy LiDAR-derived DEMs were avail-
able as reference elevation data for these areas.
It was hypothesized that differences between LiDAR-derived elevations and SRTM
elevations result more from differences in sensing methodology than from differences
in spatial resolution. The Louisiana LiDAR-derived DEMs were resampled to 90 m
and elevations compared with 1 arc-second and 3 arc-second SRTM datasets, as well
as with 30 m and resampled 90 m resolution NED DEMs.
It was hypothesized that variability in low-relief SRTM DEMs is driven by local
forest cover characteristics. While the link between error and vegetation is well-
established in the literature, here the focus was on low-relief areas, where vegetation-
induced error may in fact dominate local terrain variability. The US National Land
Cover Dataset (NLCD) was employed for the two Louisiana study areas. More
vegetated areas were expected to have larger average SRTM DEM error variances
and magnitudes. Furthermore, error variances were expected to be very large relative
to elevation variances.

These questions are addressed in the remainder of the article. The next section describes
the study areas and datasets employed, and covers the means by which comparisons were
made. Experimental results are documented in the following section, and the article
concludes with a discussion of the implications of the results for the use of SRTM DEMs
in low-relief areas and for error modeling.

2 Data and Methods

from 92°37’36.4″W, 30°7’31.4″N in the southwest

Two rectangular study areas in western and northwestern Louisiana were employed for
this study. The ﬁrst area, referred to as Acadia after one of the parishes it overlies, covers
2,023 km2 and extends
to
92°7’29.3″W, 30°29’54.7″N in the northeast. This low-relief region is characterized by
cropland, pastureland, and poorly drained soils (McDaniel et al. 2006). Figures 1 and 3
depict elevation and land cover, respectively, for this area. The climatic and soil proper-
ties of parts of the Acadia study area create suitable conditions for rice cultivation, which
covered about 9.0% of this area (USDA 2006). The second area, referred to as Webster
that parish, covers 1,469 km2, extending from
because it overlies a portion of
93°37’23.1″W, 32°37’38.9″N in the southwest corner to 93°15’12.7″W, 33°0’3.0″N in
the northeast corner. Figure 2 depicts elevations for this area. The Webster study area is
predominantly forested (USDA 2006). The Bodcau Wildlife Management Area and the
Kisatchie National Forest are located in this study area. The diverse land cover of this
area includes cypress swamps, upland pine, hardwood forests, grassland, and open ﬁelds
(LWLF 2005); a land cover map is illustrated in Figure 4. Webster Parish is comprised of
level to steep uplands and terraces, with poorly drained soils that are not conducive to
agriculture (Kilpatrick et al. 1998).

2.1 Data Sources

LiDAR-derived DEMs are the best publicly available high-resolution elevation data for
several portions of the United States, including most of the state of Louisiana. A

description of LiDAR technology can be found in Lillesand et al. (2004). The LiDAR-
derived DEMs were obtained from Louisiana’s statewide GIS site (Atlas 2007). As part
of the editing of the LiDAR data prior to public release, heights affected by vegetation
and structures in the data were removed from this dataset (Cunningham et al. 2004).
This post-processing resulted in a more reliable source of reference bare earth elevation
data for comparison to the SRTM DEM. Processed LiDAR DEM tiles were downloaded,
converted to raster, integer format, and pieced together to obtain seamless coverage of
each study area with a spatial resolution of 5 m. LiDAR data are, of course, not without
error; indeed, the presence of vegetation and above-ground structures is problematic for
the LiDAR sensor as well as the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) used to
develop the SRTM DEM (Cowen et al. 2000). Multiple canopy layers may also result in
signiﬁcant error (Hodgson et al. 2003). Nevertheless, the vast number of points emitted
by an airborne LiDAR sensor, coupled with careful postprocessing (Liu 2008), results in
vertical and horizontal errors an order of magnitude below those of airborne IFSAR
DEMs (Hodgson et al. 2003). This level of accuracy was considered sufﬁcient to employ
LiDAR as reference elevation data. Vertical units of the LiDAR DEMs were converted
from feet to meters. These DEMs were then projected and resampled via nearest-
neighbor interpolation to 90 m. The coordinate system employed for all elevation
datasets in the study was UTM zone 15N, WGS84 datum (horizontal and vertical) in
units of meters.

The National Elevation Dataset (NED) DEM was obtained from the US Geologi-
cal Survey (USGS 1999, 2009). The NED 1 arc second DEM was downloaded for
selected Louisiana study areas, projected with a cell size of 30 m, and resampled to
90 m by the nearest neighbor method to match the resolution of the SRTM. Finished
SRTM 1 arc second and 3 arc second data were obtained from the USGS seamless
server for the study areas (NASA 2002, USGS 2009). The SRTM 1 arc second and 3
arc second data were projected and resampled to 30 m and 90 m resolution, respec-
tively. No ﬁlling operation was employed to ﬁll voids in any DEM. NED, LiDAR, and
SRTM DEMs employ different vertical datums: NAVD88, NAVD88, and WGS84,
respectively. The average difference between WGS84 and NADV88 was about 0.6 m
for the Louisiana study areas (Roman 2007). This value was added to the NED and
LiDAR DEMs, so that those elevations would match the WGS84 datum of the SRTM
DEM.

Maps of the ﬁnal LiDAR and SRTM elevation datasets may be visually compared for
Acadia and Webster in Figures 1 and 2. The LiDAR 90 m was subtracted from the SRTM
90 m to obtain the SRTM – LiDAR error grid for each study site.

Land cover information was a critical secondary variable in this study. Raster US
National Land Cover Data (NLCD) 2001 data were obtained for the study areas and
projected and resampled to 30 m resolution (USGS 2003). This dataset was subsequently
resampled using a focal majority (3 ¥ 3) operation to obtain the major land cover code
for each cell of the SRTM 90 m DEM. The 90 m NLCD datasets were reclassiﬁed into
seven categories based on the hypothesis that SRTM error characteristics are a function
of land use and cover characteristics. In particular, it was expected that SRTM elevation
samples from forested and non-forested locations would have signiﬁcantly different error
means. Table 1 summarizes the aggregation of NLCD classes for this study. Non-forest

categories included water, developed, and agriculture/barren, while forested categories
were deciduous forest, evergreen forest, forest/shrub, and woody wetland. The open
water class remained in its own group, since the radar sensor has been observed to
respond differently to water than to land surfaces (Kiel et al. 2006). Cells with NLCD
2001 values 21–24 were aggregated to a developed land use group, since they represent
built-up surfaces on the landscape. Vegetated classes were aggregated largely according
to canopy height and character. Barren land was grouped with the pasture/hay,
herbaceous/grassland, and cultivated crop classes because all of these land covers have
little vegetation above the Earth’s surface, particularly in the study region during Feb-
ruary. Evergreen and deciduous forested categories were maintained as distinct classes
because their canopy structure characteristics could generate different error patterns in
the SRTM DEM. Since IFSAR does not penetrate the tree canopy completely, because its
short wavelength is prone to scattering by branches and leaves (Walker et al. 2007), the
presence or absence of leaves in forested environments could impact SRTM error char-
acteristics (Carabajal and Harding 2006, Shortridge 2006, Zandbergen 2008). The
mixed forest class (NLCD code 43), deﬁned as one with deciduous and coniferous tree
species, was combined with the shrub class (NLCD code 52) as a heterogeneous vegeta-
tion class. As emergent herbaceous wetlands (NLCD code 95) represent very small
portions of the study areas, this class was aggregated with the woody wetlands class
(NLCD code 90). Figures 3 and 4 portray the land cover maps for the Acadia and
Webster study areas. The overall proportion of each of the seven analyzed classes was
calculated and used to stratify the sample.

2.2 Sampling Methodology

Two concerns shaped the sampling methodology: selection of spatially independent
observations of elevation error, and selecting observations stratiﬁed by land cover type.
Since spatial autocorrelation exists in the DEM and error grids, determining its persis-
tence is useful for setting a minimum distance between sample points. The ArcGIS
Geostatistical Analyst (ESRI 2008) was used to examine the semivariogram of the error
grid to measure its spatial autocorrelation (Figure 5). The bin size of the semivariogram
was set to 90 m, the cell size of the SRTM DEM. The major range indicates the average
minimum distance between uncorrelated cells. For the Acadia study area, which shows
no clear sill, a minimum inter-sample distance of 800 m was used. At this distance, the
semivariance (gamma) is about half of the range of semivariance values. The semivari-
ogram for SRTM error in the Webster study area showed a clear leveling-off at a distance
of about 650 m. Thus, sampling in this study area was constrained such that no sample
point was less than 650 m from its closest neighboring sample point. The minimum
inter-sample distance and the spatial extent of the areas imposed an upper limit to the
sample size for either area. Based on this, goals of 1,500 and 2,000 randomly sampled
locations were chosen for the Webster and Acadia study areas, respectively. These sample
sizes were determined based on the size of the study area and the maximum number of
sample points that could be obtained with the minimum inter-sample distances. Strati-
ﬁcation by land cover category data introduced a further constraint on the sample size.
A minimum threshold of 20 points was set for each land cover/land use category to
ensure reasonable sample sizes. Hawth’s tool extension for ArcGIS (Beyer 2004) was
used to select the sampling locations for each study region. The Hawth’s tool extension,
frequently employed in spatial ecological applications, enables a random sample of
points to be generated with a certain distance between sample points. For the Webster
study area, all classes were represented in the sample. In the Acadia study area, the small,
compact spatial distributions of water, deciduous, evergreen, and forest/shrub classes
resulted in sample sizes below the minimum; these classes were removed from subsequent
analysis. Points with missing data were removed from the sample. Final sample sizes for
Webster and Acadia were 1,484 and 1,924, respectively.

2.3 Accuracy Assessment

To assess the second aim, correlation coefﬁcients were calculated between elevation
data for LiDAR, NED, and SRTM at horizontal spatial resolutions of 5, 30, and 90 m
for the two study sites. Each correlation coefﬁcient measures the similarity between a
particular pair of elevation data products. A value of 0 indicates no association, while
a value of 1 indicates a positive, completely linear relationship between the elevation
data.

The third aim of this study was concerned with assessing errors grouped by land
cover class. At each sample location LiDAR 5 m, LiDAR 90 m, NED 30 m, NED 90 m,
SRTM 30 m, SRTM 90 m, and the generalized land cover class were extracted. Error at
each sample location was calculated as SRTM – LiDAR, so that a positive error indicates
that the SRTM elevation is too high. Root mean square error (RMSE), a commonly used
accuracy metric, was calculated to summarize the quality of SRTM and NED DEM
elevations relative to LiDAR for each landcover type:

where N is the number of sample points and DEMi represents the elevation value
(SRTM or NED) for the ith sample location. SRTM elevation errors were also grouped
into forested and non-forested categories and evaluated with a difference of means
t-test (alternative hypothesis: forested elevation error > non-forested elevation error).
In addition, the meaningfulness of the differences was considered relative to the
total variability of the reference elevations. The relative error deviation (RED) was
introduced:

.

This ratio, the proportion of the standard deviation of the SRTM error to that of the
reference elevation data, reﬂects the degree to which observed variability in the SRTM
elevation data is due to random or structured noise, rather than to underlying variation
in the land surface. This value was calculated for forested and non-forested elevations in
both study areas.

3 Results

3.1 Spatial Structure of SRTM Error

SRTM errors are mapped for Acadia in Figure 6 and Webster in Figure 7. Visual inspec-
tion suggested that error was not distributed randomly in these landscapes. Indeed,
areas of low and high error were highly concentrated in both areas. Variography of the
SRTM error grids for the two study regions indicated that error was strongly positively
spatially autocorrelated, with very low semivariances at distances of a few hundred
meters, rising relatively rapidly to much higher semivariances after 1,000 or more
meters (Figure 5). For Acadia, semivariance rose from approximately 2 to above 12
over 5,000 m with no well-deﬁned range; for the sampling distance threshold an inter-
mediate level was chosen. Error variability for Webster elevation was considerably
greater, with short range semivariances of about 7 and a sill of 30, with a range of
about 2,000 m. Error analysis using every grid cell observation would be affected. In
particular, metrics concerned with variance,
including the root mean square error
(RMSE), may be underestimated due to the positive autocorrelation of the observa-
tions. This concern justiﬁed the employment of the spatially separated samples for
subsequent analysis of SRTM error data.

3.2 Roles of Production Method and Spatial Resolution in DEM Differences

LiDAR, SRTM, and NED elevations were contrasted at distinct spatial resolutions to
evaluate the importance of production and scale in elevation error. A visual comparison
of Figures 1 and 2 indicates substantial differences between the LiDAR and SRTM DEM
products. Agricultural and other small-scale constructed topographic features, such as
canals, were apparent in the high-resolution LiDAR DEM for Acadia. The 90 m SRTM

DEM contained striping on the south-eastern portion of the Acadia study area. Similar
striations have been identiﬁed by Bhang et al. (2007) as radar-speciﬁc production artifacts,
and were interpreted as such here. Important differences were also observed in the eleva-
tion distributions, which are summarized in Table 2. Both resolutions of SRTM DEMs
contained much higher maximum elevation values, along with greater means and standard
deviations, than NED or LiDAR DEMs. Minimum SRTM elevations were dramatically
low for Acadia; while minimum elevations were near zero in the NED and LiDAR products
regardless of resolution, the SRTM products had elevations dozens of meters below sea
level. Differences due to spatial resolution appeared correspondingly modest.

Correlation coefﬁcients were calculated between each dataset to assess the corre-
spondence of elevation distributions from different resolutions and production sources
(Table 3). High correlations (>0.9) were observed between same-source, different-
resolution elevations in Acadia. In particular, resampled 90 m LiDAR was very highly
associated with its 5 m source (0.989). While LiDAR and NED correlations were also
high, much lower correlations were observed between these and the SRTM elevations.
Similarly in Webster, high correlations (>0.95) were observed between same-source,
different-resolution elevations. LiDAR and NED were nearly as correlated, while some-
what lower correlations were observed between these and SRTM elevations. In particu-
lar, SRTM 90 m elevations for the Acadia study area were particularly poorly correlated
with reference LiDAR elevations and NED, suggesting that the SRTM DEM is not
representing this particularly low-relief area with much ﬁdelity.

One-sided t-tests of the sample SRTM – LiDAR differences yielded signiﬁcant results
(alternative hypothesis: SRTM – LiDAR difference > 0 m) for both the Acadia (sample
mean = 2.8 m, t = 32.09, P << 0.0001) and Webster (sample mean = 7.2 m, t = 49.50,
P << 0.0001) areas. These results indicated a positive, upward bias of the SRTM DEM.
RMSE for the SRTM elevations were 4.7 m and 9.1 m for the Acadia and Webster
datasets, respectively, indicating substantial differences in these low-relief areas between
SRTM and LiDAR datasets.

3.3 Land Cover and SRTM Error

The third set of results is concerned with the relationship between elevation error and
land cover. A comparison of the Webster elevation error (Figure 7) and land cover maps
(Figure 4) reveals striking visual associations. The forested areas toward the center of the
Webster study area corresponded with higher positive error. However, SRTM errors in
the non-forested, water-ﬁlled bayous were lower than average. In the eastern uplands,
there were alternating patterns of high and low error, which might be attributed more to
changes in slope than to land cover characteristics. A similar alternating pattern of error
was visually identiﬁable in the Acadia area in Figure 6 as well. Patches of high and low
SRTM error values occurred throughout the upland portions of this area. Rectangular
patterns of neighboring high and low error situated in the south-central portion of the
region suggest that particular land cover features, such as sharply delimited forests, were
responsible for these patterns. As with Webster, particular land cover within Acadia
(Figure 3) appeared strongly associated with SRTM error.

Figure 7 Webster SRTM error

SRTM elevation errors for the non-forest classes (developed, water, and agriculture)
and forest classes (evergreen, deciduous, forest/shrub, and woody wetland) were then
evaluated. Substantial differences were present for the error distributions grouped by
land cover. For Acadia (Table 4, Figure 8), average elevation error in the forested wetland
class was over 7 m higher than the non-forested classes, with a correspondingly greater
RMSE. A similar relationship existed between forested and non-forest classes in Webster
(Table 5, Figure 8). The agriculture class had the lowest average error and RMSE in both
areas. The open water class had an intermediate amount of error in Webster.

Difference of means t-tests were conducted to determine whether SRTM DEM error
differed signiﬁcantly between forested and non-forested classes (alternative hypothesis:
forested errors > non-forested elevation errors). For the Acadia area, average error for the
forested elevations was 8.9 m, while average error for the non-forested elevations was
1.5 m. The test value was 31.76, which was signiﬁcant at the 95% conﬁdence level (P <<
0.0001), indicating that SRTM error was greater within forested classes for the Acadia

study area. Similarly, for the Webster study area, the mean error of the forested classes
was 7.6 m, which was signiﬁcantly greater than the mean value of 2.8 m for the
non-forested class (t = 12.06, P << 0.0001).

Elevation error standard deviations for different land cover classes were also calcu-
lated. Error variability was particularly large for wetland and forested classes. This offers
further evidence for the effect of canopy cover on elevation estimates, as crop heights
across agricultural ﬁelds in winter would remain relatively constant (and low) in contrast
to the variation and range of vegetation cover height in wetland areas. Relative error
deviation was also calculated. For Acadia, this proportion was 1.11 for forested areas
and 0.53 for non-forested areas. This implies that the observed variability due to error in
SRTM elevations dwarfs actual terrain variability in forested areas, while the ratio was
substantially less, though still sizeable (50%), in non-forested areas. In Webster, the

relative error deviation was lower and more uniform: 0.46 for forested areas and 0.42 for
non-forested areas. This suggests that forest cover is not a substantial source of variabil-
ity in SRTM elevations in Webster, although error bias in forested areas was considerably
greater than in non-forested areas (Table 5).

This research has evaluated three research questions concerning the nature of SRTM
elevation error in low-relief areas:

1. To what extent is error in low-relief terrain spatially autocorrelated?
2. Are elevation properties related to spatial resolution or production method?
3. How dominant a role does vegetation cover play in SRTM elevation variability?

In resolving the ﬁrst question, elevation errors were found to be strongly spatially
autocorrelated, with correlations persisting for hundreds of meters. This has important
implications for the sampling, analysis, and modeling of SRTM error. In this low-
variability landscape (standard deviation of 4 m), an RMSE of nearly 5 m indicates a
substantial degree of uncertainty.

The second question was resolved in favor of production technology. Very high
correlations (r > 0.9) were observed between 5, 30, and 90 m resolution elevations from
the same data source, indicating that in these low-relief areas, cell size determines
elevation values only moderately. Correlations were also high between NED and LiDAR
elevations, but much lower between SRTM and other elevations. Positive average errors
in the Acadia and Webster study areas indicated a positive bias of the SRTM DEM
compared to the NED and LiDAR DEMs. This bias was attributed to radar scattering by
vegetation cover above the bare-earth surface. NED and LiDAR DEMs were quite
similar in spite of their different production methods. The substantial difference between
SRTM and the other DEMs therefore appears related to production method. Spatial
resolution of the DEM appeared to be less important.

The third question concerned the role of vegetation cover in SRTM error in low-relief
areas. Substantially higher average errors and variances were associated with forested
areas in both study regions. Vegetated wetlands along riparian networks were subject to
high positive SRTM elevation error averages and variances, producing distinct spatial
patterns. These included rectangular level patches, which could possibly correspond to
ﬁelds or forest patches. Agricultural and developed areas had low error magnitudes. These
results conﬁrm prior research (Bhang et al. 2007, Carabajal and Harding 2006, Short-

ridge 2006) identifying positive associations between vegetation canopy density and
SRTM error. This association is almost certainly due to properties of the sensor used to
produce the elevation data. The C-band used to develop the global SRTM dataset
transmits and receives short wavelengths (5.6 cm) (Farr et al. 2007), which do not
completely penetrate tree canopy. While this effect is predictable, its magnitude in
different environments must be measured empirically, as in this article. In the low-relief
context of this research, positive bias due to canopy effects affected the elevation model
substantially, increasing apparent relief and terrain variability. Large negative errors were
also identiﬁed. Many of these locations had SRTM elevations many meters below sea
level, with potentially serious implications for applications utilizing this DEM.

The spatial distribution of forested classes within either study area is not spatially
random. For Acadia in particular, forested areas are concentrated in bayous, leading to
especially large pockets of positive error in the lowest portions of the landscape. As
Acadia is a low-relief area, with LiDAR elevations ranging from -6 m to 22 m above sea
level, the presence of positive error values averaging over 8 m in the bayous has a
tremendous effect. Indeed, as Figure 1 illustrates, many of the highest SRTM elevations in
the entire study area occur in places with much lower LiDAR elevations. It can be said that
the Acadia DEM is an inverted terrain model for the relatively low, vegetated, riparian
portions of this region. This has critical implications for applications using SRTM data to
characterize surface water ﬂow, soil wetness, erosion and deposition, and other hydro-
logic factors. In addition, terrain derivatives such as slope and aspect may be affected by
sudden SRTM elevation changes along the edges of forested land cover patches (Zand-
bergen 2008). Such changes occur along the boundaries of riparian areas and agricultural
ﬁelds in the regions studied here. SRTM terrain inversion is likely to be an important
problem for any region with low overall relief and a concentration of forested, dense-
canopy vegetation in wetter portions of ﬂoodplains unsuited for cultivation.

Terrain is important for much geographic research across social and environmental
domains. In many parts of the world, SRTM may be the best available product for
incorporating topographic variables at local and regional scales. This intensive investi-
gation into the nature of SRTM error in low-relief areas with a diverse and spatially
variable range of land cover can inform application-oriented research in other parts of
the world with similar characteristics. Error variability may be greater than that of the
elevation surface itself, and terrain inversion may be a substantial problem for such
regions. Researchers who must rely on SRTM to characterize topographic character in
low-relief settings should exercise great caution in interpreting results.

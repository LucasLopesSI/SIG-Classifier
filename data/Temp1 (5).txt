Abstract. Agronomic soil management and decision-making frequently requires
the joint classi(cid:142) cation of soil variables. Fuzzy set theory is often used to accomplish
this task. This paper addresses the issues of objectively de(cid:142) ning fuzzy membership
functions (FMF) and reducing classi(cid:142) cation uncertainty with hedge operators.
As an example, soil in North-east Thailand was classi(cid:142) ed according to its inherent
potential to support the recovery of a rice crop after a drought spell. The utility
of auxiliary information not directly included in the classi(cid:142) cation was explored.
A tree cover density index was employed for an objective de(cid:142) nition of the
FMF to classify soil organic matter content and plant-available potassium.
Mapping units were allocated to classes having low, medium or high availability
of these plant nutrients. It was shown that crisp, Boolean style classi(cid:142) cations
severely misclassify land in all but one class. Adjusted FMF decreased the uncer-
tainty contained in thematic class maps. Single FMF values for soil organic
matter and plant-available K were then jointly modelled and the soil classi(cid:142) ed
as having low, medium and high potential for rice plants to recover from drought
impacts. The very and more or less hedge operators were applied to increase or
decrease the joint FMF values using farmer’ knowledge about soil fertility. Overall
classi(cid:142) cation uncertainty using FMF was decreased by 14% if the standard FMF
was adjusted and the generated membership values were hedged. It was shown
that adjusting FMF in(cid:143) uenced the uncertainty components vagueness and ambi-
guity diŒerently; the former increased slightly but the latter was drastically
reduced.

Introduction
Uncertain spatial reasoning is an integral component of everyday life and decision
making (Dutta 1991) and encompasses vagueness and ambiguity. The former is
associated with the di(cid:141) culty of making precise distinctions in vague conditions and
the latter requires decisions between two or more alternatives (Klir and Folger 1988 ).
Decisions about management of soil resources are no exception and made in the
presence of uncertainty because soil geographical boundaries and soil attribute class
boundaries are vague (Leung 1987). Agronomic soil management decisions call for

the simultaneous consideration of several agro-ecosystem components that are uncer-
tain in nature: irrigation requirements depend on rainfall and also soil hydrological
characteristics; soil chemical and physical as well as plant nutrient uptake
characteristics are a pre-requisite for e(cid:141) cient and environmentally sound fertiliser
applications.

Fuzzy sets (Zadeh 1965) naturally lend themselves to modelling uncertainty in
vague and ambiguous conditions. Numerous applications in natural resource man-
agement have proved the utility of the theory (Bardossy and Disse 1993, Zhu et al.
1997 ) and review articles (McBratney 1992, Van Gaans and Burrough 1993) and
textbooks on spatial analysis (Bonham-Carter 1994, Burrough and McDonnell 1998)
promote it. Applications of fuzzy set theory for modelling generally include fuzz-
i(cid:142) cation, fuzzy set operations, and de-fuzzi(cid:142) cation and the application algorithms
are becoming increasingly available in commercial computer packages (Wang et al.
1990 ).

If we consider X as a set, then A is considered a fuzzy subset of X if it comprises
a set of ordered pairs {[x, FMFA(x)]; x ×X; FMFA(x) ×[0,1]}, where FMFA(x) is
the grade of membership of x in A. The grades are assigned by the fuzzy membership
function FMFA. The fuzzi(cid:142) cation then comprises the de(cid:142) nition of the fuzzy member-
ship function (FMF) and the assignment of membership grades to all x in A. Fuzzy
set operations involve multiple fuzzy subsets, example operators are intersection and
union. De-fuzzi(cid:142) cation is necessary if the fuzzy consequence of a fuzzy set operation
must be replaced by a crisp consequence.

Notwithstanding the success of fuzzy set applications, critical issues remain in
the three operational phases described above. Fuzzi(cid:142) cation suŒers from the arbitrary
de(cid:142) nition of the membership functions (see Banai 1993, McBratney and Odeh 1997,
Burrough and McDonnell 1998). The impacts of diŒerent fuzzy set-theoretic oper-
ators (see Dubois and Prade 1980, Zimmermann and Zysno 1980 ) and linguistic
modi(cid:142) ers on the results of fuzzy set operations are not yet fully understood. First
attempts to prevent loss of information during the de-fuzzi(cid:142) cation were made only
recently (Burrough et al. 1997). The de(cid:142) nition of a FMF has received particular
interest in soil survey and soil quality assessment. For instance, Dobermann and
Oberthu¨ r (1997 ) achieved a more realistic classi(cid:142) cation using fuzzy sets but suggested
that FMF should be de(cid:142) ned dynamically based on objective criteria.

The objective of our study was to develop classi(cid:142) cation algorithms for using
auxiliary information in fuzzi(cid:142) cation and fuzzy set operations to reduce uncertainty
in the classi(cid:142) cation process. We explored ways of dynamically adjusting FMF in
regional modelling, using soluble organic matter (SOM) and plant-availabl e K in
North-east Thailand as an example. Recent research on drought in rainfed rice lands
in North-east Thailand suggests that high soil fertility, achieved through high con-
tents of plant-availabl e nitrogen and potassium (K), may alleviate the eŒects of
drought (Prasertsak and Fukai 1997). Our hypothesis was that using available
auxiliary information such as farmers’ knowledge of soil fertility and the estimated
coverage with naturally growing trees can be used for spatial adjustment of FMF
and therefore improve the spatial classi(cid:142) cation of SOM and available K used as
indices for the potential recovery of rice (Oryza sativa L.) after drought stress.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Case study area and survey data

A part of the Khorat plateau (18 000 ha) was studied, which is extensively used
for rainfed rice and lies within the basin of the lower Mae Nam Mun River ((cid:142) gure 1 ).

Thailand.

One of its tributaries, Lam Dom Yai, borders the study area in the Southeast. Gently
undulating land interspersed with minor non-(cid:143) ood and (cid:143) ood plains and isolated
hills dominate the Khorat plateau.

Soil sampling comprised 124 sites that were arranged to reveal soil heterogeneity
over diŒerent spatial scales ((cid:142) gure 1). The co-ordinate s of the sampling locations
were drawn on a map and identi(cid:142) ed in the region using a Global Positioning System
and the nearest rice (cid:142) eld sampled. Data of the sites were used to generate surfaces
of SOM, plant-availabl e K and soil fertility (see §2.2). At each location soil samples
were collected from 0 to 0.15 m depth (topsoil; soil monolith 0.2 mÖ 0.2 mÖ 0.15 m
by spade). Five samples were bulked, one from the centre of the (cid:142) eld, and four
samples within a 6 m radius around the centre of the (cid:142) eld. The samples were air-
dried and ground to pass through a 2-mm sieve. Soil organic matter was determined
using Walkley-Black wet oxidation and plant-availabl e K was extracted using the
1 N NH

-acetate method (van Reeuwijk 1992).

2.2. Generation of the basic soil maps and the auxiliary information

The generation of maps with auxiliary information describing the density of
naturally growing trees and soil fertility as perceived by farmers and of basic thematic
maps of SOM content and plant-availabl e K is brie(cid:143) y discussed next.

Farmers in North-east Thailand easily distinguish between (cid:142) elds with very low,
low, medium and high soil fertility (farmers’ soil fertility classi(cid:142) cation, FSC) and
according to toposequential position as low, medium and high (cid:142) elds (farmers’

topographica l classi(cid:142) cation, FTC). This knowledge was extracted from interviews
and compiled for locations sampled in the soil survey. Fields with an upper sandy
horizon deeper than 1.5 m and (cid:142) elds frequently rejuvenated by alluvial sediments of
the Lam Dom Yai River system were included in the FTC as additional classes.

Knowledge about the FTC was acquired exhaustively for the study area using
aerial photography. Pan-chromatic aerial photographs (1:4000) were available for
the area and scanned at 300 dpi and geo-referenced in a Geographical Information
System (GIS). A 250Ö 250 m grid was superimposed to assign each grid node to one
of the classes in the topographica l classi(cid:142) cation. Identi(cid:142) able micro-watersheds dom-
inate in the study area, and the grid nodes were easily allocated manually into classes
of the FTC using the scanned aerial photographs and an elevation map as visual
aids. A raster map showing a tree cover density index (TCDI) was derived from the
aerial photographs in the GIS. Tree covered areas were distinguished from non-tree
areas by (cid:142) ltering the raster images using a colour depth threshold. The photographs
had varying degrees of grey saturation and hence thresholds between 105 and 120
were separately de(cid:142) ned for each image. Cell size in the TCDI raster images was
aggregated to the size of units in the maps of SOM and K. The area in each map
unit covered by trees was calculated. This area ranged from 0% to 30% ((cid:142) gure 2(b))
and is used as the TCDI.

Simple or soft indicator kriging with prior means (Goovaerts 1997) was used to
integrate the point data and the exhaustive FTC information for the estimation of
probability surfaces of FSC class occurrence and of not exceeding speci(cid:142) ed indicator
thresholds of SOM and K. The (cid:142) nal class map of the FSC ((cid:142) gure 2(a)) was obtained
by applying Soares’ classi(cid:142) cation algorithm (Soares 1992) to the probabilities of
class occurrence. The E-type estimator (Deutsch and Journel 1998: 81) was applied
to derive estimates of mean values of SOM and K content from the set of probabilities
((cid:142) gures 2(c, e)). Maps showing the conditional variance for SOM and K content
were also derived ((cid:142) gures 2(d, and f )). Conditional variance is a measure of uncer-
tainty that is conditioned to the data values used. A description of an application
of the method can be found in Oberthu¨ r et al. (1999 ).

2.3. T heoretical background on classi(cid:142) cation using logical models

The principles of Boolean and standard, continuous (fuzzy) logical modelling
have been described in a number of recent publications (see Burrough and McDonnell
1998 ) and the only facts reviewed here are those essential to understand the presented
approach. Consider a set of soil property maps Zi (i 5 1, 2, ..., n) with values zi(x) for
each spatial map unit x that varies continuously in space. Most common spatial
units in this sense are points, raster cells or polygons.

Logical models are employed to assign class values to continuous spatial data.
To convert the input maps Zi to a crisp set of membership function values in an
output map U, a two-sided Boolean membership function (BMF) is de(cid:142) ned as

In soil resource assessment, the crisp class boundaries of attributes are often
indeterminate and can encompass both ambiguity and vagueness. The (cid:142) rst is due to
a lack of factual knowledge and corresponds to uncertainty about the critical thresh-
olds used to specify membership of a certain class and also to uncertainty about the
quality of the input maps Zi. Even if available knowledge permits error-free de(cid:142) nition
of class boundaries, vagueness remains as adjacent units often merge gradually at
their geographical boundaries (see Lagacherie et al. 1996 for a discussion). Using
crisp classi(cid:142) cation, values on both sides and close to a critical value b can fall into
diŒerent classes even though the diŒerence between them may be negligible because
it is within the range of the measurement, or interpolation error or contained in the
vague transition zone. Consequently, the resulting classi(cid:142) cation output is often
erroneous and, if a classi(cid:142) cation involves a succession of steps, misclassi(cid:142) cation of
land units may become a magni(cid:142) ed problem (Burrough and Heuvelink 1992).
In contrast, a FMF converts attribute values z to FMF values (FMF

) on a
continuous scale ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 representing full membership and 0 no
membership of the set. As an example, a symmetrical sigmoid FMF can be written as

where b1 and b2 are the lower and upper class limits, d is the transition width value,
p is the power value ((cid:142) gure 3(a)).

2.4. Modi(cid:142) cation of standard FMF using auxiliary information

De(cid:142) nition of the FMF for a certain land characteristic or land quality is a rather
subjective process and,
is de(cid:142) ned
intuitively or based on experience and p is set to a recommended standard of 2
(Burrough and McDonnell 1998: 271). However, decreasing or increasing p moves
the shape of the FMF further away from, or closer towards, that of the BMF. The
functions are almost identical if p is very large ((cid:142) gure 3 (a)).

in most fuzzy approaches, d in equation (2)

We adjusted the p parameter using coverage with naturally growing trees as
auxiliary information to modify the shape of the FMF to reduce the classi(cid:142) cation
uncertainty for locations where the information permits. Paddy (cid:142) elds in North-east
Thailand are used by farmers as multi-resource environments. Trees are carefully
maintained in the rice (cid:142) elds as sources of fruits, (cid:143) owers and nuts, and habitats for
birds and edible insects (GrandstaŒ1992 ). Farmers also believe that rice growth
during the regular drought spells is much better near trees. This has been con(cid:142) rmed
by recent research (cid:142) ndings (Craig 1988, Vityakon et al. 1993, Ruaysoongnern et al.
1996 ). It was suggested that trees act as nutrient and water pumps, scavenge leached
nutrients through horizontal roots and provide shade that reduces soil drying during
a drought and readily available nutrients throughout the growing season, including
nitrogen and K from leaf litter. Similar (cid:142) ndings were reported for trees in Africa

(Gerakis and Tsangarakis 1970, Kang 1977, Wendt et al. 1994) and elsewhere for
small bushes (Jackson and Caldwell 1993 ).

Therefore, tree density can be used as an indicator of the provision of plant
nutrients in the growing season and is one source of information on which to base
the modi(cid:142) cation of the p value in equation (2). The derivation of the TCDI that
ranged from 0 to 30 was described above. Let us consider the case of classifying soil
nutrient availability into classes of low (l ), medium (m) and high (h). High tree
density in map unit x increases the nutrient pool and reduces the classi(cid:142) cation

uncertainty if zi(x) is just above the threshold b
but increases uncertainty
if zi(x) is just below these thresholds. Low tree density reverses the pattern. The
TCDI was classi(cid:142) ed, very conservatively, as high if the index equalled or exceeded
a threshold of 15 because the contribution of tree leaf litter to the nutrient pool has
rarely been quanti(cid:142) ed. As a result only about 8% of the area have high tree coverage
((cid:142) gure 4(a)). Two simple functions were then empirically de(cid:142) ned as

to achieve the dynamic adjustment of p in the modelling environment of a raster-
based GIS ((cid:142) gures 4(b, c). The functions were applied on a cell by cell basis and
equation (3) generated a high p value given a high TCDI and a low p value in case
of a low TCDI. Equation (4) worked the other way around by generating high p
values given a low TCDI and low p values given a high TCDI.

Figure 3 (b) illustrates the application of the two functions for a theoretical SOM
threshold b of 1% and two samples SOM1 and SOM2 having 0.9% and 1.1% organic
matter content, respectively. Fuzzy set 1 represents low available nitrogen and fuzzy
set 2 represents a higher level of available nitrogen, assuming a signi(cid:142) cant positive
relationship between SOM content and soil N supply. In case of a left tail FMF and
to organic matter values
a high TCDI, equation (4) is applied to assign FMF
z
ranging from bÕ d to b and equation (3) assigned FMF
to samples with SOM in
the range b to b 1 d. This will not yield a full membership of 1 for SOM1 in fuzzy
set 1 because under high tree cover density it is likely that SOM1 is partially a
member of fuzzy set 2 receiving leaf litter throughout the cropping season. SOM2,
however, is not included in fuzzy set 1 in this scenario because we are reasonably
sure that the leaf litter will increase the amount of available nitrogen and push
SOM2 into the higher valued fuzzy set. Conversely, under low tree cover density,
equation (3) is applied to SOM values larger than b and assures a membership for
SOM2 in the fuzzy set with low available nitrogen. To ensure a continuous shape
of the FMF, the functions guarantee that p is always greater than 0.

z

Linguistic modi(cid:142) ers, such as very or a few, are used in natural languages to
express certainty or uncertainty about the status of properties. Hedges, as these
modi(cid:142) ers are known, were investigated for their usefulness in this land assessment
study. Two typical hedge operators acting on the FMF of the non-hedged expression
are very and more or less (Bardossy and Duckstein 1995 ):

respectively. The (cid:142) rst operator decreases the membership function value and is
referred to as concentration whereas the latter increases the membership function
value and is called dilation.

2.5. Comparison of classi(cid:142) cation approaches

Equation (2) was used to classify SOM and plant-availabl e K content in the
medium range. Identi(cid:142) cation of areas with low or high SOM and low or high K
was done using asymmetrical right-tail and left-tail variants of equation (2) with a

Class boundaries (b

and b2) and d values were chosen so that the membership
functions overlapped at the crossover point. De(cid:142) nition of the critical class levels was
based on expert knowledge and experimental data (table 1). The d value was set to
account for the input error and for each map unit included 5% of the attribute value
(conservative estimate of
laboratory analysis error) and the square root of the
conditional variance for each map unit.

Three approaches for logical modelling were compared and the identi(cid:142) cation
and mapping of areas with low SOM and low plant-availabl e K values (class 1) are
used as an example:

1. Crisp classi(cid:142) cation using a Boolean membership function (BMF).
2. Standard continuous classi(cid:142) cation using a FMF.
3. Continuous classi(cid:142) cation using a FMF with dynamically adjusted p parameter.

Indicator-kriged maps of SOM content and plant-availabl e K served as input.

Cell size in all maps was set to 250 m by 250 m.

Joint fuzzy membership functions (JMF) can be used to combine sets of diŒerent
soil properties into more general indices of soil quality (Burrough and Heuvelink
1992 ). The potential for plant recovery (PPR) from drought was de(cid:142) ned as a function
of SOM content and plant-availabl e K and derived using a convex combination of
of both variables (Burrough and McDonnell 1998) with weights of 0.5.

were also included. The FSC map was employed to adjust the JMF
(equations 7–9)
z
with hedge operators. JMF
in the fuzzy set with low recovery potential were dilated
using equation (6) if farmers had assigned very low and low soil fertility status, but
concentrated using equation (5) for high soil fertility status, and left unchanged in
case of the medium soil fertility class. Given the fuzzy set with medium recovery
were dilated if medium soil fertility was assigned, left unchanged for
potential, JMF
z
in the high recovery potential fuzzy set were
low and high soil fertility classes. JMF
z
dilated if farmers believed that soil fertility in the (cid:142) elds is high, but concentrated for
very low and low soil fertility and left unchanged for medium soil fertility. There
were more options for hedge operators, for instance adjusting FMF
in relation to
mica content and/or CEC
values in the case study area, however this paper uses
clay
only farmers’ soil fertility classi(cid:142) cation as an example.

Final PPR class maps (low, medium, and high) were derived by assigning the
value (maximum possibility of class occurrence) to

class with the maximum JMF
z
each map unit.

2.6. Assessment of maps

Crisp Boolean classi(cid:142) cation was compared with classi(cid:142) cation based on fuzzy set
theory by calculating the classi(cid:142) cation diŒerences. However, the main objective in
this study was to investigate whether the incorporation of auxiliary information in
the mapping process reduces the uncertainty about the classi(cid:142) cation. If the derivation
of a (cid:142) nal map is based on the maximum possibility value, then the vagueness (V)
in the map units x of the (cid:142) nal maps can be computed as

V(x) 5 1Õ FMFzmax

(x)

(10)

Vagueness indicates how appropriate the allocation of a map unit x is to a
particular class. Ambiguity relates to the confusion that can occur between two or
more classes. If the classi(cid:142) cation is based on the maximum possibility value, confusion
can be quanti(cid:142) ed using the confusion index (CI) de(cid:142) ned as (Hootsman and
van der Wel 1993, Burrough et al. 1997 ):

CI(x) 5

[1Õ {JMF

(x)Õ

JMF

z max

(x)}]

zmaxÕ 1

(11)

JMF

zmax
zmaxÕ 1

represents the maximum possibility assigned to map unit x and
JMF
is the second-largest possibility for that unit. The CI includes vagueness,
and total uncertainty is low if the confusion index is close to zero and maximal if
the confusion index equals one. Also, ambiguity is low if the CI is close to V. These
relatively simple measures were chosen instead of more complex measures (see Yager
1982, Klir 1987) because they allow for an easy, visual interpretation of the classi(cid:142) ca-
tion uncertainty. To permit a rapid general map comparison, mean values were
computed for both uncertainty measures.

Areas with high CI values are likely to represent zones in which class dominance
changes (Burrough and McDonnell 1998). Given a gradual change in the surfaces

of possibility values, thin lines of high CI values represent geographical boundaries
between zones that are dominated by one class (Burrough et al. 1997 ).

3. Results
3.1. Univariate classi(cid:142) cation

The success of any classi(cid:142) cation is rated with respect to its ability to correctly
allocate individuals. But maps used as tools for decision-making should not only
show what is known but also where the knowledge gaps are as well as uncertainties
about the feature of interest. In this respect, results of any classi(cid:142) cation must expose
the information content and uncertainty that is conveyed in the produced maps.
Communication of the map information, however, becomes more di(cid:141) cult with
increased map complexity and an e(cid:141) cient visualisation is paramount for map reading
and understanding . The classi(cid:142) cation results are analysed with regard to these
premises.

E Classi(cid:142) cation accuracy. Figure 5 shows the class maps of low SOM and low
K content. Boolean classi(cid:142) cation assigns a low status of SOM content and
plant-availabl e K to more land than any of the two fuzzy classi(cid:142) cations
(table 2). About 2480 ha (standard FMF) or 2570 ha (adjusted FMF) were
classi(cid:142) ed as land with low SOM content, compared with 4900 ha using a
Boolean classi(cid:142) cation. Similarly, 3100 ha were classi(cid:142) ed as low K using the
Boolean method, but only 850 ha or 890 ha using the standard and adjusted
fuzzy set approaches. Outcomes for the medium nutrient status mirrored those
for the low status. Only the areas with high soil SOM and available K content
were similar (table 2). Boolean classi(cid:142) cation clearly underestimates the nutrient
status for much of the land.
Information content and uncertainty. The classi(cid:142) cation results clearly show that
maps generated with the standard and adjusted fuzzy methods have a richer
information content than the crisp Boolean maps have. Transition zones from
high to low membership are produced where necessary ((cid:142) gures 5(c± f )).
Furthermore, the assigned possibility values allow for an immediate assessment
of the uncertainty of a map unit being assigned to a particular class. Boolean
classi(cid:142) cation always proposes perfect certainty about the classi(cid:142) cation that
rarely exists. In this study, the certainty proposed by the Boolean classi(cid:142) cation
was con(cid:142) rmed by the fuzzy approaches only for high SOM content. Pseudo-
uncertainty was in particular introduced for plant-availabl e K where misclassi-
(cid:142) cations can be expected if a crisp classi(cid:142) cation is employed. Comparing the
two fuzzy set based approaches discloses that the inherent classi(cid:142) cation uncer-
tainty is minimized conditional to the available information if the fuzzy set
functions were adjusted (see also below).

E V isualisation. Not all map users are necessarily experts in map reading and
map interpretation and most are only used to choropleth maps. Maps generated
using the standard and adjusted fuzzy set approaches are visually diŒerent
because the TCDI adjusted approach displays less grey shading ( by decreasing
the inherent classi(cid:142) cation uncertainty) . Sharper contrasts were introduced by
assigning less medium membership values to mapping units x using the adjusted
fuzzy set approach. This resulted in 474 units with memberships ranging from
0.2 to 0.8 and compares with 1382 units in this range for the standard fuzzy
set function. In fact, many map units have no or very low membership in class

3.2. Joint classi(cid:142) cation

Joint classi(cid:142) cation is interpreted with respect to the same premises raised in the
univariate classi(cid:142) cation: classi(cid:142) cation accuracy, exposure of information content and
uncertainty and visualisation of the information.

E Classi(cid:142) cation accuracy. Maps in (cid:142) gure 6 delineate areas with low, medium and
high potential that rice plants recover after a drought. All maps appear visually
similar but a frequency count reveals important diŒerences. Boolean classi(cid:142) ca-
tion ((cid:142) gure 6a) allocated about 1860 ha and 1750 ha more land to the group
with low potential for plant recovery than the standard fuzzy ((cid:142) gure 6(b)) and
adjusted fuzzy set approach ((cid:142) gure 6 (d), respectively. Hence less land has high
potential for plant recovery (table 3). Hedging the membership function values
further increased the diŒerences between crisp Boolean and fuzzy classi(cid:142) cation:
6019 ha land had low PPR using the Boolean method compared with 3087 ha
and 2931 ha for the hedged versions of the standard and adjusted fuzzy set
classi(cid:142) cations, respectively. The Boolean method assigned high PPR status to
about 950 ha of land but hedging the membership values of the standard and
adjusted fuzzy set classi(cid:142) cation resulted in 2431 ha and 2637 ha, respectively.
Information content and uncertainty. The Boolean method does not give any
indication about the classi(cid:142) cation uncertainty, hence there is more information
conveyed in the maps generated using fuzzy set based approaches. Dynamic-
ally adjusted FMF visibly reduced the joint classi(cid:142) cation uncertainty
((cid:142) gures 7(a± f )). This is particularly visible in the joint fuzzy classi(cid:142) cation maps

showing low and high PPR classes, where no-membership or very low member-
ship is assigned frequently when using the adjusted functions (table 3). Using
standard FMF assigned a total of 3400 map units a membership of 0 to 0.2
for the three considered PPR classes. Applying dynamically adjusted FMF
assigned these memberships to 4166 map units. Similar results were obtained
for the hedged versions (table 3).

E V isualisation. Hedge operators were applied to the joint fuzzy memberships to
increase or decrease them, relative to new information. Figures 8(a± f ) present
the mapped possibilities for the hedged standard and adjusted fuzzy set
approaches. Hedge operators result in a discernible increase of contrast
allowing for a sharper yet realistic (non-Boolean) delineation of classes. The
hedged version of the dynamically adjusted FMF appears most suitable in
terms of map reading and map interpretation.

3.3. Assessment

Assessment results are presented in table 4. The maps in (cid:142) gures 9(a–h) show the
CI and V. Average CI values were computed for each map and indicate that maps
generated using dynamically adjusted FMF contain less confusion than the maps
generated using the standard FMF. Hedging also decreased the classi(cid:142) cation uncer-
of the adjusted FMF 15% lower
tainty yielding an average CI for the hedged JMF
than for the standard FMF. Confusion index maps for the adjusted approach clearly
delineate low uncertainty areas where uncertainty was still high in the maps generated
by the standard fuzzy classi(cid:142) cation.

z

Unlike the CI, maps depicting vagueness were similar for the standard and the
adjusted fuzzy approach. However, hedge operators further decreased the vagueness
in the maps generated by both fuzzy classi(cid:142) cation methods.

4. Discussion

Classi(cid:142) cation of soil resources using fuzzy set based methods mirrors reality
better than crisp Boolean type approaches. This study illustrated once more the
inherent weaknesses of classi(cid:142) cations based on sharp thresholds: the Boolean method
allocated about 10% to 18% more land into the class for which soils have least
capability to support recovery of rice plants after drought impacts. Equally important
is the fact that the Boolean approach does not provide for a rapid appraisal of the
uncertainty involved in the classi(cid:142) cation. Unlike crisp Boolean classi(cid:142) cation, fuzzy
membership functions assign possibilities of class occurrence to the map units.
Possibilities represent a measure of the uncertainty that can be further decomposed
into vagueness and ambiguity.

Auxiliary information can be used to modify the information integrated into
FMF and reduce classi(cid:142) cation uncertainty. We used information from diverse sources
measured on diŒerent scales (e.g. TCDI on an interval scale and farmer’s knowledge
on an ordinal scale) for adjusting the FMF’s standard shape parameter and as hedge
operators. The (cid:142) rst allowed for the consideration of research (cid:142) ndings and common
sense. The latter quanti(cid:142) ed linguistic expressions and permitted the use of local
knowledge, which is (cid:142) nely tuned to the concrete exigencies and requirements of local
conditions. To ignore it would be counterproductive , because the perceptions of
farmers, as the ultimate stakeholders, are diŒerent from those of other agricultural
decision-makers (e.g. Hecht and Cockburn 1990, Zimmerer 1993). Also, farmers

disclosed in short and medium term research projects.

Adjusting the p parameter of the FMF and hedging the generated FMF
z

reduced
the overall uncertainty indicated by the confusion index by 14%, although the
vagueness slightly increased (table 4). In other words, the ambiguity about the
allocation of an individual to a particular class was reduced. In fact, ambiguity
represented 58% of the classi(cid:142) cation uncertainty when using standard fuzzy functions
but only 43% if p was adjusted. Hedging FMF
from the standard fuzzy function
z
did not reduce the CI but reduced V. Hence, V was reduced at the expense of
ambiguity and it becomes more di(cid:141) cult to make an appropriate choice between two
classes. Hedging the FMF
derived from the adjusted FMF reduced the CI by
z
reducing V (in fact, ambiguity increased to a proportion of 51%). It is also noteworthy
that V is higher in the map based on adjusted FMF than in the map based on
standard FMF (0.27 versus 0.23). Likewise, vagueness in maps of hedged FMF
z
values derived from the adjusted FMF is higher than hedged FMF
based on the
z
standard FMF (0.2 versus 0.18). Kosko (1994b) noted that this eŒect is desirable,
as more information decreases probability but increases vagueness by more sharply
de(cid:142) ning the grey border between member and non-member.

The application of hedge operators has several implications and eŒects:

E Membership function values are shifted towards the lower and upper possibility
boundaries (see table 2 adjusted fuzzy classes) and the de-fuzzi(cid:142) ed maps based
on the hedged classi(cid:142) cation appear smoother and less fragmented ((cid:142) gure 6).
This was already indicated by the CI maps for the adjusted FMF that delineate
clearly visible contiguous areas of high and low CI values.

E Contingency is of foremost concern for land use planners acting at regional
scales. Notwithstanding that, soil properties in the area change over short
distances (see also Oberthu¨ r 1998) and this is re(cid:143) ected in the relatively small
size of the contiguous areas. Furthermore, the exigency that the application of

fuzzy set theory in a classi(cid:142) cation involving many variables generates a too
fuzzy output is greatly diminished when using auxiliary information.

Finally, the validity of the classes generated here needs to be veri(cid:142) ed with an
independent set of observed yields from a rice crop that has suŒered under drought
impact. Also, this paper was not written as a contribution to the philosophical debate
over whether we can (Williamson 1994, Laviolette and Seaman 1994) or can not
(Kosko 1994a) draw sharp boundaries between things and non-things.

5. Conclusions

We have described the ease with which fuzzy sets allow for the incorporation of
diverse information. One does not have to subscribe to the view that things are
inherently vague to see that classi(cid:142) cation is generally not objective but only a
consensus. Fuzzy set theory allows us to express in a simple way graduality in classes
and to maintain as little graduality as the lack of further information requires. We
conclude that:

1. Dynamically adjusting FMF is easily possible with auxiliary information if
there is su(cid:141) cient evidence to de(cid:142) ne relations between auxiliary and primary
information.

2. Hedging fuzzy membership values appears to be extremely valuable in soil
resource assessment for its ability to decrease overall classi(cid:142) cation uncertainty
in general and to substantiall y reduce vagueness in particular. Smaller vague
transition zones between areas with little uncertainty will allow for an e(cid:141) cient
upgrading of information by targeted re-sampling. Also, class maps based on
hedged JMF
z

are smoother and more contiguous.

3. Future work should be directed towards an objective de(cid:142) nition of the empirical

functions that were used to dynamically adjust the p parameter.

4. The ability of fuzzy set theory to integrate local knowledge of stakeholders
into multivariate soil assessments establishes a common basis between land
evaluator and the agricultural decision-maker in the (cid:142) eld. Recommendations
based on these assessments are hence more likely to be accepted by stake-
holders and decision-makers.

The Survey Equipment

To  carry  out  hydrographic  and
geo physical surveys, the hydrographers
needed to know their position far more
accurately than did the ship’s navigating
officers. The  positioning  equipment  on
board the MINNA included: 

a) Two  range  DECCA-LAMBDA
12-f  (acronym  for  Low  AMBiguity
DeccA),  which  meant  that  there  was  a
large  vacuum-tube  Master  transmitter
on board the MINNA. One Slave station
(which  re-transmits  radio  signals  back
to Master at a different frequency) was
at  Spotted  Island  east  of  Cartwright,
Labrador,  the  other  on  Resolution
Island. Being the LAMBDA version of
DECCA, it had some capability of lane
identification 
(integer  multiple  of
+/- 600 m).  DECCA  used  continuous
wave  transmissions and thus the signals
were  contaminated  by  skywave,  which
was  stronger  at  night,  and  therefore
short ened the useable range.

b) Rho-rho  LORAN-C,  which
meant that there was an Austrom 5000
LORAN-C receiver and a cesium beam
frequency  counter  (i.e.,  an  atomic
clock)  to  help  predict  the  instant  of
transmission  from  the  LORAN-C  sta-
tions  at  Cape  Race,  Nfld.  and  from
Angissoq, at the south tip of Greenland.
LORAN-C used the leading few cycles
of the powerful pulse transmissions and
was not affected by skywave so long as
the ground wave was receivable.

c) A  Marconi  Doppler  satellite
receiver to establish a position every few
hours to verify the DECCA “lane count”
and 
rate
(microsec onds/day)  of  the  cesium  beam

to  determine 

the  clock

Introduction

Upon reading Vice-Admiral Brodeur’s
full  article  on  NORPLOY  ’74,  I
real ized the connection to the Canadian
Hydrographic  Service  (CHS)  and  a
“black  moment”  in  its  history.  It  is  not
new  that  ships  have  sunk,  had  fires,  or
grounded while in the employ of mak ing
charts  for  safer  navigation  of  Canadian
waters.  The  grounding  of  the  MINNA
and  subsequent  sinking  is  of  particular
interest to me in that I had worked under
the MINNA’s chief scien tist for one sum-
mer before the incident and 18 years after
it.  Geomatica readers  might  also  be
inter ested in a fuller account of the event.

The Ship

Motor Vessel (MV) MINNA was a
83.6 m  long  (274 ft),  ice-strengthened
freighter  built  in  1960  at  Arendel,

Norway, as MV VARLA DAN and sub-
sequently  sold  to  the  Karlsen  Shipping
Company  of  Halifax,  who  changed  her
name  (Figure  1).  Bedford  Institute  of
Oceanography in Dartmouth, N.S., char-
tered her for about three-month periods in
1972, 1973 and 1974 for deep-sea hydro-
graphic  and  geophysical  surveys  in  the
Labrador Sea, where she steamed 12500
nautical  miles  in  60+  days  of  1974,
whereas she had steamed 16700 nautical
miles  in  109  days  in  1973  and  14331
nautical  miles  in  90  days  in  1972  [BIO
1972; 1974a]. The MINNA’s net (or reg-
istered)  tonnage  was  2300  tons  (2087  t)
(or  2354  tons  (2136  t),  depending  on
source) but its full load displacement was
4280  tons  (3883 t).  Given  that  she  was
only carrying survey equipment, 300 tons
(272 t) of concrete ballast in the forward
#1 Hold, and was relatively light on fuel,
her  displacement  at  the  time  of  the
grounding  would  have  been  closer  to
3000–3500 tons (2722–3175 t).

versus the ones at Cape Race and Angissoq.
The  satellite  position  computation
was  done  in  machine  language  on  a
PDP 8 computer with just eight kilo bytes
of memory. Doppler satellite positioning
needed  accurate  veloc ity  during  the  20
minutes of the satellite passing overhead,
which  was  provided  by  DECCA  and/or
LORAN-C.  DECCA  needed  assurance
that it had the right number of repetitions
of  the  continuous  transmitted  wave,
which  was  provided  by  the  satellite  fix,
and rho-rho LORAN-C needed to know
the  difference  of  clock  rates  so  that  the
instant of transmission could be comput-
ed,  which  was  pro vid ed  by  the  satellite
fix  (Figure  2).  All  these  inter-compar-
isons  were  done  manually.  Five  years
later, the computations were done by the
PDP-8  com put er  [Eaton  et  al.  1976;
Eaton and Grant 1972].

The  geophysical  survey  equipment
included a Barringer magnetometer, three
different  marine  gravity  meters  and  one
land  gravity  meter.  The  “cli nometer”
mentioned  by  Nigel  Brodeur  was  either
part of one of the marine gravimeters, or
an  entire  one  (Figure  3).  [Ron  MacNab

included:

Raytheon  sounder,  DECCA  Navigator
and  LORAN-A  receivers,  Doppler
sonar  log,  three  radar  sets,  MRA-2
Tellurometers,  Wild  T-2  theodolites,
several  different  types  of  computers,
paper  tape  readers  and  punches,  mag-
netic  tape  storage,  teletypes  and  a
Calcomp  plotter.  [Yeaton 1974]  The
estimated value of the hydrographic and
geophysical survey equipment on board
the  ship  exceeded  one  million  dollars.
[Fillmore  and  Sandilands
1983;
Densmore 1974]  Most  of  this  equip-
ment  was  in  a  purpose-built  unit
designed  and  built  at  Bedford  Institute
and lowered into #2 Hold at the begin-
ning of the 1974 season’s charter, which
became the “survey office.”

Before the Grounding

The  MINNA  stopped  a  line  of
soundings to visit Godthåb (now Nuuk),
Greenland,  for  engine  repairs  and  to
ver i fy  the  marine  gravimeters  against

land-based  gravity  readings.  Departing
Godthåb on 16 August, she ran a line of
towards  Saglek,
soundings  back 
Labrador,  then,  at  08:00  on  18 August
1974, 
(not
she  entered  Brewer 
“Brewer’s”)  Bay  [Geographic  Names
Board  2016]  near  the  northeast  corner
of  Resolution  Island  with  the  intent  of
picking  up  electronic  technicians  who
had installed a Slave transmitter on  the
island and then to calibrate the DECCA
(determine the number of DECCA lanes
between  Master  transmitter  and  Slave
transmitter).  The  ship  anchored  at
09:00,  but  Capt.  E.  Grandy  (Figure  4)
must  have  had  concerns  about  anchor-
ing  there  because  they  were  weighing
anchor at 09:20 (MINNA deck log [BIO
1974b]).  George  Yeaton,  the  chief  sci-
entist on board (Figure 5), cannot even
remember  anchoring  at  all.  [Yeaton
2016] The wind was from the southeast
to  south-southeast  at  Force  4  (i.e.,
20–28 km/h or 11–16 knots, where typ-
ically there would be small waves with
breaking crests). The day was described
as overcast and dull with moderate sea
and the swell listed as 4 feet (1.3 m).

The Bay

The  navigable  portion  of  Brewer
Bay (Figure 6) is about 240 m wide by
600 m with a maximum depth of 40 m
(22 fathoms) and the bay is surrounded
by hills 100 to 400 m high. There is a
landing  beach, Yellow  Beach,  with  an
open-air stor age area and storage shed,
in a cove on the south shore of the bay
where supplies are landed annually for
the  Northern  Warning  System radar

station situated on Cape Warwick just
north  of  the  bay.  Sailing  Directions
advises that the bay is small and pro-
vides  little  shelter  and  that  there  is
occa sionally  heavy  ground  swell
[Sailing Directions 2009a].

The Tide

Because the MINNA had a single
propeller  and  no  bow  thruster,  her
nor mal  turning  radius  was  large  and
because  she  was  riding  high  due  to
low  fuel  and  a  light  load,  she  was
adversely  affected  by  the  SE  wind,
causing  her  to  have  an  even  larger
turning radius. The ship may have been
affected by the tidal stream that existed
because  Sailing  Directions  advises
mariners  that  the  tidal  stream  runs
swiftly in a circular path at high water.

[Sailing Directions 2009b] Consequently
she  went  outside  of  the  surveyed  area
while trying to turn, grounded on a rock
pinnacle at 09:34, partly by her forward
motion  but  also  by  being  blown  side-
ways,  to  port,  about  three  hours  after
spring  high  tide  (height  3.1 m  above
datum) [Herron 2016]. (All quoted tidal
infor mation  is  for  Sorry  Harbour,  the
nearest  tidal  station—Brewer  Bay—
would  exhibit  similar  tides.)  Spring
high  tide  occurred  at  Sorry  Harbour  at
06:19  EST  with  a  height  of  5.57 m
above  datum.  George  Yeaton  tried  to
take a sounding by lead and line on the
ship’s  starboard  (seaward)  side,  a  mere
3 m  (10  feet)  aft  of  where  the  pinnacle
pierced  the  ship’s  outer  bot tom,  but
found  no  bottom.  However,  the  ship’s
sounder  showed  a  depth  of  25  fathoms
(150  feet  or  45.7 m)  [Fillmore  and
Sandilands 1983].

The Re-Floating
Attempts

At  10:15,  the  crew  launched  the
port  boat  in  a  scenario  reminiscent  of
the  Keystone  Cops.  When  it  hit  the
water,  it  started  to  fill  with  water
because  they  forgot  to  put  in  the  drain
plug. It took some time before they fig-
ured out how to raise the boat out of the
water, drain it and put in the plug. And
when  they  lowered  it  back  into  the
water, they headed for shore. The cap-
tain  had  to  call  them  back  to  the  ship.
At  11:00  (height  of  tide  now  1.8 m
above  datum),  the  captain  ordered  full
astern, but the stern of the ship merely
turned to port, coming closer to paral-
leling  the  cliff,  and  failed  to  come  off
the  pinnacle.  To  return  the  ship  to  the
original  heading,  the  captain  ordered

peri ods of high tide and man-handled
all  the  moveable  equipment  through
the  ship,  up  the  gangways,  onto  the
deck, and then lowered it down into
the  barge  for  transfer  to  shore.
[Grant 2016]  Given  the  amount  and
weight  of  the  equipment  plus  the
tight spaces to work through, it was a
monumental task. But they felt that it
had  to  be  done,  and  done  quickly
because  they  were  afraid  that  the
ship would slide off the rocks at any
moment  and  sink.  Nine  personnel
were  flown  to  Frobisher  Bay  (now
Iqaluit)  by  chartered  aircraft  on  20
August and to Halifax by com mer cial
airlines the next day.

A Second Coast
Guard Ship

On  21  August,  the  GRIFFON
tried  to  pull  MINNA  free  without
suc cess.  When  interviewed  in  Halifax,
Nigel  Brodeur  was  complimentary
of  Captain  Pat  Connors  of  CCGS
GRIF FON for  his  excellent  maneuver-
ing in the mainly uncharted approach es
and  confined  waters  of  Brewer  Bay
[Densmore 1974].  Sometime  before
21 August, CCGS NORMAN MCLEOD
ROGERS (buoy-tender/light icebreaker)
arrived  but  stayed  outside  the  bay
[Densmore 1974].  Nine  of  the  ship’s
personnel travelled by her on 21 August
to  Frobisher  Bay  and  from  there  to
Halifax [Yeaton 1974].

full  port  rudder  and  went  forward,
driving the ship farther onto the rock.
By 13:00, it was recorded in the deck
log  that  CCGS GRIFFON,  a  buoy-
tender and light icebreaker, was pro-
ceeding  to  Brewer  Bay  to  provide
assistance  (Figure  7).  At  16:20  the
Bedford Institute barge was put in the
water and at 17:00, sixteen BIO staff
members  and  nine  crew  members
went ashore. At 19:30 (height of tide
5.5 m  above  datum)  and  again  at
20:20 (height of tide now 4.8 m) the
GRIF FON  attached  heavy  hawsers
and tried to pull the MINNA off, but
at both times the lines parted. On the
second attempt, the broken end of the
hawser  fouled  MINNA’s  propeller,
thereby reducing later attempts to the
GRIF FON  alone  [BIO 1974b;  Grant
2016].  The  GRIFFON  tried  a  third
time  at  21:15  (height  of  tide  3.9 m)
and then went to anchor in the bay for
the night. Only at 21:30 did the crew
begin  lifting  some  of  the  concrete
blocks  from  #1  Hold.  But  around
23:00, it was reported in the deck log
that #2 Hold was dry but #1 Hold was
flood ed—an  indication  that  the  ship
was  becoming  more  damaged.  Steve
Grant  remembers  that  water  was
observed in #1 Hold as early as noon
[Grant 2016].

Lightening the Load

The removal of cement blocks con-
tinued until 06:00 on 19 August, when it
was stopped owing to water rising in #1
Hold;  the  hatch  was  covered  and  the
booms  lowered.  At  three  unspecified
that  day,  GRIFFON
times  during 
attempted to pull MINNA off the rocks;
all  attempts  failed  [Yeaton 1974].  The
heavy sea and swell (1.5 m or 5 ft) and
the  wind  from  the  southeast  (i.e.,
directly  from  the  open  ocean)  caused
the ship to keep striking heavily on the
rocks, so at 09:00 the crew went aboard
the GRIFFON with their baggage, leav-
ing three engineers, two mates and the
master on board the ship. At 13:00, they
lifted the booms to take the hatch cover
off  #2  Hold  so  that  the  crew  could  lift
the survey equipment from the hold and
put  it  into  the  barge,  but  the  hinges
gave  out,  negating  that  course  of
action—another indication that the ship
was  breaking  apart.  The  crew  and  the
BIO staff were eventually transferred to
shore  and  were  not  particularly  wel-
come  guests  at  the  radar  site,  at  least
until  some  of  the  provisions  from  the
ship were brought up from the landing
beach (Figure 8). Starting on 18 August,
and  over  the  next  two  days,  the  BIO

Equipment

PRE SERVER 

The  scientific  equipment,  which
had been removed from the ship, was
stored  in  a  shed  near  the  beach.
After  HMCS  ASSINIBOINE  and
SAGUE NAY  arrived  on  22 August
and  HMCS 
on
23 August,  the  equipment  was  trans-
ferred  by  sea-boat  or  helicopter  to  the
latter  ship  and  returned  to  Bedford
Institute when it returned to Halifax in
September.  Three  of  the  survey  staff
went  to  Newfoundland  on  the  naval
ships.  George  Yeaton  and  nine  others
stayed at the radar site to dismantle the
DECCA Slave station and on 26 August
flew  to  Halifax  via  Frobisher  Bay.  On
19 September  1974,  CSS  BAFFIN
retrieved the DECCA equipment from
the  shore  and  more  equipment  from
the MINNA. Nautical tradition would
say that the captain, and maybe some
of the mates and engineers, stayed on
board until all hope of saving the ship
to  maintain
in  order 
was  gone 
own er ship of the ship. 

The End

Hettie  Densmore  reported  that  a
Norwegian  ocean-going 
tug  had
arrived  before  5 September,  but  was
waiting until a suitable high tide oppor-
tunity  near  the  next  Spring  High Tide
on  15 September.  [Densmore 1974]
Being hard-aground and with a hawser
firmly wrapped around the propeller, it
is  probable  that  the  tug  was  not
suc cess ful and the MINNA met her end
shortly 
the
con stant  pounding  of  the  waves.  On
19 September,  the  Karlsen  Shipping
Company and its insurers declared the
ship abandoned because they failed to
find  a  salvage  company  interested  in
rescuing her [Yeaton 1974].

thereafter  because  of 

Notice to Mariners

The  sealift  that  brings  petroleum
products  and  the  yearly  shipment  of
goods  of  all  sorts  to  the  Northern

the 

“PA” 

Warning  System  station  on  Cape
Warwick,  immediately  north  of  Brewer
Bay,  reported  in  June  1998  that  the
wreck  of  the  MINNA  had  slipped  into
deeper  water  because  of  ice  action.
Canadian Hydrographic Service records
show  an  entry  on  17  June  1998  report-
ing  that  the  wreck’s  location  and  least
depth  were  unknown  and  that  a  Notice
to Mariners was recommended caution-
ing mariners as they enter Brewer Bay.
The  report  caused 
immediate
issuance  of  Notice  to  Mariners  1503-
1998,  which  instructed  mariners  to  add
a  dangerous  wreck  symbol  to  the  19
April  1963  Edition  of  CHS  chart  5430
(Approach  to  Sorry  Harbor)  [note  the
American spelling since the chart at that
time  was  a  reproduction  of  a  U.S.
chart—DHG] and on its inset of Brewer
Bay, at 61° 34’ 56.0”N, 64° 38’ 23.0”W
(local  datum)  both  symbols  qualified
by 
(Position  Approximate)
[Hutchinson 2016].  The  sealift  report
also  caused  a  multi-beam  hydrographic
survey  with  full  bottom  coverage  posi-
tioned by GPS to be carried out late that
summer.  The  18  February  2005  New
Edition  of  the  chart  (now  entitled
“Approaches  to  Sorry  Harbour”)  incor-
porates  the  1998  survey  both  on  the
main  chart  (for  the  approach es  to
Brewer Bay) and for the entire inset of
Brewer Bay (Figure 6). The main chart
shows  the  more  normal  symbol  of  a
“wreck  showing  any  portion  of  hull  or
superstructure”  whereas  the  inset  uses
the  symbol  appropriate  for  large-scale
charts  of  a  “wreck,  which  covers  and
uncovers”  near  the  north  shore  of  the
bay at 61° 35’ 17.5”N, 64° 37’ 53.5”W
(NAD-83). If the symbol on the inset is
correctly  oriented,  the  bow  is  facing
northwest  and  the  stern  southeast  with
the bow drying (i.e., visible) at low tide.
The  present  Sailing  Directions,  pub-
lished 2009, cautions mariners that “ice
action  has  shifted  the  wreck;  the  exact
position and depth over [the wreck] are
not known.” It is probable that this cau-
tion came from the 1998 Sealift report.
It  seems  to  me  that  the  1998  survey’s
objective was to determine those pieces
of  information—although  that  does  not
mean  that  ice  action  might  cause  the
wreck to move after the survey.

The Chart

The  1963  edition  of  Chart  5340
was  based  on  a  1952-3  U.S.  Navy
sur vey, where its geographic grid was
probably  based  on  an  astronomically
determined survey point. The topogra-
phy  on  the  chart  was  from  aerial
pho tography  taken  about  the  same
time. A  new  edition  of  the  chart  was
required to incorporate the 1998 CHS
survey, and that was a good opportuni-
ty  to  convert  the  chart  to  NAD 83  so
that it would be compatible with GPS
topography  and
positioning.  The 
soundings  in  areas  other  than  in  the
area  of  the  1998  survey  were  left
untouched—only  the  latitude/longi-
tude grid was moved. The shift in the
geographic  grid  accounts  for  most  of
the  795 m  between  the  two  positions
quoted  above.  Nevertheless,  the  2005
edition  advises  mariners  that  there
may still be 0.5 nautical miles (900 m)
residual error remaining—more likely
in  areas  distant  from  the  1998  survey.
The  magnitude  of  this  795-m  shift  is
typical  for  charts  that  were  based  on
exploratory-quality  astronomic  posi-
tions—a  method  often  used  for  charts
hastily  surveyed,  compiled  and  pub-
lished in support of the construction of
DEW Line sites.

Air Photos

Air photos taken on 18 August 1976
show  the  MINNA  lying  on  her  star-
board side, bow to the southwest and
stern to the northeast (Figure 9). The
superstructure  is  white  and  the  side
of  the  hull  colored  (it  was  red).  The
mast between Holds #1 and #2 is vis-
ible  but  nothing  forward  of  that.  In
air photos taken on 15 August 1987,
the  ship  is  not  visible  above  water,
but  the  water  tones  suggest  that  the
ship  is  submerged  at  its  1976  posi-
tion, although the orientation may be
reversed.  In  air  photos  taken  on  25
July  1993,  the  ship  is  not  visible,
although there MAY be something in
the  water  at  the  1976  position.

1971–2005, 
in  geodetic

water at the wreck’s charted location.
These series of photographs pose sev-
eral questions. 1) Was the ship moving
or  rotating  between  these  various
epochs? 2) Was the ship being naturally
reduced  to  rubble  by  the  action  of
wind,  waves  and  ice?  3) Was  the  ship
being  purposely  dismantled  by  a  sal-
vager? Perhaps the apparent movement
in  the  airphotos  and  the  situation  as
found  in  the  1998  survey  are  the  rea-
sons for the Sailing Directions’ caution
note  and  the  continuance  of  the
“Position Approximate” (i.e., “PA”) on
the inset of the chart.

Summary

A  good  summary  of  the  value  of
the  survey  was  expressed  in  the
1973–74  Bedford  Institute’s  annual
report: “That the cost of exploration in
subarctic,  often  uncharted,  waters  is
high  was  demonstrated  in  an  unortho-
dox  but  convincing  way  by  the  1974
grounding  and  sinking  of  the  MV
MINNA off Resolution Island whilst on
her  1974  combined  hydrographic-geo-
physical  survey 
the  northern
Labrador Sea. Nevertheless, the stakes
are  high  and,  as  long  as  the  returns  of

in 

mineral  exploration  are  promising,  our
task will be to evaluate the resources and
anticipate engineering problems and envi-
ronmental  hazards  when  these  resources
are  tapped.  Whichever  way  exploration
goes, unravelling the secrets of the Earth
will be our challenge and reward for many
years to come.” [BOI 1974a]

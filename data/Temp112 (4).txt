By incorporating temporal effects into the geographically weighted regression (GWR)
model, an extended GWR model, geographically and temporally weighted regression
(GTWR), has been developed to deal with both spatial and temporal nonstationarity
simultaneously in real estate market data. Unlike the standard GWR model, GTWR
integrates both temporal and spatial information in the weighting matrices to capture
spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The GTWR design embodies a local weighting
scheme wherein GWR and temporally weighted regression (TWR) become special
cases of GTWR. In order to test its improved performance, GTWR was compared with
global ordinary least squares, TWR, and GWR in terms of goodness-of-fit and other
statistical measures using a case study of residential housing sales in the city of Calgary,
Canada, from 2002 to 2004. The results showed that there were substantial benefits in
modeling both spatial and temporal nonstationarity simultaneously. In the test sample, the
TWR, GWR, and GTWR models, respectively, reduced absolute errors by 3.5%, 31.5%,
and 46.4% relative to a global ordinary least squares model. More impressively, the
GTWR model demonstrated a better goodness-of-fit (0.9282) than the TWR model
(0.7794) and the GWR model (0.8897). McNamara’s test supported the hypothesis that
the improvements made by GTWR over the TWR and GWR models are statistically
significant for the sample data.

Introduction

1.
Location and time are important determinants of real estate prices. Location is an important
factor because of the spatial dependence between real estate prices, even though there tends
to be spatial heterogeneity across prices over a large area. Prices of proximate houses tend to
be similar because they share common local neighborhood factors, such as similar physical
characteristics (age, size, and exterior and interior features) and similar neighborhood
amenities (socioeconomic status, access to employment opportunities, shopping, public
service facilities, schools, etc). Differences between houses in the same neighborhood
tend to be determined by the size of the lot and the size and quality of the top structure.

A large-size lot, for example, tends to have a large house, a garage, and more bedrooms. In
older neighborhoods, the date and quality of construction and the level of renovation tend to
be major discriminating factors.

Housing price observations in many studies tend to be geo-referenced to account for
spatial autocorrelation and general neighborhood characteristics. The time of an observation
also matters in the determination of real estate prices. From a modeling perspective, it is
generally accepted that real estate prices depend not only on recent market events but also on
their lagged prices. Temporal effects include, for example, market trends, inflationary
factors, and differential rates of obsolescence related to the age distribution of houses.
Depreciation of housing amenities might occur at different rates related to housing char-
acteristics at the beginning of the study period, the original value of the house, the specific
amenities included in the housing package, and other factors omitted in models that do not
specifically account for intertemporal heterogeneity (Dombrow et al. 1997).

Heterogeneous spatial and/or temporal effects may violate the basic assumption of
statistical independence of observations which is typically required for unbiased and
efficient estimation (Huang et al. 2009). Several studies have, therefore, tended to incorpo-
rate spatial or temporal characteristics in house price equations to eliminate dependencies, or
nonrandom effects, in the residuals.

Prediction methods using regression can be grouped into two general categories: global
and local regression models. Global spatial models are usually an improved form of the
traditional hedonic model (Can 1992, Dubin 1992, Anselin 1998). Spatial or temporal
effects are addressed by modeling the residual variance–covariance matrix directly or by
inversing the residual variance–covariance matrix to eliminate dependency in the residuals.
In Gelfand et al. (2004), a rich class of temporal hedonic models using a Bayesian frame-
work is formulated by extending the different processes of the error term. An extended
model of this study with spatially varying coefficient process is also developed in Gelfand
et al. (2003). In fact, this model can be expanded to a spatio-temporal setting. Can and
Megbolugbe (1997) constructed a distance-weighted average variable that captures both
spatial and temporal information, which proves to be a significant explanatory variable in the
hedonic model. Alternatively, Pace et al. (1998) introduced a filtering process, and their
results greatly enhanced the accuracy of model estimations.

However, a major problem with global methods when applied to spatial or temporal
data is that the processes being examined are assumed to be constant over space. For a
specific model (e.g., the price of real estate), the assumption of stationarity or structural
stability over time and space is generally unrealistic, as parameters tend to vary over the
study area.

In order to capture the spatial variation, various localized modeling techniques have been
proposed to capture spatial heterogeneity in housing markets. Eckert (1990) suggested that,
based on the assumption that subsets are characterized by a lower variance, models gener-
ated for housing submarkets should yield greater explanatory power (and predictive accu-
racy) than those computed at the overall market level. Goodman and Thibodeau (1998)
introduced the concept of hierarchical linear modeling, whereby dwelling characteristics,
neighborhood characteristics, and submarkets interact to influence house prices. In a similar
vein, McMillen (1996) and McMillen and McDonald (1997) introduced nonparametric local
linear regression in nonmonocentric city models. Notably, Brunsdon et al. (1996),
Fotheringham et al. (1996), and Fotheringham et al. (2002) proposed geographically
weighted regression (GWR) as a local variation modeling technique.

GWR allows the exploration of the variation of the parameters as well as the testing of
the significance of this variation, and this methodology has, therefore, received considerable

International Journal of Geographical Information Science

attention in recent years. Pavlov (2000), Fotheringham et al. (2002), and Yu (2006) have all
applied the GWR or GWR-similar methodology to housing markets. Brunsdon et al. (1999),
in a study of house prices in the town of Deal in south-eastern England, examined the
determinants of house price with GWR and found that the relationship between house price
and size varied significantly through space. Despite the strength of GWR as opposed to
global models and the success of GWR in capturing spatial variations, applying a GWR
model to house price analysis that incorporates temporal effects remains a relatively
unexplored area.

The objective of this article is to extend the traditional GWR model to problems
involving both spatial and temporal nonstationarity in real estate data. This study seeks to
contribute to the literature on the topic in the following three ways. First, we extend the
traditional GWR model with temporality into a geographically and temporally weighted
regression (GTWR) model and apply it to spatio-temporal real estate data analysis. Second,
we propose the use of McNamara’s test for comparing the statistically significant difference
between the estimation methods according to their accuracies (Foody 2004). Third, we
examine and compare the hedonic model, temporally weighted regression (TWR), GWR,
and GTWR for modeling housing prices by means of a case study in the Canadian city of
Calgary.

This article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present a basic framework for GWR
and then extend it to include temporal data. Section 3 offers some key technical implementa-
tion details of the GTWR model, including spatial and parameter optimal selection, and
model comparison criterion. In Section 4, a case study of housing prices in Calgary is
reported. In Section 5, the results for different models are compared and analyzed. Finally,
we summarize and draw conclusions.

2. Geographically weighted regression model
2.1. The model and the parameter estimation

The GWR model extends the traditional regression framework by allowing parameters to be
estimated locally so that the model can be expressed as

Yi ¼ (cid:2)0 ui; vi

ð

Þ þ

(cid:2)k ui; vi
ð

ÞXik þ "i

i ¼ 1; . . . ; n

(1)

X

k

where (ui,vi) denotes the coordinates of the point i in space, (cid:2)0(ui,vi) represents the intercept
value, and (cid:2)k(ui,vi) is a set of values of parameters at point i. Unlike the ‘fixed’ coefficient
estimates over space in the global model, this model allows the parameter estimates to vary
across space and is therefore likely to capture local effects.

To calibrate the model, it is assumed that the observed data close to point i have a greater
influence in the estimation of the (cid:2)k(ui,vi) parameters than the data located farther from
observation i. The estimation of parameters (cid:2)k(ui,vi) is given by Equation (2)

^(cid:2) ui; vi
ð

Þ ¼ X T W ui; vi

ð

ÞX

(cid:2)

(cid:3)(cid:2)1

where W(ui,vi) is an n · n matrix whose diagonal elements denote the geographical
weighting of observation data for observation i, and the off-diagonal elements are zero.
The weight matrix is computed for each point i at which parameters are estimated.

2.2. Weighting matrix specification

The weight matrix in GWR represents the different importance of each individual observation
in the data set used to estimate the parameters at location i. In general, the closer an observation
is to i, the greater the weight. Thus, each point estimate i has a unique weight matrix.

In essence, there are two weighting regimes that can be used: fixed kernel and adaptive
kernel. For the fixed kernel, distance is constant but the number of nearest neighbors varies.
For the adaptive kernel, distance varies but the number of neighbors remains constant. The
most commonly used kernels are Gaussian distance decay-based functions (Fotheringham
et al. 2002):

Wij ¼ exp (cid:2)

 

!

d2
ij
h2

where h is a non-negative parameter known as bandwidth, which produces a decay of
influence with distance and dij is the measure of distance between location i and j. Using
point coordinates (xi,yi) and (xj,yj), the distance is usually defined as a Euclidean distance

(cid:6)2
ðxi (cid:2) xjÞ2 þ yi (cid:2) yj

(cid:5)

dij ¼

According to Equations (3) and (4), if i and j coincide, the weight of that observation will
be unity, and the weight of other data will decrease according to the Gaussian curve when the
distance between i and j increases. Other commonly used weighting functions include the bi-
square function (Fotheringham et al. 2002) and the tri-cube kernel function (McMillen 1996).
To avoid (1) exaggerating the degree of nonstationarity present in the areas where data
are sparse or (2) mask subtle spatial nonstationarity where the data are dense (Paez et al.
2002), adaptive weighting functions are used to change the kernel size to suit localized
observation patterns. Kernels have larger bandwidths where the data points are sparsely
distributed and smaller ones where the data are plentiful. By adapting the bandwidth, the
same number of nonzero weights is used for each regression point i in the analysis. For
example, the adaptive bi-square weighting function is the following:

Wij ¼

if dij < hi

otherwise

where hi stands for the bandwidth particular to location i.

2.3. Choosing an appropriate bandwidth
In the process of calibrating a GWR model, the weighting model should first be decided.
This can be done by cross-validation. Suppose that the predicted value of yi from GWR is
denoted as a function of h by ^yi (h), the sum of the squared error may then be written as

CVRSS hð Þ ¼

In practice, plotting CVRSS(h) against the parameter h can provide guidance on selecting
an appropriate value of the parameter or it can be obtained automatically with an optimization
technique by minimizing Equation (6) in terms of goodness-of-fit statistics or the corrected
Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Hurvich et al. 1998, Fotheringham et al. 2002).

3. Extending GWR with temporal variations

Since complex temporal effects can also lead to nonstationarity in real estate prices, this
article demonstrates how to incorporate temporal information in the GWR model to develop
a GTWR model that captures both spatial and temporal heterogeneity and improves its
goodness-of-fit.

3.1. Accounting for spatio-temporal nonstationarity

In practice, the GWR model accounts for spatial nonstationarity in parameter estimates by
constructing a weight matrix based on distances between estimation point i and all other
observations. Conventionally, the time variable is accommodated separately by adjusting the
sale price observations to a common date, often using some adapted form of present value or
future value calculation (Wang 2006).

As an alternative (or perhaps complementary) approach, we accounted for spatio-
temporal nonstationary in parameter estimates by constructing the weight matrix based on
distances determined from (x, y, t) coordinates between observation i and all other observa-
tions in line with the GWR technique. Thus, the GTWR model can be expressed as

Yi ¼ (cid:2)0 ui; vi; ti
ð

Þ þ

(cid:2)k ui; vi; tt

ð

ÞXik þ "i

X

k

Essentially, the problem here is to provide estimates of (cid:2)k(ui,vi,ti), for each variable k and
each space–time location i. Similarly, the estimation of (cid:2)k(ui,vi,ti) can be expressed as
follows:

^(cid:2) ui; vi; ti
ð

Þ ¼ X T W ui; vi; ti

ð

ÞX

(cid:2)

(cid:3)(cid:2)1

X T W ui; vi; ti
ð

ÞY

where W(ui,vi,ti) = diag((cid:3)i1, (cid:3)i2, . . ., (cid:3)in) and n is the number of observations. Here the
diagonal elements (cid:3)ij(1 (cid:3) j (cid:3) n) are space–time distance functions of (u,v,t) corresponding
to the weights when calibrating a weighted regression adjacent to observation point i. Thus,
the spatio-temporal GTWR model relies on the appropriate specification of the space–time
distance decay function (cid:3)ij. To calibrate the model, it is still assumed that the observed data
points ‘close’ to point i in the space–time coordinate system have a greater influence in the
estimation of the (cid:2)k(ui,vi,ti) parameters than the data located farther from observation i. In
this sense, the definition of ‘close’ incorporates two variables: temporal closeness and spatial
closeness. Hence, defining and measuring the so-called closeness in a space–time coordinate
system is a key problem in the GTWR model.

Before accounting for the spatio-temporal distance function, it might be helpful to
discuss some underlying notions on the measurement of ‘closeness’. Suppose that the
observed data are located in a three-dimensional space–time coordinate system and consider
those points close to location i. For instance, if the space–time coordinate system has the
same scale effect on distance, we can draw a sphere of certain radius, say r, around a

particular regression point i and calibrate a regression model using ordinary least squares
(OLS) only on the observations within this sphere. The (cid:2)k(ui,vi,ti) obtained can then be
considered as an estimate of the associations between the variables in and around i.

However, location and time are usually measured in different units (in our case, location
in meters and time in days), thus they have different scale effects. It seems to be more
appropriate to use an ellipsoidal coordinate system to measure the ‘closeness’ between a
regression point and its surrounding observed points. Figure 1 shows an example of the
proposed spatio-temporal distance. It suggests that a simple and straightforward way of
modeling a distance of time is to integrate it directly with spatial distance into the spatio-
temporal distance function.

Given a spatial distance dS and a temporal distance dT, we can combine them to form a

spatio-temporal distance dST such that

where # can represent different operators. If the ‘+’ operator is adopted to measure the total
spatio-temporal distance dST, then it is expressed as a linear combination between dS and dT.

dST ¼ dS # dT

dST ¼ (cid:4)dS þ (cid:5)dT

where (cid:4) and (cid:5) are scale factors to balance the different effects used to measure the spatial and
temporal distance in their respective metric systems. Therefore, if the parameters (cid:4) and (cid:5) are
adjusted appropriately, dST can be used to measure the extent of ‘closeness’ in a spatio-
temporal space. It should be noted that the scale factors are necessary; otherwise, if dS is
much larger than dT, dST will be dominated by dS. This may degrade the temporal effect, and
vice versa.

ST =(cid:5) are parameters of the spatial and temporal bandwidths, respectively. As such,
the weighting construct of the GTWR model retains a diagonal matrix, whose diagonal
elements are multiplied by (cid:3)S
ij (1 (cid:3) j (cid:3) n). Thus, it follows that we can build a spatially
weighted matrix WS and a temporally weighted matrix WT and then combine them to form a
spatio-temporal weight matrix WST = WS · WT. Other weighted matrix combination
methods, such as Kronecker products, proposed by Langville and Stewart (2004) for spatio-
temporal covariance can also be examined, but these fall outside the scope of this discourse.
Based on Equation (11), after the distances between location i and all observations are
computed, the weighting functions can then be constructed. In theory, if there is no temporal
variation in the observation data, then the parameter (cid:5) can be set to 0 (i.e., (cid:5) = 0), which, in
turn, degrades the distance calculation to the traditional GWR distance. If, on the other hand,
the parameter (cid:4) is set to 0 (i.e., (cid:4) = 0), only the temporal distances and the temporal

390

nonstationarity are considered. This will lead to a TWR. In most real cases, however,
neither (cid:5) nor (cid:4) equals zero, and both spatial and temporal distances will be modeled using
Equation (11).

Let (cid:6) denote the parameter ratio (cid:5)/(cid:4) and (cid:4) (cid:2) 0. We can rewrite Equation (11) by

normalizing the coefficient of dS,

and we have ˜W ST ¼ ð1=(cid:4)Þ (cid:3)S
ij ¼ W ST =(cid:4). Because W(ui,vi,ti) multiplied by a constant
in Equation (8) will not change the estimation of (cid:2)k(ui,vi,ti), we can see that only the
parameter ratio (cid:6) = (cid:5)/(cid:4) plays an important role in constructing weights. In fact, the essential
effect of (cid:6) is to enlarge/reduce the temporal distance effect to match with spatial distance.
Without loss of generality, we set (cid:4) = 1 to reduce the number of parameters in practice, and
so only (cid:5) has to be determined. (cid:5) can also be optimized using cross-validation in terms of R2
or AIC if no a priori knowledge is available.

Implementation

To examine the applicability of GTWR, a case study was implemented using the housing
prices observed between 2002 and 2004 in the city of Calgary, Canada. The spatial and
temporal heterogeneities were first tested using statistical hypotheses, and we then devel-
oped various price models using four different approaches and examined their goodness-of-
fit. First, the housing data was analyzed using a global OLS without any spatial or temporal
considerations. Following this, we performed regressions with the traditional GWR and the
proposed TWR and GTWR, respectively, for the housing data. For comparison purposes, we
applied McNamara’s test to assess the statistical significance of differences between differ-
ent models.

4.1. Study data

Calgary is located in southern Alberta on the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountain Foothills
at the merging of the Bow and Elbow rivers. It is the largest city in Alberta and the fifth
largest in Canada.

As portrayed in Figure 2, the study area was in a large part of the northwest and southeast
market analysis areas. The northwest area is near the central part of the city, north of the Bow
River from the downtown area. The sample contains several established neighborhoods,
including Parkdale, St. Andrew Heights, Hounsfield Heights, West Hillhurst, Hillhurst,
Rosedale, Sunnyside, and crescent Heights. Most of them are the relatively old residential
communities, with some homes dating back to around 1910. Some of the southeast sample
area is still under development. The neighborhoods are Cougar Ridge, West Springs,
Patterson Heights, Couch Hill, Aspen Woods, Strathcona Park, Christie Park, Springbank
Hill, Signal Hill, and Discovery Ridge, which are all fairly new residential communities.
Most of these were developed after 1980.

A set of 5000 observations were available: the data (1) included full information on age,
living area, land area, garage type, condition, and other variables; (2) were of the most common
construction types; (3) were of the most common occupancy type; and (4) were of the most
common zoning types. According to Sirmans et al. (2005), using the observed price is
generally considered to be more suitable for minimizing the bias than other measures such

as an owner’s self-assessment. A recent selling price was taken as the dependent variable,
standing as a proxy for the market value of the house. The explanatory variables comprised
three groups, which included a total of 33 variables. These were conflated into 11 variables:
living area, land area, quality, structure type, renovation, garage, condition, green space, traffic
condition, view, and age. Averages for the age of the houses, land area, and living area at each
house unit (an entire house) were calculated using ArcGIS. Discrete variables, such as the
number of houses without a garage and the number of houses with a view in each unit, were
also counted using location-related joins, and then the percentage of properties without garages
and the percentage of properties with a view in each unit were calculated. The percentage of
green and open space area in each unit was also computed.

4.2. Spatial and temporal nonstationarity diagnosis
For the type of data in the sample, an analyst should first consider whether the GWR-based
models (TWR, GWR, and GTWR) can describe the data set significantly better than an OLS
model. In other words, we need to assess whether there is significant spatial and/or temporal
nonstationarity over the study area before applying GTWR models. In earlier research,
Fotheringham et al. (2002) assessed the degree of nonstationarity visually and constructed
experimental distributions using Monte Carlo procedures. However, this technique is

computationally demanding. Brunsdon et al. (1999) suggest a test of the null hypothesis that
the functions (cid:2)k(u,v) are constants for all points (u,v) in the study area. If there is no evidence
to reject this hypothesis, it suggests that an ordinary global regression model is an adequate
descriptor of the data, i.e.

squares accounted for by the GWR estimates as compared with the global OLS estimates.
This suggests that GWR/OLS comparisons can be expressed in the form of an analysis of
variance (ANOVA) table, with the residual mean squares (MS) for both GWR and OLS
being compared.

The results of ANOVA tests on the observations in Calgary are shown in Table 1. In this
table, the first column lists the residual sum of squares (RSS) (Brunsdon et al. 1999) of OLS,
GWR, TWR, GTWR, and the difference between OLS and GWR-based models. The second

the results of dividing the sums of squares by their respective degrees of freedom. The last two
columns show the pseudo-F statistic and the p-value. We can note the reduction in RSS when
GWR-based approaches were used. It can be seen from the F-test values in Table 1 that the
statistics indicate that there is significant spatial and temporal nonstationarity over the study

area. Therefore, it is more appropriate to model the specified data set with GWR-based models
(TWR, GWR, and GTWR). Moreover, it can be found that modeling spatial nonstationarity
with the traditional GWR is inadequate for our data set, and we posit that a more accurate
model can be established if temporal variation information were added to GWR.

4.3. Optimal parameter selection

As pointed out earlier in Section 3.2, the measurement units for location and time are usually
different. In our case, Euclidean distance was quoted in meters and time in days. These units
need to be harmonized in calculating the space–time distance before constructing spatio-
temporal weighting matrices. We introduced a parameter (cid:6) to balance or harmonize the
different spatial and temporal units. Therefore, one important issue is to optimize (cid:6) before
implementing the GTWR model. In this article, we have used a validation procedure to
obtain an appropriate parameter value in terms of goodness-of-fit.

Figure 3 provides the details of parameter selection. It is evident that the explanatory
ability of the GTWR model with an inefficient (cid:6) parameter could be worse than that of
GWR. For instance, if (cid:6) , 10, the R2 of GTWR is less than that of GWR, where R2 = 0.8856.
In the data set used to generate Figure 3, the optimal parameter of (cid:6) was found to be 35.

Another issue is the choice of spatio-temporal bandwidth. The bandwidth in the GTWR
model determines the rate at which the regression weights decay around a given point (u,v,t).
It is important to choose a suitable bandwidth to obtain reliable estimates of the spatio-
temporal variations in the coefficients. If the bandwidth is small, weights decay quickly with
distance, the values of the regression coefficients change rapidly over space, and the standard
error of ^(cid:2)(u,v,t) increases. On the other hand, larger bandwidths produce smoother results,
but bias increases. An effective way to trade off standard error and bias is to verify by cross-
validation. This argument has been supported by a large body of
research (see,
e.g., Brunsdon et al. 1999, Fotheringham et al. 2002).

4.4. Model comparison criterion

The main criteria adopted for comparing the three different local models (TWR, GWR, and
GTWR) are the conventional goodness-of-fit measures using R2. However, to judge whether
there is statistical significance in the differences between the accuracies achieved by the
three models, McNamara’s test was performed, which is based on the standardized normal
test statistic (Foody 2004):

where Z12 measures the pair-wise statistical significance of the difference between the
accuracies of the first and second prediction models. f12 stands for the number of samples
classified correctly and wrongly by the first and second models, respectively. Accordingly,
f12 and f21 are the counts of classified samples on which the first and second models disagree.
A lower prediction error (higher accuracy) is identified by the sign on Z12. A negative sign
indicates that the results from f12 are more accurate than those from model f21. At the
commonly used 5% level of significance, the difference of accuracies between the first
and the second models is considered statistically significant if |Z12| . 1.96.

5. Results comparison and analysis
5.1. Results of the global model

Using the Calgary house price data set, an OLS regression was first carried out and the
results are reported in Table 2. The Durbin–Watson test indicated that the model is statisti-
cally significant and 76.31% of the variation in the house values can be explained by the
model according to R2.

These results also indicate that the assessed house values in Calgary can be modeled by
the selected housing structural attributes and the neighborhood environment conditions.
Therefore, the hypothesized relationships between the structural neighborhood attributes
and the house values are supported by the data. Indeed, all determinants except one (i.e.,
garage) are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level according to their t-prob-
abilities. In particular, living area, land area, quality, renovation, and house age are positively
correlated with house values, whereas the traffic condition index is negatively correlated
with house values. The larger the living area, the higher the price, and the presence of high
quality can add value to the house significantly. Therefore, living area and quality are the
most significant variables, with the t-values of 33.9 and 40.0, respectively, which show these
variables have the strongest relationship with housing price. Interestingly, it is also found
that age is a positive factor, which means the older the house, the more valuable it is. A
possible reason is that in the samples, older houses are closer to the city centre and hence

have higher prices. Intuitively, one should expect a newer house to be more valuable than an
older house, and this points to a general weakness in global models mentioned earlier.

5.2. Results of the TWR, GWR, and GTWR models
Using the same data set, GWR-based models (i.e., TWR, GWR, and GTWR) were also tested,
and the results are reported in Tables 3 and 4. Because the output of local parameter estimates
from TWR, GWR, and GTWR would be voluminous, Tables 3 and 4 only provide a five-
column summary of the distribution of each parameter to indicate the extent of its variability.
The signs of all the parameters between the lower quartile (LQ) and the upper quartile (UQ) in
GWR are the same as GTWR, and the magnitude of all the parameters in the global models are
between the minimum and the maximum values of those in TWR, GWR, or GTWR.

Tables 3 and 4 provide a detailed statistical comparison. It should be noted that the
percentage of explanation of variance has increased from 76.31% in the global OLS model to
77.94% in TWR, 88.97% in GWR, and 92.82% in GTWR. Tables 3 and 4 reveal that the
GTWR model is the best, even if the differences in degrees of freedom with the reduction in
AIC (from -5595.6 for the global model to -5886.9 for TWR, -8693.9 for GWR, and
-8850.4 for GTWR) are taken into account. By comparing the residual standard error and
RSS, the decreased value further indicates that GTWR gives a better fit of data than the
TWR, GWR, and global models. We posit that this is because GTWR can handle both spatial
and temporal heterogeneities. Moreover, Table 3 shows that the GWR model achieved a
better goodness-of-fit than that of TWR model in terms of R2. A possible reason is that the
experimental data only covered a short period (3 years), which indicates that the temporal
nonstationary effect is less significant than that of spatial nonstationarity.

Given that the GWR-based models (TWR, GWR, and GTWR) are statistically valid,
another issue is to decide which parameters vary significantly across the study area. The
Monte Carlo significance test is usually used to check whether the parameter estimates

exhibit significant spatial variation (Fotheringham et al. 1998). However, this approach has
the disadvantage of being computer-intensive and computation demanding. Hence, we
adopted the alternative statistical test proposed by Leung et al. (2000) due to its simplicity
and efficiency. They test the following hypothesis using the F statistic.

H0 : (cid:2)1k ¼ (cid:2)2k ¼ (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) ¼ (cid:2)nk; for a given k
H1 : not all (cid:2)ik i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n

By constructing the statistical value V 2

^(cid:2)ikÞ2, which reflects the

n
spatial variation of the given set of the parameters with the sample variance of the estimated
values of (cid:2)ik(i = 1,2, . . ., n), an approximated F distribution value is used to decide which
hypothesis is appropriate (Leung et al. 2000). The large value of F supports the alternative
hypothesis H1. It should be noted that the p-value is now widely accepted in applied statistics
because of its ease of use. For the proposed test, the p-value of the test statistic is the
probability that the statistic could have been more extreme than its observed value under the
null hypothesis. A large p-value supports the null hypothesis, whereas a small p-value
supports the alternative hypothesis. A test can be carried out by comparing the p-value
with a given significance level, for example, 0.05. If the p-value is less than 0.05, the null
hypothesis is rejected; otherwise, it is accepted.

Table 5 lists the F-statistic value of each variable and its corresponding p-value. Those
statistically significant values at the 5% level are marked with a asterisk ‘*’. It can be found
that intercept, living area, and land area have significant spatial and temporal variation in the
local parameter estimates for all three models. However, the temporal variation of quality,
traffic condition, and age variables are not significant in the TWR model, whereas they show
significant spatial variation in the GWR and GTWR models. We can also infer from Table 5
that the GWR model fits the data set better than the TWR model, because the data exhibits
more spatial variation in the variables than those of the temporal dimension. Quantitative
support for this deduction is demonstrated by the R2 statistic in Table 3. Moreover, the
GTWR model integrates both potential temporal and spatial variation of variables, thus the

number of nonstationary variables in the GTWR model should not be fewer than those of the
TWR and GWR models.

One important characteristic of the GWR-based technique is that the local parameter
estimates that denote local relationships are mappable and thus allow for visual analysis.
Taking the coefficients of ‘living area’ as an example, we can group them into several
intervals and color each interval to visualize the spatial variation patterns of this variable.

The spatial distributions of the parameter estimates for ‘living area’ of TWR, GWR, and
GTWR are shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that for the TWR model, there is no significant
spatial variation (i.e., [1.13, 1.24]) over time (temporal distance leads to the spatial variation
in this case). This is somewhat trite, because TWR only models temporal heterogeneity,
which indicates that the spatial variation of this coefficient is not obvious. Moreover, the
spatial variation of ‘living area’ in GWR and GTWR share analogous distributions, except
that the spatial variation in the GTWR model portrays heterogeneity in more detail. It can be
inferred that the spatio-temporal nonstationarity of the GTWR model is dominated by the
spatial effect for the test data set.

It can also be seen from Figure 4 that spatial variation of the parameter ‘living area’ in
GTWR shows two major trends: living area varies from high in the east to low in the west
and from low in the outer zones of the study area to high in the inner zone. This suggests that
the living area of a house had the most important influence on housing prices in the eastern
part of the city.

5.3. Significant difference comparison of GWR-based models

As demonstrated above, all GWR-based models (TWR, GWR, and GTWR) show signifi-
cant improvements over the OLS model in terms of R2 and AIC measures. However, it is still
necessary to investigate whether the GTWR model performs significantly better than the
GWR and TWR models from a statistical viewpoint.

The McNamara’s test was implemented to test the significant difference between the
TWR, GWR, and GTWR models. It was assumed that if the difference between the predicted
price and the actual price were no more than a predefined percentage threshold, the model
could be considered ‘correct’. The predicted accuracies of each model can then be commu-
tated and Z values obtained by Equation (17). Two percentage thresholds " = 0.1% and

" = 0.5% were specified, and the results are listed in Table 6. They clearly indicate (negative
value) that the GTWR model performed better than GWR. The Z values between TWR and
GWR within 0.1 and 0.5% error bounds are -5.33 and -13.67, respectively, indicating that
GWR substantially outperformed TWR. Also, the Z values between GTWR and GWR
within 0.1 and 0.5% error bounds are -2.30 and -9.35, respectively, both of them less than
-1.96. These results demonstrate a significant difference between the TWR, GWR, and
TWGR models at the 95% confidence level. It is clear from these comparisons that GTWR
outperforms both GWR and TWR in the model accuracy for the sample data.

6. Conclusions
As most previous studies have demonstrated that the hypothesis of a stationary housing
market is unlikely to be supported, this study took a nonstationary approach for analyzing
housing prices in the city of Calgary. Our analysis reveals that spatio-temporal heterogeneity
prevails in the real estate data that evolve over both time and space in the sample area and
that traditional GWR for spatial nonstationarity only is, therefore, inadequate to model such
data.

We extended the GWR model to incorporate time to deal with both spatial and temporal
heteroscedasticity simultaneously. GTWR achieved a better modeling accuracy than both
the global OLS model with no spatio-temporal nonstationarity incorporated and the GWR
model, which deals with spatial nonstationarity only in our sample data. Compared with the
global OLS model, TWR and GWR increased the R2 values from 0.763 to 0.779 and 0.889,
respectively, and GTWR yielded a considerably higher R2 of 0.928. The RSS for the GTWR
also yielded a 46.4% improvement over OLS and a 15.6% improvement over
GWR. Statistical tests showed that there was a significant difference between GTWR,
GWR, and TWR, and therefore we conclude that it is meaningful to incorporate temporal
nonstationarity into a GWR model, and GTWR can provide an additional useful methodol-
ogy for computer-assisted mass estimation of real property prices.

Some limitations still remain in our study and further work is required. For example, only
three years of temporal information was available. The inadequacy in temporal heterogene-
ity can be expected to degrade the model performance of TWG and GTWR. How GTWR
would perform if applied to the data covering a longer period merits further investigation. In
addition, we have used a simple weighting system based on a linear combination of temporal
and spatial distances. More efficient weighting schemes still need to be designed to yield
better results. We have also not attempted to duplicate the procedures used by the City of
Calgary’s appraisal department, where the city is divided into a number of appraisal areas
and an OLS model is developed for each area. Further tests of the GTWR methodology,
using a number of different models, against the localized OLS models, which perhaps
incorporate response surface analysis and fuzzy boundaries, also merit investigation.

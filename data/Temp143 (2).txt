Abstract A structural and quantitative representation of disaster status contributes to efficient
emergency decision-making, for this purpose, a representation model for disaster status is
developed in this paper, called spatio-temporal scenario model (short for STSM model).
Concept of the term ‘scenario’ is discussed at first. Then, based on the concept, STSM model
is proposed and introduced in detail. It contains two components: developing scenario
connotation and developing spatio-temporal framework. Scenario connotation is to develop
representation of disaster status of each object, consisting of object representation and damage
representation. Spatio-temporal framework is to develop representation of evolution of disaster
status, consisting of representation of spatial relation, temporal relation, natural environment
and emergency response. Finally, an example is provided to show the effectiveness of STSM
model. Advantages of the developed model lie in four aspects: flexibility in describing
dynamic disaster status; universal representation of disaster status contributing to similarity
assessment; helping in evaluating emergency severity with the quantitative representation of
disaster status. Moreover, it helps decision-makers obtain a more comprehensive representa-
tion for disaster evolution in a certain time space.

1 Introduction

Emergency decision-making is a dynamic and multifaceted process aimed at minimizing the
damage of large-scale emergency events [1, 2]. It is very difficult and time consuming to
analyze decision process based on a whole emergency case. To address this issue, scenario-
based decision pattern has been widely used in analyzing decision process of different
emergency events [3–6]. It shows that analyzing decision process based on scenario can
trigger specific decision and raise situation awareness of decision-makers, on account that
scenario makes decision-makers focus on more specific decision problem and helps in
projecting possible future of current situation [7, 8].

Recently, tailoring definition and representation for scenario in this pattern has got more
attentions in emergency management. Tina [9, 10] defined scenario as certain emergency
situation and its development and consequences. Scenario was represented by a set of
attributes of situation in the research. Wu et al. [11] proposed a domain ontology for chemical
risk analysis, in which scenario was defined as an ordered combination of specific instances,
and contains a description of the environment, the context, the actors, and the actions involved.
Conrado, de Oude, and Ieee [12, 13] analyzed decision-process in marine incidents based on
scenarios. They considered scenario as plausible future of certain situation, and scenario was
presented by casual model. Fogli and Guida [14] used this pattern in public health event and
regarded scenario as a set of initial events triggering emergency decision-making, but they did
not introduce scenario representation in detail. These studies shows that the basis of scenario-
based decision pattern is scenario definition and representation [15], and scenario is a way to
help decision maker acquire information of disaster status effectively. However, there are still
some issues to be further studied for scenario definition and representation:

&

&

Firstly, the connotation and extension of the term ‘scenario’ is not clear enough. Most
studies lack further expounding on the term ‘scenario’ which makes acquisition of
connotation and extension of scenarios difficult. It will lead to an inefficient case study.
Secondly, most scenario representation models lack formal description of scenarios in a
mathematical manner. Moreover, disaster status in these representation models lacks
quantitative representation. Scenario analysis helps decision-makers in raising situation
awareness. It is necessary to represent disaster status in a quantitative way. It provides
more intuitive awareness of disaster influence in different emergencies and helps in
evaluating emergency severity and effectiveness of decisions.

& Thirdly, current studies lack developing spatio-temporal framework for scenario. Spatial-
temporal factors, such as spatial relation and natural environment and so on have important
influence on disaster evolution as well as decision-making [16]. Developing spatio-
temporal framework for scenario will help decision-makers acquire more accurate evolu-
tion of disaster status in a certain time space.

Considering issues mentioned above, in this study, a scenario representation model name
spatio-temporal scenario model (short for STSM model) is developed. Concept of the term
‘scenario’ is discussed at first. Then, based on the concept, STSM model is proposed and

Geoinformatica

introduced in detail. It contains two components: developing scenario connotation and devel-
oping spatio-temporal framework. Scenario connotation is to develop representation of disaster
status of each object, consisting of object representation and damage representation. Spatio-
temporal framework is to develop representation of evolution of disaster status, consisting of
representation of spatial relation, temporal relation, natural environment and emergency
response. Finally, an example is provided to show the effectiveness of STSM model.

The content of this paper is as follows: in section 2, concept of the term ‘scenario’ is
discussed. Spatio-temporal scenario model is proposed and introduced in detail from section 3
to section 5. Application example is showed in section 6. In section 7, conclusions are
discussed.

2 Concept of ‘scenario’ in emergency decision-making

The main purpose of emergency decision-making is to protect objects from different disaster
damages [17, 18]. It implies that effective acquisition of information about the affected objects
and the related disaster damages are the guarantee for proper decisions. Therefore developing
representation for disaster status of each object is an important task of scenario representation.
Besides, on account that emergency decision-making is affected by some spatio-temporal
factors, such as spatial relation of objects and nature environment, developing a spatio-
temporal framework consisting of these spatial-temporal factors is another task of scenario
representation. Above all, in this paper, object, disaster status and spatio-temporal factors are
considered as three basic elements of scenario, and scenario representation is to develop
representation for object and its disaster status, as well as, to develop spatio-temporal frame-
work to organize the related spatio-temporal factors. Details of the three basic elements are as
follows:

& Objects refer to spatial entities influenced by disasters, such as oil tanks, people, pipelines
and so on, which are focus for decision-makers. In the developed model, objects are
denoted by e, and a finite set of objects is denoted by E.

& A disaster status refers to an emergency situation of a certain object, which is described as
several disaster damages by decision-makers. Generally, disaster status is analyzed corre-
sponding to a time slice instead of a time point, due to the cognitive limitation of decision-
makers. In the developed model, disaster status is denoted by d and a finite set of disaster
status is denoted by D.
Spatio-temporal factors refers to spatial relation of objects, temporal relation of disaster
statuses, and related natural environment and corresponding emergency response for each
disaster status. They are organized to form spatio-temporal framework to show decision-
makers the whole disaster evolution in a certain time space.

&

Based on these, concept of the term ‘scenario’ is described as follows:
A scenario is an ordered representation of a set of disaster statuses that emerge on
objects in a certain time-space. Its connotation is to representation of disaster status
of each object, consisting of object representation and representation of disaster
damage. Its extension is spatio-temporal framework, composed of the related spatio-
including temporal relation, spatial relation, natural environment
factors,
temporal
and emergency response.

Centered on the concept of scenario, details about representing disaster status of each object

and developing spatio-temporal framework are discussed in the following sections.

3 Representation of Disaster Status

3.1 Disaster scalar and object representation

In this paper, object attributes that affect disaster evolution, are defined as non-directional
property of disaster status, called disaster scalar. This definition indicates two critical characters
of disaster scalar: non-directivity and pertinence. Non-directivity refers that value variation of
object attribute has non-linear influence on disaster evolution. For example, if the value of
object attribute named Storage Product changes from ‘Petrol’ to ‘Crude oil’, it is hard to judge
whether combustion of oil tank will get severer or not only according to the value variation of
Storage Product. Pertinence refers that each disaster scalar has influence on disaster evolution.
Generally, a certain object has plenty of object attributes but only a few have influence on
disaster evolution, for example, whether an oil tank will boil over or not mainly depends on
object attribute ‘Storage Product’, but is irrelevant to object attribute ‘Manufacturer’. Defini-
tions and notations are as follows:

Definition 1 Object attribute is denoted as a and the universal set of object attributes is
denoted as A. For a certain object attribute aj, aj ∈ A, set the name of aj as name( aj),
which is a word set. ∀ai, aj ∈ A, define:

i)
ii)

i ≠ j ⇔ name(ai) ≠ name(aj)
i = j ⇔ name(ai) = name(aj)

Definition 2 Attribute value is denoted as a(e), a(e) = NULL means that the attribute
value is nonsense. For a certain attribute aj, aj ∈ A, set the attribute domain of aj as
dom(aj). Define: NULL ∉ dom( aj) and for a certain object ei, if aj(ei) ≠ NULL, say that aj
is an attribute of ei, denoted as aj(ei) ∈ dom(aj)
Definition 3 Object attribute assessment is the mapping

x : A→ 0; 1f

g:

Which indicates whether an object attribute is useful or not. For a certain object attribute aj
and a certain disaster status di, denote the object of di as ei. Say that aj is a disaster scalar of di,
if the following conditions are satisfied; otherwise, say that aj is useless for di:

i) aj(ei) ∈ dom(aj)
x(aj) = 1
ii)

Considering that choosing disaster scalars for each object is time-consuming, we classify
objects into different object categories. For each object category, the set of shared disaster
scalars is defined as object representation model. In this viewpoint, object attribute assessment
is no longer for object, but for object category. Definitions and notations are as follows:

Geoinformatica

Definition 4∃AΠ ⊆ A, if the following conditions are satisfied, EΠ is called object cate-
gory and Π is called category label:

i) ∀e ∈ E∏, ∀ a ∈ A∏, a(e) ∈ dom(a)
ii) ∀e ∈ E∏, ∀ a ∈ A/A∏, a(e) = (NULL)

In this case, a∈A is called shared attribute and A is called communal set.

Definition 5 ∃EΠ ⊂ E, let DΠ represent its disaster status set. If ∃AΠ
a2, …, am}, the following conditions are satisfied, say that AΠ
model of EΠ:

∗ = {a1,
∗ ⊂ AΠ, AΠ
∗ is the representation

i) ai ∈ A∏
ii) aj ∈ A∏/A∏

∗, ∃ d ∈ D∏, ai is a disaster scalar of d;
∗, ∀ d ∈ D∏, aj is useless for d;

In this case, ai is called shared disaster scalar. For a certain object ei,ei∈E; say that

tion of ei

Figure 1 shows representation models for object category ‘Tank’ and object category ‘Tank
Car’ respectively, as well as object representation of different objects. It seems that objects in
different object categories can have the same disaster scalar but their representation models are
certainly different.

3.2 Disaster Element and Disaster Vector

Generally, decision-makers’ cognition to a certain disaster status is described as a set of
disaster damages [19], each of which can be represented as pair: disaster damage = <damage
name, damage value>, where damage name indicates what the damage is and damage value
indicates how the damage is. On account that representing damage value with fuzzy terms (e.g.
very low, low, high) is not convenient for assessing severity and similarity [20], in this paper,

Fig. 1 Scenario scalars of different scenario objects

Geoinformatica

disaster element is used to quantify disaster damage. That is, disaster element is defined as a
number axis, which starts from 0 and gradually increases to the maximum value. 0 indicates
that there is no damage, and the maximum value indicates the worst damage. Therefore,
disaster element can be regarded as the directional property of disaster, and its positive
direction represents the direction which disaster damage gets worse and worse. Moreover,
considering the independence of disaster element, quantitative representation of certain disaster
status is defined as liner combination of disaster element, called disaster vector. Definitions
and notations are as follows:

Definition 6 A disaster element is the mapping

(cid:6)
~a : DΠ→ 0; MAX

A scenario space is expanding if there emerges new disaster damage type. In this
case, the number of dimension of the disaster space will increase, called space-self-
growing (shown as Figure 2). Space-self-growing shows that disaster space is
prolongable and its structure can be updated continuously based on the existed
structure.

4 Spatio-temporal Framework

According to the concept of scenario, spatial relation of objects, temporal relation of disaster
statuses, natural environment and emergency response are the related spatio-temporal factors,
which have influence on disaster evolution. They are organized to form spatio-temporal
framework. Therefore, developing spatio-temporal framework is to develop representation of
the related spatio-temporal factors. In this paper, natural environment and emergency response
are defined to be presented in a narrative way in text, therefore, rest of this section will put
emphasis on representation of spatial relation and temporal relation.

4.1 Spatial relation representation

Spatial relation representation refers to representing the spatial relation of objects in
the same spatial scene. Generally, a spatial scene comprises a collection of spatial
objects and their particular spatial arrangement [21]. In this paper, a spatial scene is
limited to a set of objects that have close spatial relation and their spatial relation has
influence on evolution of disaster status. Let E(c) represent spatial scene, and three
basic principles are illustrated as follows for choosing approaches to spatial relation
representation of objects in E(c):

& Principle 1: An approach for spatial relation representation should be more qualitative.

Generally, approaches to spatial representation can be divided into quantitative approach
and qualitative approach, among which qualitative approach is regarded as a more promising
way to represent spatial information at human level and has prevailed in many fields for its
understandability, high efficiency and computational facility [22, 23].

& Principle 2: An approach for spatial relation representation should be natural language-

based.

Spatial representation in most emergency cases is recorded in natural language, which is
regarded as the most direct and well-understood way for spatial representation [24]. Natural
language-based approach can meet different requirements from spatial representation in
emergency cases. For example, direction relation usually needs to be described qualitatively
(e.g. ‘north’, ‘south’, ‘west’, ‘east’), however, for distance relation representation, quantitative
description is needed, especially in emergency location.

& Principle 3: An approach for spatial relation representation should represent spatial

relation in a multi-layer manner

Geoinformatica

Decision-makers at different decision levels focus on different objects in a certain spatial
scene, generally, the higher the level the more abstract the object [25]. For example, in depot
fire disaster, the commander cares about the monolithic disaster status of each tank farm, but
the fireman cares about disaster status of each affected tank in a tank farm. Therefore, spatial
relation representation of objects should meet different requirements from different decision
levels.

Taking the principles mentioned above, in this paper, a spatial analysis model named grid-
based hierarchical qualitative spatial representation and calculation model (short for GHQ
model) [26, 27] is proposed. The main idea of GHQ model is: Object in a certain spatial scene
is regarded as a set of grid cells after grid partition of planar graph of the spatial scene.
Geographic coordinate of object is replaced by coordinate of corresponding grid cells. In this
case, spatial relation representation is embodied by coordinate relation between grid cells. Let
g = (xg, xg) represent grid coordinate of a grid cell g, and G represent a finite set of grid cells,
called grid set. What is noteworthy is that, although grid cells are divided into interior cells
and boundary cells in GHQ model, where interior cell is totally covered by object and
boundary grid cell is covered by object, they are defined as element of grid set from a
mathematical point of view (shown as Figure 3).

4.1.1 Topological relation representation

In GHQ model, surface entity, curve entity and point entity are all regarded as surface entity. In
this viewpoint, topological relation between objects only refers to area-area topological
relation, and can be represented as follows:

Definition 13 Set the topological relation on E(c) as RTop, ∀ei, ej ∈ E(c), RTop(ei, ej) is the
topological relation between ei and ej. The representation of RTop(ei, ej) in GHQ model is
shown in Table 1.

4.1.2 Direction relation representation

Direction relation describes where a spatial entity (called primary object) is placed relative to
another one (called reference object) [28]. Generally, direction relation representation is to use

direction-relation matrix to represent direction relation between primary object and reference
object [29, 30]. However, in some situations, due to the fact that shape of objects cannot be
ignored, the result of direction relation representation is not unique. For example, if shape of
the primary object A cannot be ignored (shown as Figure 4), different parts of the primary
object A will correspond to different direction-relation matrices in conventional direction
representation, which is adverse to spatial similarity assessment. For this reason, in GHQ
model, direction-relation matrix for representation of direction relation between objects is a
weighted summation of direction-relation matrices of different parts of the primary object
(shown in Table 2). Definition and notation of direction relation representation is defined as
follows:

Definition 14 Set the direction relation on E(c) as RDir,∀ei, ej ∈ E(c), RDir(ei, ej) is
the direction relation between ei and ej, where ei is the reference object and ej

4.1.3 Distance relation representation

Quantitative approach and qualitative approach are two ways to represent distance
relation [31]. Quantitative approach measures the distance between two objects, such
as Bthe distance between A and B is 100m^. Qualitative approach often involve the
comparison to a third object. For example, BA is closer to B than that to C^. In this
paper, distance relation is represented by quantitative approach, and only refers to the
area/area distance relation. In this viewpoint, for two objects ei and ej, let Gi and Gj
be the corresponding grid set of ei and ej respectively. According to their spatial

5 Spatio-temporal Scenario Model

Spatio-temporal scenario model (short for STSM model) is used to develop scenario for a
certain spatial scene. Based on the representation of connotation and extension of scenario,
scenario is defined as follows:

Definition 17 For a certain spatial sceneE cið Þ and a certain time slice Tj = [εj, ζj], say that Dij is
the set of disaster status related toE cið Þ and Tj, if the following conditions are satisfied:

i) d ∈ Dij ⇒ t(d) ⊆ Tj

Geoinformatica

ii) d∈Dij⇒e dð Þ∈E cið Þ, where ℯ(d) represents the object of d

is temporal relation of disaster statuses in Dij;
is spatial relation of objects in E cið Þ;
is the set of natural environment of each disaster status in Dij, there is:

, where r dð Þ

Finally, for a certain time slice and a certain spatial scene, if their related set of disaster
statuses is determined, the related scenario can be presented as the following form (shown as
Fig. 5). Process of developing scenario with spatio-temporal scenario model (short for STSM
model) is shown as Fig. 6. Steps of developing scenario with STSM are as follows:

This step is to acquire related information such as information of object attributes
considered related to disaster evolution, spatial data of objects, detailed disaster status

&

Step 2: Developing object representation model

This step consists of two sub-steps: first is to classify objects into different object categories.
Second is to select common object attributes which are considered as scenario scalar, to
develop the object representation model of each object category.

The episode records the disaster evolution in Xingang oil depot from 18:15 to 18:30 on
July 16th, 2010, and the original description is BAbout 5 minutes later, there was an explosion
of Tank #103 which caused a massive intensification of the fire. The explosion ruptured the oil
tank and made plenty of oil leaked. Moreover, two adjacent oil tanks Tank #106 and Tank #102
were going to explode due to a higher heat radiation.^

Related information and the layout of oil tanks after grid partition are shown in Table 6. The
length of the grid is 65 m which is the distance to protect adjacent metal oil tanks from disaster
damage if Tank #103 explodes [33]. Considering that the shape of oil tanks has no influence on
spatial relation representation, oil tank is regarded as point and its coordinate is the centroid
coordinate, denoted by (xg, yg).

Based on the related information and with the help of 10 experts, the object representation
model and the disaster space of oil tank are shown in Table 7, and Table 8 shows the spatio-
temporal framework for the episode. Finally, according to the process showed in Fig. 6,
scenario for the episode is shown in Table 9.

7 Conclusions

In this paper, spatio-temporal scenario model (short for STSM model) is proposed to develop a
structural and quantitative representation for disaster status. It consists of two components:
representing disaster status of each object and developing spatio-temporal framework.
Representing disaster status of each object is to develop the connotation of scenario, consisting
of object representation and disaster vector. Developing spatio-temporal framework is to
organize and represent the related spatio-temporal factors, including spatial relation of objects,
temporal relation of disaster status, natural environment and emergency response. Although
STSM model requires initial efforts in developing object representation model and disaster
space, it has many advantages. Firstly, disaster space is flexible enough to allow adding new
disaster elements without affecting existed space structure, which adapts to dynamics of
disaster status. Secondly, disaster statuses whose objects belong to the same object category
can be represented in the universal form. It contributes to similarity assessment of different
disaster status. Thirdly, the quantitative representation of disaster status can help in evaluating
emergency severity. Moreover, STSM model develops spatio-temporal framework for scenar-
io, which helps in analyzing influence of spatio-temporal factors on disaster evolution to
project more accurate evolution of current disaster status.

Besides, in this paper, a spatial analysis model named grid-based hierarchical qualitative
spatial representation and calculation model (short for GHQ model) is used to develop spatial
relation representation of objects. According to the definitions and case study, three main
advantages of GHQ model have been found in representing spatial relation:

&

Firstly, shape of object is no more an obstacle for representation of spatial relation. In GHQ
model, developing representation of spatial relation is by means of analyzing relationships
of grids which belong to objects. That is, although spatial relation representation of objects
in complex shape is regarded as a challenge in most spatial analysis models such as RCC
and n-intersections model [34, 35], in GHQ model, no matter how complex the shape is,
once the grid set of object is determined, the shape has little influence on representation of
spatial relation.

Geoinformatica

&

Secondly, GHQ model integrates representation of typological relation, direction relation,
and distance relation into one representation model, which contributes to spatial similarity
assessment [36].

& Thirdly, representation of typological relation and direction relation in GHQ model are
consistence. No matter what size is determined for grid, it has little influence on represen-
tation of typological relation and direction relation, which makes the representation of
spatial relation more practical.

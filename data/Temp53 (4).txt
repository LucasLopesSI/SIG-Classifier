ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present a systematic approach to sketch map
interpretation. The method decomposes the elements of a sketch
map into a hierarchy of categories, from the material sketch map
level to the non-material representational sketch map level, and
then interprets the sketch map using the ﬁve formal representa-
tion spaces that we develop. These spaces (set, graph, metric and
Euclidean) provide a tiered formal representation based on stan-
dard mathematical structures. We take the view that a sketch map
bears information about the physical world and systematises this
using extensions of existing formal ontologies. The motivation for
this work is the partially automatic extraction and integration of
information from sketch maps. We propose a set of ontologies and
methods as a ﬁrst step in the direction of a formalisation of
partially automatic extraction and integration of sketch map con-
tent. We also see this work as a contribution to spatial cognition,
where researchers externalise spatial knowledge using sketch
mapping. The paper concludes by working through an example
that demonstrates the sketch map interpretation at diﬀerent levels
using the underlying method.

1. Introduction

Sketch maps are drawn by people as a way to communicate information about locations
and routes. They are produced deliberately about some portion of reality that is
perceived and stored as cognitive representations in memory. Such representations
are called cognitive maps (Tolman 1948). Information stored in sketch maps can be
used to infer human spatial knowledge represented in cognitive maps. As Billinghurst
and Weghorst (1995, p. 40) wrote, ‘the fundamental importance of an eﬀective cognitive
map is that it allows two questions to be answered quickly and eﬃciently: where is that?
how do I get to there from here?’ Sketch maps as an externalisation of cognitive maps
are a valid measurement of such cognition information (Newcombe 1985, Blades 1990).
As information artefacts, sketch maps exist independently of their cognitive counter-
parts and transform such mental representations to make them publicly observable and
inspectable. Figure 1 shows the connections between sketch maps, cognitive maps,
spatial knowledge and the portions of reality sketch maps intend to depict. Cognitive

maps serve the construction and accumulation of spatial knowledge obtained in reality
through the mind’s eye (one’s ability to ‘see’ things using sensory organs with the mind).
Sketch maps partially project cognitive maps and reﬂect acquired spatial knowledge on
to paper or other media outside the human mind so that we are able to infer spatial
knowledge from sketch map information.

We need methods that classify and quantify (or qualify) features, especially spatial features
of sketch maps, in order to obtain the spatial knowledge stored in cognitive maps. Such
approaches are determined by the interpretation of the types of information that can be
extracted from sketch maps. Compared to the intensive use of sketch maps to evaluate
cognitive maps as early as Lynch (1960) (cf. Appleyard 1970, Lloyd and Heivly 1987, Tversky
and Lee 1999, Ishikawa et al. 2008) and the interest in cognition information (e.g. Kuipers
1983), less work has been done on sketch map interpretation for cognitive map measurement.
In this study, sketch map interpretation is deﬁned as ﬁnding ways of structuring and
representing the spatial
information that can be extracted from sketch maps. This
deﬁnition is diﬀerent from most existing studies in computer vision that treat interpreta-
tion as a matter of recognising ink and aim at translating strokes and shapes into object
descriptions (Davis 2002, 2007). Diﬀerent from open-domain sketch interpretation in
CogSketch (Forbus et al. 2011), our study is restricted and based on two assumptions:
ﬁrst, our working domain is limited to the sketch maps of urban areas from a survey
perspective with a well-established graphic lexicon and grammar; second, our applica-
tion domain is restricted to geographic information science and spatial cognition where
sketch maps are used mainly for spatial knowledge externalisation. According to Davis
(2002), a graphic lexicon is similar to a vocabulary in language which deﬁnes the set of
shapes used in a domain. For example, artiﬁcial objects such as buildings are usually
drawn as regular shapes while geographical objects such as water bodies are drawn as
irregular blob shapes (Wang 2014). The grammar describes the interrelations among
these shapes to indicate spatial relations such as adjacency or containment.
In this
paper, we deﬁne a sketch map as a freehand physical drawing made on a piece of
paper, and such a drawing is from memory. Also, the sketch map is about an urban area
at environmental scale (Montello 1993). Note that sketch maps do not have to be map-
like representations even though the term ‘sketch map’ has the word ‘map’ in it.

We think consistent and widely accepted ontological resources (including basic
taxonomies as well as more complex ontologies) are necessary for sketch map inter-
pretation. The semantic interpretation of sketch maps can beneﬁt from the deﬁnitions of
useful concepts and the links between them expressed formally as ontologies. We
propose a formal method to interpret sketch maps using a hierarchy of ontological
levels, each populated by its distinctive entities and related in systematic ways to
entities at other levels. This method allows us to interpret and model sketch information
using several formal representation spaces, such as graph and metric spaces, where
existing computational approaches are available for spatial analyses in each representa-
tion space and transformations between diﬀerent spaces. A set of ontologies of sketch
maps is introduced as a ﬁrst step in the direction of a formalisation of partially automatic
extraction and integration of sketch map content. The introduced ontologies demon-
strate ﬁrst how non-material sketch entities (sketch information) at diﬀerent levels are
embedded in corresponding material sketch entities (physical sketch maps), and second,

the study.

information from these non-material entities.

Our work provides consistent ontological resources and a formal model used for
sketch map interpretation for researchers who want to retrieve and analyse sketch
information for evaluating cognitive maps and acquired human spatial knowledge,
and where possibly we draw links between our work and existing ontologies based on
the basic formal ontology (BFO) such as the information artefact ontology (IAO)
(Smith et al. 2013), as well as work from the computer vision domain.

Moreover, our work contributes to automatic sketch information retrieval used by
those sketch map-based systems such as SketchMapia proposed by Schwering et al.
(2014). The contribution is twofold. At the front end, our formal model provides types,
properties and interrelations of relevant sketch features to be recognised by a sketching
interface. At the back end, our ontologies and taxonomies help to design a sketch
database schema with consistent structures and constraints on both sketch map data
and spatial query.

2. Background

We review related work in three areas: sketch mapping for cognitive map evaluation,
existing approaches to sketch understanding and interpretation and ontologies of
information artefacts.

Sketch maps have been used as the main approach to the elicitation of cognitive
maps. Lynch (1960) used sketch maps to study how people internally represent their
local cities. Tversky and Lee (1999) found that it was suﬃcient to employ sketch maps
together with a direction toolkit to convey routes. The central interests to use sketch
maps to assess cognitive maps include studying distortions, schematisation and other
inaccuracies by comparing sketch objects and ground objects (Lloyd and Heivly 1987),
understanding how people form cognitive maps and what information cognitive maps
convey (Appleyard 1970, Kuipers 1983, Chrastil and Warren 2014), and studying the
invariant sketch map information and applying it to a computational environment for
querying spatial databases (Wang and Schwering 2015).

Scientists from the computer vision domain are also interested in sketch maps
(or, more generally, sketches) but have their focus on computer understanding of
sketches in a manner similar to a human observer (Davis 2007). Diﬀerent from formal
diagrams, sketches contain noise such as unintended overlapping shapes and gaps in
circles. Sketch interpretation in this domain attempts to recognise the shape of the
object drawn using the same notion of shape that people use. For online sketches, the
direction, curvature and speed of drawing are recorded, and a sketch at its bottom level
is a collection of strokes, each of which is a set of time-stamped coordinates. Shapes at a
higher level are recognised by observing stroke sequences and matching them locally
against templates using metric distances or shape contexts (Davis 2007). It is worth
mentioning the online sketch understanding platform, CogSketch, made for cognitive
science research and education. Using analogical reasoning, CogSketch combines its
visual, spatial and conceptual knowledge about sketch elements to create a qualitative,
symbolic representation of both the sketch and what it depicts (Forbus et al. 2011).
Sketches in CogSketch are separated into multiple sub-sketches, with each sub-sketch
consisting of one or more layers. Each layer has a genre and pose, both of which
construct spatial relationships. For oﬄine sketches (e.g. scanned paper-based sketches),
sketch images can be ﬁrst segmented as a collection of independent sketch objects and
then reﬁned using local context-aware recognition (Broelemann et al. 2016). Other
methods of detecting sketch shapes include using heuristic rules with a predeﬁned
and restricted set of elements (Chen and Takagi 2013).

Sketch interpretation can beneﬁt from consistent and widely accepted ontological
resources, which provide general taxonomies of what exists in a sketch map as well as
complex relationships between sketch information entities. Some of the most commonly
used upper ontologies are the BFO, the descriptive ontology for linguistic and cognitive
engineering (Gangemi et al. 2002) and the suggested upper merged ontology (SUMO).
BFO-based ontologies can incorporate both continuant and occurrent entities in a single
framework to represent a portion of reality at a given level of granularity (Arp et al.
2015). SUMO was developed by the IEEE (Niles and Pease 2001), and its mapping to
WordNet has made it used frequently for natural language-processing tasks.

In this paper, the choice of a BFO-based approach lies in the fact that BFO has the
well-established IAO, which can represent quality, structure and content of information

foundational ontology (Arp et al. 2015). An information artefact is a material entity
whose function is to bear an information quality entity (IQE) (Smith et al. 2013). When
we talk about an information artefact, we refer to both a continuant physical artefact
such as a physical paper-based sketch map as an information-bearing entity (IBE) and a
continuant information entity carried by the physical artefact (Smith and Malyuta 2015).
IAO contains several fundamental information entities that describe quality, content and
structure of an information artefact (such as a sketch map). The core of IAO contains a
small number of foundational information entities that include both representative and
non-representative aspects of an information artefact. Figure 2 provides the IAO frame-
work based on BFO entities. The representative aspect refers to an information content
entity (ICE), which is a generically dependent continuant ﬁxed in an IBE and intended to
refer to some entities external to the representation. The non-representative aspects
include the IBE, IQE and information structure entity (ISE). An IQE is the pattern on an IBE

by virtue of which it is a bearer of some information entity, and an ISE is the structural
part of an ICE. This framework was reused by Galton et al. (2016) to develop a set of
ontologies to interpret images of cell and tissues.

Galton and Worboys (2011) proposed an ontology of information, whose basic frame-
work is reused in our study to represent interrelations between diﬀerent information
entities.

3. Levels of sketch map interpretation

It is helpful to think of our approach in terms of a number of diﬀerent levels, represent-
ing the stages in deriving sketch elements of diﬀerent types from the bottom material
sketch map level to the higher non-material representational sketch map level. Figure 3

Figure 3. The hierarchy of sketch interpretation.

illustrates this hierarchy of sketch map interpretation. At the material sketch map level
(in black), we have paper-based sketch maps as bearers for non-material sketch informa-
tion. At the representational sketch map level (in blue), we have two types of represen-
tation, namely sketch image and real world. Both representations exist in physical sketch
maps and are supported by representation primitives. The sketch image representation
is only concerned with the visual elements and the composition of these elements in a
sketch map, while the real-world representation makes use of domain-speciﬁc knowl-
edge about the real-world objects being depicted. The real-world representation is
usually indicated by the sketch image representation. Following the IAO deﬁnitions
(Figure 2), a material sketch map is an IBE, and both representations as well as the
representation primitives are ICEs.

3.1. Material sketch map level

At the material level, a sketch map is made of a collection of strokes, each created from
pen-down to pen-up events. The locations and widths of strokes diﬀer in online and
oﬄine sketching (Davis 2007). In online sketching with pen-based input devices, strokes
are composed of time-stamped points, each of which has a position speciﬁed by
coordinates (x, y). In oﬄine sketch maps, strokes are a collection of marks written or
drawn by pens on paper. The oﬄine sketch maps must be scanned ﬁrst as digital images
and then preprocessed to enhance image qualities for further interpretation. The pre-
processing takes into account both the imprecision of freehand drawings such as over-
laps, gaps and wiggles, and typical image eﬀects such as inhomogeneous illumination
(Davis 2007, Broelemann et al. 2011). We only consider oﬄine sketch maps in the current
study.

We reuse the existing taxonomy created by Galton and Worboys (2011) to create
our ontology at the material sketch map level (Figure 4). The ontology in the ﬁgure
has the twofold division deﬁned in BFO (continuants vs. occurrents) as the top-level
distinction between entities. The sketch information entity is without any material
part and has the physical sketch map as its bearer. We include the sketch information
entity here to show the link between the material level and the non-material repre-
sentational level. The details of the information entity will be elaborated in the next
section.

In Figure 4, all the entities except the sketch information event are continuants that
persist through time. The sketch information event is a process occurrent that unfolds in
time. The sketch information entity is a generically dependent continuant that is depen-
dent on one or more independent continuants that can serve as its bearers. It can be
either explicitly encoded or implicitly supported by the physical sketch map as its
information bearer. In this paper, the sketch information bearers are paper-based oﬄine
sketch maps. These sketch maps are created by sketch information events carried out by
sketch information agents as sketch map producers. Galton and Worboys (2011) deﬁned
two types of information event: the information origination event and information
copying event.
In our case, the sketch information entity is originally generated by
drawing on paper as an information origination event, and the subsequent propagation
of the information in a succession of new bearers is accomplished by a series of
information copying events such as photocopying and scanning.

3.2. Representational sketch map level

The physical strokes are not understandable to a human being without further structural
and semantic data to interpret them. Such interpretations are performed at the non-
material, representational sketch map level embedded in the strokes as their bearers. At
this level, sketch image and real-world representations supported by representation
primitives convert raw strokes into meaningful sketch information. The representational
sketch elements and the hierarchy within this level are described below. Figure 5 shows
the overall structure of the level.

3.2.1. Representation primitives
The bottom-level representation primitives support the image and real-world represen-
tations at higher levels. Following the convention of text/graphics separation in docu-
ment analysis (Tombre et al. 2002), we distinguish two types of primitive elements as
textual and graphic. Both types of elements are further recognised at two sub-levels,
namely grapheme and morpheme. Note that the approach to ﬁnd primitive elements is
out of our research scope. Existing methods from sketch recognition research can be
found from the image recognition domain literature (e.g. Sezgin et al. 2006).

The text in our sketch maps usually comprises written words which are used for
annotating or labelling graphic objects. The primitive textual elements are letters in

words. We called these letters graphemes as they are the smallest units of writing. Words
are composed of letters and exist at the morphemic level. We borrow the term mor-
pheme from linguistics to denote words as the smallest meaningful textual elements in
sketch interpretation. Note the diﬀerence in deﬁning morpheme in linguistics, where
morphemes can also be parts of words (Catford 1965).

Using the same categorisation, graphical objects can also be assigned to graphemic
and morphemic levels. Graphic elements at the graphemic level such as straight lines
and arcs are the smallest indivisible graphic units of sketching. Basic shapes such as
individual blobs and squares, formed using these straight lines and arcs, are recognised
at the morphemic level. The relationships of these graphic primitives must obey a set of
geometric constraints such as parallelism and orthogonality (subject to tolerance) to be
instances of particular shapes. Due to physical sketching imprecision, tolerance is
necessary in deﬁning the geometric constraints. For example, it has been found that
orthogonality in sketch maps is usefully deﬁned as the relationship of two lines at right
angles (90° ± 5°) (Wang 2014). Two other methods of shape recognition can also be
applied here (Davis 2007): the ﬁrst considers the sequence of the graphical primitives
used (if available), i.e. how the shape is drawn; and the second considers the traditional
concept of image appearance, i.e. what the shape looks like. Shapes recognised at this
level are mostly done by using the classic isolated recognition method (Broelemann
et al. 2016).

3.2.2. Sketch image representation
Supported by the basic geometric shapes labelled by words, a sketch image representa-
tion addresses only the visual features, particularly geometry, of a sketch image without
making use of any semantics about the depicted reality. This representation is used for
the literal interpretation of a sketch image. This bears resemblance to the composition in
the visual arts in that it only deals with the placement of visual elements such as lines
and shapes but not the subject of a work.

Elements at this level are a collection of sketch objects formed by using representa-
tion primitives and the sketch relationships between these objects. A sketch object is
deﬁned as a user-drawn object consisting of basic geometric shapes and optionally
labelled by words. The labels represent what shapes denote. A sketch object is similar to
a glyph deﬁned in CogSketch (Forbus et al. 2011), where each glyph represents a user-
drawn object composed of ink (corresponds to the arcs and straight lines as graphemic
graphical primitives) and content (corresponds to the words as morphemic textual
primitives). Shapes of sketch objects can be 0-D points, 1-D straight lines and curved
arcs and simple 2-D polygons, and they can also be higher order complex shapes
composed of simple shapes of mixed dimensions. Optionally, these shapes can be
labelled with one or more words inside or next to them. Figure 6(a) shows a raw sketch
map and Figure 6(b) shows its processed sketch image with basic shapes and words
recognised. In the processed image, examples of sketch objects are the areal object that
has the word ‘Bus’ inside, and the linear objects forming ‘Oxford Street’. Sketch objects
with higher order shapes are circled in red in the ﬁgure. The cross and square shapes
form a new shape, which looks like a church symbol. The intersected line and circle form
the symbol of a tube station used in London.

Figure 6. An example of sketch image representation.

Sketch relationships are visual relationships calculated between sketch objects, and
diﬀerent relationships can be calculated depending on the representation space they
use (more details in the next paragraph). Such relationships allow us to resolve ambi-
guity between sketch objects with similar appearance; so, they are important for sketch
map interpretation. Sketch relationships between sketch objects lead to inferences of
conceptual relationships of real-world objects being sketched. For example, the sketch
relationship ‘contains’ indicates a conceptual containment relation between real-world
objects, café (Starbucks) and street block (highlighted in Figure 6 (right)).

We now consider using the following ﬁve formal spaces of sketch objects, which
represent and reason about a sketch image at diﬀerent levels. These spaces have been
chosen because they provide a tiered formal representation based on standard mathe-
matical structures. For each space, we include an example in Figure 7 to show how it can
be used for sketch representation.

Set space. A set of sketch objects provides the simplest representation of a sketch
image. When a sketch image is deﬁned as a set, the constituent sketch objects are called
members of the set. A sketch image can be represented either as comprising three
subsets Spoint, Slinear and Sareal to classify sketch objects of diﬀerent dimensionality, or as
two subsets Plabel and Pnolable to distinguish sketch objects with or without labelling.
Table 1 gives an example of the types of sketch objects classiﬁed regarding their
geometric shapes in a plane.

The set space allows identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of sketch objects. The remaining

four spaces allow determination of spatial relationships between sketch objects.

Abstract graph space. A sketch image is represented in an abstract graph space as a
set of nodes (sketch objects) connected by a set of edges (connectedness as sketch
relations). In practice, a sketch image needs to be processed ﬁrst to have line segments
(as edges) detected using the thinning algorithm (Guo and Hall 1989). Using the abstract
graph structure, we can represent how sketch objects are connected to each other.

Embedded planar graph space. A further level of information may be added to the
graph-based representation by embedding the graph in a 2-D Euclidean space so that
the structure of the graph is preserved. Edges are embedded as arcs that may only be
intersected at nodes of a graph. This concept of embedding allows us to recognise
diﬀerent connectivities represented as inequivalent planar embeddings, even though
they may be isomorphic in the abstract graph space. Since the concept of ‘face’
(ﬂat planar surfaces) becomes available when a graph is embedded in a plane, we can
also represent topological relations such as insideness,
intersection and adjacency
between sketch objects. Depending on the geometries of the sketch objects (Table 1),
diﬀerent topological relationships can be incorporated. For example, using the dimen-
sionally extended 9-intersection model, we can represent the relationships: equality,
disjointness, intersection, touching, overlap, crossing, within and containment between
pairwise sketch objects of varied dimensionalities (Clementini and Di Di Felice 1996).

An important topological construct is that of ‘boundary’. In the real world, both ﬁat
and bona ﬁde boundaries are found (e.g. county borders and river banks, respectively).
Fiat boundaries separate ﬁat objects from their surroundings and enable a clear distinc-
tion of what does and does not belong to the objects (Kulik 2001). Diﬀerent from bona
ﬁde objects, or genuine objects, ﬁat boundaries do not support the open/closed dis-
tinction on which the classic point-based topology is based (Smith and Varzi 2000). Our
representation makes no distinction between these types, but this is scope for future
work. Note that sketch objects (also spatial objects introduced in Section 3.2.3) are ﬁat
objects and their boundaries are dependent on the cognitive and drawing processes.

Many spatial problems have been modelled using abstract or embedded planar graphs,
where these problems became essentially the task of ﬁnding a suitable route through a
network. The abstract and planar graphs form the network space introduced in Worboys and
Duckham (2004), which is important to represent and reason about street networks in real
world.

Metric space.
In this space, the concept of distance is available, which we can use to
calculate distances between point-like sketch objects. The concept of distance is neces-
sary for deﬁning qualitative positional relations between sketch objects such as at,
nearby, in the vicinity and far away so that the concepts of neighbourhood as well as
linear order relations based upon positional relations become available. Note that the
topological relations can also be derived and represented in this space.

Euclidean space.
In this space, the concepts of both distance and direction are available.
As a highly organised kind of space, a Euclidean space brings richer geometries and
several well-deﬁned relationships that can act upon sketch objects of diﬀerent dimen-
sions, e.g. area–area directional relations and area–line distance relations. Both qualitative
and quantitative spatial relationships such as topology, orientation and distance between
sketch objects can be represented and computed in this space. The set-, graph- and
metric-based spaces provide underlying structures for the Euclidean space.

3.2.3. Real-world representation
The real-world representation deals with the depicted real-world objects by using
domain-speciﬁc knowledge. We discuss at this level the entities that are part of a

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

sketched scene memorised from reality. This level arises from the previous representa-
tional sketch image level by further grouping or segmenting geometric shapes based on
their visual sketch relationships and then matching them against labels or existing
training samples and templates. Shape recognition at this level can take advantage of
using the local context-aware recognition approach introduced by Broelemann et al.
(2016), where we use the context given by surrounding sketch objects to get richer
descriptions than the isolated recognition of independent shapes performed at the
sketch image representation level. By using this approach, Broelemann et al. (2016)
were able to recognise streets, city blocks (surrounded by streets and resembled by
image background) and landmarks of diﬀerent types such as parking lots and buildings.
We can also infer various spatial relationships from the visual relationships available at
each of the formal spaces together with some other information provided by sketch
maps. For example, two adjacent sketch objects in the planar graph space might
suggest that the depicted spatial objects are adjacent in reality (see the two adjacent
shops located along Glee Street in Figure 6).

We deﬁne two types of real-world representational elements, namely spatial object and
spatial relationship. Spatial objects represent artiﬁcial or natural entities in reality such as parks,
streets, shops and canals. These objects are the cognitive reference points (Tversky 2000)
externalised as sketches due to their perceptual salience, functional signiﬁcance in the
physical environment or their relevance to sketch tasks (Wang 2014). We can classify spatial
objects, either as the ﬁve city elements from Lynch (1960) focusing on functionality or as the
four elements proposed by Wang (2014) focusing on spatial conﬁgurations. Spatial relation-
ships are calculated between spatial objects and reﬂect in the human mind how spatial
objects are located in space. Note that such relationships are not always true about the real
world due to distortions and schematisations from cognitive errors.

The proposed ﬁve formal spaces can also be used here to interpret and reason about
sketch maps at the real-world representation level (Figure 7). In the set space, the upper-
left sketch map is modelled as a collection of three sets (Slandmark, Sstreet and Scityblock)
providing the types of spatial objects extracted from the map. For example, the con-
nected streets Glee, Oxford and James form the city block Oxford–Glee–James as the
member of Scityblock. In both graph-based spaces, the sketch map can be modelled as a
network of walking paths connecting street junctions as nodes, which reﬂects the sketch
map creator’s knowledge of location accessibility. The topological relations of insideness
and adjacency are available in the embedded graph space. For example, Starbucks is
inside the region bounded by Oxford, James and Glee streets, and an unknown building
is adjacent to both Oxford and James street. Having the concept of distance available in
the metric space, the size of each spatial object can be computed and compared; so, we
can draw certain conclusions such as ‘Oxford Street is wider than James Street and Glee
Street is quite narrow’. The concepts of linear ordering and neighbourhood are both
available based on distances. Sketch maps usually do not have a single consistent global
reference frame, and the concept of neighbourhood is necessary for representing local
spatial relations (Meilinger 2008, Wang and Schwering 2015). Having neighbouring
buildings with respect to the reference routes (red and blue routes highlighted in
Figure 7), the linear order of spatial objects such as buildings and public transport
stations located along the routes can be computed. Spatial objects, such as the toy
store and church, which are not within the vicinity of the reference routes, are excluded.

In the Euclidean space, the concept of orientation becomes available. Having Glee Street
as an oriented reference object, we can calculate directional relations using the method
introduced in Wang and Schwering (2015), e.g. the shop Forever 21 is located at the
back_right zone with respect to Glee Street. Having the junction of Oxford and James
streets as the reference object, we can calculate the cyclic order of neighbouring spatial
objects with respect to the junction.

4. Representational sketch maps in the IAO framework

The levels and spaces introduced above help to learn about the sketch information
(2015), sketch information as a
extracted from sketch maps. Based on Arp et al.
generically dependent entity can exist in multiple copies and inhere in multiple infor-
mation bearers including the original paper copy. These bearers all share the same
pieces of information, in other words the same abstract pattern (Galton et al. 2016).
Examples of abstract patterns are a collection of words composed of basic letters
denoting a user-drawn object or a collection of junctions connected by street segments
denoting a street network. We introduce in this section a set of IAO-based ontologies of
sketch information entities taking into account both the levels and the ﬁve formal
representation spaces. As information content is of the central interest in our domain,
our ontologies focus only on the ICE, with each ontology representing the representa-
tional sketch map level introduced in Section 3.2 (including representation primitive,
sketch image representation and real-world representation).

Figure 8 shows the ontology of a representation primitive built at the lowest level of
representational sketch map. We reuse the ﬁve ICE entities (in blue) (image, textual
entity, data item, Cartesian spatial coordinate datum and measurement datum). The
raster sketch image in Figure 8 is a subtype of IAO image made up of pixels, which
comprises representation primitives containing graphic and textual components.
Straight lines and arcs are graphic entities comprising basic geometric shapes. Words
of letters are textual entities used for denoting shapes and describing sketches. Each
representation primitive is composed of pixels, each of which has position and colour
deﬁned using the ICE entities, spatial coordinate datum and measurement datum,
respectively. Details of the reused ICE entities can be found in IAO (2014).

Figure 9(a) illustrates an ontology of the higher level sketch image representation
using the ﬁve formal spaces. The vectorised sketch image is now conceived as made up
not of primitives but of sketch objects. Diﬀerent types of sketch relationships between
sketch objects are made available based on the choice of the formal space. These sketch
relationships lead to inferences of conceptual relationships of real-world objects.
Figure 9(b) provides an example of an ontology of topological relationships of sketch
objects using the planar graph space.

Similarly, using the ﬁve formal spaces, an ontology of the highest level real-world
representation is shown in Figure 10(a). Having the domain knowledge of what can be the
real-world objects being depicted, the sketch image at this level is made up of spatial
objects that are capable of multiple realisations in diﬀerent physical forms in reality.2
These spatial objects are associated with the lower level by image segmentation and
grouping of sketch objects based on their sketch relationships. Entities at this level are still
information artefacts deﬁned in such a way as to enable us to understand the underlying

reality by reasoning about the formal spaces that they constitute. Figure 10(b) provides an
example of an ontology of distance relationships of spatial objects using the metric space.
Similar to Hudelot et al. (2008), description logic can be used to formalise the
in order to clarify our understanding of
representations of sketch/spatial relations,
them and to automate spatial reasoning. If a relation is binary, its inverse relation as
well as its properties such as symmetry, asymmetry, reﬂexivity and irreﬂexivity can be
speciﬁed. Also, such a formalisation can help constrain the given relations. For example,
in Figures 9(b) and 10(b), the relationships are not always interchangeable, i.e. order
matters. If x is adjacent to y, then y is also adjacent to x, but if x is inside y, then y is not
inside x.

5. An illustrative example

We present in this section an example of sketch map interpretation using the proposed
method. We show how a raw sketch map can be analysed from the material to non-
material level and from the literal sketch image level to the real-world level with richer
semantics.

5.1. Preprocessing physical sketch map

Figure 11(a) shows a scanned version of an oﬄine physical drawing made on paper. It is
a raster online image consisting of pixels. This online drawing is then processed by
binarisation for enhanced image quality and text/graphics separation for further graphic
analysis. The binarisation method deals with monochromatic sketch maps by labelling
each pixel either as background or as drawing. The graphic elements are further
processed by region-based segmentation, and then object and shape recognition. We
refer the reader to the work of Broelemann et al. (2016) for more details on the methods
used in graphics recognition. Vectorisation, such as image tracing,
is also necessary
before carrying out the formal representations at diﬀerent levels.

5.2. Sketch image primitives

Figure 11(b,c) illustrates the ideas of text/graphic separation and basic representation
primitives. Open and closed arcs in Figure 11(b) are the basic graphemic graphic entities,
which are further processed to become instances of basic geometric shapes using
constraints such as parallelism and orthogonality. (For the purposes of this paper, this
ﬁgure is made manually.
In practice, the ﬁgure is usually generated by a series of
graphics recognition methods such as region-based segmentation. Graphic features
are then identiﬁed by the boundaries of recognised regions.) These geometric con-
straints, as discussed before, are subject to the tolerance used by certain image analysis
algorithms because of the imprecision from freehand sketches. We highlight in red the
minimum bounding boxes as the approximate shapes of the graphic primitives. Note
that some of the incomplete open shapes (usually found at the edge of the paper) need
to be completed. In Figure 11(c), the smallest disjoint units are letters which form words
as the smallest meaningful units for denotational purpose.

5.3. Sketch image representation using formal representation spaces

The sketch image supported by the graphic primitives consists of a set of sketch objects
identiﬁed as diﬀerent geometric shapes. The sketch is constructed in the set space as the
combination of three sets of sketch objects, which are the areal objects (brown), the
closed arcs (green) and the open arcs (blue) (Figure 12(a)). The visual sketch relation-
ships of these identiﬁed sketch objects are represented by using the graph-, metric- and
Euclidean-based formal spaces (Figure 12(b–e)).

In the abstract graph space, the connectivity of sketch objects is made available.
Figure 12(b) illustrates the idea of the abstract graph construction: line segments as
edges are detected from the image by the thinning algorithm. Edges are connected
if they share the same node. We use grey to indicate those nodes that are
connected to edges detected at the boundary of a sketch image. Figure 12(c)
gives examples of
relationships made available when an abstract
topological
letters to diﬀerentiate the
graph is embedded in a 2-D plane. We use capital
polygons created as the image background surrounded by closed line segments
(A, B, C and D) and use diﬀerent ﬁll styles to denote these background polygons.
Polygons share boundaries such as touch(B, D) and touch(C, D). A polygon can be
inside another one such as inside(f, D) and inside(d, B). The metric space allows us
to diﬀerentiate distances between nodes along diﬀerent paths. For example, the
distances between v1 and v2 along the two shortest paths (blue and red) are
diﬀerent (Figure 12(d)). A 2-D Euclidean space also brings in the concept of
orientation, and all the sketch relations from the previous spaces are available in
this space. Figure 12(e) shows the cyclic order relation between areal sketch objects
with respect to a node (cyclic(e, d, c)).

5.4. Real-world representation using formal representation spaces

The real-world representation includes sketchers’ mental concepts of depicted real-
world objects. Figure 13 shows the real-world representation of the sketch map

described in Section 5.1. Figure 13(a) shows a set of spatial objects. These include
artiﬁcial buildings such as the café and library, natural geographic objects such as the
lake and the spatial objects that people usually share various opinions about their
boundaries. The dotted lines represent such vaguely delineated objects. For example,
the square where the cathedral is located was drawn as the Dom Plaza (Figure 13(a)).
The other spatial relations between real-world objects shown in the ﬁgure mirror the
spatial relations between sketch objects that are already discussed in Figure 13(b–e).
Diﬀerent ﬁll styles in Figure 13(c) denote diﬀerent polygons, A, B, C and D, created as the
image background surrounded by closed line segments. In Figure 13(f), the neighbour-
hood of the reference street junction (in red) is decided using Voronoi cells based on
distances between points (Figure 13(e)).

6. Conclusions and future work

We have advocated the adoption of an ontological point of view to obtain a clear sketch
map interpretation and representation. In particular, we have developed a well-deﬁned
hierarchical structure to which the various representational entities handled during
sketch interpretation can be assigned and proposed the use of ﬁve formal representa-
tion spaces to classify and qualify spatial features and analyse their relationships at
diﬀerent levels.

The ontological contribution can help to establish a common interpretation of sketch
maps by linking distinctive sketch entities deﬁned at diﬀerent levels, from the lowest
material levels to the highest real-world representational level. The proposed ontologies
also facilitate schema construction for sketch map databases, integration of sketch maps
from diﬀerent resources for knowledge sharing and integration with the existing data
from spatial databases for querying user-generated sketch content. For example, urban
planners can use our methods to apply sketches as user-generated content to provide
structured information on citizens’ perceptions of their environment (e.g. SketchMapia
proposed by Schwering et al. 2014).

Formal representation spaces provide a systematic approach to sketch information
extraction and spatial representation. This approach assists in the development of an
automated system of spatial knowledge externalisation from sketch mapping. By
externalising spatial knowledge, we may be able to provide new explanations of
the following questions about cognitive mapping and human navigation: What is the
common structure and type of spatial knowledge underlying human navigation that
can be reﬂected on sketch maps? Is the structure similar to a graph (Chrastil and
Warren 2014), or the structure rather reﬂects Meilinger’s theory (Meilinger 2008) of
network of reference frames? The identiﬁcation, classiﬁcation and qualiﬁcation of
spatial relationships including topology, orientation and distance can also help to
understand people’s sense of place, especially the structural aspects of places
(e.g. Curtis et al. 2014).

The current study focuses on the interpretation of sketch maps associated with urban
areas from a survey perspective. The ontologies we provide here are not complete. Their
extension and population require the diversiﬁcation of the range of sketch maps from
diﬀerent perspectives. For example, sketch maps from a route perspective, sketched spaces
of diﬀerent spatial scales (smaller indoor space or larger geographic space), and sketch map

producers with varied cultural backgrounds. Other representations of space, such as fractal
space, may also be incorporated in the proposed ontologies if fractal geometry and patterns
can be found in other types of sketch maps. We shall also consider revising the proposed
ontologies by integrating them with existing widely recognised suites of ontologies. The
evaluation of the ontologies by users is also necessary, which will verify if the proposed
ontological resources help to close the semantic gap between the perceptual level and
conceptual level. Smeulders et al. (2000, p. 1) deﬁned such a gap as ‘the lack of coincidence
between the information that one can extract from the visual data (perceptual) and the
interpretation that the same data have for a user in a given situation (conceptual)’.

The ultimate goal is to make sketch interpretation automatic. To do this, a set of rules
needs to be deﬁned to decide the level, representation space and type of sketch features
that are required to be extracted in accordance with the sketch map type and application.
Formalisation of ontologies is needed and will be our next step to clarify diverse under-
standings of relationships of sketch entities and to automate spatial reasoning. Cooperation
with computer vision specialists is also necessary to develop such an automated system.

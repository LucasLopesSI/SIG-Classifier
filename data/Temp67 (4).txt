Abstract. This paper describes the spatial interpolation of daily minimum air
temperature using a feed-forward back-propagation neural network. Simple net-
work con(cid:142) gurations were trained to predict minimum temperature using as inputs:
(1) date and terrain variables; (2) temperature observations at a number of
neighbouring locations; (3) date, terrain variables and neighbouring temperature
observations. This is the (cid:142) rst time that trend and spatial association are explicitly
considered together when interpolating using a neural network. The internal
weights given to diŒerent inputs to the network were analysed to estimate the
degree of spatial correlation between neighbouring stations in addition to the
most in(cid:143) uential variables contributing to the underlying trend. The spatial distri-
bution of daily minimum temperature was estimated with the greatest accuracy
by a network trained on the most comprehensive data set (3). The best model
for the prediction of temperature accounts for 93% of the variance, measured by
the correlation between independent estimated and observed values over a full
year. This is comparable to accuracies reported in the literature using other
approaches such as ordinary kriging of the residuals of multi-variate linear regres-
sion or partial thin plate splines. An advantage of this method is that the guiding
variables are not assumed necessarily to be linearly related with the data being
interpolated, and combinative eŒects are taken into account. Analysis of the
internal network weights con(cid:142) rms that the networks are able to select adaptively
between trend and covariance components of the interpolation function. Example
interpolated daily minimum temperature surfaces for a 100 kmÖ 100 km area
in Yorkshire, UK, were generated using the selected network architectures to
illustrate the results achievable with an ANN.

Introduction
Spatial interpolation techniques allow the estimation of a variable at locations
where it has not been recorded using observations of that variable made at other
sites. A wide variety of globally (e.g. partial thin plate splines, trend surfaces) and

locally (e.g. inverse distance weighting, universal kriging) computed techniques are
in common use, and have been well-reviewed recently by Burrough and McDonnell
(1998) among others. The need to maximize the available information from often
sparsely distributed data is especially pertinent within an applied environmental
modelling context. In this setting interpolated data forms just one element of the
wider modelling endeavour, in which errors within continuous input surfaces may
propagate with signi(cid:142) cant consequences within a sensitive system (e.g. Mowrer 1997 ).
Additionally, there has been a marked trend for recent developments of interpolation
methods to be increasingly complex in their mathematical approach. However, as
Mita´ s and Mita´ sova` (1999) observe in a GIS context, it may be as fruitful to improve
the way in which our understanding of natural phenomena may be incorporated
within the overall interpolation process as to delve more deeply into mathematics.
The ability to interpolate accurately depends ultimately on the availability of
data commensurate with the particular target scale of output. Experience using
traditional methods of interpolation such as de-trended (multivariate linear regres-
sion) ordinary kriging (Deutsch and Journel 1998) and partial thin plate splines
(Hutchinson 1995) suggests potentially resolvable errors remain where the trend is
non-linear and shows a complex and temporally varying relationship with the
underlying landscape (Jarvis 1999). Unlike methods incorporating multiple linear
regression (MLR), neural networks are particularly adept at managing the incorpora-
tion of additional data and expert knowledge about a particular geographical domain
within the estimation process (Atkinson and Tatnall 1997 ). This suggests the possibil-
ity that neural networks might provide bene(cid:142) ts over more traditional interpolation
methods.

A wide variety of structures for neural networks may be found within the broader
literature, whilst a more limited number have been explored for the purpose of
interpolation. Pariente (1994) for example used Hop(cid:142) eld networks to minimize the
energy function of the interpolation result in a manner that mimicked (cid:142) nite diŒerence
methods, while Rizzo and Dougherty’s (1994) work using Kohonen nets showed
strong associations with indicator kriging. Feed-forward back-propagatio n networks
have more commonly been used, but with a tendency to use these networks in a
manner similar to a non-spatial regression on point data (Cheeseman 1998). This
exploits the more relaxed statistical requirements of neural networks (e.g. non-
in comparison to the more commonly used linear regression models
linearity)
(Cornford 1997a).

In contrast, Dowd (1994 ) employed spatial relationships within a feedforward–
backpropagatio n network for the purpose of conditional simulation as opposed to
estimation. These examples using neural networks for interpolation however fail to
incorporate both neighbourhood data and trend within their network structures. This
literature suggests that feed-forward backpropagatio n networks have the potential
to play a role similar to kriging for spatial interpolation if, as well as incorporating
point-based information regarding trends, they were also able to exploit the implicit
information on spatial associations between local data points on which traditional
methods of
interpolation are built. Incorporating both elements within the one
network model avoids the interpolator becoming over-prescriptive regarding the
split between trend and covariance, a recurrent di(cid:141) culty within the geostatistics
literature (Journel and Rossi 1989, de Kwaadsteniet 1990) when standard geostatist-
ical estimation methods are used. This approach is also attractive since it avoids the
need to specify a particular variogram model, and aŒords the potential to reproduce

multiple anisotropic spatial structures. The main focus of this paper is, therefore, to
discuss, exemplify and evaluate a feed-forward back-propagatio n network approach
to the interpolation of geographical data that incorporates for the (cid:142) rst time both
trend and spatial association together. In order to illustrate the approach, the inter-
polation of daily minimum temperatures within England and Wales at a resolution
of 1 km is demonstrated.

The paper opens with a review of current progress in the interpolation of air
temperatures. The climatic and terrain data sets used for the study are then presented.
The topic of ANNs is introduced, and the connection to spatial interpolation is
established. The experiments carried out are then described. Finally, examples of
minimum temperature surfaces created with neural networks are presented, and
some conclusions regarding interpolation with ANNs drawn.

2. Literature review
2.1. Interpolation of air temperatures

The demand for (cid:142) elds of air temperature data on a regular grid and in digital
form is growing dramatically as a range of environmental models seek to include
the in(cid:143) uences of meteorological and terrain variables within the estimation process
(Corbett 1996, Lennon and Turner 1995). Surface air temperature and other meteoro-
logical variables such as rainfall, solar irradiation, soil moisture, etc. are typically
recorded on a daily basis at a limited number of monitoring stations scattered over
the country. As a common response to this need for gridded data, eŒective spatial
interpolators are used to estimate those point variables as continuous (cid:142) eld variables
in order to use them as input to ecological and environmental models.

Techniques usually used for the interpolation of air temperatures to date include
kriging (Cornford 1997a), thin plate splines (Hutchinson 1995), trend surfaces (Russo
et al. 1995 ), and inverse distance weighting (Robeson and Willmott 1996). Process-
based knowledge, for example using lapse rates (Bolstad et al. 1998 ), is also used to
interpolate temperature data. Within an applied environmental modelling context,
there is a particular need for more adaptive methods that can e(cid:141) ciently interpolate
temporal sequences of daily data.

The explosion in the amount of (collateral) digital data now available from GIS
oŒers the opportunity to incorporate additional relevant information within the
estimation process. However, traditional interpolation approaches seldom explicitly
incorporate much of this available information. The use of digital elevation data to
guide the interpolation of monthly temperatures is becoming accepted practice, but
a review of the literature indicates that the spatial variability of air temperature is
signi(cid:142) cantly aŒected by topographic relief together with several other geographical
factors such as latitude and distance to coast. In a British context, these developments
are best illustrated at the monthly time step in the work of Lennon and Turner
(1995) and at a daily time step by Cornford (1997b) . The case for incorporating
additional topoclimatic data, derived using GIS, is particularly strong for the more
variable daily temperature data, but considerable problems exist with incorporating
these data within the interpolation process using standard techniques such as stepwise
multi-linear regression, since many of the potential variables are measured on a
nominal scale, and are inter-related in a typically non-linear manner.

2.2. Neural networks in GIS

Arti(cid:142) cial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been extensively used as non-linear and
semi-parametric pattern classi(cid:142) ers and function estimators (e.g. regression tools) in

a wide range of research (cid:142) elds during the last decade. ANNs have recently started
to be used for spatial data interpolation (Pariente and Laurini 1993, Dowd 1994,
Dowd and Sarac 1994, Hewitson and Crane 1994, McGinnis 1994, Rizzo and
Dougherty 1994, Pariente 1994) in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations
presented by more traditional methods. Conceptually, ANNs seem to oŒer method-
ological advantage s over traditional spatial analysis methods, in that they contain
no critical assumptions about the nature of spatial data, are well suited to processing
noisy data and handling non-linear modelling tasks (Openshaw and Openshaw
1997 ). ANNs also allow the incorporation into the analysis of a priori knowledge
and data on known physical constraints to guide the interpolation process (Haykin
1994, Atkinson and Tatnall 1997), while traditional interpolation methods like krig-
ing seem to be lacking the (cid:143) exibility to incorporate important sources of general
and case-speci(cid:142) c knowledge that are often available (IAMG 1998).

In their most general form, ANNs are structures inspired by biological systems,
usually implemented in software (Haykin 1994). As in the brain, the basic processing
elements of an ANN are the neurons (units). These units are interconnected by
weighted links to form a network. A unit in the network sums the weighted inputs
from the links feeding into it, and performs some (typically non-linear) function on
the summed value. The output is then fed to other units linked to it. During the
training of a feedforward network, the architecture used for this study, the weights
of the network are adjusted in a process called back-propagatio n so as to minimize
a measure of the diŒerence between the actual output of the net and the desired
output (Rumelhart et al. 1986 ). A single processing unit is depicted in (cid:142) gure 1(a).
Figure 1(b) illustrates the architecture of a simple network con(cid:142) guration, termed
multi-layer feed-forward, in which units are arranged in layers and connected so that
the information (cid:143) ows unidirectionally from input units, through units in one (or
more) hidden layers to units in an output layer. The multi-layer feed-forward network
imposes no restrictions on the number of units in the input, hidden and output layers.
The implementation of an ANN requires three main steps: model and architecture
selection, training (also called learning) and independent performance assessment
(validation) . First, the appropriate network model and architecture are selected. This
is normally carried out by training diŒerent networks on a subset of the training

dataset and assessing their generalization performance on the unused training subset.
The network having the lowest error is selected. The selected model is then trained
on the complete training dataset and its overall generalization performance is assessed
using an independent and previously withheld data set.

3. Methodology
3.1. Data issues
3.1.1. Meteorological and terrain data

One hundred and ninety-(cid:142) ve station records from the standard UKMO meteoro-
logical data from the year 1986 were available for the study ((cid:142) gure 2). Analyses were
restricted to stations with a complete record of daily observations for 1986. This
gave a total of 146 recording stations. The total number of temperature records over
the complete year was therefore 53 290 (146Ö 365). The 49 stations with shorter or
discontinuous records were omitted from the process of network design and training,
but were used for (spatially and temporally) independent testing of interpolations by
the ANNs on speci(cid:142) c days where data were recorded (10 692 records)
(§3.4).
Minimum temperatures at the stations were measured using standard UKMO
instruments, at standard exposure, at 9:00 am GMT.

A total of 34 topographica l and geographical variables, many of them necessarily
inter-correlated, were used as additional input data or ‘guiding variables’. These
correspond to terrain variables previously identi(cid:142) ed and derived in digital form
in press) and therefore were readily available. Examples of

variables included are those designed to incorporate the in(cid:143) uence of nearness to the
coast on temperature, the degree of urban in(cid:143) uence, and terrain factors such as
elevation, height above the valley (cid:143) oor and local roughness. The full variable set is
listed within table 1. All the variables, except station spatial location and height,
were derived at a resolution of 1 km resolution from an Ordnance Survey Panorama
digital terrain model (DTM) with an initial resolution of 50 m using a GIS.

It has been suggested that the dominant synoptic situation at the time also aŒects
which of these terrain variables are most important on any given date (Cornford
1997b) . In order to investigate the in(cid:143) uence of the prevailing synoptic situation on
the estimation of daily minimum temperature, the qualitative daily Lamb weather
type classi(cid:142) cation (Lamb 1972, Hulme and Barrow 1997) was also included in the
analyses. The original Lamb classi(cid:142) cation scheme is largely subjective, but is pub-
lished and the complete series is given on the Internet by the Climatic Research
Unit, University of East Anglia (CRU 1998). In addition it is pertinent to Great
Britain. This classi(cid:142) cation subjectively categorises the dominant weather type into
27 classes (e.g. anticyclonic north, cyclonic, north-east), including an unknown class.

The classes are mainly based upon cyclonicity, direction and vorticity of the dominant
weather feature.

3.1.2. Data preparation

Available meteorological data were stored in a standard relational database, and
selection of training, testing and independent reserved data was carried out using
SQL (Structured Query Language) . Spatial information was stored and queried
using Arc/InfoTM GIS. The required patterns were then exported to ASCII (cid:142) les to
be used in the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator software (SNSS 1995). Terrain
information derived from the 50 m Panorama DTM and associated grid layers (Jarvis
1999 ) was also stored in the relational database.

Air temperatures in Great Britain vary on an annual cycle, with the lowest values
usually occurring in January or in February (Barrow and Hulme 1997 ). Therefore,
in all analyses involving time of year, the input values re(cid:143) ecting the day within the
year ( y) were transformed using the expression modi(cid:142) ed from Re´gnie`re and Bolstad
(1994 ):

This transformation accounts for the circularity of the calendar dates. All other
input data to the networks were linearly scaled to lie also in the range 0 to 1
1, as
were the target temperatures. This is customarily done in order to normalize input
variables and prevent slow convergence in the training process (Bishop 1995). ANNs
can handle both ordinal and interval data types within the training process. Lamb
weather type, as a categorical variable, was encoded using a 1-of-(C-1) coding (Sarle
1999 ), in which a number of binary (i.e. 0/1) variables (known as dummy variables
in statistics) equal to the number of categories minus one are used. This gave 26
such dummy variables relating to Lamb weather type. This is the preferred method
for encoding a categorical variable since assigning integers to particular categories
introduces arti(cid:142) cial ordering that can produce misleading results.

Many of the 40 potential terrain variables derived using GIS were intercorrelated
so high speeds of convergence at the network learning stage were not expected. Since
ANNs have been shown to be robust to redundancy in the input data (Zhou and
Civco 1996) the impact of this inter-correlation upon the practical usage of the
trained network was expected to be low. Additionally, many variables also exhibited
non-normal distributions. Unlike traditional statistical methods however, trans-
formations are not required when using neural network methods on skewed or multi-
modal data.

The goal in training a neural network is to (cid:142) nd a structure that gives good
predictions for both the observed training data and new data, so the simplest means
to compare diŒerent networks is to evaluate the error using data that are independent
of those used for training (Bishop 1995). In this study, the hold-out method for
network training and model selection (Sarle 1999) was taken. In this approach the
available data set is (cid:142) rst randomly partitioned into a training set and an independent
test set. The training set is then further divided into two subsets, one for model
selection and another for (semi-independent ) testing known as performance evalu-
ation or validation (Sarle 1999). The selected data set from the 146 stations with
complete records was randomly divided in the following way ((cid:142) gure 3): training

(85%), and independent testing (15%). The training set was further partitioned into
a model selection training subset (80%), and a testing subset (20%).

3.2. Network design
3.2.1. Basic network structure

Three variants of a three-layer back-propagatio n net were used to estimate the
relationship between daily minimum air temperature and terrain variables measured
at the set of 146 stations for year 1986. This approach can be thought of as akin to
building a least squares regression model for temperature and a variety of variables,
including time of year, dominant weather type on the day and topoclimatic con-
ditions, but without underlying statistical assumptions (e.g.
linearity). As well
as capturing the general trends in temperature across the country using these
predictor variables, the inputs to the ANN are then extended to capture knowledge
of temperature at nearby stations into the estimation model.

3.2.2. Architecture selection and training

Two training algorithms were tested, standard back-propagatio n and scaled
conjugate gradient (SCG) (Zell et al. 1995). Pattern-based training was carried out
over a maximum of 2000 cycles, but halted when no further decrease in testing error
occurred over 50 cycles. SCG was (cid:142) nally selected, despite the fact it was slower,
since it was more stable (oscillatory) and reached similar or lower validation errors
than standard back-propagation . The activation function for all the layers was taken
to be the logistic function ((cid:142) gure 1 ), and the error function being minimized was
least square. The selection of the best architecture was done sequentially using
networks with increasing numbers of hidden layer units until no signi(cid:142) cant improve-
ment in the validation error was found. The results of three training runs were
averaged to account for diŒerent random initialisations of the weights. Nevertheless,
the diŒerent solutions produced very similar results. The results were then con(cid:142) rmed
on the test set. The aim was to (cid:142) nd the simplest con(cid:142) guration for which addition of
neurons and layers made minimal improvement. These preliminary experiments
indicated that, surprisingly, the simplest net architecture that yielded good generaliza-
tion performance had just one single hidden layer unit. Although adding more hidden
units reduced training error, these made only a negligible diŒerence on error
during testing.

3.2.3. Generalization performance evaluation

Once the three-layer network architecture was selected, the network was trained
as described above, but for this stage the full training data set ((cid:142) gure 3) was used.

Figure 3. Partitioning of data for training and validating the network con(cid:142) guration, and for
independent testing.

331

The validation component of the training data was then presented to the net at each
iteration with no further training ( learning) taking place. Training was stopped when
no further decrease in error on the test set occurred over 50 further cycles, at which
point the network might be considered to be generalized. The net with the lowest
error on generalization was saved. The root mean square error (RMSE, square root
of mean squared predicted temperature minus observed temperature), the mean
absolute error (MAE, mean after all errors made positive), and bias (predicted
temperature minus observed temperature, cumulative over the year) of the fully
trained networks for the training and independent validation data sets are reported
for each interpolation experiment. Means shown are always corrected for degrees of
freedom of the model.

3.2.4. Neural network internal representation

In order to investigate qualitatively how the trained network was representing
the underlying relationship between neighbouring observations, the weights of a
network trained with a single hidden unit were examined. A network with a single
hidden layer of one unit corresponds to a special case of regression (Bishop 1995).
In this simple con(cid:142) guration, weight magnitudes could be interpreted, to some extent,
as a form of regression coe(cid:141) cient indicating relative contribution of
inputs on
estimated temperature (unit biases should also be taken into account). Knowledge
of these weights contributes to developing an understanding of how the ANN is
working and which inputs appear to have more in(cid:143) uence on the interpolation
estimate. Extreme care must be taken however when drawing conclusions from direct
inspection of network weights and biases, since formal assessment of importance of
inputs requires a signi(cid:142) cantly more elaborate approach (Sarle 1999) and the output
from the hidden layer introduces further non-linearities.

3.3. Experimental series

Three forms of this basic network were developed, corresponding to the three
series of experiments undertaken ((cid:142) gure 4). Each form required the training and
testing procedures discussed above within §3.2.2 and §3.2.3.

3.3.1. Experiment 1: T emperature estimation using terrain variables and weather
type

The net was constructed with the day of the year and the subset of 32 geographical
and topographica l variables forming the inputs from which the temperature was
predicted. The observed temperature at each station for the corresponding day
formed the target output values for training the net.

The potential in(cid:143) uence of dominant synoptic weather type on interpolation
results was further investigated using a simpli(cid:142) ed model with 11 terrain variables
which received larger weights from these initial trials, with the addition of Lamb
weather type as categorical input ((cid:142) gure 4). Two additional networks of similar
con(cid:142) guration were also trained speci(cid:142) cally to perform under cyclonic and anticyc-
lonic conditions respectively, by restricting the input data available to those networks
to that subset of data arising under each of these weather conditions.

3.3.2. Experiment 2: T emperature estimation using neighbouring observations

A back-propagatio n net was used to estimate the relationship between observed
minimum temperature at a given point and the temperature values measured at

surrounding stations on the same date ((cid:142) gure 4). Analogous to the procedure used
when kriging, and based upon an analysis of the geostatistical ‘range’ modelled
within variograms computed using de-trended data, six neighbour stations were
chosen for the analysis. Day of the year was also included (§3.1.2) as for experiment
1 above.

In total, 19 inputs were used for this experiment. Nodes for temperature, distance
and polar angle were included for each of the six neighbouring stations in an attempt
to model the possible in(cid:143) uence of the distance and orientation between stations in
the estimation. In this approach to interpolation the relationship being modelled is
built globally, since all available meteorological input data are used. However, only
data from the nearest six stations are used to estimate temperature at one location.
The radius of the search zone from which these data are taken will however vary
according to the local con(cid:142) guration of stations.

3.3.3. Experiment 3: T emperature estimation using neighbourhoo d observations,
terrain variables and weather type

In this experiment both terrain information and surrounding minimum temper-
ature observations were incorporated into the interpolation process. The motivation
for this was that, a priori, bene(cid:142) ts could be expected from integrating additional
information in the form of variables derived from diŒerent origins to guide the
interpolation process (Mita´sova` and Mita´s 1999). The ability of ANNs to integrate

disparate data types and deal with intercorrelated variables was exploited here.
Building on the previous two experiments, which incorporated trend and spatial
autocorrelation respectively but separately, both trend and local variation were
modelled together within this (cid:142) nal experimental group.

A total of 45 input variables were used for this experiment ((cid:142) gure 4). Input
variables included all the input nodes used in experiment 2 above, plus elevation at
each of the observing stations. Elevation was included in an attempt to model the
eŒects of locally varying lapse rates (Bolstad et al. 1998). A subset of 20 input terrain
variables was created, mainly choosing the variables with largest weights and regres-
sion coe(cid:141) cients resulting from experiment 1. Some variables were excluded and
others included using a priori knowledge (Jarvis and Stuart, in press (a)) of the
phenomena and correlation coe(cid:141) cients with other variables.

The potential in(cid:143) uence of dominant synoptic weather type on interpolation

results was also investigated by the incorporation of the Lamb weather type.

3.4. Independent testing

It could be argued that the test data set used for the experiments was not
completely independent, from a spatial point of view, since some of the stations were
possibly present at diŒerent dates in the training and testing data sets. This situation
arises because, during training, the partitioning of data between training and testing
subsets is made randomly by the ANN software. A totally independent station subset
((cid:142) gure 2) was used to assess the goodness-of-(cid:142) t of the interpolations. A total of 49
stations with an incomplete temperature record for 1986, excluded from all the
analyses, were used for independent validation. The predictive power of each of the
three interpolation models was compared using adjusted r2 , RMSE, MAE and bias,
with each measure averaged over the entire year.

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Experiment 1: T emperature estimation using terrain variables

The network architecture selected according to §3.2.2 was in this case 33-1-1,
that is 33 input nodes, one hidden node and one output node. Table 1 shows the
root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and bias of the
fully trained 33-1-1 network for the training and test sets. The r2 for goodness-of-(cid:142) t
showed that the network was able to capture about 60% of variability within the
data for the year 1986. The network (cid:142) tted slightly better the test data than the
training data indicating that it was able to generalise correctly on new data. RMSE
of 3.2ß C and MAE of 2.5ß C show that reasonable accuracy was achieved. Bearing
in mind that raw daily minimum temperature data for just a single year was used,
and given the variety in daily weather over Britain, and by season, training a net on
a data set extending over a longer period might allow it to capture more fully the
wide range of possible patterns.

Analysis of the network weights and comparisons with the coe(cid:141) cients from
multiple linear regression obtained in a previous study with the same data set (Jarvis
1999 ) were used to evaluate the similarities and diŒerences in importance attached
to each input variable for the two diŒering techniques of predicting air temperature.
Similarly to the multiple regression model, elevation together with northing, easting
and the degree of urbanisation in the local area received large weightings in the
ANN. The weights permit some assessment of the importance of each input variable
to be investigated, although direct comparison is inadvisable since the ANN

weighting is not based on linear functions. However, a brief statistical comparison
indicated that both ANNs and MLR schemes weighted the same variables similarly,
with an r2 square value for this neural network model of 0.614.

The second test forming part of experiment 1, that additionally incorporated the
categorical Lamb weather type, showed that only a slight increase in r2 (from 0.61
to 0.63) was achieved when adding the weather type classi(cid:142) cation as further input.
This suggested that the weather type information slightly improved the estimations.
Further analyses of the weights relating to the networks trained with subsets of data
speci(cid:142) cally under anticyclonic (80 days) and cyclonic (57 days) conditions con(cid:142) rmed
that some variables had diŒerent degrees of in(cid:143) uence according to the dominant
weather type. This was particularly the case for variables Easting, Rough25, Highsout,
Drop10 and Rdist1.

4.2. Experiment 2: T emperature estimation using neighbouring observations

The procedures described in §3.2.2 to 3.2.3 were used to select the simplest
network showing good generalization performance. For this case, this was a network
with four units within one hidden layer. This was a larger number of hidden units
than in the previous experiment, despite the fact that the number of inputs was
lower. This may suggest that the underlying function was more complex than in the
previous case. However, validation errors in this case were signi(cid:142) cantly lower than
those of the previous experiment with terrain variables, as will be shown in the
next section.

The selected 19-4-1 network was trained using the 80% training data set, using
the 20% test set to assess generalisation performance as before ((cid:142) gure 3). Table 2
shows the RMSE, MAE and bias for both training and testing data sets. The adjusted
r2 of goodness-of-(cid:142) t showed that this con(cid:142) guration was representing accurately both
training and testing data. This suggested that the trained net would perform well on
unseen data. The RMSE of 1.2ß C and MAE of 0.9ß C were signi(cid:142) cantly lower than
those obtained using only terrain variables as input. However, overall, this net was
also underpredicting minimum temperature on new data, as indicated by the negative
bias value on the test data set.

In order to investigate qualitatively how the trained network was representing
the underlying relationship between neighbouring observations, the weights of a
network trained with a single hidden unit were examined ((cid:142) gure 5). In this case the
network gave relatively large contributions to the neighbouring minimum temper-
ature values. In contrast, the day of the year was given a very small weight, indicating
that this now had only a small in(cid:143) uence on the estimation of temperature. Weights
were increasingly reduced as the neighbouring stations were farther away from the
estimation point. This seemed reasonable knowing the signi(cid:142) cant spatial correlation

parameters). Bias is predicted temperature minus observed temperature, MAE is mean
after all error made positive, and RMSE is square root of mean squared predicted
temperature minus observed temperature. Training data set had 45 329 patterns.

shown by air temperature (Lennon and Turner 1995), and is analogous with what
might be expected from a variogram or inverse distance weighted model. Small
weights were given to polar angle by this simple con(cid:142) guration, suggesting no domin-
ant direction of anisotropy. The large value of the adjusted r2 (0.93) indicates that
reasonably high levels of explanation can be obtained from this simple network
con(cid:142) guration.

4.3. Experiment 3: T emperature estimation using neighbourhoo d observations and
terrain variables

In this case, a network with four units in the hidden layer (45-4-1) using the
input data categories described in (cid:142) gure 4 and listed individually within (cid:142) gure 6
showed a good performance while presenting a relatively simple con(cid:142) guration. This
was the same number of hidden units as used for the network of experiment 2,
despite the fact that twenty additional terrain variables were used as part of experi-
ment 3. This might suggest that the additional terrain inputs were adding a relatively
small amount of new information to the model when compared with the 19-4-1
network using neighbouring stations only. This is consistent with the (cid:142) nding using
linear regression, where the advantage s of adding more than six terrain vari-
ables were minimal when using sophisticated interpolation methods that exploit
autocorrelation eŒectively (Jarvis and Stuart, in press (b)).

The selected 45-4-1 back-propagatio n network was trained on the full training
data set, using the small 20% test set to determine when to stop training. Table 3
shows the training and testing statistics. r2 values showed that the estimation was
able to account for most of the variation in both the training and testing data.
RMSE of 1.1ß C, MAE of 0.8ß C and bias values were all lower than those reported
in the previous experiments. Bias values indicated that the trained network was
again underestimating minimum temperature, but to a lesser degree.

A trained network with a single hidden unit (45-1-1) was used to examine the
weights given to each of the input units ((cid:142) gure 4). Figure 6 shows that the network
gave the highest (positive) weights to the six neighbouring temperature observations.
Distances to those observing locations received similar small weights in this network
as in the previous experiment. Hence, it could be concluded that this model and the
19-4-1 model of experiment 2 were basically performing a form of inverse distance

J. P. Rigol et al.

weighted interpolation (IDW), but in this case using additional terrain information.
Among the terrain variables, the in(cid:143) uence of local height at the grid location upon
the temperature was given a large negative contribution. Rdist1 (distance to the
nearest river) and Rough5 (local terrain roughness) were also given relatively large
(positive) weights, as in experiment 1.

Initially, 71 variables were to be used as input in this (cid:142) nal experiment (45 plus
26 units encoding Lamb weather type). The results using a 71-4-1 were almost
identical to the ones obtained with the 45-4-1 con(cid:142) guration, and so are not repeated
here. However, computation costs were signi(cid:142) cantly higher when 71 inputs were
used. This suggested that information on weather type was useful in improving
estimation when using only terrain variables as input, but otherwise that the Lamb
weather type had no signi(cid:142) cant in(cid:143) uence on interpolation results when neighbouring
observations were included in the estimation.

4.4. Independent validation of temperature estimates interpolated using ANNs

To this point, the validation results presented have not been completely independ-
ent, from a spatial point of view, since as previously explained some of the stations
were possibly present at diŒerent dates in the training and testing data sets. Forty-
nine stations (shown in (cid:142) gure 2) with an incomplete temperature record for 1986,
that had been excluded from all previous analyses, were used for independent
validation of the temperature surfaces reported in experiments 1 to 3. The predictive
power of each of the three ANN models described above was compared using
measures of adjusted r2 , RMSE and MAE (table 4). These statistics were found to
be similar to the ones obtained through the semi-independent testing process above
(tables 2, 3 and 4). This con(cid:142) rms that the selected networks in the three experiments
were able to predict minimum temperature on unseen data. Accuracy of estimation
improved markedly when temperature observations at surrounding stations were
included in the analyses. The comparison of r2 and RMSE also showed that estima-
tion errors decreased most when both terrain and neighbouring station data were
used as input for estimating minimum temperature. Moreover, while care should be
taken not to make de(cid:142) nitive statements about the relative performance of interpol-
ators based on diŒerent interpolation data sets and regions, the MAE and RMSE
statistics for the ANNs in table 4 are comparable to those previously reported in
the literature for more conventional interpolation (e.g. Landau and Barnett 1996,
Bolstad et al. 1998, Jarvis 1999).

5.

Interpolated minimum temperature surfaces
A series of minimum air temperature surfaces was computed using the selected
network models in each of the three experiments described above, and also using
the 71-4-1 network that used Lamb weather type as additional input. The networks
had been trained previously on the full training data set (45 329 patterns) . An area
of 100 kmÖ 100 km located in Yorkshire was used to illustrate the interpolation
results. Four surfaces, corresponding to the 31 December of 1986, are plotted in
(cid:142) gure 7(a)–(d).

Figure 7.

(Continued ).

The surface interpolated in (cid:142) gure 7(a) using day of the year and 32 terrain
variables as inputs appears to show more continuously varying temperature gradients
in comparison with the other surfaces (e.g. (cid:142) gure 7(b)), using only neighbourhood
observations, which appear ‘blocky’. Figure 7(a) in particular showed an under-
lying trend probably related to topographica l characteristics. However, minimum
temperature values were signi(cid:142) cantly underestimated throughout this example area,
with diŒerences between predicted and observed temperature greater than 5ß C at
some stations. In contrast, the surface created using only the six closest observations
and day of the year ((cid:142) gure 7(b)) showed a diŒerent geographical pattern of interpola-
tion, with clear zones of in(cid:143) uence around some of the temperature observations,
especially in the north and south of the area. Despite the apparently inferior visual
appearance of (cid:142) gure 7(b), predicted values were closer to the values observed at the
independent test points than in the interpolation of (cid:142) gure 7(a).

The temperature surface generated using the network with 45 inputs ((cid:142) gure 7(c))
was similar in structure to the temperature estimates of (cid:142) gure 7(b), but with smaller
patches of uniform temperature. This suggested that terrain conditions were aŒecting
the temperature estimate in diŒerent ways depending on the particular topographic
characteristics of the area, and possibly the spatial distribution of the observation
points. Figure 7(d) presents only minor diŒerences with respect to (cid:142) gure 7(c). The
interpolated surfaces in (cid:142) gure 7(c) and (cid:142) gure 7(d) are also statistically the most
accurate, with lowest rms errors between actual and estimated temperatures.

6. Conclusions

Several back-propagatio n neural networks were developed to interpolate daily
minimum air temperature. Input to the networks variously included time, terrain

variables, neighbouring temperature observations and the qualitative Lamb weather
type classi(cid:142) cation. The neural network’s internal representation of the spatial rela-
tionship being modelled in each case was investigated by examining the weights
given to each input after training. Prediction of temperature using observations at
neighbouring stations and time was more accurate than using terrain variables and
time. The most accurate prediction was obtained using day, neighbouring observa-
tions, and a sub-set of terrain variables. Prediction of temperature by this scheme
accounted for 93% of the variance in the data as measured over a full year for a set
of totally independent observing stations. No further improvement in accuracy was
achieved using the Lamb weather type classi(cid:142) cation as additional input to this
model. However, through an analysis of network weights under diŒerent weather
types, it was shown that the synoptic situation aŒected the relationship between
terrain variables and minimum temperature.

This paper has demonstrate d that spatial interpolation with neural networks is
a viable technique for temperature estimation. Neural networks oŒer methods for
estimation of air temperature without some of the drawbacks of more classical
methods such as the linearity and co-linearity assumptions of regression often used
within the interpolation process. They also avoid the need to pre-specify the division
between trend and covariance in the interpolation model. Back-propagatio n net-
works provide models for non-linear relationships in the spatial data. Although a
data-driven technique, by carefully selecting appropriate guiding variables and the
extent of spatial association according to a knowledge of the underlying physical
processes, the initial results suggest that technique could provide results that compare
favourably with more conventional methods of interpolation. Future research on a
number of open issues such as the performance of network interpolation on particular
days, network optimisation and a direct comparison of this approach with more
traditional spatial interpolation methods using identical data sets is planned.

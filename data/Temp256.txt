Abstract. This paper reports an investigation on the accuracy of grid-based
routing algorithms used in hydrological models. A quantitative methodology has
been developed for objective and data-independent assessment of errors generated
from the algorithms that extract hydrological parameters from gridded DEM.
The generic approach is to use arti(cid:142) cial surfaces that can be described by a
mathematical model, thus the ‘true’ output value can be pre-determined to avoid
uncertainty caused by uncontrollable data errors. Four mathematical surfaces
based on an ellipsoid (representing convex slopes), an inverse ellipsoid (repres-
enting concave slopes), saddle and plane were generated and the theoretical ‘true’
value of the Speci(cid:142) c Catchment Area (SCA) at any given point on the surfaces
could be computed using mathematical inference. Based on these models, tests
were made on a number of algorithms for SCA computation. The actual output
values from these algorithms on the convex, concave, saddle and plane surfaces
were compared with the theoretical ‘true’ values, and the errors were then analysed
statistically. The strengths and weaknesses of the selected algorithms are also
discussed.

Introduction
One important study (cid:142) eld on implementing Digital Terrain Analysis (DTA) in a
is the digital hydrological models and
Geographical Information System (GIS)
algorithms, which describe the mass (e.g. water, sediments and nutrient) transporta-
tion and (cid:143) ow between land units. These models and algorithms have been developed
to compute, for example, Total Contributing Area (TCA) (Freeman 1991, Moore
et al. 1994), Speci(cid:142) c Catchment Area (SCA) (Costa-Cabral and Burges 1994, Gallant
and Wilson 1996), Topographic Index (also known as ln(a/tanb) index, Quinn et al.
1991, 1995), and Stream Power Index (SPI) (Moore et al. 1994, Wilson and Gallant
2000). The results from the models form an important input to, for example, the
development of soil erosion models (Dietrich et al. 1993), landuse and land evaluation
(Desmet and Govers 1996, Stephen and Irvin 2000), landslide prediction (Duan and

Grant 2000), and catchment and drainage network analysis (Quinn et al. 1991,
Tribe 1992).

The most critical spatial data required for the digital hydrological modelling are
the surface elevation, which is modelled in GIS as discrete samples for the speci(cid:142) c
land surface. Although there have been numerous models developed for this purpose,
such as Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN ), TOPOG model (O’Loughlin 1986)
and digital contours, the grid Digital Elevation Model (DEM) has been the most
commonly used data source for DTA because of its simple structure, ease of computa-
tion and compatibility with remotely sensed and digital photogrammetr y data (Gao
1998, Tang 2000).

Numerous grid DEM-based hydrological modelling algorithms have been
developed (O’Callaghan and Mark 1984, Freeman 1991, Quinn et al. 1991, Fair(cid:142) eld
and Leymarie 1991, Costa-Cabral and Burges 1994, Meisels et al. 1995, Tarboton
1997, Mackay and Band 1998, Liang and Mackay 2000). However, since a grid
DEM itself is an approximation, which is restricted by, for example, scale and
measurement errors, to the real-world continuous surface using regularly spaced
samples, the implementation of terrain analysis models on it, such as slope, aspect,
curvature and (cid:143) ow routing algorithms, is also represented as an approximation to
the reality. In practice, numerous assumptions and optimisation about the mass
transportation and movement on a speci(cid:142) c local surface (often represented as a 3×3
window) have to be made in order to establish a workable mathematical model
(Holmgren 1994), resulting in signi(cid:142) cantly diVerent approaches and methodologies
towards terrain analysis modelling (Pilesjo¨ and Zhou, 1996). It has been recognised
that such modelling algorithms employed in many of today’s GIS software may
produce poor results that lead to some signi(cid:142) cant arti(cid:142) cial facts (known as ‘artifacts’)
in the output.

For topographical parameters derived from a grid DEM, there appears to be

three major sources of error, namely:

1. Data accuracy of DEM itself including sample errors, interpolation errors and
representation errors (Bolstad and Lillesand 1994, Florinsky 1998a, Walker
and Willgoose 1999, Tang 2000).

2. Spatial data structure of DEM such as data precision, grid resolution and

orientation (Zhang and Montgomery 1994, Gao 1998).

3. Mathematical models and algorithms employed (Holmgren 1994, Wolock and

McCabe 1995, Desmet and Govers 1996).

The focus of this study is on the third,

i.e. the error generated from the

mathematical models and algorithms.

To further investigate the issues of accuracy and correctness of the hydrological
modelling algorithms, it is fundamental to establish a methodology for quantitative
and objective measurements of errors generated by diVerent methods and algorithms
(Zhou 2000). In the past, the most commonly used method was to apply proposed
algorithms on a ‘real-world’ DEM. The results from the simulation were then visually
or statistically examined against ‘common knowledge’ on what should be expected
or digital data derived from cartographic resources (maps or aerial photographs)
(Band 1986, Quinn et al. 1991, Chairat and Delleur 1993, Garbrecht and Martz
1994, Worlock and Price 1994, Zhang and Montgomery 1994, Wolock and McCabe
1995, Desmet and Govers 1996, Mendicino and Soil 1997, Tang 2000, Liang and
Mackay 2000). This approach, however, is challenged by the fact that no real world

DEM is perfect so that errors inherent in the DEM largely remain unknown. The
conclusion of the assessment therefore can always be questioned because of the
uncertainty of the data.

From the point of view of error assessment, there are at least three shortfalls in

this evaluation method:

1. The evaluation results are related to the actual topography. The results derived

from one particular landform may be unsuitable for the others.

2. The accuracy of a DEM is often diYcult to quantify. Thus, the uncertainty in
the DEM itself often masks the inherent errors of the models and algorithms,
resulting in improper, sometimes controversial, assessment and analytical
results (Florinsky 1998a, 1998b) .

3. The comparison between diVerent models and algorithms on a real-world
DEM can only present their relative accuracy and error distribution (should
be termed as ‘diVerence distribution’). Since the ‘true’ value is unknown, it is
uncertain and subjective to judge the correctness and quality of the models.

Freeman (1991 ) presented an alternative method that used an arti(cid:142) cial surface,
a cone, to assess divergent (cid:143) ow simulation algorithms. The results were assessed
using the pattern of catchment area that follows a theoretical expectation. Although
it is argued that whether a cone surface is realistic to the real-world cases, this
method has eliminated the uncertainty of the data so that it made more convincing
testing results. However, a methodology with authority to assess hydrological models
requires that a set of ‘standard’ tests be established so that diVerent algorithms and
models can be quantitatively compared.

The aim of this study, therefore, is to develop a quantitative, data-independen t
method for analysing and objectively assessing errors generated from hydrological
modelling algorithms. The generic approach is to use arti(cid:142) cial surfaces which can
be described by a mathematical model, thus the ‘true’ output value can be pre-
determined to avoid uncertainty caused by uncontrollable data errors (Jones 1998).
Four mathematical surfaces based on an ellipsoid (representing convex slopes), an
inverse ellipsoid (representing concave slopes), saddle and plane have been generated
and the theoretical ‘true’ value of the SCA on any given point on the surfaces has
been computed using mathematical inference.

Based on these models, we tested and compared a number of hydrological (cid:143) ow
routing algorithms (Desmet and Govers 1996) for SCA computation using arti(cid:142) cial
mathematical surfaces. The actual output values from these (cid:143) ow routing algorithms
on the convex, concave, saddle and plane surfaces were compared with the theoretical
results. The errors generated by these models were then statistically analysed and
their strengths and weaknesses, as well as application suitability, are also discussed.

2. The scope and approach

The scope of this study is to investigate the methodology in assessing errors in
hydrological modelling algorithms. For this purpose, we have restricted our focus
on the follows:

E Data: grid DEM,
E Algorithms: the (cid:143) ow routing algorithms which are employed for computing
topographi c parameters for simulating surface (cid:143) ow and other geomorphologic
processes, and

Q. Zhou and X. L iu

E Applications: computation of Total Contributing Area (TCA) and, particularly,

Speci(cid:142) c Catchment Area (SCA).

Given the shortfalls and problems as discussed above for error assessment using
‘real-world’ DEM, we propose a data-independen t approach by employing a series
of arti(cid:142) cial DEM de(cid:142) ned by analytical polynomials, which form the foundation for
computing topographi c parameters such as slope, aspect, catchment area and slope
curvature. Using a given spatial resolution (i.e. cell size) to resample the continuous
polynomial surface, a DEM can be generated on which the ‘true’ values of selected
topographic parameters can be computed through inference. Based on this error-
free DEM, the output from a tested algorithm can be compared with the ‘true’
values, thus the absolute errors and their distributions can be quanti(cid:142) ed with
con(cid:142) dence.

3. The (cid:143) ow routing algorithms in hydrological modelling

For computing the catchment area on a grid DEM, a common approach is to
undertake a two-step process, namely, (a) determination of (cid:143) ow direction from the
current cell, and (b) computation of the (cid:143) ow distribution from the current cell (the
source) to the lower neighbouring cells (the receiver). For this, there have been two
generic approaches ((cid:142) gure 1):

1. Single Flow Direction (SFD) algorithms where the total amount of (cid:143) ow should
be received by a single neighbouring cell which has the maximum downhill slope
with the current cell (Mark 1984, Fair(cid:142) eld and Leymarie 1991).

2. Multiple Flow Direction (MFD) algorithms where the (cid:143) ow from the current
lower neighbouring cells according to a pre-
cell should be distributed to all
determined rule (Quinn et al. 1991, Freeman 1991, Tribe 1992, Holmgren 1994,
Tarboton 1997, Pilesjo¨ et al. 1998 ).

Figure 2 shows a simple classi(cid:142) cation of some grid-based (cid:143) ow routing algorithms
found in literature. Given the scope of this paper, the characteristics of some (cid:143) ow
routing algorithms are only brie(cid:143) y described below. More details about most of
these algorithms can be found in Wilson and Gallant (2000).

Deterministic eight-node (D8) algorithm was reported by O’Callaghan and Mark

in 1984. On a 3×3 local window of a DEM, the slopes between the centre cell and
its eight neighbouring cells are computed. The (cid:143) ow direction of the centre cell points
to the centre of the neighbouring cell with the maximum downhill slope, and that
single neighbour will receive all (cid:143) ow accumulated in the centre cell ((cid:142) gure 1(a)). The
algorithm is the most popular one, particularly in commercial GIS software, because
of its simple and eYcient computation, and strong capability in dealing with local
depressions and (cid:143) at areas (Tarboton 1997). One major weakness of the D8 algorithm
is that although the centre cell can receive upstream (cid:143) ow from several sources, the
downstream (cid:143) ow can only be in one direction. Thus it is not suitable for areas where
divergent (cid:143) ow occur, such as convex slopes and ridges (Costa-Cabral and Burges
1994, Moore 1996, Wilson and Gallant 2000).

Random eight-node (Rho8) algorithm (Fair(cid:142) eld and Leymarie 1991) recognises
that the (cid:143) ow over a grid DEM can be arbitrary thus introduced randomness into
D8. It is a stochastic version of D8 that aims to break up parallel (cid:143) ow paths that
may be resulted from D8, and produces a mean (cid:143) ow direction equal to the aspect.
However, it still cannot model (cid:143) ow dispersion (Moore 1996, Wilson and Gallant
2000 ).

Multiple (cid:143) ow direction (MFD) algorithms recognise (cid:143) ow divergence over a
natural landscape. Thus on a 3×3 local window, the (cid:143) ow from the centre cell dose
not necessarily point to a single neighbouring cell, but rather, it may (cid:143) ow into all
or part of downstream neighbours ((cid:142) gure 1(b)). Based on this principle, a number
of algorithms have been developed with various ways of distributing (cid:143) ow proportion-
ally. Quinn et al. (1991) and Freeman (1991) reported diVerent implementation of
the MFD algorithms, a common point of which is that they do not need to determine
the (cid:143) ow direction for individual cell.

Quinn et al. (1991) proposed a (cid:143) ow distribution equation according to slope and

contour length ((cid:143) ow width):

where Fi is the proportional (cid:143) ow to be distributed into the ith neighbouring cell; L i
is the (cid:143) ow width; and tan bi denotes the slope between the centre cell and the ith
neighbouring cell. On a grid DEM, L i=ã 2/4 Dd (Dd=cell size) for the diagonal
directions (i.e. corner adjacent cells), while L i=1/2 Dd for others (i.e. edge adjacent
cells).

Freeman (1991) took a similar approach but did not consider the (cid:143) ow width

(Freeman MFD, or FMFD):

Fi=

Based on the test on a conical surface, Freeman found that r=1.1 produced the
most accurate results. This model was later tested by Pilesjo¨ and Zhou (1997) on a
spherical surface and it was found that r=1.0 would be more appropriate for the case.
Costa-Cabral and Burges (1994) proposed the Digital Elevation Model Networks
(DEMON) algorithm in a conceptually similar way to the stream-tube approach
used with contour-base d DEM by Moore and Grayson (1991), but implemented on
a grid DEM. In DEMON, (cid:143) ow is generated at each cell (source cell) and routed
down a stream tube until the edge of the DEM or a local depression is reached. The
stream tubes are formed from the points of intersections of a line drawn in the aspect
and a cell edge. The amount of (cid:143) ow, expressed as a fraction of the area of the source
cell, is added to the (cid:143) ow accumulation value of the downstream cell, thus the source
cell will provide an impact value on each of the cell along the stream tube. After
(cid:143) ow has been generated on all cells and its impact on each of its ‘stream tube’ cells
has been added, the (cid:142) nal (cid:143) ow accumulation value is the total upslope area contribut-
ing runoV to each cell, i.e. SCA. The DEMON algorithm was subsequently modi(cid:142) ed
and implemented in the TAPES-G software by Moore and his co-workers (Wilson
and Gallant 2000).

Tarboton (1997) argued that sparse catchment areas should be avoided while
computing SCA. Thus, by integrating DEMON (Costa-Cabral and Burges 1994)
and the aspect-driven algorithm proposed by Lea (1992), he proposed the
Deterministic in(cid:142) nite-node (Dinf, or D2 ) algorithm. In Dinf, on a 3×3 local window,
the centroids of the centre cell and its neighbours are used to form 8 triangles. Dinf
then computes the slope for each of the triangles and selects the one with the
maximum downhill slope as the (cid:143) ow direction. The two neighbouring cells that the
triangle intersects receive the (cid:143) ow in proportion to their closeness to the aspect of
the triangle.

Pilesjo¨ et al. (1998) proposed an alternative method based on the form of the
surface de(cid:142) ned by the DEM. On a 3×3 local window, the centroids of the nine cells
are used to establish the local second-order trend surface, thus the form of the
window can be determined in terms of convexity and concavity. The (cid:143) ow distribution
can then be determined according to whether the local (cid:143) ow is divergent or convergent.
An alternative ‘feature-based’ approach was also proposed by Mackay and Band
(1998) and Liang and Mackay (2000 ) by explicitly recognising hydrological features
(e.g. lakes) in watershed extraction processes.

4. Computation of theoretical ‘true’ values

The Total Contributing Area (TCA) is de(cid:142) ned as ‘the plane area of terrain that
contributes (cid:143) ow to the contour segment’ (Moore and Grayson 1991). The Speci(cid:142) c

Catchment Area (SCA) is de(cid:142) ned as ‘upslope area per unit width of contour’, which
has the signi(cid:142) cance for studying runoV volume, steady-state runoV rate, soil charac-
teristics, soil-water content and geomorphology (Wilson and Gallant 2000). While
the Contour Length (CL) tends to zero, the SCA is de(cid:142) ned as the upstream length
at that point (Hutchinson and Dowling 1991).

SCA= lim
CL 0

(3)

On an actual land surface, the TCA and SCA are determined by (cid:143) ow direction
and (cid:143) ow line. With the exception of divergent (cid:143) ow cases, Flow Direction (FD) is
de(cid:142) ned as the maximum hydraulic slope, i.e. the maximum downhill slope or its
approximation. Flow Path (FP) is the trace line of the (cid:143) ow along the FD. Both FD
and FP are controlled by the natural morphology of the land surface. The uphill
area bounded by the FP at two given points on a contour line forms TCA for the
contour segment, while the TCA and CL determine the SCA.

According to the de(cid:142) nition, the TCA is the value assigned on the arc of contour.
While CL tends to zero, SCA can be recognised as the TCA at that point. Thus, on
a known mathematical surface, the polynomial equation can be solved at any given
point on the surface, i.e. the ‘true’ value of TCA at that point. Therefore, we selected
SCA as the criterion for this study to assess the accuracy of hydrological modelling
algorithms.

4.1. Flow direction and (cid:143) ow path

Given a 3-dimensional surface z= f (x, y), its representation on a plane can be
expressed as contour f (x, y)=c, where c is an arbitrary constant. For any given
point P(x, y), the f (x, y) will have the maximum value decrease along the opposite
direction of the gradient at P. The value of this is thus called the maximum slope
and its direction is de(cid:142) ned as the aspect or Flow Direction (FD).

For f (x, y), the gradient at P is expressed as:

where i and j denote unit directions, and the norm of (4) is the slope:

When fy

0, the direction of the gradient is the aspect:

grad f (x, y)= fxi+ fy j

slope=ã

f 2x + f 2y

aspect=arctanA fx
fyB

At a given point P, the aspect is perpendicular to the contour line passing P.
While a point is moving downhill with gravity, its trace on the surface is presented
as the FP. At any point on the FP, the tangent direction is the direction of the
contour line passing that point, i.e. FP is perpendicular to contour lines at any
points. Thus, for the FP g(x, y) passing point P(x, y), it satis(cid:142) es the equation below:

f ê (x, y)gê (x, y)= - 1

4.2. T otal catchment area and speci(cid:142) c catchment area

Illustrated by (cid:142) gure 3,

f 2 is the contour line passing point a(x1 , y1 ), while f 1 is
the contour line higher than point a. Assuming f1 and f 2 are continuous, there is a
FP g1 that passes a, and g1 and f1 intersect at point d(x4 , y4 ). To compute the SCA
at point a, an arbitrary point b(x2 , y2 ) on f 2 is selected, at which we can similarly
derive the FP g2 that passes b and the intersect point c(x3 , y3 ) of g2 and f 1 . Thus,
the TCA above the CL between a and b is presented by the area bounded by arcs
ab, bc, cd and da, which can be expressed as:

5. Design of mathematical surfaces

Considering the complexity of the surface in the real world, the selected arti(cid:142) cial
mathematical surfaces need to be similar to the reality, at least to part of the real
surface, since the simplest surfaces may not be able to derive meaningful results
(Holmgren 1994, Jones 1998). In this study, we selected the following polynomial
surfaces ((cid:142) gure 4):

the outlet of the catchment is at the edge of the area. At any given point on the
surface, the (cid:143) ow is divergent. We derive its parameters as shown in table 1.

5.2. Inverse ellipsoid

Inverse ellipsoid (Elliptic bowl, (cid:142) gure 4(b)) simulates a part of valley or concave
slope that represents water drainage or a catchment. Along its long axis represents
the water drainage line on which convergent (cid:143) ow is found. The outlet of the
catchment is at the centre. At any given point on the surface, the (cid:143) ow is convergent
and its parameters can be derived as shown in table 2.

5.3. Saddle

Q. Zhou and X. L iu

Saddle ((cid:142) gure 4(c)) simulates the intersection between convex and concave slopes,
or ridge and valley. Along the E–W direction is the water divide while along N–S
direction is the water drainage. At the origin point (0, 0) is the saddle point. On the
saddle surface, (cid:143) ow can be divergent (e.g. along E–W) or convergent (e.g. along
N–S), or near parallel. The de(cid:142) nition and hydrological parameters of a saddle are
shown in table 3.

5.4. Plane

This is the simplest surface on which slope and aspect are constant, and the (cid:143) ow
is expected to be parallel ((cid:142) gure 4(d)). In reality, it represents straight slope or gentle
slope plain. Its de(cid:142) nition and parameters can be found in table 4.

Figure 4 shows a set of such mathematical surfaces for given spatial resolution
(cell size) and boundary (area size). It should be noted that although the surfaces

presented in (cid:142) gure 4 only (cid:142) t the given resolution and surface parameters, these
variables can indeed be varied for any given testing purposes, including changing
cell size and grid orientation, without in(cid:143) uence computation of the ‘true’ values of
hydrological parameters.

6. Experiment and results

Four mathematical surfaces were generated for the test using polynomials
described above. For the ease of discussion, the origin of the high-order polynomial
surfaces (viz. convex, concave and saddle) were set on the centre, with the x-axis
pointing to the East and y-axis pointing to the North – in the same direction of grid
orientation. The z-axis speci(cid:142) es the elevation, in the same way as a DEM.

Five selected (cid:143) ow routing algorithms, D8, Rho8, FMFD, DEMON and Dinf,
were implemented and applied on the DEM de(cid:142) ned by the four mathematical
surfaces. Using the method proposed by this study, the ‘true’ SCA values for each
cell of the DEM have been computed. Figure 5, (cid:142) gure 6, (cid:142) gure 7 and (cid:142) gure 8 show
the contour maps of the ‘true’ and derived values by the (cid:142) ve algorithms on the
convex, concave, saddle and plane surfaces, respectively.

The derived SCA values from the selected algorithms were then compared with
the ‘true’ values and statistical analyses were employed to analyse the errors generated
by the algorithms in two aspects, namely, overall accuracy and spatial distribution
of residuals. The error generated from each algorithm is computed as:

V i=SCAi - SCAi

(19)

where V i denotes the error (or residual ) at the given cell using the ith selected
algorithm, SCAt denotes the theoretical ‘true’ value of SCA at that cell, and SCAi
denotes the computed SCA value by the ith selected algorithm.

Table 5 shows the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Error (ME) and
Standard Deviation (SD) of the errors by selected algorithms (i.e. V i) on the four
mathematical surfaces. Figure 9 shows the comparison between the RMSE generated
by the (cid:142) ve algorithms. To estimate the systematic bias of each tested algorithms, the
frequency distribution of positive and negative errors are also computed and
presented in table 6.

Figure 10 shows the frequency distribution of errors for all tested algorithms on
all four surfaces. In order to estimate statistical distribution of computed SCA errors
in diVerent magnitude, a k value (m2 /m) is de(cid:142) ned as the classi(cid:142) cation unit:

S
L
where S denotes the area of a grid cell (m2 ) and L denotes the cell size (m). For a
given surface, the k is a constant, so that the error in SCA computation (V i, derived
by equation (19)) at each cell can be converted into the corresponding error class
(Ei) as:

7. Discussion
7.1. Error assessment on each selected algorithm

By analysing (cid:142) gures 5–8 and tables 5 and 6, the errors from each selected (cid:143) ow
routing algorithms can be objectively evaluated and analysed. This assessment is
based on the quantitative results of the above statistical analysis methods. Since the

tests were not based on data of a speci(cid:142) c area, the results are regarded as having
generic implications.

DEMON
Compared with all other selected algorithms, DEMON appears to deliver the
best results showing the minimum RMSE, ME and SD ((cid:142) gure 9 ) with the high
frequency of small errors on all surfaces ((cid:142) gure 10). The result con(cid:142) rms that
DEMON, based on its conceptual contour-based SCA model, can produce the most
accurate results.

The errors generated by DEMON can be summarised as with two major charac-
teristics. The (cid:142) rst is the negative systematic errors (table 6, showing average frequency
of 91% on the negative side, as well as the negative ME) on all surfaces. This means
that DEMON tends to over estimate SCA in all cases. The second characteristic is
that the signi(cid:142) cant errors exist in areas with high-degree of divergence or convergence,
with the higher error levels along the high divergence area ((cid:142) gures 5 and 7). This
also con(cid:142) rms the conclusion of Costa-Cabral and Burges (1994). However, instead
of aspect computation being the problem as argued by Costa-Cabral and Burges,
the grid data structure is believed to be the most in(cid:143) uential factor as the signi(cid:142) cant
errors seem to be concentrated along the S–N and W–E axes.

Excluding the small areas along the S-N and W-E axes, DEMON performs well

in all four cases, with the better results on convergent and parallel surface shapes
such as concave, plane and the concave slopes on saddle.

Dinf

The RMSE from Dinf is less than others except DEMON, but its spatial distribu-
tion varies signi(cid:142) cantly from that of DEMON. Examining (cid:142) gures 5 and 6, shows
that although Dinf performs better near the S–N and W–E axes, it generates quite
signi(cid:142) cant errors in the diagonal axes (e.g. NE, SE, SW and NW axes). It should
also be noted that the results from Dinf are not symmetric in the NS directions on
the convex surface ((cid:142) gure 5).

On the error distribution, in contrast to DEMON, Dinf yields more positive
errors (average 88%). Based on the positive ME, the higher RMSE and SD, it shows
that Dinf also produces systematic errors and tends to under estimate SCA in all
cases. On diVerent surface shapes, Dinf performs best on the saddle and worst on
the concave surface. Excluding the concave surface, a high frequency of small errors
is observed.

Freeman MFD

The MFD algorithms (Freeman 1991, Quinn et al. 1991) do not need to compute
aspect for each cell, thus they are not in(cid:143) uenced by the errors in aspect computation.
The major source of errors in MFD is from the proportional (cid:143) ow distribution among

receiving neighbouring cells. Therefore, how to distribute the amount of (cid:143) ow into
downstream cells is the key for accuracy. Freeman (1991) implemented the MFD
as shown in equation (2) and suggested that r=1.1 would be most appropriated.
Experiments in this study con(cid:142) rm Freeman’s result on the conical and plane surfaces,
where the slope is constant. However, on other surfaces, the FMFD has shown some
noticeable errors.

high-frequency small errors dominate the convex slope area. On the concave surface,

The large errors concentrate on the centre, close to the (cid:143) ow outlet. On the saddle
surface, the FMFD shows the mixed characteristics of that on convex and concave

surfaces. On the plane surface, FMFD produces signi(cid:142) cant errors showing curved
SCA contours along the longest (cid:143) ow path and at edge ((cid:142) gure 8).

Unlike DEMON and Dinf, FMFD does not show signi(cid:142) cant systematic bias.
The distribution of positive and negative errors is quite neutral, with small ME
values. As FMFD is proposed to solve the data structure bias that was encountered
by the D8 algorithm, it delivers quite good results on slopes, both convex and
concave, but seems to produce quite large errors near the water outlets and at edge.

D8 and Rho8

D8 and Rho8 algorithms yield results at a similar accuracy level, with quite
signi(cid:142) cant errors. The shortfalls of D8 have been recognised and well discussed and
analysed by previous studies (Fair(cid:142) eld and Leymarie 1991, Costa-Cabral and Burges
1994, Wilson and Gallant 2000). With the results of this research, we can summarise
these as: (1) parallel (cid:143) ow path, (2) a strong octant pattern in SCA distribution with
the maximum errors on these directions ((cid:142) gures 5 and 6), (3) extremely high error
level on the divergent slope ((cid:142) gure 7), and (4) large errors on plane except when
aspect is set to N, E, S or W ((cid:142) gure 8).

Rho8 introduces randomness while determining the (cid:143) ow direction, in order to
avoid parallel (cid:143) ow path problem encountered in D8 algorithm. It assumes that the
(cid:143) ow direction is not (cid:142) xed at a particular point, but in general follows the average
aspect of the land surface. Although Rho8 helps to solve the parallel (cid:143) ow path
problem (Wilson and Gallant 2000) in drainage network generation, it creates large
distortion in the SCA computation. It is argued that while the spatial resolution is
set for the grid DEM, the SCA are also (cid:142) xed, rather than a random variable. With
the introduction of randomness, there are at least two signi(cid:142) cant shortfalls in SCA
computation shown by the results of this study:

E The results are variable by each processing with the same parameters and

data, and

E The distribution of SCA does not show any noticeable drainage pattern with

many isolated small catchments ((cid:142) gures 5–8).

7.2. Error distribution on the plane surface

On a plane surface, the slope and aspect is constant, thus it is sensitive to show
the in(cid:143) uence of grid data structure and cumulative errors that may be introduced
by diVerent algorithms. In this study, an arbitrary plane is de(cid:142) ned as z=2x+y+100,
with slope 66°, aspect 243°, area extent 500 m×500 m with 10-m spatial resolution
(cell size).

By examining the SCA contour maps shown in (cid:142) gure 8, it can be observed that
DEMON, Dinf and FMFD produce quite similar outcome, varying only along the
main stream line (the line passing the highest point, see (cid:142) gure 11) with diVerent
‘smooth’ eVects as the result of multiple (cid:143) ow distribution. Because of the discontinuity
in aspect de(cid:142) nition in D8, the bias on the 225° direction is obvious. The randomness
in Rho8 makes broken (cid:143) ow accumulation along grid cells, thus produced small
isolated catchments.

Figure 11 shows the error distribution pro(cid:142) le on NS direction where x=50 m. It
is clear that DEMON does not accumulate errors along the main streamline. Except
the shape change at the main streamline, which shows the in(cid:143) uence of the grid data
structure, it has a constant error cross the pro(cid:142) le on each side, all with a negative
value. Despite quite diVerent error levels, Dinf, FMFD and D8 have similar error

distribution pro(cid:142) le, showing accumulative errors along the main streamline and
decreasing errors while moving away from the main streamline. The Rho8 shows
random error distribution with a high error level.

7.3. T he overall comparison between algorithms

Tarboton (1997) stated that while designing a (cid:143) ow routing algorithm on a grid

DEM, (cid:142) ve points need to be considered:

1. minimum dispersion,
2. avoidance of the in(cid:143) uence of grid data structure,

Downloaded by [Tufts University] at 06:12 05 October 2014 Error assessment of grid-based (cid:143) ow routing algorithms

839

3. high accuracy algorithm for slope computation,
4. simple and eYcient matrix storage structure, and
5. robustness (i.e. a strong ability to deal with various landforms such as saddle,

depression and (cid:143) at area).

Given that SCA is a value that is based on an arc (contour), when it is imple-
mented on a grid DEM, (cid:143) ow dispersion (i.e. (cid:143) ow divergence) is unavoidable. Thus
we make the following overall comparison between algorithms based on the
Tarboton’s later four points.

Among the (cid:142) ve algorithms, DEMON has the highest accuracy, minimum
in(cid:143) uence by the grid structure and minimum downstream error accumulation (or
propagation) . However, the implementation is complex, with too many special cases
needing to be considered (Tarboton 1997) and slow data processing speed (Wilson
and Gallant 2000). In contrast, Dinf, FMFD, D8 and Rho8 all have simple structures
that allow recursive algorithm implementation (Freeman 1991, Tarboton 1997), thus
they have better eYciency. On accuracy, both Dinf and FMFD can deliver good
results but Dinf needs to solve the ambiguity problem in determining the (cid:143) ow
direction (shown by the non-symmetric pattern in results, see (cid:142) gure 5) and FMFD
needs further calibration in determining the r value. D8 has a strong ability in
dealing with complex landform features, such as local depressions and (cid:143) at area, but
it is heavily in(cid:143) uenced by the grid structure, resulting in large computational errors.
Rho8, with its randomness in determining (cid:143) ow direction, does not correctly interpret
the morphology of the given surface.

From the distribution of SCA, DEMON, Dinf and FMFD have similar distribu-
tions to the theoretical expectation, while D8 and Rho8 have large distortions from
the ‘true’ value. In spatial distribution, the former three algorithms show concentra-
tion of errors along the drainage line and water divide, and areas closer to the
drainage outlet and edge of the area. On the large slope areas, all three algorithms
are capable of delivering reasonable results with minimal errors.

7.4. Evaluation of the methodology

It may be argued that the selected mathematical surfaces may represent the
morphology that could be hard to (cid:142) nd in the real world, thus it may be ‘unfair’ to
use such perfect surfaces to test the algorithms that are supposed to solve real world
problems. However, it is believed that the surfaces selected, although simpli(cid:142) ed, can
adequately represent most surface morphological cases if the surface is partitioned
according to its morphology. Besides, although the whole of some of the selected
surfaces may be rare, they can be quite common as a part of the landscape. For
example, although it may be argued that an elliptic bowl-shape is rare in natural
landscapes, a concave-sloped valley is quite a common shape in nature and can be
well represented by a part of the inverse ellipsoid by intersecting it with a sloped
plane ((cid:142) gure 12).

One advantage of this proposed mathematical ‘true’ value methodology is its
high sensitivity to the computational errors of the tested algorithms. Since on a
given surface, the computational errors tend to be cumulative rather than neutralised
by unknown factors as found in the real-world DEM (Zhou 2000), the algorithm
errors can be easily detected. The spatial distribution of the errors can be well
presented by an error grid. This approach, therefore, provides a con(cid:142) dent basis for
improving the algorithms or methodologies.

8. Conclusions

In this paper we presented a data-independen t methodology for testing hydrolo-
gical modelling algorithms by employing mathematically ‘perfect’ surfaces and theor-
etically ‘true’ values of the selected hydrological/morphological parameters. A set of
mathematical surfaces including ellipsoid (representing a convex slope), inverse ellips-
oid (representing a concave slope), saddle and plane were selected as the typical
representation for the part of natural landscape. The theoretical ‘true’ values of
selected hydrological/morphological parameters have been computed through
inference for a given set of spatial resolution and boundary parameters.

Based on the theoretical models, we made a quantitative evaluation and compar-
ison on the accuracy of (cid:142) ve selected hydrological modelling algorithms, namely,
DEMON, Dinf, FMFD, D8 and Rho8. The results show that these grid-based
algorithms all produce some level of errors, which are related to the morphology of
the surface. The major cause of these processing errors is due to the nature of grid
data structure and over-simpli(cid:142) ed assumptions on the behaviour of water (cid:143) ow
controlled by the surface morphology.

From the point of view of accuracy, DEMON, Dinf and FMFD performed well
with generally low RMSE, with DEMON produced marginally better results than
the other two. Although DEMON did show error patterns caused by the grid data
structure, it nevertheless had an overall best performance in all tests. Both Dinf and
FMFD also delivered good results, particularly on the saddle surface, but they
showed weaknesses on the convex and plane surfaces. Both D8 and Rho8 produced
unacceptable errors in all tests, so that care must be taken if they are used in the
real-world applications where the algorithm accuracy is of concern.

While comparing hydrological modelling algorithms using a real-world DEM, the
outcome can be largely in(cid:143) uenced by the errors inherent in the DEM itself, so that the
errors produced by the algorithm could be masked by the DEM error. This is particularly
true for the (cid:143) ow routing algorithms as the aspect computation in these algorithms is often
very sensitive to the DEM error, resulting in incorrect analytical results. Using mathemat-
ical surfaces, one can ensure that the DEM employed is ‘perfect’, thus he or she can
concentrate the eVort on improving the accuracy of the algorithm itself.

The method does not limit itself in the SCA computation. It can also be applied
to other DEM interpretation processes. The continuing study is aimed to further
quantify the in(cid:143) uence of DEM parameters, such as various data structures, spatial
resolutions and orientation, on the hydrological modelling functions developed in
GIS, thus a foundation can be laid to allow more accurate and reliable hydrological
models be implemented in the real-world applications.

The  spatial  representation  of  a  city  is  typically  formed  by 

top-down  jurisdictional  boundaries.  A  parallel  approach 

would  be  to  consider  representing  a  city  based  on  pla-

tial  characteristics,  that  is,  a  bottom-up  landscape  created 

through individual and collectively derived representations. 

This study contributes to this discourse through the explor-

atory  examination  of  the  ecology  notions  of  home  range 

and  habitat  applied  to  humans  in  an  urban  context.  Using 

spatial data collected through a WebGIS platform, we em-

ploy a spatial definition of sense of place and social capital 

to understand the platial nature of the city and, simultane-

ously,  defining  home  range  and  habitat  as  platial  notions. 

We  found  spatial  variability  among  individual  home  range 

and  habitat  and  the  difficulty  of  traditional  administrative 

boundaries to represent these areas. This research defines 

and  presents  home  range  and  habitat  to  partially  describe 

the emergent nature of platial theory and explores their op-

erationalization at the urban level.

The spatial understanding of human perceptions and behaviors is gaining more attention in geographic informa-

tion  science  (Ballatore,  2016;  Gao,  Janowicz,  McKenzie,  &  Li,  2013;  Goodchild,  2015;  Purves,  Winter,  &  Kuhn, 

2019; Roche, 2016; Scheider & Janowicz, 2014). Despite the importance of place as a concept in human geogra-

phy and environmental psychology (Antonsich, 2010, p. 120) and its implications for the development of identity 

and belonging (Duff, 2011), GIScience has been primarily focused on quantitative and observable facts due to

the readability of empirical phenomena (Warf & Sui, 2010). The nature of places (as opposed to spaces) is based 

on relative coordinates and mixed individual and societal conceptualizations (Murdoch, 1998). Place requires a 

relational system (Harvey, 1969) where human activities, constructs, and objects define a unit (Murdoch, 1998). 

Simultaneously, this unit is associated with other places, creating a chain of places based on recurrent associations 

(Thrift, 1999). While the Euclidean nature of spaces reveals points, lines, areas, and volumes (Goodchild, 2015), 

the vague or poorly defined geographical representation of place presents notable challenges to representation 

(Westerholt, Gröbe, Zipf, & Burghardt, 2018), remaining as a critical research area in the continued advancement 

of GIScience (Westerholt, Gröbe, et al., 2018).

Both space and place are critical components of how we understand and organize cities and the human ac-

tivity within those cities. For example, the spatial administrative boundaries set by governments are used within 

cities to embed borders according to geopolitical or social factors (Gao et al., 2013). However, many researchers 

point out the need to identify new boundaries that respect place-based human–city interactions that cross those 

traditional spatial boundaries (Foster & Hipp, 2011; Hipp, Faris, & Boessen, 2012; Grannis, 2009; Wong & Shaw, 

2011;  Sampson,  Morenoff,  &  Gannon-Rowley,  2002).  Indeed,  it  is  in  this  context  that  the  identification  of  the 
urban platial1  dynamics (i.e., connected complex urban places (Acedo, Painho, Casteleyn, & Roche, 2018)) and the 

human–urban interactions within a city can offer an alternative way of understanding community development, 

social relationships, and even the impact of the built environment and social interactions on health outcomes. For 

instance, Manzo and Perkins (2006) demonstrated that person–environment transactions foster the development 

of a community and Miralles and Granell (2019) considered context (i.e., place, spatial relationship, and sense of 

place [SoP]) in measuring the effectiveness of psychological care and treatment.

The everyday life actions of individuals and the aggregate community within an urban context can emerge 

from  platial  factors,  rather  than  the  spatial  definition  of  administrative  boundaries.  In  this  way,  the  city  itself 

is shaped by the diversity and nature of how those individual actions and platial relationships combine to form 

a  type  of  bottom-up  platial  community  and  neighborhood.  Drawing  from  this  bottom-up  approach  to  defining 

areas within a city, there are relevant questions concerning how formal societal actions (i.e., voting, governance) 

are based on predefined administrative boundaries when human interactions may be alternately defined using a 

platial perspective. Fundamentally, the predefined jurisdictional areas of a city may not be responsive enough to 

the social processes unfolding in the city (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000; Parenteau et al., 2008; Sampson et al., 

2002), since, typically, census units have little association with the social context (Deng, 2016). The current spatial 

framework of cities is formally based on a spatial organization (e.g., neighborhoods and districts) that fails to ac-

count for unique ways citizens experience their surroundings (Vallée, Le Roux, Chaix, Kestens, & Chauvin, 2015), 

while  citizens  represent  their  very  own  subjective  places  in  given  specific  locations  and  times  simultaneously 

(Westerholt, Gröbe, et al., 2018). In response, this study examines one approach to gathering and representing 

human platial representations of the city through the lens of communal perceptions toward a place (i.e., SoP) and 

meaningful social relationships (i.e., social capital [SC]).

The concepts of SoP and SC are types of individuals’ spatialities.2  These two concepts can be used to define 

urban platial dynamics that can be represented and analyzed (Acedo, Painho, et al., 2018; Roche, 2016). Despite 

the  difficulty  in  modeling  an  individual  conceptualization  of  place-related  notions  (Adams  &  McKenzie,  2013; 

Goodchild & Li, 2011; Westerholt, Gröbe, et al., 2018), we attempt to define an alternative approach of home and 

neighborhood notions (as spatial features) based on ecological concepts (i.e., home range and habitat) from the 

lens of the platial theory. The current administrative conception of home and neighborhood may limit the repre-

sentation of citizens’ daily interactions, feelings and social interactions (i.e., individuals’ spatialities). A bottom-up 

platial perspective can offer alternatives to bridge administrative boundaries to individuals’ spatialities, that is, 

from home and neighborhoods to spatial contents of interactions and perceptions (in this study home range and 

habitat, respectively). This stands in contrast to a traditional top-down spatial definition of home and neighbor-

hood, as constructed through political jurisdictions. There is a need for a better understanding of the impact of 

platial representation as a contribution to a developing theory of place (Goodchild, 2015; Mennis, 2018). With this 

ACEDO AnD JOHnSOn    |  3

in mind, the question at hand is how to move from spatial boundaries of a city (home, neighborhood) and define 

and interpret the platial alternative such as home range and habitat.

This study  employs  a spatial definition of  SoP  and SC to understand the platial nature of  the city, defining 

home range and habitat as platial proxies. The goal of this exploratory research is to consider a platial analogue to 

the spatial concepts of home and neighborhood from a citizen-focused approach and, therefore, create a new pla-

tial city configuration. Empirical research conducted in the Portuguese city of Lisbon uses a WebGIS platform to 

gather individual representations of home range and habitat as bottom-up, platial definitions. We emphasize that 

city stakeholders’ understanding of the urban environment can be enhanced through the incorporation of a platial 

approach, with individuals’ spatialities defining areas that are of particular import, including areas connected to 

both SoP and SC. This article starts with a comparison between the spatial and platial perspective at the urban 

level and approaches used to spatialize place-related concepts. The article then defines the notions of home range 

and habitat at the urban level and presents the methods and the results of an experiment conducted in Lisbon to 

clarify the spatial footprint and behavior of both home range and habitat. This is followed by a discussion of the 

results, limitations and implications. We complete the article with our conclusions and observations about future 

work.

The spatial definition of our surroundings and meaningful places is still a topic of debate. For instance, a signifi-

cant number of studies discuss several approaches to mapping neighborhood boundaries (see Deng, 2016) and 

the different hierarchies that neighborhoods have (see Park & Rogers, 2015). Additionally, there is recent focused 

GIScience research on the platial environment that aims to formalize and analyze place-related notions and char-

acteristics (Acedo, Painho, & Casteleyn, 2017; Acedo, Painho, et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2013; Papadakis, Resch, & 

Blaschke, 2019; Purves et al., 2019; Scheider & Janowicz, 2014; Vasardani, Winter, & Richter, 2013; Westerholt, 

Gröbe, et al., 2018; Westerholt, Mocnik, & Zipf, 2018). These studies draw parallels between a city as understood 

from spatial and platial perspectives, the former strongly related to science and its aims of replication (i.e., based 

on  coordinates  to  facilitate  characterization,  delimitation  of  specific  areas,  and  transfer  between  areas;  Sui  & 

Goodchild, 2011), the latter based on human interactions, conveying meaning that is characterized by context and 

relationships that may differ considerably between individuals (Goodchild & Li, 2011).

A typical city is defined by administrative spatial containers that differ between countries or even sub-regions 

within a given country. A given citizen's spatial relationship with the city is predefined by where they live (i.e., 

home), which in several cases is contained within one or more administrative boundaries (e.g., parish, neighbor-

hood, district) that represent the city spatial jurisdiction boundary. City governments wish to collect information 

about the daily life of their citizens, through the processes of managing the city, and providing services and deci-

sion-making. These spatial representations, though often efficient and well entrenched, can lack detail about citi-

zen's daily life interactions and movements in the city and also ignore how cultural, human, and social geographies 

play out in the real world. In turn, those specific geographies draw on a platial approach, touching aspects of cul-

ture, linguistics, dynamism, time, and scale (Ballatore, 2016), demonstrating the diversity and nature of bottom-up 

synergies that determine our common spatialities regarding our fellow citizens.

2.1 | Home and home range

Home is a spatially localized, temporally defined, significant and autonomous physical frame (Benjamin, Stea, & 

Arén, 1995, p. 435) where one lives permanently, especially as a member of a family or household. Typically, from 

ACEDO AnD JOHnSOn4  |    

a pure spatial planning perspective, home is a discrete point designed by a postal address and a postal code. This 

domestic space is defined with obvious boundaries (Anton & Lawrence, 2014); however, from psychological, so-

ciological, and environmental studies, home indicates not just a concrete word or location, but set of associations 

and meanings (Moore, 2000) connected to the basic family and community circle (Shamai, Arnon, & Schnell, 2012). 

Thus, what we, as individuals, conceptualize as home can vary from an apartment itself to an entire town or city 

(Kasarda & Janowitz, 1974). Home range is a concept drawn from animal ecology, and based on biological animal 

activities.  Home  range  delineates  the  spatial  extent  of  an  animal's  movement  within  everyday  activities  (Burt, 

1943; Powell & Mitchell, 2012). Those activities can be a consequence of movements for feeding and breeding 

(Armstrong, 1965) and can vary as a function of age class within a species (Lindstedt, Miller, & Buskirk, 1986). Thus, 

all animals are limited in the extent of their daily wanderings and, especially in mammals, a critical examination 

of habitat productivity and social organization can explain home range size (Swihart, Slade, & Bergstrom, 1988).

2.2 | Neighborhood and habitat

Different  countries  use  different  spatial  containers  to  determine  the  spatial  administrative  configuration  of  a 

given city, using a wide range of terms to address those different demarcations. These terms include, but are not 

limited to, parish, neighborhood, district, and section. In this study, in order to avoid any confusion, we refer to 

neighborhood as the administrative spatial container between city boundary and home location. We assert the 

existence of cities with more than one administrative layer between those boundaries (i.e., home and city), but for 

this study we only consider one intermediate layer (i.e., neighborhood).

From a institutional perspective, a neighborhood is “a physical or geographical entity with specific (subjective) 

boundaries” (Golab, 1982, p. 72) or “a collection of people who share services and some level of cohesion in a 

geographically bounded place” (Park & Rogers, 2015, p. 2). The understanding of the institutional neighborhood 

spatial footprint is based on the neighborhood identity and a boundary reached through local history, natural, or 

built divides (e.g., highways, canals) or religious, social, and political consensus (Hwang, 2015). The neighborhood 

is the most used spatial container for environmental psychology concepts (e.g., SoP) (Giuliani, 2003), the most 

detectable and viable unit of action (Wellman & Leighton, 1979) and a key unit of analysis in urban studies (Hwang, 

2015). It is also at the neighborhood level that citizens’ input in planning and public policy is enacted, as it is a social 

and political product (Martin, 2003). Despite the importance of neighborhoods as a concept, the definition varies 

considerably (Park & Rogers, 2015), with neighborhoods needing to be a size balance between containing enough 

citizens for supporting services, yet small enough to keep an identity among neighbors (Weiss, Ompad, Galea, & 

Vlahov, 2007). Hence, both the geographical and physical aspects of a neighborhood provide a basis for planning, 

policy decision-making, and research, although frequently different scales of neighborhoods are required (Park & 

Rogers, 2015).

Leaving  aside  the  institutional  neighborhood,  there  are  several  studies  of  how  different  areas  of  scholar-

ship are conceptualizing (see Galster, 2001) and spatially defining (see Deng, 2016) the notion of neighborhood. 

However, when quantitative analysis is required most social scientists studies rely on geographic boundaries cre-

ated by census bureaus or other administrative agencies (Sampson et al., 2002, p. 445). Indeed, most studies use 

some form of base unit (e.g., census section) from which geographic blocks (e.g., neighborhood) are built as a basis 

of measurement for urban and social studies (Sun & Manson, 2012). Habitat is “a description of a physical place, at 

a particular scale of space and time, where an organism either actually or potentially lives” (Kearney, 2006, p. 187). 

Based on this definition, habitat has similarities to the home range concept (see above). The main difference be-

tween the concepts remain in that habitat can exist and be described without reference to an organism (Kearney, 

2006) and needs to present resources and conditions to produce occupancy (Hall, Krausman, & Morrison, 1997), 

while home range is described by typical individual activities of food gathering, mating, and caring (Burt, 1943).

The empirical work of this article presents two platial concepts: home range and habitat. This research uses both 

concepts  to  define  an  approach  to  urban  platial  dynamics  and  urban  intelligence  (Acedo,  Painho,  et  al.,  2018) 

based on individuals’ spatialities (Lussault, 2007). The concept of urban platial dynamics is based on place and its 

three dimensions of SoP, locale and location (Agnew, 2002, 2011). The challenge is to encapsulate and operation-

alize these three dimensions to enrich city processes such as participation and planning. We define the concepts 

of home range and habitat theoretically, spatially and empirically in order to compare with already settling admin-

istrative resources that governments use to deploy their rules and actions.

3.1 | Defining home range and habitat in the urban context

In ecology, the spatial definition of habitat and home range is typically estimated by radio-telemetry techniques 

(Lindstedt et al., 1986) without a clear theoretical exploration of the biological processes that also affect it (Houle, 

Pélabon, Wagner, & Hansen, 2011). Interestingly, this statement has an urban parallel with current mobility studies 

that spatially track citizens to understand their behavior without a clear basis for explaining their perceptions or 

meanings (i.e., platial perspective).

3.1.1 | Home range

The home range concept has been used to define a citizen's neighborhood based on frequently visited places with 

easy access from home (Hasanzadeh, Broberg, & Kyttä, 2017) or to study the notion of place attachment (Brown, 

Raymond,  &  Corcoran,  2015).  In  this  study,  home  range  covers  the  location  where  one  lives  permanently  and 

the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions that one can have with the geographical area that surrounds 

one's home. This definition, specifically the second part, is based on the conceptualization of SoP by Jorgensen 

and Stedman (2001). This conceptualization exhibits three dimensions (place dependence, place attachment, and 

place identity) based on attitude theory (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1975), which was validated in a later study by Pretty, 

Chipuer, and Bramston (2003). Place dependence includes the actions and functions toward a place that meet in-

dividual's necessities Jorgensen and Stedman (2001), place attachment incorporates the affective attitude toward 

a place (Altman & Low, 1992), and place identity describes the connection between the place and one's personal 

identity (Trentelman, 2009). Thus, home range is associated with the frequent use of home and its surroundings. 

Conversely, while Brown et al. (2015, p. 43) include areas that are known but not necessarily visited frequently 

in the definition of home range, Burt (1943, p. 949) does not include those occasional escapades outside the area 

as part of home range. It is in this vein that this study adopts the ecology term of habitat to define places that are 

potentially visited or enjoyed by citizens as part of their meaningful social encounters.

3.1.2 | Habitat

Habitat is a contested concept in ecology and has rarely been used in the urban context. In ecology, habitat is 

the  subset  of  physical  environmental factors that  a species requires for its survival and reproduction (Block & 

Brennan, 1993). Our approach to the term, within the framework of platial theory, is defined by an understanding 

of humans as social creatures (Toole, de Montjoye, González, & Pentland, 2015) with associated social networks 

(Rutten,  Westlund,  &  Boekema,  2010).  Thus,  this  research  defines  habitat  as  the  places  that  combine  geo-so-

ciological  resources  (e.g.,  workplaces,  homes,  and  shopping  malls)  and  valuable  relationships  between  human 

ACEDO AnD JOHnSOn6  |    

collectives. This definition is based on the overlapping concepts of locale (Agnew, 2011) and SC (Bourdieu, 1984; 

Coleman, 1988; Perkins, Hughey, & Speer, 2002) that, from a structuralist perspective (Bourdieu, 1984; Bourdieu 

& Wacquant, 1992), refer to the relationships between human collectives (Holt, 2008) and the analysis of their 

value to individuals in the settings where daily activities occur (Agnew, 2011). Interestingly, in ecology, habitat 

fragmentation is defined as the spatial discontinuity resulting from a given set of mechanisms and resources that 

affects occupancy, reproduction, or survival in a particular species (Franklin, Noon, & George, 2002). The parallel 

in the urban context refers to the set of material and institutional factors that condition the presence of a local-

ized human population (see Agnew, 2002, 2011). Hence, while home range is conceptualized as a geographical 

continuum that represents citizens’ home, habitat can reveal different spatially disconnected locations but hold a 

shared social infrastructure for a given group of citizens.

3.2 | Operationalizing home range and habitat in the urban context

This study aims to place the ecological notions of home range and habitat in the urban context. In previous sections 

we presented the four main concepts (home, home range, neighborhood, and habitat), contrasting and revisiting 

their nature (spatial and platial). Home and neighborhood are spatial perspectives based on clear defined geom-

etries, while the definition and spatial and platial conceptualizations of home range and habitat are fuzzy or vague 

(Gao et al., 2017; Montello, Friedman, & Phillips, 2014; Twaroch et al., 2019; Winter & Freksa, 2012; Wu, Wang, Shi, 

Gao, & Liu, 2019). From this rationalization, the question naturally arises: how can the concepts of home range and 

habitat be spatially applied within the human context? Both concepts can be partly comprehended as the spatio-

temporal extent of human activities such as the locations of home, job, shopping, and leisure activities. In turn, this 

research aims to focus their conceptualization based on: (1) the human perception and organization of social inter-

actions fostered through the geographic place(s) for habitat; and (2) human attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors 

related to places containing home for the home range concept. Thus, according to the definitions in Section 3.1, 

we derived home range and habitat from SoP (Jorgensen & Stedman, 2001) and SC (Grootaert, Narayan, Jones, & 

Woolcock, 2004; Perkins et al., 2002), respectively. Both the latter concepts can be assumed from attitude theory 

(Acedo, Painho, et al., 2017) and thus can encompass the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions toward 

home  spatial  surroundings  and  meaningful  social  relationships.  Hence,  this  study  gathers  and  characterizes  the 

spatial dimension of SoP and SC to garner the platial perspective of home range and habitat, respectively.

3.2.1 | Data collection

This study uses a WebGIS platform (Acedo, Mendoza, Painho, & Casteleyn, 2017) based on the softGIS meth-

odology (Kahila & Kyttä, 2009; Kyttä & Kahila, 2011) to gather SoP and SC. We chose a WebGIS approach as a 

methodology to reach a broad public (Sieber, 2006) through an online-oriented approach (Brown & Kyttä, 2014). 

Thus, the concepts gathered are artificially forced into geographic primitives (e.g., discrete polygons) that allow 

the implementation of “standard” drawing tools more familiar to users than other approaches (Huck, Whyatt, & 

Coulton, 2014). Similar recent studies have also used this methodology to examine related concepts such as place 

attachment (Brown et al., 2015).

The WebGIS application used in this research combines the web-mapping activity with a series of questions 

related to the spatial features defined (https ://place andci ty.com, https ://github.com/aaced o/place andci ty-back-

end, https ://github.com/aaced o/place andci ty-frontend). We defined a sequence of steps to spatially define and 

characterize SoP and SC. When we refer to the spatial dimension of a notion or to spatializing a concept in this 

research we mean the geographical definition on a map of the area that covers the feelings, thoughts and acts 

toward a place (i.e., SoP) or a social group (i.e., SC). Table 1 shows an overview of the application actions that we

Map

The SoP description is based on Jorgensen and Stedman (2001), the SC on Grootaert et al. (2004) 
(see Appendix A). Once participants have considered what constitutes their SoP and SC, they can 
move to the following step

A place needs to be named to exist (Gieryn, 2000). Participants assign a name to their respective 
areas of SoP and SC (as many as needed). With this step, we wanted to provide an easier concep-
tualization of participants’ SoP and SC notions throughout the process, naming those areas and 
creating an order for the later spatialization

Participants are guided to spatialize each SoP and SC area. In the case of SC, if a given social group 
is not clearly related to a location, the participant can omit its spatialization. Participants spatially 
define each area through spatial drawing tools (http://leafl et.github.io/Leafl et.draw/docs/leafl 
et-draw-latest.html#l-draw-polygon) on a base map centered on Lisbon city without any restric-
tions in terms of scale and location. We tried to accurately conduct respondents throughout the 
WebGIS to increase the accuracy of the mapping activity

Each area defined is rated according to different criteria, and participants are asked to contribute 
their socio-demographic information (i.e., age, gender, profession, and income) at the end of the 
survey

apply for the independent study of SoP and SC. Each of the questions comprised in the WebGIS tool was adapted 

from the literature (see Appendix A).

3.2.2 | Comparing the spatial and platial perspectives

Given the aim of this study of partially understanding the platial nature of the city through home range and habi-

tat, we are only interested in those participants who defined their areas within the Lisbon city boundary (i.e., an 

urban context), whose home is within at least one SoP area (i.e., home range), and who defined both areas of study 

(i.e., SoP and SC for the study of home range and habitat). Based on that, we spatially define the four types of 

data for this study (home, home range, neighborhood, and habitat) based on geographic primitives (i.e., points and 

discrete polygons; see Figure 1):

1.  A  polygon  that  represents  a  participant's  home  range  (HRi  or  HR);
2.  Polygon(s) that illustrate a participant's habitat (Hbni or Hb);
3.  A point that depicts a participant's home (Hi or H); and
4.  Polygons that delineate city continuum neighborhoods (Ni or N).

At the individual level, we compare both perspectives (spatial and platial), analyzing the area of home range regarding 

home  neighborhood,  and  habitat  regarding  the  neighborhoods  identified  for  each  participant.  The  analysis  of  the 

topological relationships between the polygons (home range, habitat, and neighborhood) was performed using the 

database driver psycopg2 (PostgreSQL Python) (http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/) on a relational geo-database man-

aged by PostgreSQL/PostGIS. We extracted all the possible topological relationships (e.g., within, intersect, disjoint) 

that home range and habitat have regarding neighborhood boundaries. At the collective level, we computed all the 

intersected areas grouped by home range and habitat by each pair of participants. That is, we worked on the study of 

all the areas of the same type (home range and habitat) for each possible pair of participants to achieve common areas. 

Once we defined all the possible common areas of home range and habitat, we performed statistical analyses using 

the Python data analysis library Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org). Due to the limited number of participants in each 

area and the nature of the data (ordinal in most cases), we conducted a Kruskal–Wallis analysis based on the ages of 

ACEDO AnD JOHnSOn8  |    

F I G U R E   1  Geographical schema of spatial and platial concepts

all participants per group and the size of the shared area of home range and habitat, respectively. To understand the 

nature of each group (i.e., participants who shared a common area) over the other areas, we carried out chi-squared 

test of independence based on participants’ socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., profession, gender, and income). 

We handled the entire visualization process with QGIS using PyQGIS (https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.0/).

3.3 | Study area

The city of Lisbon has the largest population in Portugal (over 500,000 people) and is the national capital. It ex-
tends over an area of 100 km2. In 2012, Lisbon changed its administrative boundaries, reducing the number of 

parishes from 53 to 24. This change considerably transformed Lisbon's autonomous governments (freguesias) by 

changing their spatial distribution, names, and structures. The current distribution of parishes is shown in Figure 2. 

From  now  on,  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  case  study,  parishes  are  to  be  understood  as  equivalent  to 

neighborhoods. It is worth saying that Lisbon also has informal neighborhoods (bairros), but these are not formally 

defined or taken into consideration as administrative boundaries.

The survey was sent by the municipality of Lisbon (via email) to a database that represents a sample of the 

general adult public that has participated (at least once) in Lisbon participatory processes. They were asked to 

participate in a project led by the city council and a Portuguese university, answering a web map-based survey to 

improve the future participatory processes of the city. Interested participants were redirected (via a link) to the 

WebGIS platform (see Section 3.2.1). In total, 373 people replied to the questionnaire over a two-week period 

(from 12 June to 2 July 2017). From the 373 participants, we drew a sample of 46 respondents for the study of 

home range and habitat. The Lisbon city council was interested in studying the concepts of SoP, SC, and civic en-

gagement. In this study, we are only interested in participants who defined at least one area of SoP and SC within 

the Lisbon city boundary. Furthermore, to be able to deduce  the concept of home range from SoP , we are only 

concerned with participants whose home postal address lies in at least one SoP area. This is why the number of 

respondents greatly decreases: from all the answers received (373), only 46 participants spatially defined their 

areas based on the requirements mentioned. Table 2 shows their demographics.

4.1 | A top-down spatial perspective

For the study of the spatial approach, we depict the four spatial pieces of information about each participant. 

Figure 3 presents the combined spatial and platial representations for all 46 respondents who met the aforemen-

tioned study requirements for selection. The spatial perspective corresponds to participants’ home (magenta star) 

and the parish that contains their home (green polygon border). The platial perspective corresponds to partici-

pants’ home range (blue polygon) and habitat (red polygon(s)).

There is considerable variation in the spatial behavior of each participant regarding both perspectives. For a 

better appreciation of respondents’ home range and habitat, Tables 3 and 4 summarize the information regarding 

the spatial distribution between both platial concepts (home range and habitat) and the administrative boundaries 

that contain them. It is important to highlight the expansion of home range toward other parishes besides the 

home parish. Only 30% of participants defined their home range within their home parish and all those areas are 

in ghr1 (i.e., the home range area occupies less than 25% of the home parish). Participants who have a home range 

that extends over more than one parish also tend to have small areas in comparison with the whole parish. In fact, 

for the majority of respondents (70%), their home range extends outside their home parish.

The spatial relationship between habitat and administrative boundaries (Table 4) follow the same tendency 

as  home  range  when  the  participants  their  habitat  entirely  in  the  home  parish  (all  the  areas  belong  to  ghb1). 

Likewise, all habitats from respondents who have them outside the home parish also define small areas (i.e., ghb1 

areas). Interestingly, those participants who have areas of habitat within and outside the home parish are spread 

in groups 2, 3, and 4. Thus, respondents with significant social relationships within and outside their home parish 

define greater extensions of habitat (see, for example, participant 5 or 40 in Figure 3). Furthermore, participants’ 

habitat is similarly distributed among the three possible spatial distributions of habitat regarding home parish (i.e., 

within, outside and mixed).

4.2 | Toward a bottom-up platial perspective

The platial perspective is based on the concepts of home range and habitat. Both concepts have a close spatial 

footprint  at  the  individual  level.  In  fact,  29  participants  (63%)  had  a  non-disjoint  spatial  relationship  between 

their home range and habitat areas. At the collective level, the non-disjoint spatial relationship between partici-

pants describes different groups on both home range (n = 33) and habitat (n = 21). Figures 4 and 5 show the groups 

formed from the platial commonalities of participants’ home range and habitat, respectively. Each area defined on 

the maps is a shared area for a group of respondents of home range (areas that partially cover participants’ home 

and hold an attachment, identity or dependency for them; Figure 4) and habitat (areas that partially hold meaning-

ful social relations for them; Figure 5).

From  visual  inspection,  both  areas  are  dispersed  around  the  city.  In  general,  habitat  areas  are  smaller  than 

home range. Likewise, while home range is biased by individuals’ characteristics, that is, characterized by the par-

ticipant home (see Section 3.2.2), habitat represents those common places where participants have meaningful 

social  relationships.  Hence,  the  habitat  conceptualization  used  in  this  study  facilitates  a  better  understanding 

of the spatial behavior of individuals, as it is not forced to contain a home location within it, as is the case for 

home range. Indeed, some overlapping between common areas regarding habitat occurs at soccer stadiums (e.g., 

Stadium Jose Alvalade), around some entertainment districts (e.g., Almirante Reis and Cais do Sodré) and some 

parts of the city center (e.g., Baixa). Table 5 shows the relationship between those shared home range/habitat

areas and the parishes they occupy or that intersect with them, that is, it shows the geographic comparison be-

tween the bottom-up spatial connections between participants (platial perspective) and the spatial footprint of 

top-down administrative boundaries (spatial perspective). The areas that appear in Table 5 refer to all the portions 

(regions) of shared areas of both home range and habitat result of the intersection with the administrative bound-

aries (i.e., Lisbon parishes). Eighty-seven percent of the regions occupy less than 25% of the parish that contains 

them. Additionally, all the shared regions of habitat follow this trend, while 17% of home range regions cover more 

than 25% of the targeted parishes. In turn, 17% of the home range areas are within a parish, while the number of 

entire common habitats in the same parish is significantly higher (79%).

The analysis of variance of participants’ socio-demographic characteristics among the different shared areas 

of home range and habitat does not show statistical significance at the 5% level. Both statistical techniques used 

in this study (Kruskal–Wallis and chi-squared test of independence) show that there is not a statistically significant 
difference between the variables (i.e., age (χ2 = 28.81, χ2 = 14.98), profession (χ2 = 85.28, χ2 = 33.69), household 
income (χ2 = 164.52, χ2 = 95.83), and gender (χ2 = 65.54, χ2 = 35.00)) and the different groups of home range 
and habitat, respectively. Thus, we have statistical evidence not to reject the null hypothesis of independence 

between the mentioned variables and groups, that is, groups are independent among themselves based on the 

participants’ socio-demographic characteristics.

In order to further study the resulting areas, we choose one of each type (i.e., home range and habitat) to bet-

ter understand the shape and nature of those platial representations. Figure 6 is the resulting overlapping habitat 

area of 13 participants who have defined meaningful social relationships in a shared zone of Cais do Sodré. The 

latter is a famous nighttime entertainment area of Lisbon. None of the 13 participants lives in the parish that con-

tains the defined zone (Misericórdia), but rather this is the location of some of their important SC. The majority of 

the 13 participants are salaried women from Portugal with a household income per month of 1,000–1,500 Euros.

Collective home range areas are connected with participants’ understanding of their home and surroundings. 

It is important to highlight that Lisbon citizens frequently have in common green areas as part of their SoP (Acedo, 

Santa, Painho, & Henriques, 2018). This finding emphasizes the importance that green zones have for the attach-

ment, identity, and dependence of Lisbon citizens (Acedo, Painho, et al., 2018). Hence, although resulting common 

areas might not cover the specific homes of participants that are linked to the given area, the overlapping part 

represents a piece of the common significant area. For instance, four participants defined a common home range 

within the Campo de Ourique parish (Figure 7). The polygon in Figure 7 represents the common attachment, iden-

tity and dependence that those four citizens have toward this specific location. Those participants limited their 

home range as a part of the parish, specifically, the urban flat continuous area of the parish in which just one of the

Parallels between spatial and platial perspectives of urban organization are an emerging area of study. For exam-

ple, recent research has revised the role of place in GIScience (Merschdorf & Blaschke, 2018) and explores how to 

formalize platial characteristics (Acedo, Painho, et al., 2017; Goodchild & Li, 2011; Papadakis, Resch, & Blaschke, 

2016; Scheider & Janowicz, 2014), how to analyze platial concepts (Acedo, Painho, et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2013; 

Huck et al., 2014; Westerholt, Gröbe, et al., 2018; Westerholt, Mocnik, et al., 2018) and the challenges (Ballatore, 

2016; Goodchild, 2011) of developing representations of place. This study proposes that the platial characteristics 

ACEDO AnD JOHnSOn16  |    

F I G U R E   7  Common home range within Campo de Ourique parish and participants’ socio-demographic 
characteristics. This area defines a common habitat shared by four participants

of a given location, shaped by individuals, can be combined to create collective areas of agreed-upon importance 

for a group. For example, a collection of spatialized representations of SoP related to home location can be used 

to define an area of home range, that is, an area surrounding one's home that represents the cognitive, affective, 

and behavioral needs (Jorgensen & Stedman, 2001) expressed by a group. Additionally, the concept of SC can be 

operationalized to include the urban habitat of a group of individuals, that is, areas where individuals combine 

social resources (e.g., shopping, work) with social relationships. These two concepts, SoP and SC, have clear pla-

tial characteristics (Acedo, Painho, et al., 2018), and do not necessarily respect the spatial layout of cities or the 

top-down imposition of city and neighborhood boundaries. Given this geographic connotation of SoP and SC, we 

propose that cities can be also understood via a bottom-up construction based on platial characteristics such as 

home range and habitat. These platial representations can be used to highlight and uncover new ways of under-

standing the city and its patterns. Within the current discourse on smart cities and, in particular, smart citizens, the 

ability to draw alternate boundaries based on individual and collective preference can provide a strong contribu-

tion to citizen engagement in governance (Johnson & Robinson, 2014; Joss, Cook, & Dayot, 2017). In this section 

we discuss how this collective definition of place can be used as a ’bottom-up’ representation of the city, as a step 

toward building a more responsive, citizen-focused government.

5.1 | The platial representation of city boundaries

This research has found notable spatial variability among individuals’ home range and habitat. It is not surpris-

ing that the home range concept has this variability among the participants since what humans understand as 

home can encompass a wide range of spatial scales (Kasarda & Janowitz, 1974). Likewise, the participant urban 

habitat is slightly more fragmented than home range between parishes in the city, corresponding to a variability 

ACEDO AnD JOHnSOn    |  17

in  homogeneity  depending  on  their  composition  of  various  social  groups  (Putnam,  2000;  Westlund,  Rutten,  & 

Boekema, 2010). Furthermore, at the collective level, the areas of home range and habitat are not aligned with 

Lisbon parishes. This statement is supported by the results regarding collectives’ home range and habitat. A single 

neighborhood or parish is not adequate to cover the home range and habitat of a person, or their collective con-

ceptualization. Nevertheless, our formal participation in the city domain is based on a single spatial administrative 

boundary. For instance, participants’ home range does not cover a large parish area, but is mostly contained be-

tween parishes. Additionally, participants’ habitats are more spread throughout the city, pointing to the suitability 

of overcoming the reductionist case of just studying neighborhood ties in these kinds of investigations (Wellman & 

Leighton, 1979). However, collective habitats tend to be within a single parish, but their spatial footprint is signifi-

cantly smaller than the parish that holds them. These findings show that our commonalities as citizens regarding 

the place where we live or develop our meaningful social relationships are not aligned with jurisdictional bounda-

ries. Moreover, the statistical analyses conducted based on the participants’ socio-demographic characteristics 

show that there is no relationship between the different groups for either home range or habitat.

The  two  examples  provided  in  this  study  show  the  importance  of  understanding  how  people  identify  their 

attachment with physical space (Westlund et al., 2010) and use space in different ways in their daily life. These 

practices shape our social relationships (Simms, 2008), and can be influenced by the dwellers of a place (Bernardo 

& Palma-Oliveira, 2016). It is not a coincidence that people around their forties have defined Cais do Sodré as the 

place of their meaningful social relationships. Cais do Sodré is a historic neighborhood that nowadays is the most 

vibrant nightlife spot in Lisbon, replacing the former harbor quarter (Nofre et al., 2018). The other example based on 

commonalities of home range is situated in Campo de Ourique. This is an old residential neighborhood with exten-

sive street commerce (Alho & de Abreu e Silva, 2014). In fact, the common home range area defined by the four par-

ticipants is a flat and walkable area that represents the core of the neighborhood. Additionally, some studies have 

shown that Campo de Ourique is the best neighborhood in Lisbon in terms of accessibility of its facilities on foot 

(Vasconcelos & Farias, 2012). Hence, it is important to spatially describe platial concepts, but also to understand 

the social and urban landscape of those spaces which are crucial to fully understand their platial representations.

The methodology followed in this study presents a way of understanding cities as overlapping areas of home 

ranges and habitats.  This combination of platial factors can sustain new representations of urban organization. 

Given the importance of civic engagement to the process of city governance (Adler & Goggin, 2005; Robinson & 

Johnson, 2016), there is potential for a platial perspective and definitions to be used to underpin neighborhood 

visioning and development strategies. In particular, we consider how this type of representation may have bene-

fits for realizing some of the promises of open government, that is, a more responsive government, with a better 

connection to residents (Bertot, Jaeger, & Grimes, 2010; Sieber & Johnson, 2015). For example, as a component 

of open government strategies, a government could adopt a platial perspective on interacting with citizens, and 

possibly as an overall framework for the municipal organization of service provision. The defined home range and 

habitat could provide alternate or completely new units of analysis for setting inclusion/exclusion criteria or group 

discussion for citizen participation within both formal and informal planning processes. For the process of city 

planning, the incorporation of a platial perspective and platial groupings, as opposed to solely spatial definitions, 

could have several benefits. Incorporating a platial perspective can facilitate the use of bottom-up, self-generated 

neighborhoods connected by the perspectives and opinions of those (i.e., individuals, communities, civic groups) 

who actually live in them, not superimposed from above by those who govern. Rather than use neighborhood 

definitions, or prioritize citizen perspectives that come from within a certain distance of a particular proposed de-

velopment (for example), citizens could achieve standing with certain issues based on their individual spatialities. 

The use of collective, platially defined groupings has additional importance in a world where communication and 

meanings are often transmitted, but without necessarily having a physically inscribed presence. Simply because 

an individual does not physically travel to a given area of a city (a movement that would be recorded based on 

a tracking study), this does not mean that this area is without importance or that the individual should not have 

standing or be able to influence or comment on the potential value of that place. These platial definitions could be 

ACEDO AnD JOHnSOn18  |    

used to inform or recruit input from broader, more diverse citizen groups, providing a conduit for input for solving 

problems, governing, making master plans and other developments.

The bottom-up perspective presented in this study is based on individuals’ SoP and SC as a preliminary way to 

define shared home range and habitat. Using an ecology parallel, there is not an established boundary (top-down) 

for species, but rather we study their movements and dynamics as a step to defining their home range and habitat. 

We extend this general approach to the human domain, taking individual platial representations on: (1) home and 

individuals’ attitudes toward the space immediately surrounding it (Brown & Altman, 1981); and (2) neighborhoods 

as a segmented, perceptual and relational urban spaces (see Sun & Manson, 2012) to create a collective notion 

of human home range and habitat, respectively. These collective definitions, based on discrete polygons in this 

study, establish the first approximation of representations of areas within a city from a bottom-up, citizen-focused 

perspective.

5.2 | Challenges to government adoption of a platial perspective

Despite the potential benefits for government of adopting a platial representation of the city, it is possible that 

these groupings can in fact create more conflicts between citizens and government. The adoption of a platial per-

spective within city management and decision-making does come with various risks. Traditional forms of civic par-

ticipation are spatially and jurisdictionally bound (Cardullo & Kitchin, 2018; Sieber, Robinson, Johnson, & Corbett, 

2016). For example, voting, that most basic of civic participation actions, is based on residence within a specific 

jurisdiction, and the definition of that jurisdiction is typically accomplished via spatial demarcation of borders (e.g., 

census sections). But with a platial perspective, borders become ill-defined, and indeed open to mixed and diverse 

interpretations. This can create an issue of cross or overlapping definitions of place and neighborhood, complicat-

ing decision-making and delivery of services. The necessity to frame voting in the census section acknowledges 

the need to statistically shape the results. However, researchers have already identified the need for new bounda-

ries that recognize the city interactions based on a socio-geographic approach for social issues (Foster & Hipp, 

2011; Hipp, 2007; Joss et al., 2017). Hence, there is a recognized difficulty in tackling urban issues of different 

nature from the same spatial prism.

Our exploratory study conceptualizes, collects and analyzes complex social concepts (SoP and SC) based on a 

citizen-focused approach. Unfortunately, this type of process is rarely applied to place-related concepts because 

of their dynamic, time-dependent and scale variability. In fact, this study is based on a “spatial frame” at a given 

time (12 June to 2 July 2017) in order to enable the reduction of complex and multifaceted concepts (SoP and SC) 

to geographic primitives (Huck et al., 2014). In turn, this study highlights the spatial dimension of social concepts 

as an important link for relating and framing new connections between and among citizens (Acedo, Painho, et al., 

2017; Mooney, Corcoran, Sun, & Yan, 2012). However, this reduction is not as simple as merging place with its 

spatial  domain  (Westerholt,  Resch,  &  Zipf,  2015;  Westerholt,  Steiger,  Resch,  &  Zipf,  2016;  Westerholt,  Gröbe, 

et al., 2018), but rather to engage citizens in the mapping of complex and multifaceted concepts. The feature of 

these individuals’ spatialities recalls the importance of not anticipating or omitting the singular characteristics that 

an individual and their surroundings possess. An individual can be attached to a place within an administrative 

boundary, but this does not mean that the characteristics of this place are contained within a traditional spatial 

jurisdictional boundary. Characteristics of an individual's spatiality, rather than the topological relationship with 

administrative  boundaries,  is  what  is  taken  into  consideration  to  create  the  collective  meaning  of  home  range 

and habitat defined in this study. Despite the noted limitations of GIScience in representing and understanding 

behaviors and perceptions (Goodchild, 2015), exploratory studies aim to translate academic conceptualizations of 

place theory to an applied domain. We acknowledge the difficulty and criticism in this (see Elwood, 2006), as well 

as the importance of applying longitudinal time series and dynamic data collection, pointing to these issues as a 

limitation of this kind of study and methodology.

The city is not just a space continuum, it is a container for places, experiences, values, and feelings. This study 

addresses the limitations of traditional geographic approaches that represent the city as jurisdictional containers 

(i.e., spatial perspective). Rather, we use the concepts of home range and habitat to reveal the lived experience of 

those people who have actually created much of the meaning associated with that place (i.e., platial perspective). 

We empirically operationalize a bottom-up definition of home places (i.e., home range) and geo-located social rela-

tionships (i.e., habitat) that individuals value, based on attachment, identity, and dependence. Indeed, these platial 

characteristics, home range and habitat, describe the emergent nature of a given place, its flexible and diverse 

construction, and the meaning that citizens of different experiences, backgrounds, and cultures assign to it. We 

propose a complementary approach for municipal governments and urban planners, particularly in the context of 

place-making studies, planning, and participation. Our approach reimagines the current administrative boundaries 

toward alternatives arenas that immaterially cover values (i.e., SoP and SC) and represent a more citizen-focused 

approach. The next step would be to formalize the platial pattern of those alternative arenas to inform studies of 

the social and spatial organization of cities, including the identification and discussion of specific areas of cultural 

and social value, as constructed by individuals, as opposed to being imposed through government, political, or 

other organizations.

Concept

Question

Sense of place (SoP)

We want to know where are the areas that, for 

Jorgensen and Stedman 

Adapted from

(2001)

Social capital (SC)

Grootaert et al. (2004)

some reason/s, are significant for you. Please think 
about the area/s which you: identify the most 
with (e.g., this place represents me) and/or feel 
attached to (e.g., I love this place) and/or depend 
on (e.g., it is the most suitable place for doing the 
things that I enjoy the most)

We would also like to ask you about the groups of 
people or organizations, networks, associations 
to which you belong. These could be formally 
organized groups (religious groups, familiar groups, 
sports teams, workplace groups, …) or just groups 
of people who get together regularly to do an 
activity or talk about things

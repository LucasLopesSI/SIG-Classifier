Space, time, and disease on social media: a case
study of dengue fever in China

Junfang Gong, Shengwen Li, and Jay Lee

Abstract: It is possible to generate real-time and location-by-location data of many types of
human dynamic events based on social media information for the awareness of events in
public health. Analyzing these events is useful in understanding spatiotemporal trends
and patterns of how diseases spread and also provides indications for users’ sentiment
about the concerned disease. This article examines the spatial and temporal patterns of
social media posts based on the content, attributes, and follower activities of posts on social
media. We describe the spatial features of the topic discussed in the posts and the spatial
relationship among comments on the posts. We present models for describing the diffusion
process of these posts and for exploring their spatiotemporal patterns. Our results suggest
that (1) the long-term trends of the topics in users’ views seem to be stable, (2) results from
analyzing follower activities of posts are critical in describing the spatial patterns of the
posts, and (3) the diffusion process of an event in social media is still similar to that of a
traditional information diffusion model. Our findings are useful for understanding social
media and social events. The processes we describe in this article suggest a standard form
of analysis that can be adopted for extracting spatiotemporal patterns of information diffu-
sion and for data mining in social media posts.
Key words: social media, disease, spatiotemporal, topic model.

Résumé : Il est possible de générer des données en temps réel et par endroits de nombreux
types d’événements dynamiques humains fondés sur les informations des médias sociaux
pour la sensibilisation aux événements en santé publique. L’analyse de ces événements est
non seulement utile pour la compréhension des tendances et des modèles spatiotemporels
de la façon dont la maladie se propage, mais elle fournit également des indications sur les
opinions des utilisateurs au sujet de la maladie concernée. Le présent article examine les
modèles spatiaux et temporels des publications des médias sociaux fondés sur le contenu,
les attributs et les activités des abonnés aux messages sur les médias sociaux. Nous
décrivons les caractéristiques spatiales des thèmes abordés dans les publications et les rela-

pour décrire le processus de diffusion de ces publications et pour examiner leurs modèles
spatiotemporels. Nos résultats tendent à démontrer que (1) les tendances à long terme des
thèmes dans les opinions des utilisateurs semblent être stables, (2) les résultats des analyses
des activités des abonnés aux publications sont essentiels pour décrire les modèles spatiaux
des publications et (3) le processus de diffusion d’un événement dans les médias sociaux est
toujours similaire à celui du modèle de diffusion de l’information traditionnelle. Nos con-
clusions sont utiles pour comprendre les médias sociaux et les événements sociaux.

1. Introduction

Over the last few years, much attention in geography and public health has been given
to spatial aspects of outbreaks of diseases in relevant literature (Lowery and Sloane 2014;
Su et al. 2017; Tung et al. 2017; Koh et al. 2018). Progress in the area of geospatial technolo-
gies has led to significant improvements in ways to explore the outbreak, transmission,
and treatment of diseases at both global and local scales. Aiming to promote a healthy
lifestyle by using social media and associated technologies, e.g., geospatial services and
sensor apps, we now have a great opportunity for real-time monitoring of public concerns
for certain diseases and for exploring patterns of the daily activities of such behaviors
(Hay et al. 2013; Raubal et al. 2013).

Dengue fever, also known as the breakbone fever, is a mosquito-borne viral disease
caused by the dengue virus. It has quite a few notable outbreaks in several countries in
recent years. For example, in 2013, there were approximately 2.35 million cases of dengue
fever reported in the Americas alone. Among these, 37 687 cases were diagnosed as severe
(Centre 2014). Early detection of disease activities and a good understanding of their spatio-
temporal patterns could help us to gauge the risk posed by new outbreaks and to relieve the
impacts of both seasonal and pandemic outbreaks of this disease (Ginsberg et al. 2008;
Hay et al. 2013; Li et al. 2017).

This article presents results from a study on an outbreak of dengue fever in China in
2014. We sought to learn from social media posts regarding this outbreak to understand
how the concerns with this outbreak spread spatially and temporally. As a case study, we
focused on mining the texts posted on social media to explore the spatial and spatiotem-
poral patterns of the social media messages related to this outbreak. Specifically, we set
out to address the three following research questions. (1) If social media posts
represent users’ attention and concerns regarding certain issues, how do users discuss
these on social media and how such views evolve over time? (2) How to quantitatively
measure and assess the spatial patterns of social media posts using their location
attributes? (3) What or how could the propagation patterns of such posts proceed across
social media?

To our knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts to examine the spatial patterns
of users’ views on a concerned disease that is based on analyzing follower activities of social
media posts. In addition, our study is also possibly the first study that attempts to under-
stand the diffusion process of concerns for a disease across the social media. As a case study,
this research offers a new perspective to understanding issues in public health by sug-
gesting methods for analyzing related social media information for dengue fever that can
be applied to do the same for other concerned diseases.

The rest of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of spatio-
temporal analysis of discussion topics on social media as related to issues in public
health. Next, Section 3 provides a detailed overview of our data and the analytical meth-
ods used in the study. Subsequently, results from our analyses are presented and dis-
cussed in Section 4. Finally, conclusions, limitations, and future work are presented in
Section 5.

In this era of big data, social media posts with spatial information can be a new goldmine
for exploring geospatial applications of social media and for analyzing the data they gener-
ated. With spatial analysis and visualization methods, social media data enable researchers
to better understand human dynamics such as people’s urban experience (Tse et al. 2018).
Additionally, it can be used to assess behavioral issues such as urban mobility of social
media users during natural disasters (Qu et al. 2011), cultural ecosystem with services provi-
sion (Van Berkel et al. 2018), or the changes in land use patterns of a city as the result of
changing human dynamics (Tu et al. 2017).

Mining the relationship between social media messages and public health issues has
become a much discussed topic and widely applied analysis in recent years. Such discus-
sions include, for example, studies that explored the prevalence of healthy and unhealthy
behavioral patterns of food consumption across the contiguous United States (Widener
and Li 2014), studies that examined individual food environmental conditions and their
impacts on people’s food choices (Chen and Yang 2014), and studies that surveyed people’s
opinions on specific local health policies (King et al. 2013). Because social media data can be
generated and accessed in real time, they can be used for timely spatiotemporal applica-
tions such as the detection of trendy events of a disease (Xu et al. 2017) or the early detection
of epidemics (Velardi et al. 2014). In addition, social media data can support the mapping of
infectious diseases to enable the detection of unique spatial and (or) spatiotemporal
patterns (Breland et al. 2017).

A comprehensive database of confirmed human dengue fever cases (Messina et al. 2014)
could be extremely useful in monitoring emerging or potential outbreaks of these infec-
tious diseases. Furthermore, understanding the spatial and temporal trend of related social
media information is useful because it can assist in the formation of intervention programs
(Milinovich et al. 2014). For example, Twitter data were applied to detect patterns of influ-
enza activities in the conterminous United States (Gao et al. 2018). Moreover, social media
data were also used to identify the population at risk when considering cultural ecosystems
(Richards and Friess 2015). Space–time analytics based on Ripley’s K coefficient and space–
time kernel density estimation have also been used to explore and show the dynamic
trends of reported dengue fever cases (Hohl et al. 2016).

Social media data can be used to support epidemiologic studies if analyzed with spatial
analytical methods. These studies help to assess and map the levels of spatial and spatio-
temporal clustering of the concerns for the disease that support the design and implemen-
tation of intervention programs (Delmelle and Kanaroglou 2015; Kirby et al. 2017), as it was
carried out in a study that applied spatial analysis to detect how dengue fever cases clus-
tered spatially and spread over time (Ye et al. 2016). Emerging from these studies are new
technologies such as those that were developed to monitor the spread of flu in real time,
which led to estimations of possible future trends of influenza (Padmanabhan et al. 2014).
It should be noted, however, that some of these studies have limitations. First, they did
not focus on the evolutional aspects of topic contents in the discussion of specific diseases
in social media posts. This is because the analyses were often based on simply the occur-
rences of social media posts but not on how such discussions change over time.
Furthermore, there often was no specific analysis of the differences between how posts
were followed and how posts were reposted to different social media users. This omission
inevitably ignored the different spatiotemporal trends of how the concerns for different
diseases changed when such concerns spread over social media networks.

3. Data and Method

3.1. Dataset

115

For this study, we collected social media posts on dengue fevers in Guangdong Province
in China from Sina microblogs (http://www.weibo.com). Sina microblogs is a hybrid of
Twitter and Facebook. It is the most popular micro-blogging website in China (Guan et al.
2014). Each posting on Sina microblogs is limited to 140 characters, but it allows attach-
ments of pictures to each post. A blogger on Sina microblogs can be followed just like any
Twitter account or discussion thread in social media. Furthermore, a post on Sina micro-
blogs may be endorsed or favored by its readers, allowing analysis to be carried out to
research how posts on particular topics are being followed and noticed.

Guangzhou, also known as Canton, is the capital and the largest city in Guangdong
Province in southern China. It is a large urbanized area serving as an important hub in
China’s national transportation network. It has an active trading port for international
cargos for over two centuries. As one of the five National Central Cities under direct gover-
nance by the central government, it had a population of 12.7 million according to China’s
2010 census. In terms of its climatic pattern, Guangzhou is in the subtropics, which is a
well-known area for occurrences of dengue fever.

Another dataset of reported dengue cases comes from the Chinese Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CCDCP, http://www.chinacdc.cn/tjsj), which publishes disease
reports monthly. CCDCP reported that there were 14 759 cases of dengue fever cases con-
firmed in the month of September 2014 in China. According to the Guangdong Health
Department, there were 9282 new cases of dengue fever in Guangdong within 10 d, from
22 September 2014 to 31 September 2014. Undoubtedly, Guangdong was one of the hardest
hit cities by the 2014 outbreak of dengue fever. For this reason, Guangdong was chosen as
the main study area for this research. It was used to explore the distribution of the dengue
epidemic in space and time.

3.2. User views in social media about disease

The first step in analyzing social media content was to extract the users’ attention from
posted texts as “topics”. With downloaded microblogs that are related to dengue fever over
the study period, we were interested to find out what topics were being discussed on these
microblogs and whether the topic contents of these microblogs had any spatial patterns.

A “topic” is a subject being discussed in one or more documents (i.e., posts in the case of
this study). Examples for topics include entities such as “Southeast Asia” or news events
such as “reports of dengue fever in 2014, China”. Alternatively, a topic can be a long-standing
subject such as “prevention of dengue fever”. Each topic is assumed to be represented by a
multinomial distribution of words.

The process of extracting topics in post contents was often carried out by using the tech-
nique of text mining, which is known as building topic models (Blei and Lafferty 2009). In
natural language processing and machine learning, topic modeling is a statistical method
that analyzes the words in texts to discover abstract topics (themes) that run through the
texts. Topic modeling also helps to discover how those themes are connected to each other
and how to detect bursting events over time from posts on social media. In this article, we
applied the text mining technique to find the topic contents and their spatial features from
posted microblogs.

3.2.1. Extraction of topics

Widely used for topic modeling, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei and Lafferty
2009) is a generative probabilistic model of topics. It is an unsupervised machine learning
process, which identifies latent topics in many documents (i.e., documents are posts on

Geomatica Downloaded from www.nrcresearchpress.com by UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW on 09/02/19For personal use only. 116

Geomatica Vol. 72, 2018

Sina microblogs in this study). It treats each document as a vector of word counts based on a
“bag of words” method. Each document is represented as random mixtures over latent
topics, where each topic is characterized by a certain distribution of words.

In the LDA model, a document is a sequence of n words, denoted by D = {w1, w2, : : : , wn},
where wn is the nth word in the document. A topic is a collection of M documents denoted
by Z = {d1, d2, : : : , dM}. We calculated the number of documents for each topic based on the
following model:

NumberðziÞ =

pðdijziÞ

XM

ðj=0Þ

where zi is the ith topic, M is the number of documents, di is the ith document, p is the
probability of di belonging to topic i.

The number of topics can be used to discover the distribution of topics. We statistically
analyzed the numbers of topics with different time spans to explore the trends of different
topics that had evolved over time.

3.2.2. Process of the topic model in a microblog

First, raw data in the downloaded format were preprocessed or cleaned. This was done
by removing all html entities (e.g., “&quot;”, “&amp;”, etc.), URLs (words starting with
“http://” of “https://”), and other meaningless words or characters (e.g., “rt” and “@”) from
the downloaded posts. Then, we converted all texts to lowercase texts.

In the LDA topic model, a word can be one or more Chinese characters. A word is also the
basic element in processing social media texts. Unlike using a space to separate different
words in English, there is no space between characters in a word in Chinese written texts.
Chinese words are divided based on semantics. Thus, semantic analysis is an important
and fundamental step in extracting words from microblog contents.

Although stop words occur frequently in microblogs, they are useless for topic model-
ing. These words include common words and words that we specifically wished to ignore,
such as “的” (possessive prepositions: ’s or of, among others), “是” (auxiliary verbs: be, is,
are, was, or were), and others. Thus, these stop words were removed from the texts of all
downloaded microblog posts.

3.3. Spatial pattern of posts and followed activities

A growing number of social media platforms now allow the general public to access and
acquire location information of their users. However, the location attributes (i.e., the exact
geographic coordinates) may not be available for data from all social media posts. In
general, less than 10% of the posts on social media have location attributes attached. This
is because users’ devices may not support the inclusion of location attributes or it could
be due to privacy concerns. Even with such a limitation, researchers in many fields have
successfully applied the location information (however much was available) in their studies
to assess spatial aspects of their works (Achrekar et al. 2011; MacEachren et al. 2011; Tsou
et al. 2013; Chen and Yang 2014; Jiang and Miao 2014; Padmanabhan et al. 2014). Using loca-
tion information of social media posts, it is now possible to construct spatial patterns of
posts on social media that have similar or related content or topics.

There are three types of follower activities in social media: comments, reposts, and
endorsements. Comment activities are posts by users who comment on posts originated
by other users. Repost activities are posts that users post to or share with their own
followers existing microblogs that were originated by other users. Endorsement activities
are praises of existing posts, normally taking the form of users marking some existing posts

117

as their favored or endorsed posts. These three types of activities can be used to assess the
effect of social media posts (Wang et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014). Such assessment is under the
assumption that the more influential a post is, the more times the post would be reposted
or the more comments and endorsements that the post may receive. At the same time, a
user generating many reposted posts can be regarded as an opinion leader or an influential
user. It should be noted, however, that such information has not been used to its full poten-
tial in existing research.

To better use this information, we employed Moran’s index to examine the spatial
pattern of the concerned disease by using followed activities of posts as the attribute data
of the posts. Moran’s index is a widely used method for estimating the degree of spatial
autocorrelation, or spatial dependency, among attributes associated with geographic
objects or events. Two forms of Moran’s index are available, one assessing the global level
of spatial dependency and another assessing levels of localized spatial dependency for indi-
vidual geographic objects or events.

With the localized Moran’s index, the Z scores, which are calculated by the reported
value of local Moran’s index together with their expected values and variances, give the
levels of statistical significance of the index values. As calculated values of Moran’s index
are not symmetrical and are not centered at 0, it is important to calculate the statistical
significance for each Moran’s index value. This statistical significance can be represented
by a Z score that is associated with the index value. The following equation provides the
way to calculate a Z score for each index value (I), its expected value E(I), which is an
expected index value if a spatial pattern is considered random], and the variance of the
index values VAR(I).

ZðIiÞ =

Ii − EðIiÞ
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
p
VARðIiÞ

The Z scores of values of local Moran’s index enable us to estimate the levels of localized

clustering of the microblogs related to dengue fever cases in this study.

3.4. Spatial diffusion pattern

The pattern of spatial diffusion processes can be quantitatively modeled using the
method discussed in Lee et al. (2014). Such a method models, in mathematical forms, the
processes of spatial diffusion by using the nearest neighbor analysis and regression curve
estimation (henceforth referred to as NNA-R). Here, a spatially diffusing process can be
recognized either as a contagious or expansion diffusion process or as a hierarchical or relo-
cation diffusion process. Essentially, this modeling approach assumes that each social
media post regarding the spread of dengue fever is a point in space (as defined by the loca-
tion of the social media user account). Sorted by the temporal sequence, each point enter-
ing the point set will change the average nearest neighbor distance among the points at
that time step. By calculating an average nearest neighbor distance among points, each
time a new point entered into the point set, the average of nearest neighbor distances
and the associated nearest neighbor ratio is recalculated. All such ratios can be plotted
against time to illustrate how frequencies of posts change over time.

The nearest neighbor ratio of a spatiotemporal sequence of points is the ratio of (1) the
observed average nearest neighbor distance among all points at a certain time and (2) an
expected average nearest neighbor distance among all points at that time. The nearest
neighbor ratio is a simple yet powerful spatial statistic.

For this study, NNA-R was used to model the processes of spatial diffusion of the topic
models that were extracted from social media texts. Specifically, it was used in analyzing

the cases of dengue fever posts in Chinese microblogs collected for the study area
(Guangzhou) over the study period (2014).

4. Case Study

We integrated a web crawler and the Sina microblogs API (which was very similar to a
Twitter stream) to obtain the data, as mentioned in Ye et al. (2016). With “登革热”
(i.e., dengue fever in Chinese) as the only search keyword for crawling, we extracted and
downloaded 23 144 original Weibo posts from 1 June 2014 to 9 November 2014 that were
posted by users registered as being in Guangdong Province, China.

4.1. Correlation between new case and related posts

Guangdong Health Department published daily reports on the dengue epidemic,
including those for the period between 22 September 2014 and 30 October 2014. During
this period, dengue fever quickly became a hot topic for discussion among people with
massive social media posts, as well as in TV and radio news broadcasts. The numbers of
posts related to dengue fever peaked on 22 September and then decreased over
subsequent 4 d. The number of posts was at the lowest level on 27 September.
Obviously, the focus on dengue fever in social media was inspired by the awareness of
the disease, possibly due to news from all media outlets in the first 5 d. The number of
posts from 27 September reflected the actual focus by the public regarding the disease
in microblogs. Therefore, we collected the daily numbers of new dengue fever cases from
Guangdong Department of Health and the daily numbers of microblogs on dengue fever
for the period from 27 September to 30 October 2014. The trend of newly reported dengue
cases and the numbers of posts over time are shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1 shows that new
dengue fever cases and the social media posts on dengue fever have very similar curves.
This result is consistent with previous findings from analyzing tweets downloaded from
Twitter (Paul and Dredze 2011).

The dynamic patterns of the newly reported dengue fever cases and social media posts
on dengue fever were also analyzed using curve estimation. The dates were plotted on the
horizontal axis, whereas the number of new dengue fever cases and posts on dengue fever
were plotted on the vertical axis. The temporal duration was from 27 September 2014 to 29
October 2014, with 27 September as the starting date (i.e., n = 0), 28 September 2014 as the
second date (i.e., n = 1), etc. We used SPSS 19 to estimate the curves. The trends of the two
curves are estimated to have the parameters listed in Table 1.

The estimated equations for the trend curves are the following:

Posts on dengue fever∶y = 471.278 þ 52.047t − 3.469t2 þ 0.048t3

New dengue fever cases∶y = 891.11 þ 145.342t − 9.586t2 þ 0.14t3

where y is the number of posts or cases, and t is time.

Curve estimation allowed mathematical equations to be formulated for each process of
spatial diffusion. Such curves are useful to explain how the processes proceeded and to en-
able the extrapolation of the number of posts or new cases at different times beyond the
duration of available data. The figure shows that the numbers of new dengue fever cases,
and the numbers of posts on dengue fever are both best approximated as cubic curves with
similar parametric values over time. The two curves are highly correlated, suggesting that it
is possible to analyze the distribution of dengue fever by analyzing the spatiotemporal
trends of the posts on dengue fever.

4.1.1. Posts topics

The microblog posts that we collected were first cleaned by removing web characters in
the downloaded posts. The next step was to extract Chinese words in the posts. For this pur-
pose, we chose to use NLPIR, a word extractor software, which was developed by Huaping
Zhang at the Beijing Institute of Technology. This tool has received many praises and is
highly respected in the field of Chinese word processing. In 2003, it won the comprehensive
championship of the International SIGHAN Word Segmentation Contest [Zhang H.P.
Chinese Word Segmentation Software (EB/OL) (2013-6-8) http://ictclas.nlpir.org/].

After using NLPIR to process downloaded posts, the Stanford Topic Modeling Toolbox
(Stanford TMT, http://nlp.stanford.edu/downloads/tmt/tmt-0.4/) was used to perform topic
modeling. The Stanford TMT has a built-in feature for filtering out uninformative words
from text corpuses. To correct the fact that standard LDA might not work well with social
media posts because of their short text lengths, the Stanford TMT provided a series of filters
to remove short texts with user-defined rules. We used default settings for the filters to pre-
process the data. The filters removed terms (words) appearing in less than four documents.
We kept only documents with lengths greater than or equal to four words. After this step,
we had 842 valid microblogs. Among these, there were six frequent toponyms (i.e., a word
derived from the name of a place) among those posts. To assess the clustering of toponyms,
the number of topics was set to 3, the number of topic words was set to 20.

Table 2 lists three topics found from the filtering processes. Each topic was labeled using
20 words, which were listed in descending order of frequencies in the extracted microblogs.
The three extracted topics demonstrated the classified discussion topics on dengue fever in
the downloaded posts. Each topic contains several toponyms, which are listed in Table 2.
In topic 1, the toponyms “Chancheng District” and “Shunde District” were two districts in
Foshan city. This city had the second largest number of reported dengue fever cases in
October 2014, according to data from the CCDCP. In topic 2, the toponyms “Chaoyang
District”, “Chaonan District”, and “Xiangzhou District” are parts of Shantou city. Topic 3

primarily focused on disease prevention, which contains names of five places. The toponym
“Southeast Asia” described an upper geographical scale (larger spatial units). The former is a
larger hotspot area of dengue fever in the world, and the last four places were small areas in
different cities in Guangzhou, China.

In short, the toponyms in each city were clustered on the same topics. The other top-
onyms were classified to the third topics. This shows the trend of spatial autocorrection
among discussed content in microblogs.

4.1.2. Topic evolution

Figure 2 shows the topic distribution of the three extracted topics from posts between
24th August and 4th November of 2014. The figure suggests the following two things.
(1) Microblogs peaked at three different times: around 28th August, 27th September, and
25th October. In these time periods, there were many media outlets that reported concerns
for dengue fever, which showed that the traditional media sources had a great effect on the
numbers of social media posts. (2) The curves of different topics were very similar to one
another, which suggest that dengue fever occurrences spanned over a long period of time
and that the users’ focus on dengue fever remained fairly constant throughout the studied
time period.

and 4 November 2014 in Guangdong Province. Specifically, there were 1908 original
Weibo posts, with approximately 8.2% of the posts containing location attributions.
The locations of these microblogs were mainly in Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen,
Zhuhai, and Shantou. The four cities are the largest cities in Guangdong, which also gen-
erated the most microblogs among all provinces on dengue fever during the studied
time period.

We examined the distribution of three types of follower activities in Figure 4.
Figure 4 shows a couple of interesting trends. (1) The number of microblogs on three
types of activities had similar trends. These trends loosely followed Zipf’s Law (Culotta
et al. 2005), namely that the “size”, y, of occurrences of an event is related to the rank, r,
of the location of occurrences of the event among all locations (Adamic 2000).
(2) Microblog users were more likely to comment on a thread of discussion than to perform

other activities such as reposting posts. Consequently, the curve describing the trend of
comments had a better fit to Zipf’s Law than that by other curves.

If an original microblog can be considered as an event and the number of comments on
the microblog could be thought of as an attribute of the event. In that case, locations of
microblogs would be the location attribute values of the events. With that, it would then
be possible to analyze the spatial distribution of microblogs on dengue fever by using the
numbers of comments on those microblogs as their attributes.

To analyze this, the Z scores of localized spatial autocorrelation of the numbers of com-
ments for all microblogs were calculated after a spatial weights matrix based on inversed
distances between posts was constructed. With location attributes of microblogs, each
point (location of a post) is associated with a calculated Z score. Together, all of the Z scores
form a spatial distribution. These locations were interpolated to a raster surface using the
kernel density estimation method as a spatial interpolation technique. The distribution of
the Z scores of local Moran’s index after IDW interpolation is shown in Figure 5.
Compared with Fig. 2, Fig. 5 shows that there are significant spatial clusters in
Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Zhanjiang, and Shantou cities.

4.3. Processes of spatial diffusion

Social media posts on a particular thread of discussion typically spread through a social
network rapidly. The speed and the way posts spread could vary depending on the message
content. As such, understanding the process of how social media posts spread would be an
important step towards devising the means to use the social media to spread news, political
posts, warnings for extreme weathers, or, in the case of this study, knowing how dengue
fever spread so as to design operational intervention programs or treatment programs.
Quantitative modeling of the patterns of the processes of spatial diffusion in the case of social
media content allows us to estimate or predict how such diffusion would evolve over time.

The dynamic distribution of social media posts on dengue fever over time was analyzed
with nearest neighbor analysis and regression curve estimation, which we called NNA-R.

The days when social media posts were generated were treated as a variable x, plotted along
the horizontal axis in Fig. 6. The numbers of social media posts related to dengue fever at
each date were treated as a variable y, plotted along the vertical axis. The curves in Fig. 6
included social media posts from 24 August (i.e., day n = 0), 25 August (i.e., n = 1), and so
on. We used SPSS to estimate the regression curves as listed in Table 3. The results are
shown in Fig. 6a. The curve of time and the number of microblogs related to dengue fever
fit closely to the form of a cubic curve with the highest R2 value and the higher F value
among all estimated curve forms.

This curve shows three phases in the diffusion process of social media posts on dengue
fever. At first, it took more than 20 d for the discussion related to dengue fever to become
a hot topic in microblogs. After this period, which lasted approximately 30 d, many more
microblogs on the topic were posted. Users continued the discussion on dengue fever in
the second phase. Finally, users gradually lost interest in the discussion thread on dengue
fever in the third phase that occurred over the last 20 d. Given that the spread of dengue
fever typically started in late spring and leveled off in late summer or early autumn, the
80 d time period explained the diffusion process very well.

As can be seen in Fig. 6a, the trend line between time or days (horizontal axis) and social
media posts (vertical axis) is not a linear one. Consequently, curve estimation was used to

model this trend. Following the method described in Lee et al. (2014), the frequencies and
locations of social media posts were analyzed by using the nearest neighbor analysis. The
nearest neighbor index values were calculated and plotted against time in Fig. 6b. The curve
in Fig. 6b shows that significance of spatial cluster pattern is high at the beginning,
decreases rapidly with the increasing posts, and finally keeps a flat value after 40 d
(although there were still more cases being reported). Also, the curve was then fitted with
all 12 regression curves in SPSS, as suggested in Lee et al. (2014). The NNA-R analysis used
the trend line between two variables, i.e., time (days) as the horizontal axis and the
numbers of social media posts as the vertical axis, to perform curve estimation. The results
of curve estimation are shown in Fig. 6b. The spatial diffusion curve is the most closely to a
cubic curve with the highest R2 value and F value among all 12 estimated curve forms.
According to Lee et al. (2014), the diffusion process in a microblog was more similar to a
relocation or hierarchical process than to a contagious or expansion diffusion. This finding
explains very well how dengue fever spread as the infectious disease now typically spread
through different population clusters in a hierarchy and modern transportation networks
now often move carriers (human and mosquitos) from one place to another, even over
lengthy distances.

5. Conclusion and Discussion

In this article, we modeled the spatiotemporal trends of public concerns for health
issues with social media microblogs on dengue fever. The concerns were from the perspec-
tive of microblog users with regards to followed activities and the diffusion patterns of such
microblogs. We demonstrated the use of methods for exploring user views and how the
views evolved based on topic modeling. We also demonstrated the applications of methods
for examining spatial patterns of followed activities based on numbers of comments and
reposts and of a method to evaluate the spatial diffusion process based on NNA curve.

We focused on the outbreak of dengue fever in 2014 in China as a case study to conduct
the experiments presented here. The results showed that the topics of user views had sim-
ilar trends over time. Furthermore, the activities of social media showed significant levels
of spatial autocorrelation, suggesting high levels of spatial dependency or clustering.
Finally, the curves of the NNA ratios fitted well to cubic curves, which indicated a common
diffusion process to be a relocation or hierarchical diffusion process.

The methods applied in this study can be used for similar analysis in other regions or on
posts of other social media outlets such as tweets from Twitter. The same techniques can be
applied to other social activities as a standard form of exploratory analysis for detecting and
describing the spatiotemporal patterns of social media posts to enhance data mining in
social media.

The generalizability and the applicability of these results are subject to certain limita-
tions. For instance, a limitation of this study is that LDA model does not work very well
on short texts, possibly including Tweets because of the 140 character limit. For future
research, this study can be expanded to including some comparative analysis between
the results presented here and those from applying other techniques such as SatScan
(http://www.satscan.org) or other methods for calculating spatiotemporal autocorrelation.

The monolithic structure of process-based environmental models has become a
major obstacle in dealing with complex environmental problems. Interoperability
is the inevitable direction for future generations of models. This article discusses the
identification of equation functions for interoperable environmental models. These
equations represent environmental processes that are implemented as algorithms
in the models. The identification of common equations in existing models helps
develop equation components that can be assembled to form customized models.
In the context of a semantic reference system, formal concept analysis is used to
decompose existing models, extract the common equations embedded in them, and
organize these equations in a hierarchy of a concept lattice. The hierarchical
structure of the lattice helps identify the relationships between equations across
different levels and within the same level. Insights drawn from the concept lattice
provide valuable information for the framework design of customized models and
the adaptation of algorithms from existing models for the development of equation
components. An important hydrological process, surface runoff, is used as an
example of an environmental process to illustrate the analysis. To support the
discussion, a customized surface runoff model is built using three components
extracted from several existing hydrological models to predict surface runoff of a
watershed.

Introduction

1.
Process-based environmental models describe the exchange of energy and materials
through space and time, and their impact on the environment. These processes are
characterized according to laws of physics and expressed as mathematical equations.
Typical process-based models include those used in hydrological, atmospheric,
meteorological, climatic, oceanographic, and other disciplines.

Environmental processes are represented at three levels: conceptual, mathe-
level deals with

matical, and implementation (Bekey 1985). The conceptual

concepts of processes in the knowledge framework. The mathematical
level
formalizes these concepts through equations that draw from laws in physics.
The implementation level implements the mathematical formulation into algo-
rithms in models.

At the conceptual level, the knowledge framework of a discipline organizes the
concepts of process into a hierarchy. For example, surface runoff, a fundamental
process in hydrological models, can be divided into two processes at a finer level,
overland flow on hillslope, and stream flow in the channel. Each can be further
divided into more detailed processes at successive levels.

In contrast with knowledge framework at the conceptual level, environmental
models deal with both equations at the mathematical level and algorithms at the
implementation level. Equations represent the processes and are implemented into
algorithms. These models follow the knowledge framework of the discipline, but
implement only a selection of processes according to the intended application
(Friis-Christensen et al. 2009). These models may have their own equations, hierarch-
ical structures to organize the equations, and levels of generalization for these equa-
tions to represent the processes. Certain equations are more widely accepted than
others. For example, of all equations that represent the infiltration process, the
Green–Ampt equation is the most commonly used. It is included in a range of
hydrological models, such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT, Neitsch
et al. 2001), the Water Erosion Project (WEPP, Flanagan and Nearing 1995),
Topography - based hydrology MODEL (TOPMODEL, Beven et al. 1995), Storm
Water Management Model (SWMM, Huber 1995), THALES (a distributed para-
meter rains all - runoff model based on the terrain analysis, named after Thales of
Miletos, a Greek philosopher who recognized the influence of topography on water
movement. Grayson et al. 1995), and many other models. In contrast, other equations
may be used less frequently.

A great number of environmental models have been developed in the past several
decades (Jøergensen et al. 1996, Benz et al. 2001). Many are closed monolithic systems
although only parts of certain models are often needed for a project. In addition, there
has been an increasing level of duplication among these models, especially for those
parts that embody widely used equations. This situation has produced negative
results. Developers of recent models have had to spend a significant amount of time
scrutinizing the details of existing models to determine which parts can be adapted for
the new model. Consequently, many developers prefer to create their own models
because it is often not cost effective to adapt the work of previous modelers. Either the
adopted or the newly created model parts are most likely locked in another monolithic
model system. The monolithic model structure has become a major obstacle to dealing
with increasingly complex environmental problems that are of concern to scientists
and general public.

Ideally, interoperable models would allow functions to be used across the boundary
of individual model systems (Bian and Hu 2007, Chen et al. 2009, Zhang and Tsou
2009). For process-based environmental models, a function may execute a single
equation or a set of equations. Note that the word ‘functions’ is used in the context
of model operation, while the word ‘equations’ is used in the context of representa-
tion. Because this article emphasizes the latter, the following discussion will focus on
‘equations’. Sharing equations between models involves interoperation at both the
technical and the semantic level. Technically, effective tools, such as component-
based modeling (Pfister and Szyperski 1998), have been available to help ‘package’

equations into independently developed, ready to use components. Much like plug-
ging LEGO pieces into an object, these components can be assembled together to
create customized models. Semantic interoperability involves the establishment of
meaning for data and functions and the sharing of the meaning across different
modeling activities. It is the semantic interoperability, however, that is critical to
ensure a meaningful assemblage. The importance of interoperable environmental
process models has been well recognized by both the research community and the
government agencies (American Society of Civil Engineers, Task Committee on GIS
Modules 1999, Interagency Steering Committee on Multimedia Environmental
Models 2001, Yang and Raskin 2009). Presently in its infancy, research in this field
still faces many challenges (Bian and Hu 2007).

Recent research in interoperable environmental models has focused on the con-
ceptual and algorithm design of components (Leavesley et al. 1996, Bennett 1997,
Keller and Dungan 1999, Taylor et al. 1999, Bernard and Kruger 2000, Bian 2000,
Westervelt and Sharpiro 2000, Benz et al. 2001, Villa 2001, He et al. 2003, Bower and
Ludascher 2004, Bian and Hu 2007, Wang and Liu 2009). Few have focused on the
semantic interoperability at the equation level although the equation components are
the ultimate building blocks for any customized model.

This study addresses this issue by identifying the basic equations and their compo-
sition to aid in the future development of components. Based on the concept of
semantic reference system, formal concept analysis (FCA) is used to decompose
existing models and extract the common equations contained in these models. A
central process in hydrological models, surface runoff, is used as an example of an
environmental process to illustrate the analysis.

The remainder of this article begins with a background section (Section 2) describ-
ing hydrological models and equations. Section 3 explains FCA and its application in
extracting common equations in hydrological models. Section 4 describes the proce-
dures of using FCA. Results and major findings are discussed in Sections 5 and 6,
respectively. Lastly, an experiment is discussed in Section 7. It presents a customized
model consisting of three components extracted from existing hydrological models to
predict surface runoff of a watershed.

2. Background

2.1 Hydrological models

Modern hydrological models are typical of process-based environmental models.
Hydrology is the study of the physical processes of water movement, including its
occurrence, distribution, and chemistry. Hydrological models are the mathematical
simulation of hydrological processes on both the land surface and in the subsurface
environment (Maidment 1993). The core concepts of hydrological process include the
hydrological cycle, various hydrological processes that transfer the water in the
hydrological cycle, and the laws that drive these processes. All water is perceived to
be stored in water bodies (reservoirs, lakes, river reaches, etc.), and the water is
moving between them via multiple processes. Basic hydrological processes include
precipitation, infiltration, interception, evapotranspiration, surface runoff (overland
flow and channel flow) and routing, reservoir management, subsurface water, and
ground water. The laws that govern these processes include the laws of conservation,
motion, and thermodynamics.

2.2 Equations in hydrological models

A complete hydrological model includes the processes, the governing equations
behind the processes, the initial and boundary conditions constraining the processes,
and the relationships between the constituents involved in the processes (Shen et al.
2002). This article focuses on the governing equations, including the following specific
laws: (1) mass balance of fluid, (2) mass balance of solid, (3) motion of fluid, (4)
consolidation of the media, and (5) compressibility of water. Like different levels of
processes, these equations can be arranged into a hierarchy of many levels.

There are three types of relationships between the equations. First, some equations
may describe the same process, but across different levels of generalization. For
example, the soil conservation service (SCS) curve number (CN) method describes
the runoff process at a broad level, while the rational equation describes the same
process in much greater detail. Second, some equations describe the same process at
the same level of generalization. For example, both the Green–Ampt method and the
Horton infiltration equation are devised to determine the infiltration rate. The former
is for use in humid areas and the latter is for arid regions. Third, some equations
describe different processes but are at the same level. For instance, the equations to
describe the evapotranspiration and infiltration process are at the same level and are
parallel to one another in a hydrological model.

The knowledge hierarchy and the equation hierarchy can be relatively independent
of each other. On the one hand, a process can be described by different sets of
equations, as either alternatives or as a combination. For instance, the evapotran-
spiration rate could be determined by two alternative types of equations: the energy
balance equation and the mass balance equation. A process can also be described by a
combination of equations, each of which models a part of the process. On the other
hand, the same equation may be associated with different processes. For example, the
lumped runoff equation can be used to describe both overland flow and stream flow.
In other instances, an equation may describe several processes by varying the input to
the equation. Furthermore, certain equations are more widely used than others. For
example, the Muskingum method is used more often for modeling the process of
stream flow routing than other equivalent equations.

Over the last several decades, a large number of equations have been developed for
hydrological modeling. Of these models, a finite number are most frequently used in
practice and most of them are either developed or endorsed by the federal agencies in
the United States (Maidment 1993). These models contained well-developed algo-
rithms that represent accumulated scientific knowledge and time-tested coding. It is
strategic and efficient to respect these algorithms (Bower and Ludascher 2004). The
identification of these common equations and their inter-relationships are a critical
step toward the development of interoperable model functions. Once the common
equations are identified and a hierarchy of these equations is established, the basic and
composite equation components can be developed. This will allow future model
developers to efficiently choose equations and to confidently build customized models
based on the requirements of their environmental projects.

3. Formal concept analysis

FCA is designed for knowledge representation and information management (Wille
1982, 1992). In the past 10 years, FCA has grown into an actively pursued research
topic with applications in many disciplines, such as linguistics, software engineering,

Downloaded by [Northeastern University] at 13:25 20 November 2014 Interoperability of functions in models

661

psychology, artificial intelligence, and information retrieval (Priss 2006). However, the
potential application of FCA to environmental modeling has not been fully explored.
A central notion of FCA is a duality, objects and attributes, called a ‘Galois
connection’ (Priss 2006). The elements of the former are called ‘formal objects’, and
the elements of the latter are called ‘formal attributes’. The adjective ‘formal’ is used
to emphasize that these are formal notions. They are derived from the fundamental
principles of a specific discipline and are widely accepted as a standard conceptual
framework within the discipline, such as the knowledge framework in hydrology
(American Society of Civil Engineers, Task Committee on Hydrology Handbook
1996). Furthermore, the objects and attributes are not restricted to their literary sense.
The ‘formal concept’, often referred to as a conceptual class or category, is a set of
objects and attributes. These objects, attributes, and the binary relationships between
them form a formal context. In this context, the set of attributes common to certain
objects, and the set of objects that own these attributes, can be identified in the process
of FCA (Kavouras and Koklar 2002).

Concepts may be related to each other in a superconcept/subconcept relationship.
Superconcepts are more generalized concepts, and the subconcepts are more specia-
lized concepts. Subconcepts relate to superconcepts in either an ‘is-a’ or a ‘part-of’
relationship. The set of concepts that can be ordered by the superconcept/subconcept
relationship form a class hierarchy called a concept lattice. The use of the concept
lattices method (CLM) is explored in this study to identify basic equations and their
combinations for use in the future development of equation components.

The CLM offers a systematic approach to integrate heterogeneous ontological
systems into a single framework, the concept lattice (Kavouras and Koklar 2002).
An ontological system consists of a set of concepts to express certain knowledge and
the relationships between the concepts. Hydrological models consist of a set of
concepts to describe hydrological processes and the relationships between these
processes, both conceptually and mathematically. In this sense, a hydrologic model
is equivalent to an ontological system. There may be different levels of ontological
systems in a discipline (Guarino 1998). A top-level ontological system provides a
generic concept frame. The knowledge framework of hydrology is equivalent to this.
Application ontological systems are specific and heterogeneous; each may focus on
certain aspects of the knowledge framework with different levels of structures and for
different applications. In this context, individual hydrological models are equivalent
to the specific and heterogeneous application ontological systems. The most basic
equations and their combinations contained in these heterogeneous ontological systems
can be identified and subsequently organized in the concept lattice.

The CLM is used in the context of a semantic reference system (Kuhn and Raubal
2003). That is, a semantic reference system consists of a semantic datum, a reference
frame, and translation functions. The semantic datum provides the basic terms and
their meanings that are used in a discipline. The semantic reference frame is a formal,
application-independent concept structure that organizes the basic terms contained in
the semantic datum. The translation functions project any application-oriented terms
to the basic terms organized in the semantic reference frame such that the application-
oriented terms can be represented uniformly and understood properly. This aspect of
the CLM is emphasized in this study. Specifically, the CLM is used to first decompose
individual models into application-oriented processes, then project these processes to
standard processes and standard equations, and subsequently, identify the common
equations embedded in individual models to identify the basic hydrological equations

S. Hu and L. Bian

and their combinations. The basic CLM steps are explained below before their
application to hydrological models is specified.

The CLM steps involve both processes and equations. Because the focus of this
study is on equation interoperability, the equations are treated as objects, whereas the
processes are treated as attributes. The CLM decomposes heterogeneous ontological
systems into their ‘local’ attributes (i.e. the processes included in individual models
and hereafter referred to as ‘local processes’). These local processes are then projected
onto a set of formal attributes (hereafter called ‘formal processes’ that are standard
processes widely accepted in the discipline). These formal processes serve as the
semantic datum for the local processes, and the projection of the local processes to
the formal ones unifies the representation of local ones. In the mean time, the local
processes can also be projected to a set of formal objects (hereafter referred to as
‘formal equations’ that are standard equations widely accepted in the discipline). The
binary relationship between the formal processes and formal equations can be estab-
lished based on these two sets of relationships, that between the local processes and
the formal processes and that between the local processes and the formal equations.
The resultant binary relationships between the formal processes and the formal equa-
tions establish the Galois connection.

The usefulness of the Galois connection is to reveal sets of formal equations that
represent common sets of formal processes. These formal equations, along with the
associated formal processes, are referred to as ‘new concepts’. These new concepts are
the basic equations and their combinations embedded in the original individual
models. The new concepts are then organized in the concept lattice based on the
inclusion relationship between them. The resultant concept lattice can provide new
insights into the equations and their relationships that were not previously obvious
(Koklar and Kavouras 1999, 2001, Kavouras and Koklar 2002).

The local processes are normally adopted directly from the original individual
models. The formal processes and formal equations can be derived by various
approaches (Kavouras and Koklar 2002). Process-based environmental models can
take advantage of the existing knowledge framework, such as that documented in
Hydrology Handbook (American Society of Civil Engineers, Task Committee on
Hydrology Handbook 1996), to obtain the formal processes and formal equations.

Before further discussion on the application of CLM to hydrological models, it is
necessary to clarify the relationships between the definitions of the two fields. The
terms used in CLM and their equivalents in the hydrological models are listed in
Table 1.

The following section illustrates the CLM steps to identify the basic equations and
their combinations for processes and to construct a concept lattice for these equa-
tions. The hydrological process, surface runoff, is used as an example to illustrate the
analysis.

4. Application of CLM to identify common equations

Surface runoff is a process that represents all waters flowing on the surface of the
Earth in response to precipitation as either overland flow or channel flow (Maidment
1993). Six hydrological models that contain detailed runoff processes are selected for
this study. These are EPIC, SWAT, WEPP, CREAMS, MIKE SHE, and PRMS
(Appendix). These models are widely used and have evolved over a long time, thus
providing a comprehensive representation of runoff. Equations extracted from these
models are deemed representative and are potentially useful to a broad user
community.

Only the surface runoff section of each model is used for the following analysis.
Five steps are entailed to apply the CLM for the identification of the basic equa-
tions and their combinations embedded in the six models. These steps involve (1)
establishing the formal processes; (2) decomposing individual models, extracting
local processes from the models, and projecting them to the formal processes; (3)
projecting local processes to formal equations; (4) relating formal processes to
formal equations; and (5) identifying the new concepts from the formal-equation
and formal-process duality and constructing the concept lattice. The goal of these
procedures is to develop a hierarchy to organize the formal equations and their
associated formal processes, which could provide valuable information needed to
build customized models. Each step is described in the following section.

4.1 Establish formal processes

The formal processes are derived from the Hydrology Handbook (American Society of
Civil Engineers, Task Committee on Hydrology Handbook 1996), which documents
the knowledge framework of hydrology and is widely cited by the hydrologic model-
ing community. Based on hydrology principles, the surface runoff can be further
divided into four second-level processes and 12 third-level processes. These processes
are listed as follows with the third-level processes in parentheses (Table 2): overland
flow (lumped overland flow, surface storage, inter-rill flow, rill flow, and overland flow
routing), stream flow (lumped stream runoff, stream flow routing, bank storage, trans-
mission loss, and evaporation loss), water body routing (reservoir routing), and surface
runoff routing (lumped surface runoff). The 12 third-level processes are most basic and
can no longer be subdivided. They are used as the formal processes for the subsequent
analysis.

4.2 Relate local processes to formal processes

The runoff sections of the six hydrologic models are first decomposed into local
processes based on the model structure described in the manual for each model
(Appendix). These are the processes at the finest level of detail in a model. Then,
each local process is examined as to whether it is equivalent or contains any of the 12
formal processes described in the previous step (see the top row in Table 3). The
equivalence or containment is determined based on the descriptive and mathematical

definitions of the processes in the manuals. These models may use different local terms
(see second column under ‘Element’ in Table 3) to describe the same or a similar
formal process. For example, the MIKESHE model uses ‘loss through riverbed’
instead of transmission loss to describe the same process. If a local process in a specific
model is equivalent to or contains a formal process, a cross sign ( · ) is given at the
intersection of the local and the formal processes. This step projects the local pro-
cesses to the formal processes.

4.3 Relate local processes to formal equations

Also referenced in the Hydrology Handbook (American Society of Civil Engineers,
Task Committee on Hydrology Handbook 1996), eight equations representing sur-
face runoff are selected as the formal equations. These include SCS CN, kinematic
wave method, rational equation, modified pulse routing, Muskingum, linear storage
routing, mass balance, and empirical methods. Based on the manuals of the six models,
the local processes are linked to these formal equations (Table 4). Because of the
relative independence between the process hierarchy and the equation hierarchy
(Section 2.2), a local process may relate to any number of formal equations, while a
formal equation may be used to describe several local processes. If a formal equation
is involved in describing a local process (in second column of Table 4) in a specific
model, a cross sign ( · ) is given at the intersection.

4.4 Relate formal processes to formal equations

Based on the results from Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, if a formal process and a formal
equation are both related to a same local process in a model, the link between the
formal equation and the formal process is given as a cross sign (Table 5). This table is
critical for the intended analysis, which shows the Galois connections between formal
equations and formal processes.

The table identifies the set of processes that use the same single equation. Each row
is such a set. Of these sets, certain processes are included more frequently than others

and they can be identified through intersections of the single-equation sets. For
instance, the intersection of the sets corresponding to g1 and g2 reveals a new set
(g1, g2, m1, m4, m5, m10). Processes m1, m4, m5, m10 are common to both sets and
equations g1 and g2 are associated with these processes as alternatives. Similarly, the
three-set intersection corresponding to g1, g2, and g3 generates a new set (g1, g2, g3,
m5, m10). The resultant set of processes (m5, m10) is common to three sets in the table
and the three equations are associated with these two processes, as alternatives or in
combination. The intersection reveals the set of equations that is used to describe a set
of common processes. This information is implicit in the original models.

4.5

Identify common equations and construct concept lattice

New concepts are derived from Table 5. These include both the single-equation sets
and the intersected sets. The latter is derived through all n-set intersections (n = 2, 3,
. . ., 8). Because this study is intended to identify the basic equations and their
combinations, the new concepts are hereafter referred to as ‘new combinations’.
These new combinations are organized in a concept lattice according to the inclusion
relationships between them (Table 6). The intersected set (g1, g2, m1, m4, m5, m10)
described above is the new combination C4, and (g1, g2, g3, m5, m10) is C5 in Table 6.

5. Hierarchy structure of common equations

Table 6 includes 14 new combinations, organized into five levels (Table 6). The
graphic form of this concept lattice is displayed in Figure 1, along with definitions
of the formal processes (m1, m2. . .m12) and the formal equations (g1, g2. . .g8). C1,
which contains no formal equation and all 12 formal processes, is not a meaningful
new combination in itself. New combinations containing a greater number of formal
processes are placed at a higher level, such as C2 and C3 at Level 2. The combinations
with a smaller number of formal processes are at a lower level, such as C7, C9, C11,
C12, and C14 at Level 5, each containing only one formal process. The arrows
indicate
to the
subcombinations.

super- and subcombination relationships and point

the

The level of placement is determined by the inclusion of formal processes. If a set
of formal processes contained in a new combination includes the entire set in
another new combination, then the former is the supercombination of the latter,
and the latter is a subcombination of the former. For example, the new combination
C2 at Level 2 is a supercombination to C4 at Level 3 because the formal processes
contained in C2 (m1, m4, m5, m10, m12) include the entire set of formal processes in
C4 (m1, m4, m5, m10). Similarly, C4 is a supercombination of new combinations C5
and C6 at Level 4. The super- and subcombination relationships do not have to be
between two successive levels, as long as a supercombination is at a level higher than
its subcombinations. For example, the new combination C3 at Level 2 is a super-
combination of C8 at Level 4. Dashed line arrows indicate the relationships across
more than two levels.

6. Discussion

The concept lattice in Figure 1 shows the associations between the formal equations
and the formal processes embedded in the original individual models. These associa-
tions reveal the most typical applications of these equations in hydrological modeling.

The hierarchical structure of the lattice helps identify the relationships between
equations across different levels and within the same level. Insights drawn from the
concept lattice provide valuable information to help design the framework of custo-
mized models and to adopt algorithms from existing models to develop equation
components. Several such findings are discussed below, in terms of implications of the
vertical, horizontal, and pairwise structure of the lattice.

6.1. Vertical structure

The vertical levels of the lattice indicate the degree of comprehensiveness of the
equations in terms of the range of processes they represent. The combinations at a
higher level are useful to represent a broader range of formal processes. The combina-
tions at a lower level are more specialized for certain formal processes.

At Level 2 (the actual top level), the two formal equations g1 (SCS CN) and g2
(kinematic wave method) associated with C2 (g1, m1, m4, m5, m10, m12) and C3 (g2,
m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m10), respectively, are the most comprehensive ones. For
example, g2 can be used to describe seven processes by altering certain inputs to the
equation. These include surface storage (m1), inter-rill flow (m2), rill flow (m3), lumped
overland flow (m4), overland flow routing (m5), lumped stream runoff (m6), and stream
flow routing (m10). Not only do both g1 and g2 dominate the processes at the top
levels (Level 2), they are also involved in processes across all four levels (Figure 1)
because of the broad range of processes that they represent. This information helps
prioritize the development of the equation components. The most commonly used
equations, such as SCS CN (g1) and kinematic wave (g2) method, should be given
high priority in the development processes.

From Levels 2 to 5, the equations at each successive level tend to be less comprehen-
sive and more specific in terms of the range of processes represented. At Level 5 (the
lowest level), formal equations in C7, C9, C11, C12, and C14 (Figure 1) only focus on a
single process, overland flow routing (m5), bank storage (m9), stream flow routing (m10),
and reservoir routing (m11), respectively. The two formal equations g4 (modified pulse
routing) and g7 (mass balance) are unique to Level 5. The formal equation g4 is
specifically for stream routing and g7 is for the routing of stream and water bodies.
This information is very useful for developing specialized equation components.

Furthermore, from Levels 2 to 5, an increasing number of equations may be asso-
ciated with a single process. For example, in C9 (Level 5), four formal equations g1
(SCS CN), g2 (kinematic wave method), g3 (rational equation), and g5 (Muskingum) are
involved to describe one formal process, m10 (stream flow routing). These equations are
linked with each other in various relationships, such as spatially or temporally sequen-
tial or in parallel to describe a process. In addition to helping develop equation
components, this relationship information can contribute to the meta-information for
the components. In this context, the meta-information describes a component, such as
what it is, what it does, how it is produced, and what components it may be related to.
As mentioned previously, a number of super- and subcombinations are in non-
successive levels. In addition to the aforementioned C3–C8 example, C10 (g6, m9,
m11) at Level 4 is not a subcombination of any in Levels 2 and 3. Instead, it is across
two levels to be associated with C1 in Level 1. One implication is that there are not
many comprehensive equations available to describe the formal processes m9 (bank
storage) and m11 (reservoir routing) in C10 except g6 (linear storage routing), because
the equations are more comprehensive toward the top level. Formal processes m9 and
m11 can only rely on specialized equations such as g6. The vertical structure of the
concept lattice sheds light into the design of a framework for customized models and
the development of individual equation components.

6.2 Horizontal structure

The equations and their combinations at the same level may show variations in the
level of generalization and emphasis. For example, C2 and C3 at Level 2 may differ

Downloaded by [Northeastern University] at 13:25 20 November 2014 674

S. Hu and L. Bian

from each other. From the modeling perspective, C2 is dominated by a lumped
equation g1 (SCS CN) and does not include details of overland flow (m1, m4, m5,
m12) and stream flow (m10). C3, on the other hand, is dominated by Equation g2,
which represents seven detailed processes of overland flow and steam flow, as
described previously. This variation in a same level provides options in the develop-
ment of customized models, depending on the intended application and expected level
of detail. For example, g1 would be a better choice for empirically oriented models.
Otherwise, g2 is the best option for a process-based model.

Furthermore, combinations of equations at the same level have distinct focuses.
Taking Level 4 as an example, equations in C6 focus on routing, those in C8 center on
lumped stream flow, those in C10 are specifically for reservoir management, and those
in C15 emphasize the overland flow routing process. This information helps establish
meta-information on the intended application for the equation components, espe-
cially when a set of specialized equations may be associated with a single process.

6.3 Pairwise structure

Within two pairs C11 and C12 in Level 5, equations are related to each other as a set
and subset. In other words, Equation g7 in C11 (g7, m11) is a subset of those in C12
(g6, g7, m11). This means that there are two options to represent m11 (reservoir
routing) depending on practical situations. Option one is to only use g7 (mass balance).
Option two is to consider either g6 (linear storage routing) or g7 in the representation
of the same process. This information revealed by the concept lattice is especially
useful when the modelers are facing a large number of choices.

The significance of applying concept lattice method in hydrological modeling is
obvious. First, the method provides a hierarchical view of common equations used in
hydrological models and the basic processes represented by them. The hierarchical
structure of the lattice, both vertically and horizontally, provides a framework for the
design of customized models. The association of the equations with the processes,
either broadly or specialized, individually or in a set, is an asset to develop standard
functions for interoperable hydrological models. The relationships between the equa-
tions can be adopted as part of the meta-information of the equation components.
Though specifically for hydrological models, these implications can be readily
extended to other types of interoperable process-based environmental models.

Second, the advantage of the standard functions is that each can model a single or a
limited set of processes at a time. It allows the functions to be verified and modified
individually based on the observation data without changing the streamline of the
model. This is much more efficient and effective than to verify whether an entire
monolithic model will provide appropriate results.

Third, the concept lattice analysis presented in this study provides the possibilities
and opportunities for model developers from disciplines other than hydrology to
select proper functions in their models, if provided with minimal training and
involved with straightforward modeling tasks. The construction of complex models
may involve a number of additional considerations. If time and budget are limita-
tions, simple comprehensive equations (e.g. g1 SCS CN), rather than detailed equa-
tions (e.g. g2 kinematic wave method), may be chosen to build a simple model. Of
course, just as a LEGO player needs as many LEGO pieces as possible to build an
ideal object, more standard functions will always help advance the interoperability of
hydrological and even broader environmental models in the future.

7. Experiment

The purpose of the experiment is to demonstrate the interoperability of functions in
surface runoff based on the analysis in previous sections. The experiment implements
a three-component customized model to predict surface runoff of Brodhead
Watershed in northeastern Pennsylvania. Three sets of equations are extracted from
three existing models to develop the three components. These components represent
three basic processes required to predict surface runoff. The watershed and data, the
three processes, the three sets of equations, the development of the three components,
and the prediction results are detailed below.

7.1 Watershed and data

Brodhead Watershed is a typical medium-size watershed with a drainage area of 730
square kilometers. Located in an east-coast humid temperate environment in north-
eastern Pennsylvania, Brodhead Creek is the main stream of its watershed with many
tributary streams draining into it. All runoff converges at the outlet of Brodhead
Creek and subsequently enters into the Delaware River. Historically, the watershed
has provided high-quality drinking water for local residents and served as an ideal
habitat for cold-water fish. In recent decades, the watershed has experienced rapid
urbanization, and man-made surfaces have replaced forests and fields. These changes
have greatly altered the hydrological processes of the streams and increased flood risk.
Three 100-year floods have affected the watershed in the past 4 years. An under-
standing of the flood potential has become an immediate concern of the local com-
munities. The magnitude, location, and timing of surface runoff in the watershed are
of particular importance for flood assessment and are modeled in this project over a 4-
month high-flood period.

A USGS gaging station is located at the outlet of the Brodhead Watershed. Daily
precipitation and daily runoff discharge of the watershed were collected at the station
between July and November 2007. Information on other environmental character-
istics of the watershed, such as soil type and land use, is also available. The data on
precipitation, soil type, and land use are needed to model surface runoff, and the
observed runoff data are used for model validation.

7.2 Processes and equations

Of all processes involved in runoff (Table 2), three are considered most appropriate
for the intended modeling. These include lumped overland flow (m4), overland flow
routing (m5), and steam flow routing (m10).

The first process, lumped overland flow, occurs in the initial state of surface runoff.
It is the generation of water flow on hillslopes. The flow includes rill flow and inter-rill
flow. (These two are often represented as a lumped single process.) The overland flow
is measured by depth (mm) and volume (m3) of accumulated water at the land surface.
Once the flow moves down slope, the second process, overland flow routing, begins.
This process describes how the generated overland flow routes through the land
surface and eventually converges at the base of hillslopes before it enters the stream.
The routing is represented as the peak flow rate (m3/sec). The third process, stream
flow routing, takes place when the overland flow enters the stream channel. This
process describes how the water flow overcomes the resistance from irregular river
channel and sediments and finally reaches the outlet of a watershed after the steam

S. Hu and L. Bian

flow routes along the stream network. The routing is represented as the daily average
of discharge rate (m3/sec) of surface runoff at the outlet of the watershed (Brutsaert
2005, American Society of Civil Engineers, Task Committee on Hydrology
Handbook 1996). The behavior of runoff during the modeling period is usually
displayed in a hydrograph that is the plot of runoff discharge with respect to time.
Of the three processes, generic modeling of the first and last is adequate, while detailed
modeling is required for the second process.

Three equations are selected to represent the three processes. SCS CN (g1) is used to
represent the lumped overland flow process (m4), kinematic wave method (g2) for the
overland flow routing process (m5), and Muskingum (g5) for the steam flow routing
process (m10). As shown in Figure 1, SCS CN is one of the most typical equations
used to describe lumped overland flow. The empirically oriented approach used in this
equation is most appropriate for the intended modeling. Kinematic wave method is a
common choice for modeling overland flow routing. Its process-based and detail-
oriented approach is most useful to provide a detailed assessment of flood, including
the magnitude, location, and timing of the peak flow when it propagates through the
watershed. Muskingum is typically used to model stream flow routing. It can provide
reasonably accurate estimates for mild to steep sloping channels, thus meeting the
need of this study.

The three equations are extracted from three different hydrologic models, EPIC,
WEPP, and SWAT, respectively, for the customized model. Although the six models
share some common sets of equations, none include all three equations needed.
Equation SCS CN is extracted from EPIC to represent the lumped overland flow
process. EPIC is an empirically oriented model. The generic and straightforward
treatment of SCS CN in EPIC is compatible to the intended modeling of overland
flow. Kinematic wave method is extracted from the WEPP model to represent the
overland flow routing process. WEPP has the most detailed treatment of the overland
flow routing process, thus most suitable to the needed level of detail for this project.
The Muskingum equation in SWAT is used to simulate steam flow routing. SWAT
combines both empirical and process-based approaches, and its treatment of the
Muskingum equation is most appropriate for modeling the last process. The three
equations extracted from the three models are implemented as three components, as
described below.

7.3 Component development

Component development involves two major parts, the components content and the
interfaces associated with each component (Pfister and Szyperski 1998, Kirtland 1999).
Users only interact with the interfaces when selecting and integrating components to
build customized models. The interfaces provide meta-information about a component,
including the identification of the component, data and functions that the component
produces, and the data and functions that the component requires to produce.

For this project, three functions are implemented as equation components to model
the three processes, one function for each process. The basic meta-information for the
three functions is listed in Table 7. It includes the component name, the process being
modeled, the input required, and the output produced by the component. The
components are implemented in C++, following the specifications of COM+. The
hydrologic processes are represented as objects. The processing of inputs, executing
the equations, and producing the output are treated as methods of the objects.

For demonstration purposes, the meta-information used in this study is confined to
the most basic. A full set of meta-information may also include information on spatial
temporal scale, process, and model development (Bian and Hu 2007). Spatial tem-
poral scale includes information on spatial extent and temporal duration, and spatial
and temporal resolutions. Information on process refers to entities, processes, and
relationships between them. The information on model development concerns with
model validation and referencing. The meta-information helps evaluate the compat-
ibility between components, select the appropriate ones, and integrate them to build
customized models. This information is most useful when dealing with a large number
of components and selecting and integrating components in an automatic or a
semiautomatic environment.

7.4 Model results

Using the precipitation data in the Brodhead Watershed as the initial input, the
surface runoff of the watershed is modeled using the three-function customized
model. Results are displayed in Figure 2. The three functions connect well, and with
routine calibration, the modeled runoff matches well with the measured runoff.

This experiment illustrates the flexibility and effectiveness of interoperable func-
tions for environmental models. Its advantages are obvious during the modeling for
the study watershed. Users can select appropriate functions and ‘plug and play’
according to specific modeling needs. The functions can be adjusted and calibrated
individually to achieve desirable results. If data are available, these functions can be
validated individually for further improvement. These advantages can significantly
improve the efficiency and accuracy of environmental models.

8. Conclusions

Interoperable process-based models are without doubt the direction of a future
generation of environmental models that offer the flexibility and efficiency required

to meet a wide range of needs. This study uses the surface runoff process in hydro-
logical models as a case study to demonstrate how to identify standard functions for
use in developing customized interoperable models.

One tendency in environmental modeling is to develop integrated multidisciplinary
models in order to address complex issues, such as bio-geo-chemical, hydro-eco-
morphic, and social-economic-environmental models. This study illustrated that
concept lattice method is a powerful tool to identify common functions and their
associated processes. Combined with component-based modeling techniques, the
standard functions developed in different disciplines can be integrated to construct
complex multidisciplinary models.

To achieve the ultimate intra- and interdisciplinary interoperable models, there
remain several research challenges and associated technical steps. These research issues,
at least, not completely, include the creation of meta-information for function compo-
nents and the evaluation of the compatibility between components. The meta-
information includes a range of information, such as the relationships between equa-
tions as discussed in a previous section. The most critical meta-information includes the
identification of a function component, the processes it models, the input it requires to
perform, and the output it produces. This meta-information is essential to evaluate
whether a pair of components can be assembled together or whether any pairs of
components can be placed in a same model. Technically, algorithms need to be devel-
oped or adopted to generate function components and the interfaces associated with
each component. These interfaces, where the meta-information resides, are required for
the communication and integration between components. Based on the evaluation of
the meta-information, appropriate function components can be selected and assembled
into a customized model. The two research issues (meta-information and compatibility)
and their technical development depend on the identification of standard function
components, as discussed in this article. The findings in this study are one of the critical
steps on the journey toward developing interoperable environmental models.

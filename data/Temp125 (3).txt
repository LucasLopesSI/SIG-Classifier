Abstract
Researchers’  fame  in  most  scientific  fields  is  closely  linked  to  their  publishing
capacity, both in terms of quantity and quality. In GIScience, as in other fields, this
situation  demands  that  the  researcher  evaluate  and  to  be  very  familiar  with  the
scientific journals in which they could publish. Some specialized journals (e.g. Journal
of Citation Reports or JCR) are devoted to ranking these reviews according to various
methods  and  criteria.  Compared  to  other  scientific  communities,  GIScience  is
relatively new and constantly evolving. Therefore, the journals of this field do not
benefit  from  any  real  formal  ranking  yet.  The  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  present
the  process  and  results  of  a  study  aimed  at  addressing  this  gap.  More  specifically,
the challenge is to elaborate an importance ranking of the scientific journals in the
field  of  GIScience.  To  do  so,  both  a  qualitative  (Delphi  study  carried  out  with  40
international  experts)  and  a  quantitative  (JCR  impact  factor)  approach  has  been
implemented.  This  triangulation  method  leads  to  an  early  global  ranking  of  the
journals of this field.

production  is  an  important  evaluation  criterion  during  the  “tenure  track” period,  as
well as for potential promotions. This production is evaluated not only on the quantity
of  their  published  works  (for  instance,  the  number  of  papers  published  per  year),  but
also on their quality (awards for the best papers, personal invitation to publish, etc.), as
well  as  on  the  way  these  publications  impact  their  area  of  expertise  (particularly  the
modus operandi
frequency with which articles are quoted) (Dubois and Reeb 2000). This 
also  implies  an  evaluation  of  the  scientific  journals  in  which  researchers  publish  their
results. Consequently, in both applied science and humanities, these journals are being
classified  according  to  various  criteria,  based  on  various  methods.  Specialized  journals
are dedicated to this task, such as the Journal of Citation Reports (JCR), which is one
of the most respected by the international scientific community.

Numerous  research  studies  have  tackled  these  issues  of  evaluating  and  ranking
scientific journals (Garfield 1972, Hamilton and Ives 1980, Tijssen and Van Raan 1990,
Gillensen  and  Stutz  1991,  Hardgrave  and  Walstrom  1997,  Moed  et  al.  1998,  Dubois
and  Reeb  2000,  Rousseau  2002).  These  works  have  facilitated  the  evaluation  of  the
specific  contribution  of  each  journal  regarding  the  dissemination  of  research  results
within the scientific community, as well as the structuring of communities of practice.
It  is  now  clear  that  the  issue  of  evaluating  and  ranking  scientific  journals  is  an
important  one.  Yet,  in  some  relatively  new  fields,  this  type  of  ranking  is  still  quite
informal.  This  is  particularly  the  case  in  GIScience.  As  far  as  it  is  known,  journals
related to GIScience have not been subject to any formal evaluation. No overall evaluation
exists  enabling  prioritization  of  the  scientific  journals  in  which  researchers  from  our
community publish their works. These journals, however, do not have the same impact
on the dynamic of this specific field, and on the transfer of knowledge between GIScientists.
Some studies have been carried out in the related field of geography, the most notable
of which are Gatrell and Smith (1984) and Lee and Evans (1984, 1985). These studies
are interesting as some of the journals already ranked in the 1980s are still respected by

de facto

Without  venturing  into  any  epistemological  analysis  of  GIScience,  we  assume  that
 a community of specialists and scientists who do care about the issues
there is 
related  to  the  formalization,  analysis  and  use  of  geographical  concepts  and  data  (e.g.
University  Consortium  for  Geographic  Information  Science  (UCGIS),  Association  of
Geographic Information Laboratories for Europe (AGILE)). The GIScience community
has been developing for more than a decade (Goodchild 1992, Hendriks 1998, Ottens
1999,  Caron  2000,  Fryrear  et  al.  2001,  Murayama  2001,  Gatrell  2003).  According  to
Bruno  Latour’s  (1987)  analysis,  GIScience  as  described  in  Goodchild  et  al.  (1999)  is
more  and  more  considered  to  be  a  special  field.  Therefore,  on  the  basis  of  this  very
active community, we wish to identify, then evaluate and rank the journals considered
as being related to GIScience by the practitioners of the field.

Evaluating  the  specialized  journals  in  GIScience  is  highly  relevant  because  it  will
give  a  clearer  picture  of  how  papers  contribute  to  the  advancement  of  knowledge
(Gatrell  and  Smith  1984).  This  evaluation  will  also  identify  trends  that  lead  to  the
development  of  research  policies  (Wilson  1985),  and  that  characterize  the  scientific
community (identification of the sub-domains, possible differentiation of the researchers’
behaviors according to their type and age, etc.) (Lanegran 1992). The improvement of
the  comprehensive  knowledge  about  the  GIScience  literature  also  offers  to  junior
researchers, early in their careers, the possibility to identify which journals are the most

relevant to publish in. Furthermore, depending on their publishing strategy, this knowledge
allows them to target selective and prestigious journals or ones that are not too demanding
(Hamilton and Ives 1980, Dubois and Reeb 2000).

It is with a view to improving the knowledge of the GIScience-specialized literature
that  we  have  carried  out  this  study.  The  objective  is  to  offer  a  preliminary  formal
ranking  of  the  scientific  journals  in  GIScience.  To  do  so,  we  chose  a  methodological
1
, qualitative
approach focusing on both quality and quantity. First of all, a Delphi study
and  consensual  by  nature,  was  carried  out  on  nearly  40  international  experts  of  the
field. Then, the results obtained were consolidated, using triangulation and comparison,
with quantitative approaches (particularly the JRC impact factor).

First  we  develop  a  contextual  framework  by  providing  an  update  on  the  major
scientific journal ranking schemes. Then, we explain the methodological approach, and
more  particularly  the  implementation  parameters  of  the  Delphi  study.  Finally,  we
present  the  results  and  the  consequent  ranking.  We  conclude  with  the  limits  and
perspectives of this research.

2 Research Conceptual Framework

2.1 GIScience in Action

Before building up a ranking system of the GIScience journals, it is necessary to identify
all  the  journals  in  this  area.  Therefore,  a  major  precondition  is  to  define  the  current
boundaries of GIScience. Yet, this is a very difficult task since, reciprocally, the decision
of considering whether or not each journal is a part of GIScience and contributes to the
very  definition  of  the  field.  Bruno  Latour’s  works  offer  in  this  context  an  interesting
framework  (Latour  1987).  He  believes  that  publications  and  journals  fully  participate
in  the  actors’  network,  on  which  scientific  fields  develop.  Consequently,  whatever  the
difficulty,  proposing  a  reading  and  understanding  grid  of  this  actors’  network  means
contributing to a better understanding and definition of GIScience.

What does GIS mean? GIS tools, systems or science? : This is the type of questions
on  which  the  scientific  community,  involved  in  geographic  information  research,  has
been focusing for over a decade (Chrisman 1999, Pickles 1997, Wright et al. 1997, Mark
2000, Schuurman 2000). Our purpose is not to continue this epistemological debate, but
rather to emphasize how much this community is alive, how much this new “discipline”
or “science” is going through a very rich development period. Whether this dynamism
confers on this discipline the status of science or not is hard to say, but it surely highlights
the researchers’ strong will to formalize its basic concepts and to define its boundaries.
The  last  decade  has  been  particularly  rich  with  discussions  that  fostered  the
progressive emergence of a (more or less) shared vision of GIScience. Numerous forms
of  research,  and  numerous  positions  have  been  proposed  since  the  Spatial  Data
Handling conference  keynotes  presented  by  Michael  Goodchild  in  Zurich,  July  1990,
and then in Brussels, April 1991, during the EGIS – European GIS conference (Schuurman
1999). In 1991, Jean-Paul Cheylan also developed the GIScience concept in an editorial

followed  (e.g.  Gagnon  and  Coleman  1990,  Gagnon  and  Bédard  1994).  In  1993,  the

Discipline dedicated to the management of spatially referenced data, and thus
relies  on  the  scientific  concepts  and  technologies  implied  in  the  acquisition,
storage, analysis, and distribution of the data (Bergeron 1993).

The  first  attempts  to  formalize  GIScience  plead  for  their  recognition  as  a  full
scientific discipline. This reasoning emerged out of a strong distinction between GIScience
and  GIS  software,  and  went  even  beyond  the  debate  “tools  versus  system”  that
animated the community at the beginning of the 1990s. Michael Goodchild (1992) gave
no formal definition of GIScience, but he clarified the scope of this field by identifying
its  main  characteristics.  One  of  the  first  definitions  was  proposed  by  Frank  (1992):
GIScience  addresses  the  spatial  representation  of  the  data  allocated  to  represent  a  part
of the Earth’s surface.

The  1990s  provided  a  wealth  of  thoughts  and  debates.  The  book  coordinated  by
John  Pickles  (1995)  is,  in  this  regard,  a  significant  contribution  to  the  reflections  on
which  GIScience  developed.  A  few  more  papers  on  that  subject  were  published  during
this period (Pickles 1997, Wright et al. 1997). The “critical GIS” stream arose around
the  same  time,  and  was  widely  supported  by  the  publications  (articles  and  research
reports)  produced  through  the  National  Center  for  Geographic  Information  Analysis’s
(NCGIA’s)  Research  Initiative  19.  The  Varenius  project,  which  followed  the  NCGIA’s
International Journal
initiatives, began with the publication of a series of papers in the 
  but  for
of  Geographic  Information  Science
sciences
, as was the case for other journals that were renamed as the GIScience concept
emerged). In the introduction of the Varenius project, Goodchild et al. (1999) devoted
a large part of their article to marking the boundaries of GIScience, to define, but also
to justify their relevance to scientific, societal and technological influences.

GIScience deals with the fundamental issues resulting from the creation, processing,
storing, representation, distribution and use of geographical information. That is to say,
and  as  Goodchild  et  al.  (1999)  also  specified  it,  the  terms  geomatics,  geoinformatics,
spatial  information  sciences  can  be  considered  as  synonymous.  A  recent  definition
posted  on  the  Geographic  Information  Science  Center  at  the  University  of  California-
Berkeley  website  (see  http://www.gisc.berkeley.edu/about/whatisgis.html  for  additional
details) supports this statement:

GIScience  has  recently  emerged  as  the  field  where  problems  of  data  capture,
encoding,  storage,  analysis,  retrieval,  synthesis,  and  dissemination  of  geographic
information are studied. These problems have increased in significance as new
computer-based  technologies  such  as  geographic  information  systems  (GIS),
digital  remote  sensing  (RS)  and  Global  Positioning  Systems  (GPS)  evolve.
GIScience is the foundation upon which these GI technologies are built.

Inspired by the above, we marked the boundaries of GIScience as they have developed
for  the  last  two  decades,  and  as  they  are  considered  today.  We  decided  to  adopt  this
formal  and  operational  definition  of  GIScience  through  all  the  current  study.  On  this
basis, we constituted the initial corpus of journals for the Delphi study (section 3).

The  previous  timeline  briefly  emphasizes  the  dynamics  of  GIScience  development
and  underlines  the  significant  role  of  publications  and  journals  in  the  formalization  of
this scientific discipline. They are crucial in communicating ideas within communities of
scientists,  because  of  the  concepts  and  ideas  they  explicitly  formalize  through  their
names (which often change as the discipline evolves), and finally because of the way they

journal evaluation and ranking methodology chosen here is so important, not only for
the  development  of  this  still  relatively  new  field,  but  also  as  an  active  component  of
GIScience in action.

2.2 Journal Ranking Methodologies

The  ranking  approach  elaborated  here  required  the  development  of  a  conceptual  frame-
work, built on the basis of an analysis carried out to identify the main priority-ranking
methods for scientific journals. The criteria being used are variable: some are quantitative,
some are qualitative; some rely on statistical or bibliometric methods, or on qualitative
evaluation processes. Singleton (1976), in his work dealing with the ranking of physical
sciences  journals,  proposed  bringing  all  of  these  methods  together  into  three  major
approaches: the analysis of journal article citations; scientists’ assessment of journals in
their field of study; and the evaluation of the size or productivity of the journals.

Science Citation Index

The  first  approach  adopts  the  analytical  techniques  dedicated  to  the  citations
published  in  journal  articles.  The  “impact  factor”  of  the  Journal  of  Citations  Report
(JCR) is surely the most common quantitative evaluation process for citations (Rousseau
2002). This approach made clear the fact that the quality of scientific journals is linked
to  the  impact  factor,  a  term  created  and  used  for  the  first  time  in  1963  by  Eugene
 at the beginning of the 1960s. Amin and
Garfield, founder of the 
Mabe  (2000)  underlined  that  the  value  of  the  impact  factor  is  directly  affected  by  the
research field at stake, the type and size of the journal, and may fluctuate over time for
some journals (Gillenson and Stutz 1991). Amin and Mabe (2000) also mentioned that
the “impact factor” is not only a means to describe the impact of journals on the scientific
literature  of  a  specific  field,  but  it  is  a  strong  measurement  process  for  the  ranking  of
scientific journals, yet this type of indicator should only be used independently for each
discipline.  Some  secondary  journals  in  one  specific  field  may  be  primary  journals  in
another  field.  This  type  of  approach  was  developed  by  Gatrell  and  Smith  (1984)  to
assess  the  relationships  between  22  geography  journals.  In  this  study,  the  authors
calculated how many times journal articles were cited by other journals.

The  second  methodological  approach  relies  on  the  researchers’  judgement  and
appraisal  (often  qualitative)  of  journals  in  their  own  field.  It  may  have  to  do  with  the
“freshness” or mean elapsed time between the submission of an article and its publication,
or with the calibre and recognition of the members appointed to the peer reviewers or
an editorial review board. It may also be related to the review process itself (anonymous
or  not),  or  with  the  calibre  of  the  journal.  Hamilton  and  Ives  (1980),  Gillenson  and
Stutz (1991) and Walstrom et al. (1995) focused on assigning a rating to various journals
with  the  help  of  a  numerical  scale.  For  instance,  Hamilton  and  Ives  (1980)  asked
experts in information system management to systematically score the relative importance
of  journals  in  related  fields.  Their  results  revealed  that  the  experts’  perception  is
very important. Katerattanakul et al. (2003) went even further, asking academics to
give their opinion about the relative value of computer science journals via a series of

questionnaires.  Formal  techniques  have  also  been  developed  to  assess  researchers’
perceptions towards journals in their field of study, for instance: Koong and Weistroffer
(1989) in management information systems (MIS) and Dubois and Reeb (2000) in inter-
national  business.  Following  this  approach,  Sutter  and  Kocher  (2001)  measured,  over
10 years, the fluctuating recognition of economics journals so as to establish an overall
ranking through time.

The third methodological approach relies on the quantitative evaluation of the size
or  productivity  of  journals.  Many  indicators  are  used:  number  of  readers,  number  of
articles  submitted,  number  of  articles  accepted,  number  of  issues  sold  (or  delivered),
diversity  of  the  subject  fields  covered,  etc.  For  instance,  Todorov  and  Glaenzel  (1990)
developed  a  journal  ranking  method  on  the  basis  of  computerized  bibliometric
techniques. The journals were organized by speciality areas, relying on the measures of
dispersion (or of concentration) of the subjects treated. Closer to our own field, Lee and
Evans (1984, 1985) used this approach to rank 34 geography journals according to the
“The growth
number of issues delivered. In this regard, Lanegran (1992) mentioned that 
in the number and circulation of geographical journals has led to speculation about their
prestige and impact

”.

So, in many disciplines, studies have been carried out to establish scientific journal
operational rankings. In disciplines closely related to GIScience, issues relating to journal
ranking  have  also  been  tackled.  For  instance,  Brancheau  et  al.  (1996)  determined  the
critical issues with regard to information systems. Sabrin (2002) developed a classification
of the academic institutions offering information systems training in the United States.
Walstrom et al. (1995) dealt with the ranking of information systems conferences. Yet,
nothing of the kind formally exists in GIScience.

Centre  National  de  la  Recherche  Scientifique

Granting agencies, or research institutions themselves have a true interest in possessing
such a ranking system, since publications still constitute today one of the major criteria
to evaluate researchers (obtaining grants, tenure and promotion, etc.). For instance, the
  (CNRS)  launched  in  2004  an
French 
action  to  assess  the  place  and  influence  of  French  journals  dedicated  to  human  and
social sciences at the international level. An inquiry based on the impact factor principle
was  then  started.  Finally,  18  disciplines  were  chosen,  and  the  journals  were  analysed
between 1992 and 2001. This analysis ranked 125 journals in three categories: (A) very
highly  rated  international  journals,  (B)  highly  rated  international  journals  and  (C)
national audience journals. This ranking is now a basis for the evaluation of researchers
and French laboratories.

3 Description of Methodological Approaches

We  believe  that  an  intersectional  approach  could  strengthen  the  ultimate  outcome;
consequently we have opted for a methodology integrating the first and second approach.
The  first  step  is  mainly  based  on  the  Delphi  method  (Loo  2002).  The  rationale  for
choosing  this  qualitative  and  consensual  method  was  two-fold:  the  appropriateness  of
being  directly  in  contact  with  the  researchers  in  a  still  young  and  developing  field;
and  the  lack  of  quantitative  data  relating  to  GIScience  journals  (with  particularly  few
journals mentioned in the JCR). This step allowed us to generate a consensus as well as
an  initial  ranking  of  GIScience  journals,  so  as  to  better  interpret  the  results  obtained
with the Delphi.

GIScience Journals Ranking and Evaluation

3.1 The Delphi Method

The  Delphi  method  has  been  the  subject  of  many  studies  in  various  fields:  health
(Demeyrick  2003),  information  systems  (Brancheau  et  al.  1996,  Schmidt  et  al.  2001),
banking (Bradley and Stewart 2003), and marketing (Mitchell and McGoldrick 1994).
Yet, in GIScience, this method of investigation has not been used extensively (Roche et
al. 2003, Péribois et al. 2005). Consequently, before going further, it is useful to review
some of the elements relating to this approach. There are several variants (Linstone and
Turoff 1975, Mitchell and McGoldrick 1994, Brancheau et al. 1996). We have chosen
Loo’s method (2002), which appears to be the more straight forward one. Loo (2002)
identifies four major steps: (1) define the problem; (2) select the participants; (3) determine
the size of the sample; and (4) conduct the iterative surveys of the Delphi method.

Kaynak and Macaulay (1984) underscored the fact that the Delphi method is used
in  response  to  a  situation  or  a  phenomenon  rather  than  to  test  hypotheses.  That  is  to
say, the Delphi method is efficient at explaining a problem or defining a situation, rather
than  assessing  the  relationships  between  hypotheses.  Therefore,  we  consider  that  it  is
well adapted to develop a GIScience journal ranking methodology.

General approach.

 Successive questionnaires are sent to a targeted group of experts
on  a  given  theme,  until  a  consensus  on  the  questions  posed  is  reached.  This  method  is
used to establish a consensus of opinion on a more or less quantitative specific subject.
It allows the researchers to predict, develop and explore the attitudes of a group, as well
as their needs and priorities (Jairath and Weinstein 1994). Iterations allow for feedback
from one survey to the other. Usually, three iterative surveys are enough to complete the
study (Duffield 1988).

Jury.

 The Delphi study is directed by a small group of jurors. The members of the
jury are not chosen at random but selected according to their subject matter knowledge
(Deitz 1987).

Expert.

 The definition, the choice and the maintenance of anonymity of the experts
are the key elements of a Delphi study. They prevent personal opinions from leading
the  study.  Moreover,  anonymity  stimulates  ideas,  as  well  as  observations  without  any
pressure of external factors or from pairs (Goodman 1987).

Group of experts.

 The constitution of the group of experts is critical to the rigor of
the  Delphi  study  (Linstone  and  Turoff  1975).  The  chosen  respondents  must  be  repre-
sentative  of  the  group  and  be  familiar  with  the  discipline  or  issue.  The  constitution  of
the group of experts in the present study is mainly based on Martino’s (1983) theories.
In some specific fields, experts are too few in number to be chosen randomly. There is
no formal rule regarding the size of a group of experts (Linstone and Turoff 1975, Loo
2002). Martino (1983) proposes a rule of thumb: a group of 15 to 30 experts is necessary
for  a  heterogeneous  population,  where  a  group  of  5  to  10  experts  is  enough  for  a
homogeneous  population.  To  test  a  medicine,  a  heterogeneous  population  will  consist
of physicians in an academic health-science centre, whereas a homogeneous population
will consist of specialist physicians in cardiology, for instance.

Limitations/Sources  of  error.

  The  Delphi  method  does  not  escape  criticism.  Sackman
(1975),  and  then  Woudenberg  (1991),  raised  a  series  of  questions  about  the  scientific
bases  of  the  Delphi  method,  whereas  ample  scientific  evidence  clearly  demonstrates  its
usefulness. Linstone and Turoff (1975), Martino (1983), and Loo (1997, 2002) confirmed
the good performance of the Delphi technique, but also specified the precise criteria that
are  required  to  ensure  efficiency  and  exactness.  Constituting  the  group  of  experts  and

determining  the  sample  size  are  particularly  important  criteria.  Choosing  experts  form
different geographical locations, or confirming the experts’ reputation through informal
discussions  is  also  essential.  Based  on  successful  research  outcomes,  Mitchell  and
McGoldrick  (1994),  Blow  and  Sprenkle  (2001)  and  Bradley  and  Stewart  (2003)  all
agree.  In  order  to  mitigate  the  limits  of  the  Delphi  method, Dootson  (1995)  suggested
adopting a triangulation approach, using other complementary methods as well, which
is adopted in the present study.

The  sampling  of  experts.

  The  sampling  process  of  experts  is  non-probabilistic  in
nature, since the individuals are not chosen randomly. Sacks (2000) mentioned that the
more  qualitative  studies  typically  imply  small  samples,  and  enhance  the  sample  repre-
sentativeness  rather  than  its  size.  We  used  Martino’s  (1983)  guidelines  to  gather  a
homogeneous group.

In  this  study,  the  experts  were  chosen  from  a  thorough  study  of  the  peer-review
journals  in  the  fields  of  geomatics,  geography,  geographical  information  systems,  and
other related disciplines. We listed all the Internet sites of these scientific journals so as
to  identify  the  members  of  their  respective  editorial  boards.  This  identification  took
place  over  a  period  of  several  weeks.  Based  on  an  initial  population  of  1,110  experts
reported  in  the  editorial  review  boards,  a  first  sample  of  174  experts  was  drawn.  This
filter was carried out according to the following criteria: experts serving on at least two
editorial review boards and with an expertise in GIScience. The group includes selected
experts from all over the globe.

3.2 Constitution of the Initial Corpus of GIScience Journals

First, an initial listing of GIScience journals was compiled. The sampling process, used
to generate this basic corpus from the Delphi study, is non-probabilistic since the jour-
nals were not chosen at random. More specifically, we have mainly used the following
information sources:

•

Journal  of  Citation  Reports  2003  –  Social  Sciences  Edition,  Institute  for  Scientific
Information (ISI), Thomson Scientific, Philadelphia, microfiches.

• A selection of journals from the lists of the following sources : http://www.crg.ulaval.ca/
revues/revues.asp (June 2002), http://www.geomatique.georezo.net (June 2002), and
http://www.forum-pggq.com/liens/index.asp?section=10 (June 2002).

• Research  guide  2002–2003,  Business  Administration  Department,  Université  de

Sherbrooke.

, reduced the corpus of 121 journals identified
An initial sorting, produced by the jury
at the beginning in the sources mentioned above, to 84 journals. After the first iteration of
the Delphi study, scientific journals that were region-based or unknown to most experts
were removed, as well as those published in languages unfamiliar to the experts, or those
whose content was not relevant to the definition of GIScience adopted in this study.
After the experts’ suggestions and the jury deliberation, the list of scientific journals,
used  from  the  second  iteration  of  the  Delphi  study  with  regard  to  the  classification,

majority  is  Anglophone,  i.e.  most  of  them  come  from  North  America  and  Western
Europe.

3.3 Comparison with Other Measurement Approaches

To  validate  the  classification  resulting  from  the  Delphi,  we  have  compared  it  with  the
JCR  impact  factor.  Only  some  of  the  journals  listed  in  the  Delphi  appear  in  the  JCR,
Institute
which  limits  the  comparison  to  only  some  of  the  classified  journals.  The  ISI
for Scientific Information) JCR multidisciplinary database offers statistical data used to
assess how significant publications are in various fields. Two versions are available:

  (

JCR Web Science Edition
JCR Web Social Sciences Edition

: 5,000 leading international scientific journals
: 1,600 key international journals

The impact factor is a quantitative measure of the frequency with which the articles
in a particular journal of a given field have been cited, compared to the other journals
of the same field. The impact factor is defined as follows:

The average numbers of times recent articles in a specific journal were cited in
the JCR cover year. For JCR impact factors recent articles and those published
in  the  two  years  preceding  the  JCR  cover  year.  There  are  other  ways  of
calculating journal impact (Garfield 1972).

The impact factor is calculated by dividing the total number of citations published
during  the  previous  two  years  by  the  total  number  of  articles  published  in  those  two
 is 2.448,
years. For example, the impact factor of the 
resulting from the following calculation:

American Political Science Review

– Number of citations in 2002: 123
– Number of citations in 2001: 152
– Number of articles published in 2001: 50
– Number of articles published in 2000: 46
– (123 + 152)/(50 + 46) = 235/96 = 2.448

The comparative approach used here consists of determining whether the sorting
in  descending  order  of  importance  resulting  from  the  Delphi  also  corresponds  to  a
descending impact factor.

4 Methodology Used in This Study

4.1 Questionnaires

A questionnaire was developed for each round of the Delphi (Appendices 1–4), and was
4
.
then distributed iteratively to the experts. The questionnaire was produced in English
To  ensure  a  good  understanding  of  the  questionnaire,  pre-tests  were  conducted  before
each  iteration  on  the  jury  of  the  Delphi  and  researchers  from  the  GeoBusiness  Group
(Université de Sherbrooke) and the Center for Research in Geomatics (Laval University).
Furthermore, a definition of “GIScience” was included with the questionnaire, in order
to make clear the boundaries of this particular field. To facilitate the experts’ work, the
questionnaires  were  developed  using  a  four-level  classification  of  journals  (Faculté
d’administration 2002):

– Level 1: journals ranking in the top 15% of their field
– Level 2: journals ranking between 16% and 50% of their field
– Level 3: journals ranking between 51% and 100% of their field
5
– Level 4: journals that are not part of the first three categories

When an expert had difficulties classifying some of the journals in one of the four
categories,  this  person  could  indicate  “unknown”  rather  than  a  number  from  1  to  4
(Hufnagel and Conca 1994).

An identical analytical method was used between each survey. The jury studied the
results  and  made  certain  decisions,  such  as  discarding  some  redundant  journals,  and
then developed a questionnaire for the next survey. Each questionnaire listed the jour-
nals in alphabetical order to prevent the experts from being influenced by a presentation
of  the  journals  in  descending  order  (which  may  have  led  them  to  concentrate  on  the
evaluation of each journal individually).

4.2 First and Second Rounds

In August 2003, we sent an e-mail to the 174 experts of the original group. These
e-mails  included  a  customized  introductory  letter,  as  well  as  the  first  questionnaire
(Appendix 1). A first reminder was sent three weeks after the initial message, but only
to 140 experts, for some e-mail addresses were invalid and certain experts had already
accepted or refused to participate in the study. Most of the refusals were on the ground
of lack of time, or because some of those contacted were deemed insufficiently qualified
with regards to GIScience. Thirty-seven experts (21%) answered the first round.

With the first questionnaire, the experts’ mandate was two-fold: to comment on the
relevance of each of the 84 journals appearing on the list, and to suggest adding missing
journals (Appendix 1). The following choices were offered: to decide whether a journal
should  remain  or  be  removed  from  the  list  for  the  second  round,  or  to  make  no  com-
ment  if  the  expert  believed  they  did  not  have  the  necessary  knowledge  to  judge  the
journals  or  to  include  additional  journals.  At  the  end  of  the  first  round,  the  experts’
suggestions and comments enabled the jury to correct and enrich the original list.

Twenty-eight  additional  journals  were  proposed  by  the  experts  during  the  first
round  (Table  1).  Once  the  analysis  and  screening  (number  of  experts  who  suggested  a
journal,  relevance  of  the  journal  regarding  GIScience  and  breadth  of  the  journal),  the

six  following  journals  were  added  by  the  jury:

Moreover, updates were proposed, because some journals had changed their names

The  second  round  took  place  from  November  2003  through  January  2004.  Its
process  was  the  same  as  the  first  one,  both  in  terms  of  questionnaire  and  outcome
measures.  It  included  two  reminders  over  a  period  of  a  month.  Out  of  the  37  experts
contacted  during  the  second  round,  only  28  answered  the  second  questionnaire

(Appendix 2). This questionnaire required the experts to proceed in the same way as for
the first round, but then, they also had to propose a first classification for each journal.
To conclude this second round, the jury had once more, and using the same method, to
decide about the new journals added, as well as about the journals that the experts could
not make up their mind, whether they should remain on the list or not.

4.3 Third and Fourth Rounds

The  third  and  fourth  rounds  took  place,  respectively  from  February  2004  to  March
2004, and from April 2004 to May 2004. Both rounds followed the same patterns and
included two reminders over a period of a month. The questionnaires distributed to the
experts  during  both  rounds  are  very  similar  (see  the  questionnaire  of  the  third  round,
Appendix 3).  Both  iterations  have  the  same  goal,  namely  to  request  each  expert  to

classify  each  journal  according  to  the  categories  ranging  from  1  to  4.  Unlike  the  first
two  rounds,  these  last  two  were  no  longer  offering  the  possibility  to  add  or  remove
journals from the list. Each expert had two pieces of key information at their disposal
to  proceed  to  a  classification,  that  is  to  say:  (1)  their  own  evaluation  of  each  journal
during the previous round and (2) the group of experts’ average rating of each journal.
The  fact  that  each  expert  could  have  access  to  the  average  rating  given  by  the  group
represented  an  opportunity  to  be  influenced.  The  expert  could  then  maintain  his/her
evaluation  for  each  journal,  or  follow  the  overall  opinion,  so  that  a  group  consensus
could be achieved progressively and anonymously.

In  fact,  27  experts  answered  the  third  iteration,  whereas  at  the  end  of  the  fourth
and  last  iteration  they  were  down  to  26,  which  corresponds  to  a  net  response  rate  of
14.9% (26/174). This rate is very good and in line with expectations, since the literature
forecasts  a  15%  response  rate  for  Delphi  studies  (Linstone  and  Turoff  1975).  The
erosion of the group of experts after each round is a consistent characteristic of Delphi
studies,  the  average  desertion  rate  usually  reaching  10%  to  40%  (32%  in  our  study).
The  distribution  of  experts  by  country  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  study  is
summarized  in  Table  2.  The  large  majority  came  from  Northern  America  (50%)  and
Western Europe (27%).

The  various  iterations  of  a  Delphi  are  complete  only  when  a  final  consensus  is
reached. Therefore, for the third and fourth rounds, the jury had to decide whether the
iterations should stop or continue. With regard to our study, four rounds were carried
out, which is in line with the development standards achieved by a Delphi study, which
usually consists of three to six rounds (Bradley and Stewart 2003, Linstone and Turoff
1975).

In order to determine accurately the achievement of a consensus, the jury measured
the stability factor (Scheibe et al. 1975) during the third and fourth rounds. For a given
iteration, the stability factor is the ratio between the total of units changed (in this case the

differences between the answers given for each journal in two successive questionnaires),
and the number of participants (the total number of experts in a given iteration). This
calculation  gives  a  percentage  change,  which  should  remain  below  15%  to  have  the
consensus achieved.

Table  3  shows  the  classification  obtained  at  the  end  of  the  fourth  iteration  of  the
Delphi. This ranking reveals a consensus among the experts contacted (for comprehensive
results, see Appendix 4).

5 Analysis and Triangulation of Results

Once the final results of the Delphi were obtained, we proceeded with the second part
of the study, namely the comparison with the JCR impact factor. To do so, we produced
a  table  comparing  all  the  journals  of  the  Delphi,  ranking  them  from  1  to  3  that  were
mentioned in the JCR (Table 4).

Table  4  indicates  the  JCR  Rank  in  its  main  field  for  each  journal  analysed,  which
enables  the  calculation  of  the  ranking  percentage  for  each  of  those  journals.  For
instance, the Applied Geography journal ranks 25th among the 35 journals listed in the
field “Geography”, that is to say 71st out of 100. Within a categorization ranking from
1 to 4, a ranking of 71% based on the JCR data corresponds to a level 3. Out the 44
journals ultimately classified from the Delphi, the same journal ranks 34th, which also
corresponds to a level 3. It is, thus, easy to make comparisons between the Delphi and
JCR approaches.

We have been able to compare nearly 50% of the journals from the Delphi (21/44).

Based on the analysis of these 21 journals, we can say that for:

57%: both classifications coincide
43%: both classifications do not coincide, but out of these 43%:
20%:

the ranking resulting from the Delphi is just above the one calculated from
the JCR;
the ranking resulting from the Delphi is just below the one calculated from
the JCR.

23%:

Consequently  we  can  conclude  that  there  is  a  match  between  the  classification
resulting from the Delphi and the one compiled from the JCR (57%). When there is no match
(43%), the ranking given by the Delphi is equally just above or below the one resulting
from the JCR. On that account, the triangulation of the Delphi results and the JCR data
confirms the classification obtained. Therefore, we believe that, in regard to the 44 journals
the  international  experts  consensually  classified,  the  Delphi  constitutes  an  innovative
and sound methodology to determine the importance of the journals in GIScience.

The final ranking, built on the basis of the Delphi and confirmed through a trian-

gulation with the JCR, is presented in Table 5.

6 Conclusions

The classification, developed in a rigorous qualitative manner (Delphi method), has been
corroborated  by  a  quantitative  approach  (JCR).  Consequently,  the  resulting  overall
ranking helps to correct a deficiency in GIScience.

Indeed, there are limits to these results. First of all, the group of experts contacted
is over-represented by residents from North America and Western Europe. Generalization
to  the  whole  international  community  is,  thus,  precarious.  For  instance,  how  relevant
these  results  would  be  to  Asia,  especially  China?  Moreover,  we  did  not  carry  out  an
analysis  aimed  at  determining  in  detail  the  experts’  specialized  fields  of  expertise.
GIScience is characterized by a large variety of disciplinary backgrounds and expertise.
These  specializations  could,  if  the  case  arises,  challenge  the  representativeness  of  the
group. For example, what could be the impact on the classification of certain journals
that are more specialized in photogrammetry or remote sensing? It is difficult to say.

The  scale  proposed  here  to  carry  out  the  Delphi  (ranks  from  1  to  4)  entailed
difficulties  in  the  experts’  decision-making  process  regarding  the  evaluation  of  some
scientific journals. For instance, some of them gave half scores, such as 2.5 or 3.5. Then,
we had to contact the experts to ask them to make a choice. Other experts informed us
that they had difficulties to carry out the exercise, mainly due to the very limited rating
scale.  The  rating  exercise  may  have  been  easier  if  the  experts  had  a  wider  choice  than
the  initial  ranking  from  1  to  4.  For  example,  how  might  a  five  or  seven-point  Likert
scale have impacted the results?

Finally, the list of scientific journals covered by the Delphi does not pretend to be
exhaustive, even though it was compiled on the basis of various sources of information,
as well as on suggestions made by the participating experts. It is clear that the method
used to develop this ranking will have to evolve with time and according to the experts’
commentaries and further inquiries.

Sometimes  though,  this  classification  will  necessitate  updates.  Journals  evolve  and
their  rankings  change  over  time  as  well,  GIScience  will  evolve  too,  just  like  disciplines
continually  do.  The  constant  redefinition  and  the  steady  integration  of  new  concepts
and  new  information  technologies  (IT)  imply  the  need  to  maintain  and  improve  our
global  knowledge  in  this  field.  In  order  to  make  guarantees  about  how  current,  and
thus,  useful  this  classification  is,  it  is  important  to  keep  on  improving  and  enhancing
this first version.

Generally  speaking,  it  would  be  interesting  to  transpose  this  type  of  exercise  to
conference  rankings  in  GIScience  (e.g.  COSIT,  GIScience  conference),  with  respect  to
thematic  content  and  prestige,  for  example.  Furthermore,  we  are  convinced  that  the
methodology of this work could be generalized to research fields other than GIScience.
The Delphi method appears to be an innovative and efficient way to achieve this purpose.
We  consider  the  innovative  approach  used  in  the  present  study  as  complementary
to the JCR approach. It efficiently fills some of the gaps of the JCR, such as the lack of
consideration  for  some  key  journals,  and  because  few  other  rankings  of  journals  from
the emerging field of GIScience have been attempted. This complementarity might imply
some  changes  relating  to  the  criteria  used  to  constitute  the  JCR,  i.e.  to  complete  these
criteria with others based on consensus building, such as the Delphi method.

Moreover, since the approach used in the present study aims at reaching consensus
among subject-field experts, we consider it as a sensible means for publishers, people in
charge  of  tenure-track  and  promotion  decisions,  and  granting  agencies  to  evaluate  the
contribution and reputation of journals. We do hope that the present research will lead
to  the  development  of  a  new  journal  ranking  approach  in  the  field  of  GIScience,  and
possibly  in  other  research  fields.  In  this  regard,  we  are  ready  to  get  involved  in  any
initiative  aiming  at  structuring  some  kind  of  process  to  periodically  update  the  results
of the present study.

1 The method for structuring a group communication process so that the process is effective in

(Linstone and Turoff 1975). 

2 The jury of the Delphi study consists of the authors of this paper.
3 One mistake was made during the Delphi study. The title: “Geographical Information Systems
for  Urban  and  Regional  Planning”  was  part  of  the  final  list  compiling  the  54  journals,  even
though it is not a journal but a book. One of the experts had suggested adding this title during
the first iteration of the Delphi. But, neither the experts nor the jury of the Delphi ever detected
this  mistake  afterwards.  Yet,  it  hardly  affected  the  final  ranking.  We  ultimately  removed  this
title. This mistake does not invalidate the remainder of the classification obtained.

4 A French version of the questionnaire was available upon request.
5 The  fourth  level  corresponds  to  journals  without  editorial  boards,  that  is  to  say  professional

or transfer journals.

Appendix 2: Questionnaire #2

Dear Sir/Madam,

We are pleased to note that you are among the 38 experts that answered our first survey
concerning  our  research  project  for  classifying  the  scientific  journals  in  the  field  of
Geographic Information Science (GIS). For a second time, we request your professionnal
skills to complete Survey # 2.

Following your suggestions from the first round, we eliminated nearly 20 journals.
However,  we  need  your  opinion,  a  second  time,  to  evaluate  some  other  journals  from
the  first  round.  Also,  some  new  suggestions  of  journals  provided  by  some  of  your
colleagues who answered the first survey need to be evaluated.

To do so, we provide you a definition of Geographic information science:

“GIScience has recently emerged as the field where problems of data capture,
encoding,  storage,  analysis,  retrieval,  synthesis,  and  dissemination  of  geo-
graphic information are studied. These problems have increased in significance
as  new  computer  based  technologies  such  as  geographic  information  systems
(GIS),  digital  remote  sensing  (RS)  and  Global  Positioning  Systems  (GPS)  evolve.
GI Science is the foundation upon which these GI technologies are built.”

(Source: http://www.gisc.berkeley.edu/about/whatisgis.html)

Please, answer the following two questions that represent your opinion.

1) Look  at  the  scientific  journals  above  and  indicate  those  which,  according  to  your
expertise, do not deserve to be evaluated because they do not belong in the field of
Geographic Information Science. Please answer the question in the column entitled
“Yes,  No  or  ?”  question.  (If  you  are  unfamiliar  with  the  journal,  put  a  question
mark (?))

2) For each journal in both lists, identify its ranking according to the scale below

(If you are unfamiliar with the journal, put a question mark (?))

– Level 1: Peer journal classified among the first 15% of their field
– Level 2: Peer journal classified between 16% and 50% of their field
– Level 3: Peer journal classified between 51% and 100% of their field
– Level 4: Journal not part of the first three categories

(For example: A journal that does’t have a referee process.)

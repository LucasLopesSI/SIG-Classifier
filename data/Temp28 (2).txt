Abstract In line generalization, a first goal to achieve is the classification of features
previous to the selection of processes and parameters. A feed forward backpropagation
artificial neural network (ANN) is designed for classifying a set of road lines through a
supervised learning process, attempting to emulate a classification performed by a human
expert for cartographic generalization purposes. The main steps of the process are presented
in this paper: (a) experimental data selection; (b) segmentation of lines into homogeneous
sections, (c) sections enrichment through a set of quantitative measures derived from a
principal component analysis, and qualitative information derived from road network and
road type; (d) expert classification of the sections; and finally (e) the ANN design, training
and validation. The quality of results is analyzed by means of error matrices after a cross-
validation process giving a goodness, or percentage of agreement, over 83%.

1 Introduction

this line characterization must

In automatic line generalization it is known that the performance of any generalization
operation depends on line type and properties [10]. So line description and classification is
a prior essential step in order to enrich data bases and thus facilitate decision-making when
applying automatic procedures. Moreover,
involve a
segmentation task in homogeneous sections, because each line could have a heterogeneous
shape and a global description would not be appropriate to all its length because its
variability. The importance of this line segmentation has been emphasized by different
authors: [14], [36], [39], etc. Therefore, optimal segmentation and classification methodol-
ogies would be the first goals to achieve for adapting processes, algorithms and parameters to

different line types, uses and scales, taking into account basic studies of the performance of
line simplification algorithms like [46]. For example, if this performance is related with line
class, it should be necessary to know if we have a sinuous of a non-sinuous line in order to
choose the best generalization algorithm, then a classification methodology should be
available, as that one presented in this paper.

The choice of road line elements is not a coincidence. Although different linear elements
can be considered (contour lines, hydrographical elements, coastal lines, boundaries and so
on), road lines are used intensively in many different products (topographic, road, tourist
maps...) and it is essential to maintain their communicative capacity and positional accuracy
and to assure an appropriate generalization. The road classification problem is also
interesting in many other applications. For example, that is the case of road route planning,
in which the previous classification of the lines according to its geometry, not only
according to its speed limit, should be taken into account. Other type of lines, such as
contour lines or hydrographic lines, are related with the corresponding digital terrain model
(DTM). In this case, the generalization of the DTM supposes the generalization of these
lines, and a previous line classification is not so important.

The work presented is part of a large scheme that pursues the automatic segmentation
and classification of road lines of a medium scale map (MTN25, Topographic National Map
1:25,000). It is centred on the stage of automatic classification through a supervised
learning process, that is to say a classification engine, by means of an artificial neural
network (ANN). In previous road line classification works, such as [38] or [47], cluster
analysis was applied in an unsupervised learning process.

ANNs are part of the field of artificial intelligence. ANN theory and modelling follow
the structure and operation of nervous systems, where a neuron is the fundamental element.
Artificial neurons try to assume the more important characteristics of biological neurons.
Their work is simple: to receive input from neighbouring neurons and to compute an output
value, which is sent to other neurons.

Fundamentals of neural computation come from [30], who modelled a simple neural
network with electrical circuits, and [21], who established a link between psychology and
physiology. The first model of ANN was presented in [40], who developed the perceptron
which is used today in several ways for pattern recognition. The first application to a real
problem was presented in [55], who developed the model adaline to remove echoes in
telephonic lines. ANN research declined in the 1970s, but in the 1980s interest increased
with the contributions of [20], [23] and [26].

[54] underlined the potential that ANNs have in cartographic generalization, empha-
sizing thematic classification, structure recognition and assessment of alternative general-
ization solutions. They also specifically quoted the possibility of applying ANNs to the
segmentation of linear features into homogeneous sections. [33] suggests the use of ANNs
for a knowledge–acquisition process, anticipating efficient
results, but with less
understandable engines than other techniques in machine learning. [44] is not very
optimistic in relation to the application of ANNs in generalization, but he points out its
proven benefit in classification tasks. Nevertheless there are several examples of application
of ANNs in cartographic generalization. [2] and [3] use a Kohonen [27] AAN for an
amalgamation operation, and [45] also tests a Kohonen AAN for a typification operation.
But any example of AAN applied over road line classification can be found. This paper
studies this issue and it contributes with the design of an AAN for this goal, but also with a
set of significant quantitative measures and qualitative data to feed this AAN. Also the
entire paper is a proposal of steps to follow (data segmentation, measure selection, AAN
design, results valuation...) in similar studies in the future.

One of the most widely-used ANNs is the backpropagation ANN (BANN). This method
allows an ANN to learn the association between an input pattern and a set of classes using a
feedforward structure. Our point of view is similar, for example, to an electrocardiogram
classification like that of [9], who derived a set of parameters from an electrocardiogram to
feed a BANN which detected several different classes or behaviours.

The contents of this paper are divided into eight sections. In Section 2, the basics of the
backpropagation neural network are presented. From Sections 3 to 5, different steps for test
data preparation are detailed: road selection and segmentation, section enrichment (input
data for the BANN are obtained) and section classification (output expected data of the
BANN is defined). Neural network implementation and training with this input and output
data is explained in Section 6, with results summarised in Section 7. Finally, conclusions
are presented in Section 8.

2 The Backpropagation Neural Network (BANN)

BANN was first described by [52] and developed by [41]. They proposed an ANN with
more layers than the Rosenblatt’s perceptron in order to allow it to learn the association
between the inputs and the corresponding classes. A more detailed explanation of the
BANN can be found in [42] and [52].

is connected to each unit of the following layer, but

A BANN is a multilayer ANN composed of three types of layer: the input layer, one or
more hidden layers and the output layer. Each layer is composed of several neurons (called
units). Each unit
there are no
connections between units of the same layer (see Fig. 1). The value of each unit is
computed from the sum of the multiplications between the values of the units of the
previous layer and weights of the connections to that unit. Input layer units receive the input
pattern values while the output layer units show values that, in our case, represent the
classes to be recognized. Hidden layers are only used for computations.

An ANN is a system and in this way is defined like any system by means of a structure
and its behaviour. A BANN structure is defined when the number of hidden layers and the
number of units in each layer (size of the layer) are fixed. The size of the input layer is

Fig. 1 BANN structure

292

Geoinformatica (2008) 12:289–312

usually equal to the number of features on which classification is based. The size of the
output layer is the same as the number of classes to be considered. The major problem is the
definition of the number and size of the hidden layer(s), since the optimal values are
unknown and have to be derived from experimentation. On top of everything, this is critical
to the ANN’s performance. In general, a complex structure causes an overtraining of the
ANN: it learns too much, and generally does not work well with data that have not been
used for training. On the other hand, a simple structure impedes the decrease of error in the
learning process. Only one hidden layer is considered if the learning process takes place
with no greater problems. If two ANNs work well, the simple one is preferred because the
number of computation tasks is lower. Once a structure is fixed an ANN is defined by the
weight given to each link between units, so that structure and weights define the behaviour
and capacities of an ANN.

Weights are the means by which an ANN stores knowledge in a given structure. The
acquisition of such knowledge requires a so-called learning process, where a training
pattern is used. The training pattern is a data set of inputs for which a desired classification,
or output, is known. The learning of a BANN is carried out with the modification of the
weights of the connections. The term backpropagation refers to the operation of the learning
process. It is based on a backward propagation of the error obtained from the output units.
The first step is the random initialization of the weights of the connections. After that, each
input pattern (or learning pattern) is presented to the input layer and propagated forward
through the hidden layer(s) to obtain the output values (Eq. 1). The error is estimated as the
difference between the obtained and the desired output and is propagated backward through
the ANN, assigning a percentage of error to each unit (Eqs. 2 and 3). Next all the weights
are readjusted to reduce the error at the output layer (Eq. 4). The whole process is repeated
until the error is minimal, or else is lower than a given threshold value. This process is also
called the generalized delta rule, and is an iterative gradient descent training procedure.

The learning rate a is the parameter that controls the process. The bigger the value, the
bigger the modification of the weight at every iteration and the faster the learning, but the
minimum error could not be achieved if oscillations appear. Lower values are preferred in
order to ensure that the ANN converges to a solution. [41] proposed modifying the delta
rule in order to introduce another parameter b, called the momentum, that adds a fraction of
the weight change when the weight is modified in the following iteration (see Eq. 5). This
procedure helps to maintain the weight changes in the same direction and therefore to
reduce the number of iterations.

To sum up, the BANN is a consolidated methodology that has extended the number of
applications of ANNs. It is not only useful for classification tasks, but also for data
encoding, filtering or compression, for pattern recognition and so on. In subsequent
chapters our BANN is defined by the number of hidden layers, number of units of each
layer, learning rate, and momentum.

3 Road data selection and segmentation

The goal of this study is the training of a BANN for road line classification. A sample of
road lines should be used to perform the training, taking into account that the operation of
the trained BANN is going to depend largely on the selected sample. It should be chosen
carefully in order to ensure a representative study. So several criteria were taken into
account.

&

&

&

Sample Size: Sample size means the global number of elements taken into account. It
should be large enough if a statistically significant result is sought. In our case, the
length of the road lines should also be greater than a certain threshold, because a short
line presents fewer possibilities of segmentation and generalization. Observing previous
studies of line generalization (see Table 1), the sample size is very variable, from the
four elements of [7], [14], [25], [56] to those studies in which a large set of lines in a
geographic scope is selected without specifying quantity ([28], [29], [35], [38], [48],
[50], [51]). This last option seems more adequate, since the validity of the results should
be better and because it is closer to a real case of operating with a cartographic product
(such as road elements of a sheet).
Inter-group variability: Lines should belong to the largest number of categories
possible, with attention to administrative categories, design guidelines, etc. In this way
this study is more general and close to the population of lines of a cartographic series.
This would allow the differentiation of behaviours and characteristics according to the
line type.
Intra-group variability: For the same reason, in each category there should be, as
far as is possible, variability in the routes. This is easier in byroads and tracks

because the variations in sinuosity and complexity are more frequent, since their design
is less restrictive.

Following these criteria this work employs all tarmac roads and tracks in four sheets
from the MTN25 with a length of over 4 km (Fig. 2; Table 2). MTN25 series has been
considered because is not a derived cartography by generalization, but comes directly from
the photogrammetric process. Also it is the cartographic series at a bigger scale which
covers all Spain, so in the future all series at a low scale could be derived from it (as the
new MTN50, National Topographic Map 1:50,000). The sheets selected (four 947 sheets
from MTN25 that correspond with one generalized sheet from MTN50) are the nearer to
our research centre, and contain such a set of road lines that complies with criteria of
sample size, inter-group variability and intra-group variability.

These lines could be enriched to proceed with the next step of the process, the data
enrichment that allows feeding of the BANN. But in order to increase the purity of the
classes the BANN is going to distinguish, a line segmentation process is applied. After
segmentation the sample of lines is divided into a sample of sections, each one more
homogeneous than the original line.

The basic ideas and goals of segmentation can be approached by acquiring knowledge
from the manual process. In a manual segmentation an expert would perform the
segmentation with his/her visual criteria, preferably over the paper map. The advantages
would be those derived from the holistic processing and the expert knowledge of the human
mind. In fact, [36] refers to line segmentation as a human visual perception-related process.
The disadvantages are those typical of a human process: lack of repetitivity, subjectivity,
qualitative analysis versus quantitative, etc.

The visual assessment is performed in a global way, observing the whole line, by means
of the detection of sinuosity and directionality changes, as suggested by [32]. Visual
analysis allows choosing between different segmentations of the same linear element. A
segmentation is preferred which detects variations, as obvious as possible, in sinuosity,
directionality or both. Sinuosity has been evaluated by observing the bend size, radius and
the presence of rectilinear stretches. Directionality starts from the presence of rectilinear
stretches, but is based on a global examination of the main trend of the line. Naturally, it is
easier to compare segmentations in a not very homogeneous line, because the section
changes are easier to locate. A more homogeneous line is more difficult to segment
manually, therefore it is more difficult to compare two different segmentations. Figure 3
shows an example of segmentations that have been performed following this procedure,
indicating whether the sinuosity and the directionality are higher or lower.

But line sections or segmentation can also be derived through other strategies than the

manual one:
& Automatic segmentation. In this case any of the algorithmic computer methodologies
could be used. Advantages would be repetitivity, objectivity, quantitative analysis, etc.
Disadvantages would be sequential data processing, lack of cartographic knowledge
application, etc.
Semiautomatic segmentation. An expert would control segmentation performed by a
computer algorithm, in order to guarantee homogeneity of sections. The digital system
would be a tool for the expert, combining the advantages of the manual and automatic
options.

&

We have chosen semiautomatic segmentation in order to try to guarantee an adequate
sample for the pursued goal. The method for performing this segmentation can be any with
proven results, such as the one suggested by [35], a wavelet filtering ([16], [37]), those
suggested by [15] and so on. The method used employs an accumulated sum of

Fig. 3 Examples of visual seg-
mentation, with indications of
differences in sinuosity and
directionality

297

Visvalingam and Whyatt [49] effective areas, detailed in [5] and [15]. So its application is
guided, modifying parameters and visually inspecting the results, choosing a solution in
which a clear difference in the planimetric route characteristics is appreciated and is
assessed as valid. This segmentation (and the subsequent classification) divides the line into
several, but not many sections. Segmentation over the sample of road lines can be observed
in Fig. 4.

This segmentation has been assessed by a group of 20 international experts, belonging to
different universities and national mapping agencies (see [15]). They have evaluated the
results, taking into account the aforementioned sinuosity and directionality changes, with
very positive conclusions.

4 Section enrichment: Input data for the BANN

Expert knowledge formalization is a complex issue in cartographic generalization. But the
BANN needs to acquire this knowledge in order to learn to perform a road classification
process. The knowledge is assimilated by the BANN when it learns to relate some measures
to the expected class. So a first step to performing every attempt at automatic classification
is to select those characterising measures that are to be used to feed the classifying system.
There are abundant measures that can be employed when characterising a line or section.
Sometimes the measures have been selected in an intuitive way. This intuition is very
valuable, but it is advisable to complement it with a statistical study which supports the
selection. Common sense would dictate that the measures be significant, not correlated and
normalized. These three conditions make the classification task easier. A principal
component analysis (PCA) has been applied, as suggested by [25], [31], [33], or [47]
over a set of measures, for choosing those measures which are more significant and not
correlated. The selection of measures for PCA must be carried out anticipating their

Fig. 4 Segmentation of the sample of road lines

298

potential usefulness. It is interesting to examine each one considering what information it is
going to contribute: sinuosity, detail density, etc. Several ideas can be established about
this:
& Measures can be computed either over the whole section or over every isolated bend for

a later derivation of central tendency measures, dispersion measures, etc.

& A mean can be used as the central tendency measure, but it is interesting to note the

remark of [38], who suggest the median instead of the mean.

& A dispersion measure of every geometric measure is a section homogeneity indicator. In
[25] there are examples with the coefficient of variance, which has the advantage of
being a dimensionless measure.
PCA is useful for its application over correlated measures, so multiple measures are
selected, although several could seem very similar.

&

We have used a total of 25 measures for the PCA analysis. Some have been previously
referred to ([1], [25], [31], [34]–[36], [47]) and others have not. Most of them are central
tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (coefficient of variance) measures derived from
computations performed on isolated bends.

PCA results (detailed in [15]) show that the first three components explain 75% of
variance; the first five components, with eigenvalues over 1, explain 89%. A varimax
orthogonal rotation of the factorial matrix has been used to facilitate the PCA interpretation.
In Table 3 the first five components are presented, with a brief interpretation and the
corresponding measures. These selected measures are described in Table 4 and some basic
measures over every bend are presented in Fig. 5.

These measures detected by PCA allow us to enrich each section of the sample and take
part of the input data used to train the BANN. But it is interesting to consider another type
of information that is not quantitative, but qualitative. Each road of the sample belongs to
an administrative category, and there is a certain type of implicit geometric knowledge, like
the general criteria in the design of roads of this category, that usually introduces different
constraints. Finally five different categories have been considered, as shown in Table 5.
Each section of the sample belongs to one of these categories and this information is also
part of the input data for the BANN.

5 Section classification: Expected output of the BANN

Prior to the ANN training, expected output has to be established. In this work, the output is
the classification of the section set, so sections have to be classified in some way (previous
classification). In a subsequent step, the training means that the ANN learns to associate
inputs with outputs to classify automatically any section (ANN automatic classification). So

a correct previous classification is essential, since to a large extent the success of the ANN
automatic classification tasks depends on a coherent expert classification of the section set.
An ambitious goal would be to try to set a high number of different classes. But it can be
difficult to assign a section to one of the classes, because of the many different routes that
can be found. If this causes any arbitrary allocation, then the generalization ability of the
ANN could be contaminated in its application to cases that are different to those employed
for the training. So the general criterion should be to establish categories that do not cast
doubts on the manual classification by means of the visual analysis. We must remember

that, if is difficult for a human being to perform the classification, it is more difficult for an
ANN trying to emulate human behaviour.

Previous studies do not usually establish a high number of classes. Table 6 summarises
several studies in which an unsupervised classification has been performed with cluster
analysis. It can be said that the number of classes varies between 3 and 4, and that a
sinuosity criterion has been applied. Also we find that:
& Extreme classes, corresponding with the most and least sinuous sections, seem to be
more easily detected. In Skopeliti and Tsoulos’ work the two intermediate classes
appear to be different according to the directionality instead of the sinuosity.

& The line samples seem to be less heterogeneous than ours, especially those of [34] and
[38], because no high-capacity roads like motorways, which would be of a high
smoothness and thus easily appreciable, are considered. So the greater variability in road
types to classify in our work should allow a higher number of classes to be defined.

For the definition of our classes, an intense visual analysis of the sections sample has
been carried out. Here we have attempted to establish groups of lines that represent classes
that take into account differences in sinuosity and directionality. The criteria for this visual
assessment are the same as those applied to the segmentation process. The methodology is
based on a repetitive detailed examination and classification of the sections set. Multiple
revisions of the classification have been carried out, starting from a preliminary, coarse
revision and refining it through section observation. On multiple occasions we found
sections which combined properties from more than one class, causing a redefinition of the

common characteristics of the sections of a class and a reclassification of a certain number
of sections.

Contemplation has been performed both on screen and on paper, at different zoom
levels. This visualization has been performed in two ways: (a) in the original relative
location, making the comparison between consecutive sections of a line easier (see Fig. 6);
and (b) in class groupings, facilitating the comparison of sections grouped in the same class
(see Fig. 7). Also, original MTN25 sheets have been observed to understand de geographical
context of each line. In any case, we have realised that this task of classification is not easy.
Established classes are presented in Table 7. Each section of the sample belongs to one of
these classes and this information is part of the expected output data for the BANN training.
Figures 6 and 7 show the classification of the sections set.

6 Neural network implementation and training

6.1 BANN design

A three layer BANN has been used in this work. As mentioned before, the input layer size
depends on the data considered to enrich every section, and the output layer size depends
on the classes which have been identified. Input layer is integrated by one unit for each
measure selected with the PCA (nine units, quantitative data, Table 4), plus one unit for
each category of road (five units, qualitative data, Table 5), so 14 units have been

302

considered. Output layer is integrated by one unit for each class to be recognized, so five
units (Table 7) have been considered. Only one hidden layer has been used because there is
no reason to expect problems in the BANN learning. The size of the hidden layer is not
known at first, and several sizes should be tested. Tests with two hidden layers would have
been considered if poor results had been found. Sigmoid function f (x)=1/(1+e−ax), the most
common in BANNs, is the transfer function for all units.

6.2 Learning and validation patterns

Before any learning process it is necessary to arrange the input data and expected output
data in the suitable format for the BANN. Input quantitative data (measures) should be

standardized as suggested in [43]. Max and min for each measure are detected to carry out a
rescaling in the interval [−1, 1]. Input qualitative data (road categories) is coded and also
standardized in that interval, assigning a value of 1 to the category of the road, and a value
of −1 to the other. Output data (section class) is also coded, assigning a value of 1 to the
class of the section and a value of 0 to the other. All this data is computed for the 73
available sections of the sample and make up a pattern for training the BANN. But it is
advisable to perform the training with one part of the pattern and validate the results with
the remaining data, that is, to divide the pattern into a learning and a validation pattern.

Seventy-three is a small number of cases to be divided into a learning pattern and a
validation pattern. So a cross-validation process is applied in order to obtain a sounder
result. Cross-validation was proposed by [18] and makes maximally efficient use of the
available data. It entails the partitioning of the sample data into subsets. The learning is
initially performed with all subsets except one, which is used for validation, that is, to check
if the learning process is successful or not. This process is repeated with every subset. An
example of the application of this technique in cartographic generalization can be found in
[33]. As one section class (class 5, “very sinuous”) has eight sections, cross-validation has
been stratified with eight folds, assuring that each subset contains samples of every class
(see Table 8).
Therefore,

independent
the eight fold cross-validation allows us to perform eight
processes of learning-validation of an ANN design. The learning is performed with a
pattern consisting of seven subsets and the validation pattern with the remaining subset.
Each section has been randomly assigned to each subset. This whole process finishes with
the creation of eight learning and eight validation pattern files.

6.3 BANN training

The experimentation with ANNs has been carried out with JavaNNS software. JavaNNS
(Java Neural Network Simulator) is a free software based on SNSS (Stuttgart Neural

Network Simulator), developed by the Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems of
Stuttgart University. This software has been used for research work in many subjects: [6],
[19], [24], [57] are some examples; in cartographic line generalization, SNNS seems only to
be used in [53].

The generalized delta rule with a momentum is the learning function. Values that control
the learning are those suggested by JavaNNS: a low value for the learning rate (0.2) and a
value of 0.5 for the momentum influence. The number of iterations is high (5,000) in order
to allow us to observe if the learning is stabilizing.

In every training process, JavaNNS plots an error graph, showing the error in both the
training and the validation pattern (see Fig. 8). A definitive learning process should show a
clear descending trend in the error learning pattern, with a low final value, and a descending
trend in the validation pattern.

Preliminary experiments have been performed to estimate the size of the hidden layer.
One unit size has been rejected because the error in the learning pattern stabilizes early with
a high value. Six unit size has been rejected because the error in the validation pattern
increases instead of decreasing. So the size of the hidden layer has been modified between 2
and 5 units (four structures). The learning process has been repeated over each structure and
for each fold of the cross-validation.

7 Results

After the learning process over each structure and each fold has been carried out, the ANN
is defined by all the weights between units of the three layers. At that moment some
cartographic knowledge has been assimilated by the ANN, and this can be used to classify a
section that has not previously been used for learning. Performing the classification with the
ANN, output unit values can be used to estimate the probability of belonging to a class.
Using a simple criterion, the highest value of the five output units has been used to
automatically assign the class.

Once all 73 sections have been automatically classified with each structure, an error
matrix (Table 9) has been developed to check results. An error or confusion matrix is
usually used to assess classification accuracy (see [13]). Here columns show the a priori
classes, and rows the a posteriori classes assigned by the ANN. Diagonal values represent
cases correctly assigned, while the remaining represent mistakes. For 2, 3, 4 and 5 units in
the hidden layer, the percentages of agreement (Pa) are, respectively, 0.81, 0.81, 0.77 and
0.77. Pa can be considered as the global probability of a correct classification ([4]).

However, not only is it interesting to take into account the percentage of agreement, it is
also valuable to compare the output layer unit values in order to evaluate the consistency of
the classification. Therefore we have differentiated strong, moderate and weak classifica-
tions. A strong classification is one which shows a value near to 1 in a unit and near to 0 in
the remaining units (whether the classification is correct or not). A moderate classification
is one which shows a value clearly higher than the rest but where any of the classes have a
non-zero value, with a minimum difference (not less than, for example, 0.7) with respect to
the highest value. A weak value is set in the rest of the cases. It is also valuable to determine
if there is interference between the classes when two or more units show similar values (for
example, a difference below 0.5). Table 10 shows different measures following the referred
criteria. An analysis allows us to see that, when increasing the number of units in the hidden
layer, there is a tendency for the quantity of strong classifications to increase. Related to this
fact, interferences tend to decrease; but strong incorrect classifications also increase.

In order to select one of the presented structures, several criteria can be taken into

account:
& BANN classification should be as strong as possible, with few interferences.
& Correct classifications should be maximized, minimizing the incorrect ones.
&

It is always preferable to reduce the quantity of units, in order to reduce the processing
tasks in a software simulation ([22]).

Results indicate that the three hidden units BANN shows characteristics with a balance
between the maximization of the correct classifications and the minimization of the
incorrect ones; the presence of interferences is not too high, and the quantity of neural links
is more reduced than the 4 or 5 units structures (the BANN is more simple). So the three
hidden units BANN is selected, with the final structure shown in Fig. 9.

7.1 Section classification review and re-training of the BANN

Any of the sections may have been wrongly classified by any of the BANNs. It is
interesting to detect and analyze these cases, to decide if the BANNs are suggesting that the
section belongs to a class different from the one initially considered. In this review results
from 3, 4, and 5 hidden units BANNs are considered. Two units BANN has been rejected
due to its poor results.

To detect a change of class for a section, the number of BANNs indicating the same class
and the type of classification (strong, moderate, weak) are considered. The more obvious
case is that with all three BANNs indicating the same class with strong classification. In this
work a change in the class is considered if at least two BANNs have classified the section in
the same class with a strong or moderate classification type. From the 73 sections, 10
potential changes of class have been detected. All have been visually analyzed to accept or
reject the suggested change. Finally, only five changes have been accepted.

It can be thought that in the same way the BANN has learn to classify sections, we can
learn from the BANN and modify the output with the five changes of class as it has
suggested. Under this assumption the pattern has been modified and the sections have been
relocated for the cross-validation process.

The three hidden units BANN has been re-trained with the resulting new learning and
validation patterns. A new confusion matrix has been obtained (Table 11) and results have
been compared with the previous three units BANN (Table 12). In general, the new BANN
has meant an improvement of the results:

&

&

&

Strong classifications have gone up from 57.6 to 67.1%, the interferences having been
reduced from 17.8 to 13.7%. So the BANN is more assertive
Strong and moderate correct classifications have increased from 69.9 to 71.2%, while
total correct classifications from 80.9 to 82.2%.
Strong and moderate incorrect classifications have decreased from 12.3 to 9.6%.

7.2 Final BANN definition

Another use of the cross-validation processes is the selection of a subset of the input data. A
subset with all the relevant data is qualified as good; a subset which exclusively contains
the relevant data is qualified as the best [43]. In this work one of the eight trainings is to be
chosen as the definitive one. Conflictive cases (sections), those which have not been well
classified, are relevant data for the training and should be part of the training pattern. The

validation pattern should be integrated by cases without confusion problems. This
procedure, and a reduced error in the validation pattern, guarantees a high generalization
capacity of the BANN.

Choosing the best of the eight training processes, the BANN is defined by a set of
parameters: a threshold value for each unit and a weight value for each link between units (see
Tables 13, 14 and 15). Although they are not directly understandable for us, they mean the
formalization of cartographic knowledge that allows the classification of every road line.

8 Conclusions

Segmentation and classification tasks are considered essential for the improvement of
automatic generalization, since different algorithms, and different values of
their
parameters, are more suitable for different line types. In this work an automatic method
for classification of homogeneous road sections has been presented, with the basic

hypothesis that an ANN can imitate a human expert classification. The number of classes
considered, five, is higher than other road classification studies.

Consecutive steps carried out for a BANN classification have been summarized: data
selection, semiautomatic segmentation, section enrichment (quantitative and qualitative),
expert classification, BANN design and training with a cross-validation process.

The proposed BANN is defined by three layers and the respective weights and
thresholds. The input layer has 14 units (for nine quantitative mathematical measures, and
five qualitative road categories) and the output layer has five units (one for each class to be
detected). The number of hidden units has been set testing different alternatives searching
for the best results.

Classification results have been evaluated using a confusion matrix method. The
obtained automatic classification performance, or goodness, is quite encouraging, with a
percentage agreement of 83%. The three hidden units structure seems to be adequate and
complex enough for performing the classification task of road lines.

This structure, the threshold values of the units, and the weights of the links between
units, all mean a formalization of the cartographic knowledge that allows road line
classification. This BANN can be applied to a set of homogeneous sections in order to
classify them but also, within an appropriate software tool, for automatic segmentation of
lines and classification of detected sections. We think that these results will be of value for
the study of the performance of line algorithms over detected classes when deriving rules
for an automatic generalization decision-making procedure based on the characteristics of a
line section.

Time  is  a  fundamental  dimension  in  urban  dynamics,  but 

the  effect  of  various  definitions  of  time  on  urban  growth 

models has rarely been evaluated. In urban growth models 

such as cellular automata (CA), time has typically been de-

fined as a sequence of discrete time steps. However, most 

urban growth processes such as land-use changes are asyn-

chronous. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of 

various temporal dynamics scenarios on urban growth simu-

lation, in terms of urban land-use planning, and to introduce 

an  asynchronous  parcel-based  cellular  automata  (AParCA) 

model.  In  this  study,  eight  different  scenarios  were  gener-

ated  to  investigate  the  impact  of  temporal  dynamics  on 

CA-based  urban  growth  models,  and  their  outputs  were 

evaluated using various urban planning indicators. The ob-

tained results show that different degrees of temporal dy-

namics lead to various patterns appearing in urban growth 

CA  models,  and  the  application  of  asynchronous  (event-

driven)  CA  models  achieves  better  simulation  results  than 

synchronous models.

Understanding and simulating urban dynamics is a challenge for decision-makers and urban planners, so providing 

models that can describe urban dynamics is critical in urban studies (Batty, Xie, & Sun, 1999; Ghavami, Taleai, & 

Arentze, 2017; O'Sullivan, 2001; Shafizadeh-Moghadam, Asghari, Taleai, Helbich, & Tayyebi, 2017). Although time 

is a fundamental dimension in urban dynamics, few studies have been undertaken to evaluate the effect of various

definitions of time on the result of urban growth simulation models. In recent decades, cellular automata (CA) have 

been widely employed by researchers to simulate the behavior of complex systems such as land-use change and 

urban growth (Barredo, Kasanko, McCormick, & Lavalle, 2003; Batty, 2007; Cao, Huang, Xu, Lü, & Chen, 2019; 

Clarke, 2008; Feng & Tong, 2018; Santé-Riveira, Crecente-Maseda, & Miranda-Barrós, 2008; Wang & Marceau, 

2013), but the resulting studies provide little consideration of the treatment of time (Chaudhuri & Clarke, 2014).

CA are defined by five components (Batty et al., 1999; White & Engelen, 2000): (a) space, represented as a set 

of entities; (b) state, defined as a set of states that characterize entities; (c) neighborhood, including the definition 

of neighborhood distance and how the objective entity is influenced by neighbors; (d) transition rules, determin-

ing the transition of each entity’s state as a function of its neighbors’ states; and (e) time, typically defined as a 

sequence of discrete time steps to update entities. In a classical CA model, space is represented as a regular unit 

as for raster data. Since raster-based CA do not match the shape and size of real-world objects such as city blocks 

and cadastral parcels, irregular CA models have also been developed (Abolhasani, Taleai, Karimi, & Rezaee Node, 

2016; Alaei Moghadam, Karimi, & Habibi, 2018; Barreira-González, Gómez-Delgado, & Aguilera-Benavente, 2015; 

Dahal & Chow, 2014; Yao et al., 2017). Among the various methods of representing the spatial structure of irreg-

ular CA models, it seems that the most appropriate ones for simulating urban land-use interaction at a high level 

of detail are those using the cadastral parcel, since these are more realistic and more impactful in urban land-use 

planning  (Abolhasani  et  al.,  2016;  Jjumba  &  Dragićević,  2012;  Maleki,  Hakimpour,  &  Masoumi,  2017;  Stevens, 

Dragicevic, & Rothley, 2007).

One of the components of CA that should be explored more accurately to make the model conform more to 

real-world processes is time. In the literature, two types of methods have been used to update CA entities: (a) syn-

chronous methods, updating the states of entities (cells or polygons) at each time step simultaneously (Baetens, 

Van der Weeën, & De Baets, 2012; Barredo et al., 2003; Dahal & Chow, 2014; Engelen, White, & Uljee, 1997; 

Torrens, 2006); and (b) asynchronous methods, updating the states of entities consecutively. In the latter type, the 

time step for updating entities is not explicitly defined and is not limited to specific time intervals (Ke, Qi, & Zeng, 

2016; Kim, 2013; Liu & Andersson, 2004; Schönfisch & de Roos, 1999). The significant feature that distinguishes 

an asynchronous CA from a synchronous CA is that the state of a newly developed entity affects the entities in its 

neighborhood in every event of the model.

In recent studies, it has been shown that synchronous updating is not in accordance with many real processes 

(Baetens  et  al.,  2012;  Bandman,  2010;  Barreira-González  et  al.,  2015;  Cornforth,  Green,  &  Newth,  2005;  Kim, 

2013; Lee, Adachi, Peper, & Morita, 2004; O'Sullivan & Torrens, 2001; Ruivo, Montalva-Medel, Paulo Balbi de 

Oliveira,  &  Perrot,  2018;  Schönfisch  &  de  Roos,  1999)  and  therefore,  due  to  the  temporal  nature  of  entities, 

asynchronous  CA  is  more  realistic  than  synchronous  CA  and  achieves  more  accurate  results  (Ke  et  al.,  2016). 

Schönfisch and de Roos (1999) compared several updating methods for CA. Their study showed that different 

updating methods lead to qualitative and quantitative differences in the dynamic behavior of CA, but these dif-

ferences are not apparent in all cases. Baetens et al. (2012) explored five updating methods within a set of CA 

models and found that the stability of CA is greatly affected by the method employed. Fatès (2013) undertook 

comprehensive research into various aspects of asynchronous CA, stating that “Nature does not possess a clock 

to synchronize the transitions.” It should be considered that studying a single updating scheme is not adequate and 

it is necessary to evaluate different possibilities to model a natural system.

Although numerous studies have been undertaken on urban growth modeling based on CA, time and its effect 

on the results of urban growth models has remained a neglected dimension. Liu and Andersson (2004) investi-

gated the impact of various levels of temporal dynamics on the behavior of urban growth models via a modified 

Markov random field and CA. The results indicated that various levels of temporal dynamics have considerable ef-

fects on the urban morphology results of the model, but that there is no quantitative compression of the obtained 

results. Stevens and Dragićević (2007) designed iCity, where various land-use types could be at different stages 

of  development  at  the  same  time.  In  spite  of  the  high  temporal  resolution  of  the  model  (one  month),  adjacent 

ABOLHASANI ANd TALEAI    |  3

scores updated after every iteration and the effects of the early developed parcel were not considered during 

each iteration.

Kim (2013) assessed the sensitivity of the simulation result with the application of different spatiotemporal 

resolutions in a CA model, under multiple urban land-use change scenarios, where varying time intervals for a 

synchronous CA were applied. The experiments in this study suggest that spatiotemporal variation can gener-

ate considerable differences in simulation outcomes. Ke et al. (2016) developed a partitioned and asynchronous 

cellular  automata  (PACA)  model  to  simulate  urban  growth.  They  divided  the  study  area  into  several  sub-areas 

and defined various evolution rates for cells in each sub-area. The results of this study demonstrated that PACA 

performed better than classical CA. However, in this study, the effects of newly developed cells on their neighbors 

are neglected. Bonnell, Chapman, and Sengupta (2016) assessed the interaction between spatial representation 

and scheduling choices. The results yielded some evidence that the sensitivity of model outcomes varies in differ-

ent spatial and temporal representations.

Due to the difficulty of dynamic computation, its time-consuming nature, and the limitations imposed by the 

availability of parcel data, studies of asynchronous CA models, particularly at the parcel level, have only rarely 

been  performed.  The  most  exciting  of  these  have  applied  CA  models  to  the  district  temporal  resolution,  as  in 

studies by Dahal and Chow (2014), Barreira-González et al. (2015), and Yao et al. (2017). Drawing upon the ref-

erenced literature, and in an attempt to overcome the mentioned limitations regarding the spatial and temporal 

representations of classical CA, this study investigates the impact of various degrees of temporal resolution on 

the results of urban land-use planning models via a parcel-based cellular automata (ParCA) model. For this pur-

pose, we first describe how the temporal dimensions of CA affect the behavior of the land-use dynamic. Then, we 

explain how to apply an asynchronous parcel-based cellular automata (AParCA) model and present the results of 

model evaluation. In order to investigate the impact of temporal resolution on the outcome of the ParCA model, 

and to survey the various urban growth patterns, two different urban land-use allocation approaches, and two 

states of synchronous and asynchronous parcel-based CA using two different time intervals (1 year and 10 years), 

are applied, and the results of eight generated scenarios are compared and discussed.

In utilizing CA, the question arises of how often the system should be updated, and how it can affect the urban 

land-use pattern. The updating method obviously depends on the process one wants to investigate: if the time 

step of a CA has a relatively large time interval in comparison to the simulated process, it can be assumed that 

every entity will be updated at the end of each time step, and the applicability of the synchronous CA is confirmed 

(Schönfisch & de Roos, 1999). On the contrary, if the time step is shorter, fewer events occur during the step, and 

the application of asynchronous CA is more natural (Baetens et al., 2012). It should be taken into account that, 

although appropriate time handling leads to better modeling of the behavior of land-use sets, the results of the 

model can be changed considerably by small random processes (Kim, 2013; Liu & Andersson, 2004).

In total, three definitions of time are used in the urban growth simulation models: duration, discrete, and con-

tinuous (event-driven). Duration means the state of all the entities is updated at one step for the whole duration of 

simulation, while within the duration the process of the simulation is unknown (Liu & Andersson, 2004; Runfola & 

Pontius, 2013). Discrete time implies a much higher degree of temporal dynamics. In this definition, several time 

steps are considered in the simulation, while the state of entities is updated at each time step. Continuous time 

means that only one entity has the chance to change its status at each time step, and each change affects other 

entities and the characteristics of the system (Fatès, 2013; Liu & Andersson, 2004). The continuous concept can 

be applied to fully asynchronous updating (Fatès, Morvan, Schabanel, & Thierry, 2005).

In terms of land-use planning, the main point is that the interactions among components at the micro level 

lead to patterns appearing at the macro level, and as soon as a land use is allocated to a site, other parcels in its 

ABOLHASANI ANd TALEAI4  |    

neighborhood distance are affected (Stevens & Dragićević, 2007; Stevens et al., 2007). Therefore, the frequency 

of simulation of the land-use interactions affects how the spatial patterns are produced. In the discrete-time defi-

nition, changes occurring during a particular time step are assumed to occur simultaneously, and their interactions 

within a time interval are not taken into account (Liu & Andersson, 2004). In continuous time, however, changes 

are evaluated one after another and their interactions during the simulation can affect the process. It should be 

noted that fully asynchronous updating (continuous-time concept) is the most “natural” updating method; because 

“real” time is continuous (Fatès, 2013; Fatès et al., 2005).

Since any geographical phenomena have both spatial and temporal dimensions, spatial and temporal processes 

are inseparable (Cheng & Masser, 2004; Gregory, 2002). In land-use models in particular, if fine spatial resolution 

such as the cadastral parcel is used, more small changes will appear, provided that fine temporal resolution is also 

employed. In other words, in the concepts of land-use models, the spatial and temporal resolutions have a mutual 

connection. Thus, the spatial and temporal dimensions are the key to understanding land-use processes and their 

dynamics.

Consider the following example. In a land-use planning process, a model is designed to allocate required land 

uses for the following year. Based on statistical estimation, two parcels should be allocated to meet the projected 

park demand. If discrete time is employed, both parcels are allocated simultaneously, and based on the initial suit-

ability for park use (Figure 1a), they occur close to each other (Figure 1b). However, considering the importance of 

the proper distribution of land uses, there is no need for two adjacent parks, and this is not a favorable outcome in 

urban planning (Dadashpoor & Rostami, 2017; Taleai, Sliuzas, & Flacke, 2014). On the contrary, if continuous time 

is applied, the entities are developed one after another; every change propagates through the study area and the

step. As can be seen in Figure 1c, this results in appropriate allocation in terms of land-use planning.

3.1 | Conceptual simulation framework

In this study, we use a ParCA model to assess the effect of various degrees of temporal resolution in the context 

of urban growth simulation. A ParCA model consists of four phases: (a) preparing a parcel-based space for de-

velopment; (b) estimating the neighborhood effect and suitability of undeveloped parcels; (c) projecting future 

land-use demand; and (d) allocating suitable parcels to meet the projected demand based on the various temporal 

resolutions. Providing a complete description of the ParCA model is beyond the scope of this article. A general 

overview of the model is presented in the next section. For more theoretical details, the reader should refer to 

Abolhasani et al. (2016).

3.1.1 | Space

The irregular spatial structure in ParCA includes parcel data. In order to present urban growth at the parcel level, 

the same as Dahal and Chow (2014) and Jjumba and Dragićević (2012), an automated land subdivision tool is used 

to divide tracts into smaller lots. In the utilized tool, street width, lot length, and lot width are user-defined inputs. 

To subdivide irregularly shaped parcels, first a minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) for the parent parcel is gener-

ated; then, based on input parameters, as mentioned above, the MBR is subdivided and finally, the subdivided 

MBR  is  clipped  using  the  parent  parcel  and  new  streets  are  connected  to  existing  streets.  Figure  2  shows  the 

implementation of this tool for a track. The algorithm employed for this purpose is adapted from Wickramasuriya, 

Chisholm, Puotinen, Gill, and Klepeis (2011).

3.1.2 | Land-use suitability

The  suitability  of  each  undeveloped  parcel  for  each  land  use  depends  on  three  factors  (Barredo  et  al.,  2003; 

Engelen  et  al.,  1997):  (a)  physical  land  characteristics,  including  the  weighted  linear  combination  (WLC)  of  the 

F I G U R E   2  Subdivision of an irregularly shaped parcel: (a) parent parcel; and (b) created lots and street 
(Abolhasani et al., 2016)

ABOLHASANI ANd TALEAI6  |    

altitude and slope of the parcels; (b) accessibility of parcels to pathway networks, computed by the Euclidean dis-

tance from the nearest point of the road network; and (c) the neighborhood effect, as the key factor of CA models 

described in the following section. The suitability of a parcel can be summarized by:

Sal = WA∗Aal + WPh∗Phal + WN∗Nal

(1)

where Sal, Aal, Phal, and Nal represent the suitability, accessibility, physical land characteristics, and neighborhood 
effect, respectively, for parcel a with land use  l . In addition, WA, WPh, and WN represent the weights of the men-
tioned parameters, which could be specified by expert knowledge. It should be noted that the restricted space 

(such as protected area, streams, etc.) is bypassed in computing suitability, and allocating parcels is performed just 

for unrestricted parcels.

3.1.3 | Neighborhood effect

The efficiency of CA models is justified, provided that neighborhood rules are properly determined; therefore, 

the neighborhood effect definition is the most important issue in CA models (Liao et al., 2016). The neighborhood 

effect  arises  from  spatial  externalities  between  neighboring  land  uses,  which  decrease  with  distance  and  are 

scale dependent (Taleai, Sharifi, Sliuzas, & Mesgari, 2007). In this study, the neighborhood effect is formalized as 

follows:

Ab

Amin

⎜
⎝

⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠

∗ exp �−dab∕800�⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠

∗ Ialbk

(2)

where Nablkd is the neighborhood effect of parcel b with land use k, within neighborhood distance r, located at dis-
tance d, on parcel a with land use  l . In this study, the neighborhood distance is assumed to be an 800 m external 

buffer (Ballesteros & Qiu, 2012; Hagoort, Geertman, & Ottens, 2008; Hagoort, Rijksuniversiteit te, & Geografisch, 
2006; Karimi, Sharifi, & Mesgari, 2012). In this equation, Ab, Aa, Amax, and Amin indicate the area of neighbor, subject, 
largest, and smallest parcel’s area of any land-use type, within the whole study area, respectively. The term dab 
represents the minimum distance between two closest edges of two parcels and is divided by the neighborhood 
distance (800 m) (Abolhasani et al., 2016). Finally, Ialbk is the attraction or repulsion that parcel a with land use  l  
receives from parcel b with land use k. The term Ialbk is explained more fully in the following section.

3.1.4 | Neighborhood effect classification

For better interpretation of land-use interaction, the spatial externalities of adjacent land uses, especially in land-

use planning, are classified using three components: compatibility, dependency, and compactness (Karimi et al., 

2012). For example, the repulsion of residential use with respect to industrial use is due to incompatibility, its at-

traction for facilities such as schools is the result of dependency, and the tendency of residential use to be allocated 

in the neighborhood of similar land use is related to compactness (Abolhasani et al., 2016). These three factors are 

presented in more detail in the following paragraphs.

Compatibility

The  coexistence  of  two  or  more  land-use  types,  without  a  significant  negative  impact,  means  compatibility 

(Abolhasani  et  al.,  2016;  Ghavami,  Taleai,  &  Arentze,  2016;  Masoomi,  Mesgari,  &  Hamrah,  2013;  Taleai  et  al., 

ABOLHASANI ANd TALEAI    |  7

2007),  in  a  way  that  none  of  the  land  uses  prevents  the  activity  of  other  adjacent  land  uses.  Negative  effects 

of  land  uses  arise  from  environmental  pollution,  noise  pollution,  and  other  similar  factors.  Taleai  et  al.  (2007) 

employed the Delphi method to assess land-use compatibility at fine resolution. They presented a compatibility 

matrix expressing land-use compatibility (attraction) and incompatibility (repulsion) at various levels. In this study, 

the abovementioned matrix is employed to measure the compatibility rate of land uses.

Dependency

Some land uses require other land uses in their vicinity to supply their needs. In other words, the existence of a 

land use involves the necessity for other land uses, for example, the dependency between facilities (schools) and 

residential use (Abolhasani et al., 2016; Karimi et al., 2012; Masoomi et al., 2013). As for compatibility, Masoomi 

et al. (2013) formed a dependency matrix using the Delphi method and this matrix is used to evaluate the depend-

ency/independency between land uses.

Compactness

The  organization  of  some  land  uses  is  much  easier  and  more  economical  in  the  vicinity  of  similar  land  uses 

(Abolhasani et al., 2016; Ghavami & Taleai, 2017; Karimi et al., 2012). Therefore, aggregation of certain types of 

land uses can be identified as a factor for the attraction of the same type of land uses, and their number can be an 

indicator of the compactness factor.

Since the compatibility, dependency, and compactness of a subject parcel represent an agglomeration of the 

effects of all adjacent parcels over the neighborhood distance, the neighborhood effect (in terms of compatibility, 

dependency, and compactness) is defined according to:

uses. It should be noted that the land-use categories employed in this study include residential, commercial, fa-

cilities, and green space/park uses, classified into regional, district, and local levels based on their service level.

3.2 | Various temporal dynamics and scenarios

In this study, the time dimension is considered based on the duration, discrete-time, and continuous-time concepts. 

In duration-based modeling, the planning period is considered as a 10-year time interval, and in the discrete concep-

tion, time is identified as a sequence of 1-year time steps. In the continuous (event-driven) models, events may occur

ABOLHASANI ANd TALEAI    |  9

at any time, and after every event, the states of the entities are updated and an asynchronous updating method is 

achieved. Since the basic logic of allocating land use in ParCA is to meet land-use demand, the amount of demanded 

land is calculated annually, using statistical population data for each year and based on the land per capita standards.

In this research, transfer of undeveloped parcels to commercial, residential, facilities, and park uses is considered 

as the transition states. In practice, urban land uses are allocated based on two methods: (a) the priority of land-use 

types; and (b) the maximum suitability of each undeveloped parcel for any of the abovementioned land-use types. 

In this research, each parcel has four suitability values, regarding the considered land-use types. In the first method, 

the priority of land-use types is determined based on the urban planners’ point of view and then undeveloped par-

cels are ranked from highest to lowest based on the suitability value for land-use type with the highest priority (e.g. 

commercial use as first priority) and undeveloped parcels are allocated to land-use type with the first priority to 

meet the projected demand. Next, the mentioned process will be carried out for the land-use type with second pri-

ority, and so on. The priority order used in this research is commercial, residential, parks, and facilities (Pettit, 2002).

In the second method, parcels are allocated to land use according to the maximum suitability value. In other 

words, all suitability values, regardless of land-use type, are ranked from highest to lowest and then the undevel-

oped parcel with the highest suitability value is allocated to a land-use type which offers the highest suitability 

value for the parcel. In case of equal suitability values for several land-use types, allocation of parcels will be ac-

complished based on the priority of land-use types (the same as the first method). In both methods, undeveloped 

parcels are assigned to one of the mentioned land uses to meet the projected demand.

Drawing upon the mentioned items, eight different urban growth scenarios are generated to investigate the 

impact of temporal dynamics on the output of the models, as summarized in Table 1. The flow chart presented 

in  Figure  4  describes  the  AParCA  model  for  the  first  land-use  allocation  method  [scenarios  II  (LP10-C)  and  IV 

(LP1-C)] and for the first priority (commercial use). Since parcels are allocated according to the priority of land 

uses (commercial, residential, park, and facilities) in these scenarios, the process of allocating and updating parcels 

is presented for commercial use, and it is understood that the other land uses are allocated in a similar way. In 

addition, the flow chart presented in Figure 5 demonstrates the AParCA model for the second land-use allocation 

method [scenarios VI (MS10-C) and VIII (MS1-C)].

(LP1-C)] for the first priority (commercial use)

in Tehran, with a population growth rate of 6.85% per year. The size of the study area allows a detailed survey on 

land-use interactions and neighborhood characteristics. Since this area is not yet completely developed, there is 

still a chance to provide a more consistent urban plan, as a proposed master plan. Apart from census data such 

as population and annual population growth rate, the major data set used in this research consisted of the parcel 

data of the study area, classified into five land-use types: residential, commercial, facilities, green space/parks, 

and accessibility network.

As a first step, the automatic subdivision tool was employed to create a parcel-based space. In this research, 

the size of the newly subdivided parcels was determined using the norms utilized in the available urban plan of the

F I G U R E   5  Flow chart for the AParCA model [scenarios VI (MS10-C) and VIII (MS1-C)]

case study area. The number of parcels in the study area was 862, and the number of newly subdivided parcels 

was 209. Figure 6a presents a view of the land-use status quo and Figure 6b shows the parceled area.

In  order  to  obtain  an  initial  transition  potential  value  (suitability)  for  each  parcel,  according  to  Equation  (1) 

and the explanations given in Section 3.1.2, the physical suitability, accessibility, and neighborhood effect values 

are combined. Since the neighborhood effect is classified into three components (i.e. compatibility, dependency, 

and compactness), these factors are computed with respect to the target land use, land uses in the neighborhood 

distance,  and  their  service  levels,  according  to  Equation  (2).  Then,  the  three  factors  are  aggregated  based  on 

Equation (3). Due to the different performance of land uses, different relative importance values of compatibility,

F I G U R E   6  A view of: (a) land-use status quo; and (b) Pareceled area

dependency,  and  compactness  are  employed  for  different  types  of  land  use,  based  on  expert  knowledge.  For 

example, since the attraction of similar land uses (compactness) is more important than compatibility and depen-

dency, for residential and commercial use relative weights of 0.58, 0.24, and 0.18 were applied to the mentioned 

factors, respectively (Karimi et al., 2012). In contrast, with respect to the proper distribution of facilities and park 

use within the study area, the dependency factor is more significant than compatibility, and compactness is con-

sidered as a neutral factor to prevent aggregating facilities and park use. Hence, weights of 0.7, 0.3, and 0 were 

applied to the dependency, compatibility, and compactness, respectively. A more detailed account of the model 

implementation is given in Abolhasani et al. (2016).

To assess the different degrees of temporal dynamics, various scenarios were applied to the initial suitability. 

Figures 7‒10 show the results of the scenarios. In scenarios I (LP10) and V (MS10), involving the least temporal dy-

namics, the demand for each land use is estimated over a 10-year time interval, all changes occur simultaneously, 

and interactions among them are not considered. Figures 7a and 9a show the simulation results of scenarios I and 

V. In scenarios II (LP10-C) and VI (MS10-C), demand is estimated over a 10-year time interval, whereas parcels 

are allocated one after another and their influences on their neighbors are considered. In other words, after every 

event, the suitability scores of the neighbors are updated. Figures 7b and 9b show the application of scenarios II 

and VI.

Scenarios III (LP1) and VII (MS1) represent finer temporal resolution (a sequence of 1-year time steps). The 

interactions among parcels are updated at the end of each iteration (every year). Figures 8a and 10a show the 

results of scenarios III and VII. Scenarios IV (LP1-C) and VIII (MS1-C) represent the maximum degree of temporal 

resolution. As well as demand being estimated for every time step, events occur sequentially; every event distrib-

utes some effects to its neighbors in the neighborhood distance, and suitability scores are updated continuously.

This study has assessed the impact of various degrees of temporal dynamics on urban growth, in order to simulate 

urban dynamics more realistically and overcome the limitations of classical CA. The effect of different temporal

resolutions  on  the  spatial  pattern  generated  by  the  ParCA  model  is  obvious  from  a  visual  comparison  among 

Figures 7‒10. As can be seen in Figures 7a and 9a, due to the application of synchronous CA over a 10-year dura-

tion, land uses were allocated in clusters. In scenarios II and VI (Figures 7b and 9b), although asynchronous CA 

was employed and the suitability of parcels was updated after every event, due to the simulation over a 10-year

duration, land uses were also developed in clusters. Figures 8a and 10a (scenarios III and VII) show a higher degree 

of temporal dynamics, with different types of land uses allocated in a sequence of 1-year time steps. Since suitabil-

ity scores are updated at the end of every year, dispersed growth is seen in these maps. As can be seen in Figures

8b  and  10b,  due  to  the  employment  of  the  continuous-time  concept  and  the  asynchronous  updating  method, 

these scenarios result in compact growth, which is favorable in terms of urban planning.

Since the aim of this study is to investigate the role of time in providing an optimal land-use plan for urban 

growth,  indicators  such  as  compatibility,  dependency,  and  compactness  can  be  employed  to  clarify  potentially 

problematic aspects of the projected land-use plan that can arise through the implementation, and to evaluate 

the properties of the proposed plan (Abolhasani et al., 2016; Masoomi et al., 2013; Taleai et al., 2007, 2014). In 

this study, the mean values of compatibility, dependency, and compactness were calculated for eight scenarios, in 

order to compare the results of the scenarios and determine the most appropriate method for urban growth simu-

lation, in terms of urban land-use planning. Table 2 shows the means of the normalized values of the above factors 

for the eight scenarios. In total, Table 2 shows that in all the scenarios, utilizing asynchronous (event-driven) CA 

models leads to better results than duration or discrete CA models [e.g. comparing scenarios VI (MC10) and VII 

(MC10-C) 8 out of 10 items, and comparing scenarios VII (MS1) and VIII (MS1-C) all items increased].

To  demonstrate  the  advantages  of  the  application  of  asynchronous  CA  in  comparison  to  synchronous  CA, 

scenarios similar in terms of time interval and allocation method (e.g. scenarios I and II or scenarios VII and VIII) 

should be compared. In addition, to assess the effect of various time intervals, the scenarios that are only different 

in the time interval should be analyzed (e.g. scenarios I and III or scenarios V and VII). The minor changes in value 

of  Tables  2  and  3  occur  because  of  competition  among  parcels  for  allocation  into  different  land-use  types,  as 

the suitability values of parcels are slightly different for various land-use types. Although significant changes are 

evidenced and considerable in various layouts of land uses in Figures 7‒10, their compatibility, dependency, and 

compactness factors in Tables 2 and 3 show minor changes.

As can be seen in Table 2, the application of a sequence of 1-year time steps instead of a 10-year time interval 

(e.g. scenarios III and IV in comparison to scenarios I and II) caused a reduction in compatibility, dependency, and 

compactness of residential use. Because all projected land uses over 10 years were allocated simultaneously, and 

residential use had second priority, therefore all residential uses were allocated in the most suitable parcels and 

there was no conflict among residential parcels. In contrast, when the model time interval changed to a sequence 

of time steps, facility use had the opportunity to be allocated to parcels with higher suitability, causing the com-

patibility and dependency of facility use to increase in scenarios III and IV in comparison to scenarios I and II. A 

similar interpretation can be arrived at for the case of scenarios V and VI in comparison to scenarios VII and II, 

because in this case study, the maximum suitability occurred for residential use.

In various scenarios, the values of compatibility, dependency, and compactness increased for some land uses 

and decreased for others. Therefore, a general evaluation of scenarios is given in Table 3. In this table, the means 

of the compatibility, dependency, compactness, and neighborhood effect are given for all newly allocated parcels. 

As seen in Table 3, application of asynchronous CA leads to a better result than synchronous CA. Furthermore, 

using the various temporal resolutions—such as a sequence of 1-year time steps and a 10-year time interval—leads 

to influential effects in the results.

Considering that the neighborhood effect arises from the aggregation of compatibility, dependency, and com-

pactness, and in scenario VIII (MS1-C) the neighborhood effect takes the maximum value among all scenarios, 

as a result, the most appropriate scenario to present an urban land-use plan is scenario VIII for this specific case 

study, which allocates land uses based on maximum suitability, in the sequence of 1-year time steps, under the 

continuous (event-driven) conception of time.

Table 4 illustrates the importance of the application of asynchronous CA models. In this table, the scores of 

compatibility,  dependency,  compactness,  and  neighborhood  effect  are  shown  for  an  undeveloped  parcel  (indi-

cated in Figure 11), which has been developed in the tenth year, regarding the demand assessed for every year. 

The presented scores refer to scenario VIII, where the maximum suitability allocation method is applied in a se-

quence of 1-year time steps with the continuous-time definition (asynchronous updating method).

As can be seen in Table 4, as a result of allocating various land uses in the neighborhood distance of the sub-

ject parcel, the scores for the factors mentioned are changed in every time step. While the most suitable land use

F I G U R E   1 1  The subject parcel specified to track the scores of compatibility, dependency, compactness, and 
neighborhood effects for various steps

for the subject parcel was commercial use in the first year, it was developed for residential use in the tenth year, 

because of the effects exerted by various land uses developed during earlier time steps. This corresponds to what 

happens in reality.

This study can be considered as a continuation of and improvement in the methodology employed in other 

asynchronous  CA  models  for  land-use  modeling  and  urban  growth  simulation,  such  as  the  works  by  Liu  and 

Andersson  (2004)  and  Ke  et  al.  (2016).  In  the  research  undertaken  by  Liu  and  Andersson  (2004),  only  visual 

comparison was used to assess the results, and the comparative advantages of the application of different time 

definitions are unclear. In our study, however, factors such as compatibility, dependency, compactness, and neigh-

borhood  effect  have  been  employed  to  evaluate  the  results  and  to  show  the  comparative  benefits  of  various 

scenarios. Furthermore, in the research undertaken by Ke et al. (2016), the study area was divided into several 

sub-regions and different evolution rates were used. Thus, in every partition of the study area, synchronous CA 

was employed, and the effects exerted by newly developed cells did not affect the state of surrounding cells in the 

following steps. While it does not matter whether the changes are synchronous or asynchronous, the interactions 

among newly developed and existing entities do result in problems (Liu & Andersson, 2004).

This study mainly aimed to reveal the impact of the application of various temporal scenarios and time concepts 

[duration, discrete, and continuous (event-driven)] on the results of urban growth simulation, in terms of urban 

land-use planning. Due to the asynchronous nature of phenomena proven by recent research (Baetens et al., 2012;  

ABOLHASANI ANd TALEAI    |  21

Bandman, 2010; Cornforth et al., 2005; Kim, 2013), an AParCA model was employed to overcome the restric-

tions  of  classical  CA  models  and  to  correspond  more  closely  to  realistic  land-use  interaction  processes  (Liu  & 

Andersson, 2004; Stevens & Dragićević, 2007). In order to evaluate the ability of asynchronous CA for producing 

and predicting current urban growth trends, different assumptions from those are considered in this article and 

data of different time intervals are required. Assessment of the eight implemented scenarios confirmed that tem-

poral dynamics have a substantial effect on the behavior of the model, and the asynchronous (event-driven) CA 

models achieved better results than synchronous models.

The ability of the AParCA model to present a comprehensive set of urban land-use dynamics, and to delete 

the boundaries between time steps, is the unique contribution of this work, as it considers time as a continuous 

current broken by events. Understanding the process of varying simulation outcomes based on the model com-

ponents enables urban planners to evaluate the various advantages and disadvantages of the model, and hence 

to employ the model in a suitable context. Moreover, the AParCA model can be employed as a spatial decision 

support tool in the context of evaluating various temporal dynamic scenarios.

The  AParCA  model  has  been  developed  as  a  generic  approach  and  can  be  employed  in  other  case  studies 

with the parcel structure. However, in this research, an available master plan in the case study area is utilized to 

set some thresholds for simulating urban land-use planning such as population growth, land per capita, restric-

tion of altitude, slope, the neighborhood distance of the subject parcel with various land-use types, and so on. 

Furthermore, in this study, the suitability factor, which is the aggregation of physical land characteristics, accessi-

bility, and neighborhood effect parameters, could be defined as the attractiveness of the parcel; meanwhile, com-

bining new parameters (like the distance of the edge of town, the effect of air and noise pollution, etc.) requires 

further research.

Assessing the role of the different definitions of time on urban land-use planning is an extremely complicated 

issue, especially for urban systems, and it is necessary to investigate various aspects. For example, spatial and 

temporal processes cannot be clearly separated, and the temporal dimension of an urban land-use model is strictly 

related to the different components of the model, such as the rate of population growth, the speed of land-use 

changes, and the spatial scale of the study area. Therefore, future research on the proposed model might include 

discovering the relationships between the mentioned components and the proper temporal resolution of land-use 

models to enable them to correspond more closely to reality. It should be noted that the proper temporal resolu-

tion should be chosen by considering the purpose of the modeling or simulation exercise and the planning policies 

of the study area, since finer temporal resolution is not always better.

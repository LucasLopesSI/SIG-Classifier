Abstract. Spatially coincident land-cover information frequently varies due to
technological and political variations. This is especially problematic for time-
series analyses. We present an approach using expert expressions of how the
semantics of different datasets relate to integrating temporal time series land-
cover information where the classiﬁcation classes have fundamentally changed.
We use land-cover mapping in the UK (LCMGB and LCM2000) as example
data sets because of the extensive object-based meta-data in the LCM2000.
Inconsistencies between the two datasets can arise from random, gross and
systematic error and from an actual change in land cover. Locales of possible
land-cover change are inferred by comparing characterizations derived from the
semantic relations and meta-data. Field visits showed errors of omission to
be 21% and errors of commission to be 28%, despite the accuracy limitations of
the land-cover information when compared with the ﬁeld survey component of
the Countryside Survey 2000.

Introduction
The process of natural resource inventory takes place against a background of
change which may result
in inconsistency. Human understanding within the
scientiﬁc ﬁeld, which is the subject of the inventory, may well vary as may the
policy initiative under which the inventory occurs. The methods by which
the inventory could be conducted may be revised, and the nature of the resource at
a location may change (Comber et al. 2003a). These different changes necessitate
the re-inventory of an area after a number of years. In geological mapping and soil
survey changes in understanding and methods are the most important reasons for

re-inventory. In the study of land use and land cover, the main incentive for
remapping is that the use or cover itself may have changed, but at the same time
there may be alterations to the methods of analysis. Changes in methodology make
it difﬁcult to separate changes in the phenomenon being measured (such as land
cover) from changes that are the result of the revised methodology; that is to say,
ontological inconsistency may be a problem for change detection. This discord
causes problems for research that seeks to develop time series of land cover or land
use to monitor environmental change and for initiatives that aim to react to
environmental change.

The issue of dataset inconsistency is endemic to resource inventory and should
be unsurprising to many involved in the activity. First, different surveys at the same
instance in time may record nominally similar features (such as land cover), but
may do so in completely different ways due to their particular institutional or,
indeed, personal perspectives. Second, different surveys at different points in time
would not be expected to record objects of interest (such as patches of land cover)
in the same way because of scientiﬁc developments and new policy objectives
(Comber et al. 2002, 2003a).

The effect of changing methodologies is that much of the value of previous land
resource inventories is lost with each successive survey; each inventory becomes the
new baseline against which future changes are theoretically to be measured but, in
reality, never are and cannot be. Ideally, each successive methodological evolution
would be accommodated in a multi-layered derived dataset, presenting the previous
and the new approaches alongside each other. Often, constraints of time and money
prevent this.

In this paper, we describe an approach for integrating spatial data that
combines expert descriptions of how the semantics of different land-cover datasets
relate with object level spectral meta-data. This approach is applied to two satellite
derived land-cover surveys of the UK in order to identify inconsistency between the
datasets, a subset of which are locales of actual land-cover change.

2. Land cover and changing ontology
2.1. Land-cover mapping in the UK

One speciﬁc example of data dissimilarity caused by revision of methodology is
land-cover mapping in Great Britain, where land-cover inventories have been
conducted in 1990 and 2000: the Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCM1990,
also known as LCMGB) and the Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) (Fuller et al.
1994, 2002). Both surveys are based on similar data (composite winter and summer
satellite data) but contain signiﬁcant structural and thematic differences. LCM1990
records 25 Target land-cover classes selected by an expert panel and primarily
deﬁned using reﬂectance values with limited ancillary data; classiﬁcation was
carried out using a supervised maximum likelihood algorithm applied to each pixel.
The project demonstrated the viability of using satellite imagery to map land cover
in the UK. In contrast, LCM2000 records 26 Broad Habitats which were designed
to ﬁt into new policy obligations as a result of the Rio Earth Summit and
subsequent national and European Union legislation. The ‘expert panel’ of 1990
was expanded to a steering group that included a range of potential users. The
steering group then had to marry what was technically possible with that which was
politically suitable. LCM2000 identiﬁed land cover using a per-parcel supervised

maximum likelihood classiﬁcation algorithm. That is, a segmentation procedure
was used to divide the landscape into parcels that were more or less spectrally
homogeneous. Next, the ‘core’ of each parcel was extracted, where the core was
assumed to be homogeneous. The whole parcel was then classiﬁed on the mean
reﬂectance of this core. Knowledge-based corrections were applied to the data for
certain types of habitat (soil acidity masks to identify Acid, Neutral and Calcareous
grassland Broad Habitats; peat drift masks to identify areas of Bog) and to re-
classify parcels that were out of context (Fuller et al. 2002). Extensive meta-data are
attached to each LCM2000 parcel, including a description of the whole parcel
spectral heterogeneity,
the spectral subclass percentage, and some processing
history information, as described by Smith and Fuller (2002).

In Britain, at the time of writing, the only national land-cover datasets are the
LCM2000 and its predecessor, the LCM1990. Yet, because of the problems of
semantic and methodological difference, the 2000 dataset is accompanied by a
‘health warning’ against comparing it with its predecessor (Fuller et al. 2002). In the
research reported here, we are interested in identifying those locations where the
land covers are inconsistent between the two dates of classiﬁcation as a ﬁrst step in
identifying change.

2.2. Ontologies

LCM2000 is very different from LCM1990, not just in terms of its more readily
quantiﬁable aspects such as minimum mapping unit and its data structures, but also
with regard to the whole way that land cover in the UK is conceptualized. The
objects identiﬁed by each survey represent different paradigms about how the
landscape should be represented: similarly named classes have different semantics,
they have different meanings, and they represent different conceptualizations. In
short, LCM1990 and LCM2000 have different ontologies, where an ontology is
deﬁned as an explicit speciﬁcation of a conceptualization, and a conceptualization is
an abstract representation of the world (Gruber 1993, Guarino 1995).

the problem of

The recognition of

incompatible ontologies originates in
concepts of data sharing in computing science, where the translation ‘problem’ is
that an object described in one vocabulary may not correspond to the same object
in another vocabulary. In the ontologies approach, the capacity for data integration
and sharing depends on understanding the way in which the data are
conceptualized (Pundt and Bishr 2002). Necessarily,
this approach extends
beyond consideration of differences in data structure (such as pixel size or
minimum mapping units) and seeks
in object
conceptualization (as found in their semantics; Guarino 1995, Uschold and
Gruninger 1996).

to understand differences

We have used a knowledge engineering approach based on Look Up Tables
(henceforth LUTs) to encapsulate and manipulate what is known about the
semantic similarities and differences between the datasets. The aim is to overcome
the semantic stumbling blocks to interoperability by formalizing descriptions of
how the semantics of the 1990 dataset relate to those of 2000. The expert
descriptions in a Semantic LUT are compared with metadata descriptions of the
LCM2000 spectral heterogeneity from a Spectral LUT. It is worth noting that we
use the Level 3 LCM2000 product (that with the full set of published metadata) and
the standard (or only) product for 1990.

2.3. Change and inconsistency: preliminary work

In the work reported here, we are making no evaluation of the accuracy or
otherwise of either dataset. Rather, we are assessing the consistency of the 2000
classiﬁcation and attribution with how the land was classiﬁed in 1990. However,
inaccuracy in one or other product
is obviously one possible reason for
inconsistency.

Therefore, we deﬁne inconsistency in this context as whether the information for
a particular land-cover object (in this case a LCM2000 parcel) is inconsistent with
the cover types within that parcel in 1990 when viewed through the lens of the
Spectral and Semantic LUTs. If the semantic deﬁnition of the land-cover types at a
location in the 1990 map is inconsistent with those present in 2000, we can identify
two possible causes of the change. Either the cover type at one time or the other is
in error, or else the cover type on the ground has changed.

Previous analyses used a Euclidian distance calculated between two character-
izations of the parcel based on the Spectral and Semantic LUTs. Parcels with the
greatest distance (by proportion of the parcel area and in absolute terms) were
identiﬁed. The pattern of vector directions was found to be related to the level of
ontological change. This methodology is reported in full by Comber et al. (2003b,
2003c). Field visits showed that 26% of the parcels identiﬁed as inconsistent were
believed to have actually changed since 1990. We also identiﬁed situations with
meta-data inconsistencies (e.g. empty attribution ﬁelds) and small parcels that bore
no relation to landscape objects on the ground. Filters were developed to eliminate
such artefacts from analysis (Comber et al., 2003d). A second tranche of analyses
considered the ﬁltered data and identiﬁed a second set of inconsistent parcels based
on absolute vector distance (not proportion). Again, a sample of these was visited
in the ﬁeld. The results showed that 41% of these parcels were believed to have
actually changed since 1990. The remainder (59%) were due to inconsistencies
(errors of classiﬁcation) in either the 1990 or the 2000 dataset. This work is reported
in Comber et al. (in press b).

The aim of the present paper is to take the identiﬁcation of inconsistency and
change a step further. Using the knowledge gained from the ﬁeld visits about the
distribution of different types of inconsistency, the aim is to provide more robust
inferences about the distribution of change. Information from the visited parcels
from the Spectral and Semantic LUTs was used to predict inconsistency and to
provide statistics about the probability of parcels so identiﬁed as being locales of
actual change.

More recent approaches have focused on how derived land-cover information
may be integrated. Ahlqvist et al. (2000) used rough set theory to manage
uncertainty between spatially coincident but
semantically and conceptually
divergent data. An uncertain set
speciﬁed using an upper and lower
approximation to indicate extremes of certitude. Similarly, Kavouras and Kokla
(2002) applied concept lattices to map between the semantic concepts from different
data ontologies. Wyatt and Gerard (2001) proposed a standard set of attribute
classiﬁers to overcome semantic differences between land-cover classiﬁcations.
These solutions were for idealized cases, where the semantics of the problem were
well understood. For instance, concept lattices require clear, non-overlapping and
unambiguous identiﬁcation of the attribute semantics of each classiﬁcation scheme
to identify subcategory objects. Whilst this works well for the example presented by
the LCM1990 and
Kavouras and Kokla (2002; urban/industrial

deﬁnitions that overlap in various dimensions such as species composition,
biogeography and reﬂectance (Comber et al. 2001).

land use),

Frank (2001) describes a ﬁve-tier ontology for GIS to integrate different
ontologies in a uniﬁed system. Frank proposes consistency constraints, relating to
each ontological tier, to help integrate data from different sources. For instance, he
shows how appropriate formulations of reality must be selected according to the
process of interest and how observations must be checked using measurement-based
approaches. However,
the constancy constraints for Frank’s tier of socially
constructed reality are only applicable for that context—the problem in translating
different terms for lakes is given. Whilst the discussion provides a valuable insight
into relating data of different ontologies, its applicability to our problem is limited
by three factors. First, it is difﬁcult to test for consistency of the ‘knowledge’ of the
world as collected by different
individuals, agencies, organizations or other
‘cognitive agents’. Second, Comber et al. (2003a) have shown the LCM2000
classiﬁcation scheme to be more strongly socially constructed than that of
LCM1990. Third,
the ﬁve tiers and their consistency constraints provide a
framework for integrating different ontologies at design time, but they do not
provide a post hoc solution for reconciling data sets such as the LCM2000-to-
LCM1990 problem.

Devogele et al. (1998) formally correlate semantic concepts between the objects
of two databases by deﬁning correspondences. Once the correspondences have been
found, an integrated schema can be built. However, there is uncertainty about
relations between the LCM1990 and LCM2000 classiﬁcations and ambiguity in the
way in which some LCM2000 land-cover classes are deﬁned. The authors note that
there is the potential for semantic conﬂict, and interestingly, the ﬁnal decision about
the responsibility of database

administrators, based on their knowledge of the semantics of the data’ (Devogele et
al. 1998). In Devogele’s view, the database managers are the domain experts.

Establishing semantic linkages has consistently been identiﬁed as the bottleneck
in developing translation or integration ontologies. The methodology described in
the next two sections, which speciﬁcally addresses semantic relations, is suitable for
post hoc application to a problem where the semantics are not clearly understood.

4. Background
4.1. Preamble

The question we wanted to answer was whether

the LCM2000 parcel
represented a change compared with how the same area was classiﬁed in 1990.
Our approach was to exploit the LCM2000 parcel based meta-data and to compare
that with an inferred heterogeneity in LCM1990 data.

One of the LCM2000 attributes (‘PerPixList’) provides a description of the
parcel spectral heterogeneity,
listing the top ﬁve spectral subclasses within the
parcel. These meta-data were the result of a production stream that was completely
separate to, and independent of, the process by which the parcel was identiﬁed and
then classiﬁed. Of greater signiﬁcance was, ﬁrst, the methodological similarity
between LCM1990 and the PerPixList—both were the result of a standard
supervised per-pixel maximum likelihood classiﬁcation. Second, the PerPixList
subclasses are broadly equivalent to the subclasses from which the LCM1990
classes were aggregated. Third, accompanying the release of the standard Level 3
LCM2000 product was information about the expected overlap of the spectral
subclasses of PerPixList with the Broad Habitat classiﬁcation.

Therefore, PerPixList meta-data offered a thematic and methodological
equivalency with LCM1990. Information was available on how it related to the
LCM2000 parcel classes from which it was possible to construct a table of relations
between the spectral subclasses and Broad Habitat classes (i.e. LCM2000 meta-data
classes to LCM2000 Broad Habitat classes). The semantics of LCM2000 and
LCM1990 were related by an expert, familiar with both datasets. They described
the pairwise relations based on their understanding of the links between the
semantics of the two classiﬁcations. In both cases, the pairwise relations were
described in Look Up Tables (LUTs) scored to indicate those relationships that
should not occur (i.e. were unexpected), those which were ambivalent (i.e. were
uncertain) and those which should occur (i.e. were expected).

In summary, a direct comparison between LCM1990 and LCM2000 was not
possible. The LCM2000 meta-data offered an equivalency between the PerPixList
attribute (a record of parcel spectral heterogeneity) and the spectral subclasses from
which the LCM1990 Target classes were derived. The link between the PerPixList
spectral subclasses and the LCM2000 Broad Habitat classes was made by a
Spectral LUT from published information. The link relating LCM2000 classes to
LCM1990 classes was provided by an expert in a Semantic LUT. The LUTs
allowed the 26 LCM2000 Broad Habitat classes and the 25 LCM1990 Target
classes to be related via the PerPixList attribute. This is shown in ﬁgure 1.

4.2. Hypothesis

The Semantic and Spectral LUTs generated two characterizations of the parcel,
one showing the extent to which the PerPixList attributes related to the descriptions

of expected spectral overlap, the other indicating how many of the LCM1990 pixels
within the parcel would be Expected, Unexpected and Uncertain according to an
expert description of the semantics. Our hypothesis was that most parcels have not
changed, but those which have are those whose characterizations are very different
from the mean values for that Broad Habitat.

4.3. Parcel characterization

A triplet of (Unexpected, Expected, Uncertain) was calculated for each parcel,
which described how its coincident LCM1990 classes related to its LCM2000 Broad
Habitat class. Each intersecting LCM1990 pixel was compared in turn with the
Semantic LUT:

. If the LUT recorded an Expected relation, then the Expected score was

incremented by one.

incremented by one.

The second parcel triple was calculated by comparing the PerPixList attributes with
the Spectral LUT in the same way. Comparing the Unexpected and Expected scores
for 1990 and 2000 resulted in a 2-D vector for each parcel in that feature space.
Note that the Uncertain scores were ignored for the moment.

5. Methods

In all the work (current and previous), the LCM2000 and LCM1990 data were
for a 100 km by 100 km square corresponding to Ordnance Survey National Grid
square SK, which includes an area from Leicester in the south to Shefﬁeld in the
north.

The results of ﬁeld visits undertaken between December 2002 and March 2003,
which are described in Section 2.3, assessed whether the 1990 and 2000 classes could
have been correct and whether there had been any land-cover change in the period.
In a third programme of ﬁeld validation, we visited 200 further parcels at random
and assessed their 2000 Broad Habitat class and whether there was any evidence of
a change since 1990. In total, 361 parcels were visited.

The Semantic LUT was used to partition the visited parcels into subsets of

possible change and no change in the following way:

. Proportional changes in Expected and Unexpected scores between 1990 and
2000 were interpreted as measures of Belief and Disbelief in the hypothesis
that the cover types in a parcel had changed.

. A threshold derived from the combined Belief of the visited parcels were

applied to the entire dataset to identify other areas of change.

. Uncertain scores (from both LUTs) were used to generate further support for
possible change parcels. There was a higher belief in change for parcels with
the smallest Uncertain scores.

5.1. Analysis of visited parcel data

Each of the visited parcels was labelled in terms of whether change may have
occurred (yes or no) and whether the 1990 and 2000 datasets were thought to be
correct (yes or no). Five Broad Habitat classes that had at least ﬁve instances
(parcels) of change were used to determine the combined Belief threshold.

5.2. Data analysis

Parcels with an area less than 49 pixels (30 625 m2) were excluded because this is
the smallest parcel where the core area can exceed the periphery—parcel
classiﬁcation was made on the basis of the core area, but edge pixels are known
to be particularly heterogeneous (Fuller et al. 2002). For each of the ﬁve Broad
Habitat classes, each parcel with an area greater than 49 pixels was treated in the
following way:

699

. Proportional changes in the Unexpected (DU) and Expected (DE) scores

between 1990 and 2000 were calculated.

. Uncertain scores at both times were derived.
. Therefore, two values of Belief and Disbelief in a hypothesis of parcel change
were generated from a standard cumulative distribution function using the
class mean and standard deviation for DU and DE.

. The beliefs and disbeliefs were combined using the Dempster–Shafer theory of

evidence.

. Uncertainty information was used to generate further support for belief in the

hypothesis that the parcels may have changed.

Calculation of parcel DU and DE and Uncertain scores.

The parcel scores for 1990 described the number of LCM1990 pixels that were
considered to be Unexpected, Expected and Uncertain by the expert, as indicated in
the Semantic LUT. For example, consider a LCM2000 parcel of Acid Grassland
Broad Habitat with intersecting LCM1990 pixels, as shown in table 1. The 1990
scores are determined by calculating the proportion of pixels that represent each
type of relation. In this case the parcel has an Unexpected score of 0.36 (161/446),
an Expected score of 0.40 (178/446) and an Uncertain score of 0.24 (107/446).
Scores are calculated from the parcel PerPixList attribute using the relations
contained in the Spectral LUT. Table 2 shows the percentage of the top 5 spectral
subclasses for the same example parcel. The Unexpected, Expected and Uncertain
proportions are 0.32, 0.42 and 0.25 respectively.

The proportional changes in the Unexpected (DU) and Expected (DE) scores
between 1990 and 2000 were calculated. The scores for DU and DE were converted
into Beliefs in a hypothesis of parcel change with a standard cumulative distribution
function using the class mean and standard deviation for DU and DE. For the
Broad Habitat class of Acid Grassland, the mean was 0.299, and the standard
deviation was 0.321. The calculation of the Beliefs in DU and DE is shown in
table 3.

Uncertain scores were treated slightly differently because some classes had no
Uncertain relations indicated in one or both of the LUTs. Where they did,
Uncertain scores in 2000 and in 1990 were calculated for each parcel via the

‘Low’ if they were less than the 25th percentile of the distribution for that Broad
Habitat class, ‘High’ otherwise. Where no Uncertain relations were indicated in
either LUT, the parcel uncertainty was characterized as ‘None’. Table 4 describes
how the Uncertain characterizations were combined to give qualitative statements
of the change in Uncertain scores, DQ.

5.3. Calculating combined Belief

Dempster–Shafer was used to combine beliefs from DU and DE because it is the
only theory of evidence which allows for the explicit representation of uncertainty.
Dempster–Shafer requires a pair of functions to assess a proposition: the belief
function (Bel) and the plausibility function (Pls). The uncertainty (Unc) is the
difference between the plausibility and belief. The belief is therefore a lower
estimate of the support for a proposition, and the plausibility an upper bound, or
conﬁdence band. Disbelief (Dis) is 1 – Pls. They are related in the following way:
BelzDiszUnc~1

The greater the increase in the Expected score (that is, a positive DE), the higher
our Belief that the parcel has changed; similarly, the more the Unexpected score has
decreased (that is, negative DU), the higher our Belief that the parcel has changed.
Since values of DE and DU are both close to a Gaussian distribution, we
approximate a Belief value from the appropriate cumulative distribution function.

Our hypothesis was that the parcel has changed. The only alternative was that it
had not. Therefore, in this step, there was no uncertainty to be allocated to the
frame of discernment or set of other competing hypotheses. Thus, in this case,
Disbelief is 1 –Belief, and Uncertainty is zero. Because the uncertainty is zero, this
is equivalent to negation in standard probability theory.

Equations (2) and (3) allow a measure of combined belief and disbelief in a
hypothesis of change to be calculated (equation (4)) for the data in table 3, for the
example parcel.

5.4. Abstract from visited parcels to population

The combined Belief (from DU and DE) was calculated for all parcels in SK. We
extracted the values for the parcels that have been visited. Visited parcels were
identiﬁed as correct change or correct no change. Placing each parcel into histogram
bins of combined belief values provided a simple way to partition the data and
identify a threshold for change. The threshold was applied to the entire dataset to
identify areas of possible change.

5.5. Filter using changes in Uncertain scores

Parcels of possible change identiﬁed from the combined evidence of DE and DU
were given further ‘Strong’ support where ‘Low’ or ‘None’ Uncertain scores
occurred at both times. In these cases, most of the weight of evidence from the
Semantic and Spectral LUTs was partitioned into Unexpected and Expected scores,
and where no uncertainty was indicated in either (or both) of the LUTs, DU and
DE were exclusive.

6. Results
6.1. Analysis of ﬁeld data

The distribution of the combined Belief (from DU and DE) for change for the
visited parcels is shown in table 5. The distributions indicate that the data can be
partitioned by selecting a threshold for change, and from this, errors of commission
and omission determined. Selecting a threshold of §0.9 Belief in a hypothesis of
change results in an error of omission of 21% and error of commission of 28%.
That is, the threshold of change of 0.9 correctly partitions 75% of the (error free)
visited sites (26z26 out of 69).

6.2. Abstracting from ﬁeld data—identifying change

The thresholds were applied to the LCM2000 data to identify possible change
parcels (i.e. those with Belief above the threshold). An area to the north of Shefﬁeld

is shown by way of illustration, which has a mixture of rural and urban land-cover
types and changes to woodland Broad Habitats (‘Coniferous Woodland’ and
‘Broadleaved Woodland’) and to the Broad Habitat of
‘Suburban Rural
Development’. This area has been subject to de-industrialization, road building
with concomitant increased roadside verges, numbers of nature reserves and
country parks.

Woodland Broad Habitats

Parcels identiﬁed as possible changes are shown in ﬁgure 2. No uncertain
relations for Coniferous Woodland and Broadleaved Woodlands Broad Habitats
were indicated in the LUTs, and no ﬁltering due to differences in Uncertain scores
was possible. The parcels in ﬁgures 2a and 2b are those identiﬁed purely on the
threshold of belief described above, ﬁgure 2c shows the distribution of 1990 grass
classes in red, and ﬁgure 2d shows heath classes in purple. There are two patterns:

1. The major area of existing woodland identiﬁed in 1990 in the south-eastern
corner is now a nature reserve. Possible change parcels have been identiﬁed
at its fringes.

2. New woodland areas have been established in a country park, running

northwest to southeast, just to the north of the suburban area.

In both cases, the change to woodland in 2000 is from grass and heath classes as
local recreational woodland activity increased. Conﬁrmation of this change is
provided by the Ordnance Survey backdrop, showing areas of woodland.

Suburban Broad Habitat

Parcels identiﬁed as changes are shown in ﬁgure 3. The main urban area is the
villages of Chapeltown and High Green. Without the ﬁltering, a large number of
Suburban and Rural Development Broad Habitat parcels are identiﬁed as having
changed (ﬁgure 3a and b). Filtering for Low Uncertain scores at both times
eliminated many of the parcels (ﬁgure 3c). Most of the changes are from the
LCM1990 arable class of ‘Tilled Land’ (ﬁgure 3d), which is intuitively correct, as
urban developments in small towns are likely to be at the fringes of existing urban

areas, where arable areas are likely to be found. However,
the pattern of
distribution of the LCM1990 arable class in the urban area would suggest that there
has been some spectral confusion in 1990 between arable and suburban classes.

Previous work has shown the use of semantic and spectral LUTs to be

moderately successful
in press b). Major
failures were found to be due to error in either LCM1990 and/or LCM2000,
typically due to common spectral confusions. In this work, we have described an
approach that extends the application of these expressions of expert opinion in
order to predict speciﬁc locales of
land-cover change as a component of
inconsistency between LCM1990 and LCM2000.

Any data comparison will always be subject to the limitations of data accuracy.
If 2 maps are 75% accurate, then a priori analysis reliability will be limited to just
over 55% success. Analysis of maps that record very different land-cover features in
very different ways and have very different conceptualizations of the objects they
seek to record will be further limited by such ontological differences. Because of

these problems of semantic and methodological difference, the 2000 dataset is
accompanied with a ‘health warning’ against comparing it with its predecessor for
change detection (Fuller et al. 2002). Whilst we expect many of the parcels
identiﬁed as having changed by this methodology to be false positives (for a
hypothesis of change) from the ﬁeld visits we are able to provide some measure of
conﬁdence in the form of errors of omission and commission. For instance, we
would expect 21% parcels that had actually changed to be missed by this approach,
and 28% of the parcels identiﬁed as having changed to not have done so. Given the
stated accuracy of the data when compared with a sample ﬁeld survey, these results
are very encouraging.

Overcoming the data dissimilarity of LCM1990 and LCM2000 has raised a
number of other issues. First, given the possibility of data error at either time, it is
important to consider the individual context within which a possible change is
identiﬁed. Apparent changes from arable to urban in the middle of a town are likely
to be a data artefact originating in spectral similarity of the two classes, whereas
changes from grass to woodland represent a much more spectrally distinct change.

705

It is not difﬁcult to see how some simple rules could be developed and applied to
ﬁlter possible spurious changes.

Second, where there are such spectral confusions, we might be able to identify
the type of evidence or data that would enable more robust inferences of urban
change (for example) to be made. Such ‘Task Oriented’ approaches (i.e. not relying
solely on the remotely sensed data to extract as much information as possible, but
considering the nature of the problem in hand) to land-cover change have been
recommended by workers in remote sensing such as Foody (2002) and implemented
in the work of Skelsey et al. (in press) and Comber et al. (in press a). Remotely
sensed data (and their derived products) are considered as only one of a number of
useful datasets that can contribute to solving the problem.

A third issue is the different degrees of ontological change for different classes
between LCM1990 and LCM2000. Woodland Broad Habitat classes are deﬁned in
broadly similar terms to their LCM1990 counterparts, whereas there are subtle but
signiﬁcant differences between the LCM1990 deﬁnition of the ‘Suburban/Rural
Development’ Target class and the LCM2000 deﬁnition of the ‘Suburban/Rural
Development’ Broad Habitat. These differences are reﬂected in the Semantic and
Spectral LUTs which contain no pairwise relations that were Uncertain for the
woodland Broad Habitats, and some that were for the Suburban ones.

7.2. Discussion of the method

land-cover

LCM1990 and LCM2000 provide very different

information
regardless of any change on the ground. They have different minimum mapping
units, have different accuracy distributions and record landscape features through
land cover in very different ways. In most cases, direct comparison is precluded as
the impacts of structural difference mean that attempts to relate any signal
contained in each dataset get lost in the noise of dissimilarity. Fuller et al. (2003)
comment on one way forward as being that: ‘the vector structure of LCM2000
could be used to interrogate LCMGB (LCM1990) raster data and determine the
previous cover dominance for each LCM2000 land parcel’ (Fuller et al. 2003, 251).
In this context, both the LCM1990 pixels that intersect with the LCM2000 parcel
and the parcel spectral heterogeneity provide comparable, independent descriptions
of the parcel.

The method described here adopts the strategy outlined by Fuller et al. (2003)
and extends it by incorporating some of the extensive LCM2000 object-based meta-
it obviates extensive and sometimes tortuous probabilistic
data. In so doing,
analyses of data characteristics combined to account for structural differences
between the datasets. Such integration models do not exist. Whilst the results and
analysis may be seen to rely on conjecture or anecdote in the form of the Semantic
LUT, it is precisely because the representational issues are both irreconcilable and
impenetrable that we have developed this method.

7.3. Future work

We have applied a Semantic LUT of an informed User under a scenario of
idealized ‘semantic relations’, that is, one based on an understanding of how
consistent the deﬁnitions (or concepts) behind the land-cover class labels are.
However, other LUTs are possible from different perspectives:

Downloaded by [Dalhousie University] at 03:57 05 March 2015 706

A. Comber et al.

. semantic LUTs can be provided by different experts;
. a ‘change’ LUT can indicate the transitions that an expert might expect to see

happen to a land-cover class over time;

. a ‘technical’ LUT can describe some of the common technical

issues of

satellite-image classiﬁcation such as spectral confusion.

Future work will consider how further evidence about change from these sources
can be combined.

8. Conclusions

We have shown that it is possible to reason about change using expressions of
expert opinion of how the dataset semantics relate. We have robustly overcome
ontological discord and identiﬁed locales of change with conﬁdence limits. In the
process, some of the wider issues of using remotely sensed data to identify land
cover have been highlighted, conﬁrming the need for contextual information to be
incorporated into remote-sensing analyses.

The UK land-cover mapping example shows that despite many and varied
differences between the datasets,
it is possible to combine data of different
ontological pedigrees for speciﬁc applications. Any approach working with satellite-
derived land-cover information that records moderate ecological detail such as
LCM2000 and LCM1990, however, will be limited by the accuracy of the data as
reported by many papers in the remote sensing literature.

Future land-cover mapping exercises in the UK and elsewhere will record the
landscape in different ways due to technological and political developments
(Comber et al. 2003a). It is only possible to develop solutions to overcome these
data limitations where data producers communicate some of their understanding
and knowledge of the data in the form of metadata. The Centre for Ecology and
Hydrology are to be lauded for including detailed object-based process history and
measures of thematic heterogeneity as part of their standard products.

InSAR 

instrumentation  have  been  used,
(Interferometric
includ ing 
Synthetic Aperture Radar), GPS (Global
Positioning  System),  differential  level-
ling,  extensometers,  piezometers,  etc.
InSAR relies on satellite images taken at
different  times.  The  images  are  then
processed  to  reveal  relative  ground-
ele v ation  change  over  time.  InSAR  is
preferred  for  projects  covering  large
areas because of its cost and image pro-
cessing. In comparison, an extensometer
measures the compaction and expansion
of the aquifer system to a specified depth.
It is ideal to have extensometer measure-
ments  as  well;  yet,  considering  drilling
and  the  expense  for  the  device  itself,
these cost a great deal in terms of invest-
ment. A piezometer is a specialized well
that  is  used  to  measure  water  levels  at
specific  depths.  Again,  installation  of
piezometers 
expensive.
Differential levelling using automatic or
digital level is a precise way of obtaining
elevation  information,  provided  that  the
benchmarks used are outside of the sub-
sidence zone. This technique allows car-
rying elevation from a known benchmark
to  other  points  of  interest  with  high
pre ci sion.  However,  it  is  not  a  fea sible

rather 

is 

technique for large project areas covering
a  state  or  a  continent  since  it  requires
sur vey  crews  to  take  measurements  one
setup at a time along roads, railroads, etc.
When  obtaining  information  on  large
scales, the use of GPS is more efficient.
GPS  provides  three-dimensional  posi-
tioning of a point wherein, by observing
variations 
coordinate,
in  vertical 
sub si dence is determined.

In  this  study,  elevations  along  a
canal in Madera County, California are
determined  using  GPS,  RTK  (Real
Time  Kinematic)  GPS,  Network  RTK
and  differential  levelling.  In  addition,
subsidence in the area is examined.

2.  Methods

Currently,  differential  levelling  is
accomplished  using  an  automatic  or
digital level along with one or two lev-
elling  rods.  A  level  is  attached  to  a
tri pod,  and  rod  readings  are  taken  by
observing  the  rods  held  on  backsight
and  foresight  points.  The  basic  proce-
dure is illustrated in Figure 1. The level
is  set  up  approximately  halfway
between  the  points.  Assume  that  the

1. Introduction

Subsidence 

is  a  phenomenon
across  the  globe.  According  to  USGS
(United  States  Geological  Survey)  in
the  U.S.A.,  California,  Texas  and
Florida are the states that suffer from it
most. The major source of subsidence is
exploitation  of  groundwater.  Due  to
groundwater  depletion,  the  water  layer
that  holds  the  ground  disappears  and
rocks compact. If this compaction hap-
pens in a small area, subsidence appears
in the form of a sinkhole. If compaction
covers large areas like the central valley
in California, it makes itself visible as a
small land drop over time.

According to USGS, subsidence has
been a major concern in the central valley
of  California  since  the  1950s.  Growing
populations  and  demand  on  agriculture
increased  the  use  of  groundwater  in  the
valley,  thereby  exacerbating  the  already
dire  situation.  USGS  studies  indicated
that by 1970, significant land subsidence
(more than 30 cm) had occurred in about
half  of  the  valley,  or  about  13 450  km2,
and, locally, some areas had subsided by
as much as 8.5 m. Reduced surface-water
availability  during  1976–77,  1986–92,
2007–09  and  2012–15  caused  increases
in  groundwater  pumping,  declines  in
water  levels  to  near  or  beyond  historic
lows,  and  renewed  aquifer  compaction.
In  the  central  valley,  subsidence  has
caused costly infrastructure damage such
as canal buckling and reduced freeboard
on canals and bridges. At some points, up
to  28 cm  of 
land  subsidence  was
meas ured from 2012 to 2015.

Scientists  have  been  putting  effort
into monitoring and understanding subsi-
dence. For this purpose, various types of

lev elling  the  instrument,  backsight  and
foresight  rod  readings  are  taken.  Height
difference (ΔhAB) between these points is
calculated  as  ΔhAB = backsight – fore-
sight. Finally, the elevation of point B is
calculated as HB = HA + ΔhAB.

With  differential  levelling,  monu-
mented  points  called  benchmarks  are
used. Heights of these points are usually
given with respect to mean sea level, or
more  precisely,  the  geoid  (Figure  2).
Mean  sea  level  is  established  through
the  use  of  tide  gauges,  and  elevations
are  determined  working  inland  from  a
tide  gauge.  Levelling  lines  are  usually
along  roads  or  railways  due  to  the
nature of the measurements. This means
that  elevations  of  benchmarks  are
orthometric heights.

GPS  provides  latitude,  longitude
and  ellipsoidal  height  of  a  point.
Ellipsoidal  height  is  determined  with
respect  to  WGS84  (World  Geodetic

System 1984) ellipsoid, since GPS uses
WGS84  ellipsoid  as  the  reference
(National  Geodetic
datum.  NGS 
Survey)  has  been  producing  geoid
mod els  to  convert  ellipsoidal  height
obtained  from  GPS  to  orthometric
height  of  a  specific  vertical  datum.  In
the  conterminous  United  States,  North
American  Vertical  Datum  of  1988
(NAVD 88) is used, wherein by generat-
ing refined geoid models, NGS provides
geoidal height N, which is the height of
the  geoid  from  the  reference  ellipsoid
(Figure 2).

h = H + N

(1)

where  h  is  ellipsoidal  height,  H  is
orthometric  height  and  N  is  geoidal
height. Therefore, in using this formula
one  can  move  from  ellipsoidal  height
to orthometric height or vice versa.

RTK  GPS  has  been  widely  used  in
surveying.  Yet,  in  RTK  GPS,  as  the

dis tance  between  the  rover  and  the
ref er ence  station  increases,  the  atmos-
pheric  conditions at  the  rover  and
ref er ence  station  become  increasingly
different.  This  decreases  the  accuracy
and makes it more difficult for the rover
to  fix  the  ambiguities.  To  extend  the
capabilities  of  RTK  positioning  over
long  distances,  the  Network  RTK  con-
cept was investigated by Wubbena et al.
[1996]. An RTK Network is a network
of permanent GNSS receivers that con-
tinuously streams satellite observations
to  a  central  server  in  which  combined
data  is  used  to  gen er ate  RTK  correc-
tions for precise positioning use within
the  coverage  area  of  the  reference  sta-
tions.  These  net work-gen er ated  RTK
corrections  are  called  Network  RTK.
Major  GPS  manufacturing  companies
have  established  their  own  Network
RTK  systems  at  local,  state  and
nation al levels. These networks vary in
size, from small local networks consist-
ing of only a few reference stations, to
dozens of reference stations spanning a
whole country. These permanent refer-
ence  stations  stream  corrected  RTK
positioning

information 
receivers.  The  rover  connects  to  the
Network RTK server via radio modem,
GSM  or  Internet,  and  once  it  receives
the  RTK  data,  it  computes  its  position
[Leica 2012].  In  this  study,  the  Leica
net work in California is used.

Results

Control  points  (CP1  and  CP2,
established  for  this  study,  and  existing
point  USGS  13EGS)  placed  along  the
Kenney  irrigation  canal,  which  runs
about  2 km  along  the  south  side  of
Avenue 11 in Madera County (Figure 3),
are  surveyed  using  static  GPS  method
for a period of approximately four hours.
The closest NGS point (AC6103), which
has precise 3D coordinate information, is
surveyed again using static GPS method
for  approximately  eight  hours  (see
Figure 3). To collect the measurements,
Trimble R8 receivers are used. Antenna
and  receiver  are  mounted  on  a  fixed-
height 2-m range pole.

The first approach to surveying the
points along the canal involves a Trimble
R8 set up as a base station on CP1, which
is  then  connected  to  the  radio  antenna
(Figure  4a). Two  other  Trimble  R8
receivers  are  used  as  rovers.  Site  shots
are taken (Figure 4b).

With  the  second  approach,  the
Leica receiver is used as a rover to uti-
lize  the  Network  RTK  system  estab-
lished  by  Leica  in  California  (Figure
5a). This approach is used to complete
the survey of the canal (Figure 3).

The  rationale  behind  an  eight-hour
survey made at AC6103 is to obtain pre-
cise elevation for this point, as this point
is used as the reference point for differen-
tial  levelling  (see  section  2).  Moreover,
subsidence at this point was also found to
be a concern. With the static GPS meas-
urements  collected  at  control  points
(CP1,  CP2  and  USGS  13EGS),  eleva-
tions of these points are determined. On
the other hand, as well known, GPS is not
an  effective  technique  in  determining
precise  elevations  if  the  observation
peri od is not long enough. Furthermore,
elevation determinations are two to three
times  worse  than  horizontal  coordinate
determinations  [Berber  et  al.  2012].
Therefore, elevation from point AC6103
is  carried  to  the  control  points  in  our
proj ect  area,  which  utilize  differential
lev el ling for comparison purposes.

For differential levelling, a Sokkia
SDL30 digital level (Figure 6a) is used

with  its  barcoded  rod  mounted  on  a
turning plate (Figure 6b). As mentioned
above,  sur vey  began  at  point  AC6103
and  con tinued  to  the  control  points  in
our project area. The entire length of the
levelling was approximately 10 km (see
Figure 3)  and  took  three  days  to  com-
plete.  The  precision  obtained  is  classi-
fied  as  First  Order  Class  I  by  Federal
Geodetic  Control  Committee  because
all our misclosures were below the First

Order Class I limit val ues pre scribed by
this committee.

Elevations  determined  for  three
con trol  points  in  our  project  area  are
listed  in  Table 1 for  both  differential
levelling and GPS.

Since  differential  levelling  is the
most  precise  method  and  highest  preci-
sion 
the  survey
per formed, it is surmised that the rather
large difference at CP2 is a result of errors

is  achieved  with

this point. At the other two points, dif-
ferences are congruent between differ-
ential  levelling  and  GPS  elevations.
GPS  ellipsoidal  heights  are  con verted
to  orthometric  heights  by  adding  the
geoidal  height  (see  Section  2).  This
shows the precision of the geoid model
(GEOID12B) disseminated by NGS.

Further  analysis  of  elevations  are
deter mined  using  differential  levelling;
RTK GPS and Network RTK are done at
the  following  eight  points.  These  points
are close to the base station and on a con-
crete headwall and this is the reason that
these  stable  points  are  chosen.  In  addi-
tion, using both differential levelling and
GPS, these points are coordinated relative

to  CP1.  The  results  are  tabulated  in
Table 2 and portrayed in Figure 7 for
easier  interpretation.  Leica  Network
RTK  system  is  in  NAD83(2011)
2015.250 epoch. Therefore, to be con-
sistent  with  comparisons,  static  GPS
survey  results  and  RTK  GPS  results
are transformed into this epoch.

As  can  be  seen  in  Table  2  and
Figure  7,  the  discrepancies  between
differential  levelling  and  RTK  GPS
vary  between  9  and  13  cm;  whereas
the  differences  between  differential
levelling  and  Network  RTK  vary
between  4  and  7  cm.  Better  results
obtained  with  Network  RTK  can  be
attributed to the power of the software
used  by  Leica  Network  RTK  system,
in  that  to  min i mize  the  influence  of
distance-dependent  errors,  Network
RTK  sys tem  software  computes
Network RTK corrections, interpolates
these  corrections,  and  then  transmits
them  [Lachapelle  and  Alves 2002]
allow ing  higher  precision 
to  be
achieved.

The  headwall,  on  which  the
USGS  13EGS  point  is  set,  was  dam-
aged.  Hence,  AC6103  was  the  only
control point which had precise eleva-
tion information. As mentioned above,
in  order  to  obtain  reliable  elevation
information, this point is surveyed for
approximately eight hours using GPS.
The  elevation  of  this  point  obtained
using  GPS  is  compared  against  the

sheet and the result indicated 0.023 m
subsidence  based  on  NAD83(2011)
2015.250  epoch,  which  is  just  below
that of 25 mm in Figure 8.

As  can  be  seen  in  Figure  8,  the
proj ect  area  subsidence  monitored  by
USGS is about 25 mm. The survey indi-
cated  23 mm  subsidence.  USGS  not
only  uses  permanent  GPS  stations  but
also  runs  other  systems  (i.e.,  InSAR,
extensometers,  piezometers  and  moni-
toring  wells).  The  independent  result,
which  is  in  agreement  with  USGS
the  subsidence
sur veys,  confirms 
phe nomenon in the cen tral valley.

In  the  end,  using  the  Network
RTK  system,  a  topographic  survey  of
the  canal  is  produced  (Figure  9). For
this project, cross sections of the entire
length of the canal including any utili-
ties,  utility  poles,  concrete/stone
struc tures, inlets/outlets, nearby gates,
side roads, dirt build up, and any major
ero sion are surveyed.

As mentioned above, the length of
this canal is about 2 km. Since it is not
possible  to  show  the  entire  canal,  a
portion of it is displayed in Figure 9.

4.  Conclusions

In 

this  project, 

to  determine
ele va tions  of  points  of  interest,  static
GPS survey, RTK GPS, Network RTK
and differential levelling techniques are
used.  Differential  levelling  is  still  the
most  precise  technique  for  elevation
determinations;  however,  it  requires
more time in the field and more than one
personnel  to  complete  the  survey.
Network  RTK  measurements  can  be
taken  with  one  person  using  just  one
GPS receiver. Our results indicated that
Network RTK measurements produced
comparable results. This can be ascribed
to the power of the software used by the
Network RTK system. RTK GPS results
produced  decimeter-level  precision  for
point elevations, which are not suitable
proj ects.
for  most 
Furthermore, GPS survey con ducted at
the  NGS  point  confirmed  the  subsi-
dence phenomenon in our project area.

Abstract
This article reports on an empirical study of the trends and patterns of research
activities in Geographic Information Science (GIScience) during the years 1997–
2007. The GIScience research priorities identiﬁed by the University Consortium of
Geographic Information Science (UCGIS) were used as guidelines to examine the
985 research articles published in six well-recognized academic journals. Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) was employed to investigate the association among the
different GIScience research themes. The spatial and temporal patterns of the asso-
ciation between the publications and the different GIScience themes were examined
to show the development of GIScience research during the study period. Further-
more, correlation analyses between the publications were conducted following the
LSA results to reveal GIScience research networks, including the networks of the
published articles and those formed by the research places. In this article, we applied
an approach that was developed within information science to depict what GIS
research activities were conducted when and where and how they connect to each
other through sharing common research themes. The related ﬁndings pave the way
for future efforts to describe the paradigm of GIScience as well as the pattern of
GIScience research.tgis_1228 689..708

1 Motivation and Research Design

“The rapid rise and diffusion of Geographic Information Science is one of the most
remarkable features of the academic landscape in the last decade of the twentieth
century” (Berry 2004 p. 444). Geographic Information Science (GIScience) was ﬁrst
proposed as a scientiﬁc ﬁeld in the early 1990s (Goodchild 1990, 1992). It refers to the

theories and methodologies addressing issues related to the development, use, and
application of geographic information systems and related technologies. Following Kuhn
(1996), a clear deﬁnition of the paradigm of GIScience should include a distinct set of
theories and methodologies that reﬂect a world view of the members of GIScience
community. However, with GIScience’s astounding development, an effort to deﬁne its
paradigm is as risky as an attempt to predict its future development (Goodchild 2009).
Yet we can better prepare for the future of GIScience by looking back at its history to
understand its growth patterns and trends. This article reports on an empirical effort that
examines the research activity landscape represented by the selected GIScience publica-
tions during the period 1997–2007.

The University Consortium of Geographic Information Science (UCGIS) was formed
by “a broad representation of universities and professional associations”; its mission
includes “serv(ing) as an effective, uniﬁed voice for the geographic information science
research community”; its goals incorporate “provid(ing) ongoing research priorities
for advancing theory and methods in Geographic Information Science” (http://www.
ucgis.org/aboutucgis/mission_goals.htm). The UCGIS is recognized for its role in advo-
cating GIScience research (Elmes 2005). The Consortium publishes a series of white
papers on GIScience research priorities every few years (UCGIS 1996, 1998, 2000).
Usery and McMaster (2005) provided a detailed description on the evolving process of
the UCGIS research priorities. To what degree have these priorities guided GIScience
research activities during the fast-growing years from 1997 to 2007? How are these
priorities reﬂected by the GIScience publications during this period? Answers to these
questions will not only enhance our understanding of the structure and paradigm of
GIScience, they will also help UCGIS to reﬂect on its research priorities in order to better
serve the GIScience community. Table 1 summarizes the research themes advocated by
UCGIS and investigated by this study.

By using the UCGIS research priorities as reference to examine the research themes
of the publications, this study may be open to a critique of possible bias towards the
nomenclature of GIScience activities in North America. However, we argue that, through
supporting international membership and including GIScientists from Europe and other
parts of the world in its many activities, UCGIS serves GIScience communities beyond the
physical boundary of the US. Moreover, the ubiquitous Internet access has minimized the
impact of distance on the distribution of ideas and information (Cairncross 2001). The
extremely low cost of information ﬂow facilitates high frequency and increasing volume
of intellectual capital ﬂow (Batty 2007). Therefore, GIScientists from other parts of the
world have, theoretically, similar access to the UCGIS white papers. Furthermore, a large
number of GIScientists in the US came from other places; many of them maintain active
collaboration with people and institutions in their countries of origin and act as a channel
to connect GIScience activities in the US with those outside. Therefore, in spite of being
instituted in the US, the UCGIS is well-positioned to promote GIScience beyond the US.
Nevertheless, further empirical studies will certainly beneﬁt from a more comprehensive
investigation to include GIScience research themes that are promoted by more organi-
zations worldwide.

Starting from the UCGIS research themes, the ﬁrst part of this study depicts the
knowledge domain of GIScience that is reﬂected by the themes and their relationships. To
reveal how these themes are related to the GIScience research activities, this study
examines how the different research themes have been pursued across space and time.

assess the subscription of each article to the different themes. Summarizing by research
themes, we provide a quantitative description of the spatial patterns of GIS publications
on the different research themes and the changes in these patterns through time.

The second part of this study focuses on depicting the GIScience research networks
as reﬂected by the publications. Both the connections among researchers and those
among places are examined. The text of the publications is examined using LSA to create
a similarity index measuring the association between two articles. The articles are then
grouped by their authors and authors’ afﬁliations. Similarity indices of GIS publications
were then generated between different authors and between different places. Using the
similarity indices to indicate the strength of connections, we describe how GIS research
themes have linked different researchers and different places.

2 Related Approaches

Rarely is any research conducted without connection to the remainder of the world. The
connection exits through various links between researchers and across institutions; it is
also present due to the inherent association between different themes or topics. The
investigation of such connections can reveal a landscape of research activities to depict
what research is conducted where, how research activities are connected across space and
time, and how research of different themes converge to deﬁne the knowledge domain of
a scientiﬁc discipline (e.g. Skupin 2004a, b).

2.1 Social Network Theory

Social networks represent the pattern of human interaction present in a social structure
(Newman 2000). A social network is made of vertices of actors and linkages representing
acquaintances between vertices. Actors are most often individuals, while the linkages are
exchanges of ﬁnancial, informational, or technological means, markers of the spread of
disease, and organizational structures of formal or informal groupings. The structure
of a social network is of particular interest because it has implications for the spread of
phenomena or information.

Revealing the structure of the social network through which research ideas and
fronts spread can help in understanding the construction and development of a scientiﬁc
discipline. However, it is a challenging task to depict the social network that facilitates
the spread of scientiﬁc research. Not all social connections are appropriate for the
communication of scientiﬁc ideas. Moreover, the rapid development of the Internet and
other communication technologies has greatly decreased the friction of distance;
this makes the establishment and maintenance of research networks more “intangible”
and different from the traditional social networks. As a result, co-authorship and citation
information is widely used to approximate the scientiﬁc connection between scientists.

2.2 Co-Citation and Co-authorship

Citations were ﬁrst used in the late 19th century (Kessler 1963). The Scientiﬁc Citation
Index (SCI) was published in the early 1960s as an index of paper-to-paper citations.
Citations reﬂect binary relations between documents and are limited for assessing the
connection between articles. Bibliographic coupling was originated by Kessler (1963) to
measure the amount that different papers cite the same sources. Co-citation was pro-
posed by Marshakova (1973) and Small (1973) independently to measure the relatedness
of two articles by the frequency of them being cited together by a third article. These two
indices can describe the strength of links between articles on a continuous scale. The ﬁrst
co-citation map was created by White and Grifﬁth (1981). Co-citation analysis was used
to determine the subject similarity and the association between the key ideas of publi-
cations (Small 1973). It was also used to analyze the specialty structure of science (e.g.
Chen 1999, 2006). However, both bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis depict
the relatedness between documents indirectly – based on the frequency of two documents
citing a same third document or being cited by a same third document; they fail to
differentiate between critical and marginal citations. The content-based connection
between articles is not accounted for.

Another method for detecting the linkage between research is co-authorship. A
social structure of science can be described through examining the co-authorship linkages
in a science authorship network, a social network where vertices are authors and linkages
(or edges) are co-authorship status on publications. Co-authorship networks can be
interpreted as a structural representation of the collaborative nature of scientiﬁc research
(White 2003). The nature of the edge can be deﬁned clearly for these studies (Newman
2000, 2001). A challenge to co-authorship study is that, while reﬂecting the collabora-
tion between researchers, it does not speak to the speciﬁc contribution of a publication
to a scientiﬁc ﬁeld. There is no assessment on how a researcher’s scientiﬁc endeavor
advances the structure or knowledge domain of a discipline. Furthermore, similar to

co-citation analysis, co-authorship study only reﬂects the research connections that
resulted in successful publications.

2.3 Latent Semantic Analysis

Latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al. 1990) examines the semantics of the
text in a publication to quantify its association with a target text, which can be a
description of a research theme, a set of key words, or another publication. One major
advantage of LSA over co-citation analysis and co-authorship study is that LSA assesses
the association between two entities using content-based information. Through semantic
analysis, one publication can be evaluated as being more or less connected to a research
theme or a target document than another publication. Not only can the strength of the
connection between any two publications be described (compared with binary assess-
ment), but also the association of a publication to different themes in a scientiﬁc ﬁeld can
be quantiﬁed. The latter enables a depiction of the structure of a scientiﬁc ﬁeld and its
development. Seeing the advantages of semantic analysis over the traditional citation or
authorship network analysis, researchers have recently started to promote the use of
semantic association for assessing the development of scholarly knowledge and expertise
in a discipline (e.g. Börner 2006, 2007). The remainder of this section explains the
technical process of LSA in general terms; the detailed explanation of LSA for this
empirical study is included in the next section of this article.

LSA starts with creating a term-document matrix to report weighted word counts in
each document for the selected terms. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is then
performed to decompose this term-document matrix into three matrices: an orthonormal
matrix representing term vectors, an orthonormal matrix representing document vectors,
and a diagonal matrix containing singular values to represent the strength of relationship
between documents and terms (see Figure 1). These three matrices decompose the
term-document matrix into linearly independent factors (equation 1).

where U and VT have orthogonal columns and S is a diagonal matrix of singular values
representing the strength of the relationship between U and VT.

Many of the factors represented in the singular value matrix S are small and may be
ignored as noise. Keeping only the largest k singular values and replacing the small ones
with zeros converts the original singular value matrix from S to c. The matrices U and
VT must also be adjusted slightly to maintain orthogonality, and these become T and
DT respectively. By applying dot product to the three matrices, T, c and DT, a new
k-dimensional term-document matrix is created to represent the relative strength of
the association between each term and each document (equation 2).

The reduced term-document matrix Xk exhibits characteristics that will be used to
extract meaning and relationship from the corpus. Since the term vector space and the
document vector space are orthonormal, the dot-product correlation (or cosine) can be
computed easily for any two terms or any two documents. Performing dot-product on all
terms (or all documents) creates a correlation matrix of term-term (document-document)
relationships with each value between -1 and 1. These correlation matrices provide a
means to quantify the semantic association between terms (or documents). Furthermore,
when aggregating the publications by researchers or their afﬁliations, the semantic
association between research activities by different GIScience researchers and different
places can be revealed.

3 Data and Methodology

3.1 Data Preparation

The research articles from Transactions in GIS, the International Journal of Geogra-
phical Information Science, Cartography and Geographic Information Science, Geo-
Informatica, and the GIS research papers published in the Annals of the Association of
American Geographers and The Professional Geographer form the corpus of GIS pub-
lications investigated in this study. A total of 985 research articles between 1997 and
2007 are included. In addition to the text part of these articles, the date of publication,
the names of the authors, and their afﬁliations were extracted. These articles were
published by 823 different ﬁrst authors, whose afﬁliations are located in 398 distinguish-
able places worldwide.

Author afﬁliations, article titles, and dates of publication were entered into a database
using several small programs to check for completeness and accuracy. Common discrep-
ancies include capitalization in names, small differences in the name of author’s afﬁliation,
and the choice of complete name versus abbreviation or nickname. One author may have
multiple afﬁliations and multiple authors may be listed for one publication. For this study,
the ﬁrst author and the ﬁrst afﬁliation for the ﬁrst author were extracted to represent the
person who conducted the research and the place where the research was conducted. This
is based on the assumption that the ﬁrst author contributes the most to the publication.
While this is not always the case, to assess the contribution of each author using
information revealed in the publications is beyond the scope of this paper. A potential
technique that may be used in the future to address the issue of multiple research locations

and multiple authors is higher dimensional LSA. For this study, the ﬁrst author’s afﬁliation
was geocoded to represent the location of a published research.

3.2 Latent Semantic Analysis

A LSA module written by Fidolin Wild1 in the R programming language was used to
generate the text-document matrix. This module examines each article to identify words
of interest as well as their variations. A total of 602 common words, such as articles,
pronouns, common verbs, and prepositions, were ignored. Using an R module written
by D. T. Lange,2 words were broken down into word-stems, or roots of words. Using
stemming allows LSA to ﬁnd plurals and alternate words for each word of interest.
Lange’s R module uses a list of over 60 word endings, logic and rules to decide how
and when to stem; it also has a list of exceptions to ensure no excessive stemming
is performed. For example, the words “integration”, “integrate”, “integrates” and
“integrator” are stemmed to “integra-”, while such words as “succeed” and “ugly” are
not reduced to “succe-” and “ug-”.

The text-document matrix was further processed to account for the variation of
article length. Each word-stem in the matrix is weighted by a “term frequency multiplied
by the inverse document frequency method”, or TF*IDF method (Salton 1989). “Term
frequency” is the number of times a term appears in a given document divided by the
total of times the term appears in all documents. “Inverse document frequency” is the log
of the number of documents divided by the number of documents the word appears in.
The text-matrix generated after this standardization process reﬂect how intensively each
word of interest is used by the 985 articles.

3.3 Variations of LSA Text-Matrices

Variation of the above text-matrix can be generated to reveal more aspects of GIS research
activities. First, the “words of interest” for LSA can adopt the keywords of the GIScience
research themes. The association of the publications with these keywords reﬂects how
each theme was pursued by the GIS community. Table 2 summarizes the many text-matrix
variations. Using research keywords, we can interrogate the thematic substructure of
the GIScience publications. Alternatively, by grouping the articles according to author-
ship, author’s afﬁliation, research places, or publication time, the text-matrices that are
generated can be used as input to investigate the association among the publications by
different authors, from different places, and at different time. This allows the depiction of
the connections among GIScience publications during the investigated years.

Sixteen keywords are identiﬁed from the UCGIS research priorities (see Table 1).
Each keyword is stemmed to a root-word. With LSA correlation analysis, the words
(referred to as “stemmed words”) that are closely related to each root-word of the
research keyword are identiﬁed. For example, Table 3 lists stemmed words that are
highly correlated to root-word “uncertain-” (connoting the research keyword “mobile”).
The stemmed words with Pearson correlation of 0.5 or above with the root-words are
used to generate weighted keywords text-matrices. In this example, the usage of keyword
“uncertainty” in an article is the sum of the number of occurrences of “uncertainti-” plus
the number of occurrences of “uncertain” weighted by 1.0 plus the number of occur-
rences of “signiﬁ-” weighted by 0.66, and so on. This way the appearance of each UCGIS
keyword in an article is quantiﬁed as the accumulated weighted count of all the selected

stemmed words. This weighted count for each keyword is further standardized using the
TF*IDF method.

After generating the singular value matrices, we create correlation matrices using the
pair-wise similarity index between the rows. The results denote the intensity of associa-
tion between paired articles or paired groups of articles. For instance, a similarity index
between two articles represents the thematic association between the articles measured
by the common occurrence of certain words that are examined. For article-article,
author-author, year-year, afﬁliation-afﬁliation, and location-location correlation matri-
ces, we used stemmed words to determine the correlation index. We chose stemmed

words over whole words because we believe stemmed words better represent the seman-
tic meaning of a term, and that stemmed words produce more connections between
subjects.

4 UCGIS Research Priorities as Reﬂected by the GIScience Publications

4.1 Relationship between the UCGIS Research Themes

To show how the UCGIS research priorities are related among themselves, the correlation
between each keyword to every other keyword is investigated. Language is not math-
ematically precise. As a semantic analysis, LSA tends to reveal a certain degree of
association between virtually all entities. Therefore, it is necessary to select certain links
from the LSA results in order to reveal the valid connections. Our trial-and-error
experiments with the data showed that a 0.8 cut-off value identiﬁes the correlation links
that are abundant and meaningful. Only the most salient links – the association with a
correlation coefﬁcient of 0.8 or higher – are included in this study to describe the GIS
research networks.

The overall ﬁndings echo those by Usery and McMaster (2005) – these research
themes are intertwined and overlapping frequently, and the relationships between and
among themes are rarely reciprocal. However, Usery and McMaster (2005) conducted
their evaluation of the interrelations among the UCGIS research themes based on experts’
assessment of the concepts that are related to the research themes. This study follows an
empirical approach by using LSA to reveal how the published articles that are associated
with each of the research themes are related to each other. Put another way, Usery and
McMaster (2005) followed a top-down approach to investigate how the research themes
are supposed to connect to each other according to expert knowledge about the themes;
the present study takes a bottom-up approach to depict how the different GIS themes
were revealed to connect to each other by the investigated publications.

Table 4 reports our ﬁndings on the connections among the 14 UCGIS priorities. The
numbers indicate how two research themes are correlated to each other based on
the LSA analyses of the GIS publications. A high correlation coefﬁcient between two
research themes indicates that the publications that are associated with one research
theme (as assessed by the LSA analysis) tend to be associated with the other theme as
well. The correlation coefﬁcients of > 0.5 are highlighted in the table. It can be seen that
some areas of research are tightly coupled with others. The Spatial Analysis theme is
closely related to ten other UCGIS research themes. The Remotely Acquired Data and
Information, Geographic Representation, and Geospatial Data Mining and Knowledge
Discovery themes are each closely related to nine other UCGIS research priorities. At the
other end of the spectrum, research themes such as Spatial Information Infrastructure
and GIS & Society are only closely related to one other research theme (i.e. Geospatial
Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery and Spatial Analysis, respectively). The research
themes, Spatial Data Acquisition and Integration and Ontological Foundations of GIS
are each closely related to two other research themes. Moreover, it is interesting to note
that some research themes are negatively related to each other, although all of the
negative coefﬁcients are relatively small. For example, the Future of Spatial Information
Infrastructure theme appears to be negatively related to the Geographic Visualization,
Geographic Representation, and GIS & Society themes, indicating that the publications
closely related to Spatial Information Infrastructure tend to be less related to the papers

on the themes of Geographic Visualization, Geographic Representation, and GIS &
Society.

Two issues should be kept in mind when interpreting these results. First, the rela-
tionship between the different UCGIS research themes only represents the patterns
embedded in the publications that are investigated by this study. Therefore, any specially
identiﬁed focuses or ﬂavors of these six journals during the years 1997–2007 would have
impacted the revealed patterns. Second, LSA relies highly on the meaning and context of
the words in publications. The lack of a relatively uniform meaning for any words could
degrade the algorithm’s ability to reveal accurate correlations.

4.2 Research Trends for the UCGIS Themes

Using the matrices listed in the last row of Table 2, LSA was conducted to examine the
spatial distribution of GIS publications. By linking all the investigated articles with the
cities where the primary authors’ afﬁliations are, the connection between places (or cities)
and research themes can be established. Although we cannot for certain infer the
innovative sites for the different research themes, a high correlation between a place and
a theme signify the presence of active research on the theme in that area. Therefore, the
key centers of GIScience research on speciﬁc themes can be identiﬁed. The ten placess
with the most counts of weighted keywords were identiﬁed for the UCGIS research
priorities (Table 5). Some well-known places for GIS research appear under multiple
research themes, including Santa Barbara, CA (11 themes), London (11 themes), Hong
Kong (10 themes), State College, PA (9 themes), and Melbourne, Australia (9 themes).
This conﬁrms the signiﬁcant role these places hold in advancing GIScience. On the other
end of the spectrum, some locations only appear under one research theme, such as
Zurich (under “uncertainty”) and Stuttgart (under “visualization”), signifying the con-
tribution by these places to the speciﬁc GIScience research themes. Geographically,
outside of North America and Europe, GIScience research is active in Austria, Brazil,
China (Beijing and Hong Kong), New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea, and Taiwan.
Through linking the articles in each year to the research themes, the thematic
distribution of the GIS publications investigated is revealed (Table 6). Several trends can
be observed. When checking the GIScience themes on which the publications were
focused, some themes were well reﬂected throughout this study period, including spatial
analysis, geographic representation, cognition of geographic information, and GIS and
society. Other themes have not received enough attention or are not well-represented by
the publications, such as data mining, scale, and interoperability, Still others are fairly
represented by the publications, including spatial data acquisition and integration, visu-
alization, and distributed computing. Furthermore, examining the sustainability of the
GIScience themes, it can be seen that some have become more active while others less
active. Themes such as ontology, visualization, uncertainty, and interoperability have
seen increased publications through the years, while the numbers of publications on
spatial analysis, GIS and society, and spatial data infrastructure have dropped consid-
erably. The ﬁndings on the dynamics of the GIScience themes throughout the study
period can be used as guidance by the organizations such as UCGIS and the disciplines
sharing an interest in GIScience to identify strategies and directions to encourage,
monitor, and facilitate GIS research activities. They also provide information for
researchers to relate their research interests and career plans to the development of
GIScience. However, it is important to note that due to the dynamic and imprecise

nature of language, the meaning of a word or a phrase for GIScience can change over
time, which might add noise to the patterns revealed.

5 Research Networks Presented in the GIScience Publications

5.1 The Network of GIScience Publications

Running correlation analyses between the LSA indices for the different articles reveal
how strongly the articles are related to each other. Visualizing only the signiﬁcant
connections between the articles, Figure 2 is a visual representation of the network
formed by the 985 articles. Each edge in the network indicates a correlation coefﬁcient
of 0.8 or larger. The ﬁgure is intended not to enable the readers to identify which article
corresponds to which node in the network, but to illustrate the ubiquitous connections
among the published articles when the 14 UCGIS research themes are applied to them.
However, it is important to notice that there are a number of self-contained sub-networks
in Figure 2. The articles in each sub-network share similar subscription to the research
theme(s); they might indicate a possible route of GIScience knowledge diffusion. Further
investigation focusing on the sub-networks is warranted, as the spatial and temporal
sequence of these articles might reveal how GIS research has “traveled” over space and
time.

For illustration purpose, we take a medium-sized sub-network from Figure 2 to
show the construction of a sub-network. This sub-network consists of ﬁve related articles
(Table 7). Two articles (BC2005 and JO2006) cited a third article (F1998) in the same
sub-network. The others did not cite each other, but they do hold common citations in
their references. Applying LSA and correlation analysis, the connection among the
articles are analyzed and their strength reported in Figure 3. It is relatively clear that the

PF1998 article has strong connections to the other four articles, indicating that this
article might have important impact on the other published research activities. Further
investigations can be conducted by following the publication time and research locations
to examine if and how these publications can possibly reﬂect the diffusion of GIScience
research related to “error and uncertainty”.

5.2 The Network of GIScience Research over Space

As indicated in the last row of Table 2, the information derived from the LSA matrices
can be used to derive the correlation between different places. The correlation reveals
how the places are connected in their roles to support GIScience research on the different
themes. The coefﬁcient for two places is high if the articles published by researchers from
these places show similar subscription to the GIScience themes. Figure 4 is a world map
illustrating how the different places are connected based on the association between
the published articles. Two places are connected on the map if the articles published
from them show a high correlation coefﬁcient. The map shows some striking patterns.
Many connections exist between places in North America and Europe, both within and
between the two continents. The connections from North American or European to other
places tend to point to a limited number of geographical regions. These include countries
such as Australia, Brazil, China, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa.
Some speciﬁc places in these countries are more related to the places in North America
and Europe than to the other places in their regions. For example, Hong Kong and
Beijing are more connected to the West than to the many large cities in China and Asia.
However, Australia is a special case – despite its close connection to North America
and Europe, two links connect places (Brisbane with Melbourne and Townsville with
Newcastle) within this country. These patterns suggest that the major GIScience research

activities exist mostly in the developed countries. While some major cities in the devel-
oping world are connected to this developed-country research network, there is a lack
of connection among places in developing countries. This could suggest either weak
communication between the researchers within the developing world or the lack of
leading researchers and research in these countries and regions.

It is important to point out that, despite the interesting patterns revealed by the
analyses, these results could be biased towards publications in English. As English is
the only language used by the journals investigated in this study, non-English speakers
and their GIScience publications are underrepresented. Furthermore, the language
barrier can be signiﬁcant for the diffusion of knowledge. Given that English is less
popular in many developing countries than in North America and Europe, the lack of
connection between the GIScience research activities in these two groups of countries
may reﬂect the restricted information ﬂows. Lastly, institutional funding and resources
may present challenges for GIScience research in developing countries. North Ameri-
can and European institutions may be better funded or have better access to GIScience
literature.

6 Concluding Remarks

6.1 Conclusions

LSA provides a method to identify and quantify the relationship among published
research works. While it may not speak to the quality of the research, it can establish
semantic linkages between research themes, publications, publication years, and publi-
cation places. Previous academic research has focused on the citation network as the
structure of scientiﬁc connectivity (Newman 2000, 2001, Small 1973, White and Grifﬁth
1981). In this research, we show that LSA can be used to derive content-based similarity
indices between the GIScience publications or other grouping units for publications. A
content-based similarity index provides more information than one based on citation
information since it describes the semantic intensity of the connection between two
entities. LSA is used in this study to examine the relationship between researchers and
publications based on their subscription to the GIScience themes. The results reveals the
connections between GIScience researchers who share the same research interests
through their publications, regardless of their citation, co-citation, or co-authorship
relation.

By linking GIS publications to UCGIS research priorities, we depict an empirical
picture of the landscape of published GIScience research. The structure of knowledge
indicated by UCGIS research priorities is described. The analyses also reveal the dyna-
mics of GIScience research foci during the 11 years. These ﬁndings can serve as a
reference for UCGIS to revisit their research priorities in order to encourage or
de-emphasize speciﬁc research themes. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal patterns of
GIScience publications on the different themes as well as the network formed by the
major GIScience research places, as revealed by this study, have implications for under-
standing the specialty structure of GIScience and its dynamics. They laid out a good start
for future research to follow on in order to understand better how research has changed,
and when and where different research themes were pursued.

6.2 Limitations of Current Study

The publications examined were restricted to the years 1997 to 2007. This was mainly
because digital copies of full journal papers published before 1997 are not as easily
available for certain journals. Furthermore, the ﬁndings reported in this article are likely
to be affected by the nature and tastes of the six selected journals. GIScience articles are
published in a wide range of journals, including those outside the ﬁeld of geography. By
limiting our source material, we have omitted research in applied GIScience and other
ﬁelds. Furthermore, the patterns of GIS publications as identiﬁed by this empirical study
are limited to the themes covered by the UCGIS research priorities. We recognize that
there are GIScience concepts and themes that are important for the development of the
GIScience research agenda but that were not included in this investigation.

Similar to most other empirical studies of structure and development of a scientiﬁc
ﬁeld, the analyses and conclusions are limited to the published GIScience research.
However, this does not mean that the unpublished scientiﬁc activities are not important
or that they are not an integral part of GIScience research.

Lastly, the imprecise nature of language affects the patterns revealed. LSA infers
semantic context, but language is never exact or static. Words have multiple meanings
and multiple words can share a single meaning; the meaning of a term may change over
time. The looseness of language does add noise to the data and affect the quality of the
results. Using stemmed words and weighted inputs, we have endeavored to limit the
introduction of imprecision and error into the analysis.

6.3 Future Research

At the foundation of all the analyses in this article is the identiﬁcation of the words
closely related to the UCGIS research priorities. As discussed in the opening section of
this article, while we acknowledge the limitation of choosing the research priorities of
UCGIS, we wanted to point out that UCGIS being a US-centric organization does not
necessarily mean that its view for GIScience development excludes non-US research
communities. Furthermore, similar limitation would be present should the GIScience
research agenda advocated by another institution be chosen. Therefore, future research
should explore how to deﬁne the most appropriate set of research themes shared by the
whole GIScience community. The technical approach presented in this article can be
followed by future investigations when a more rigorous GIScience research agenda is
applied.

Future research can expand on the network analysis of LSA results. Options include
optimizing the correlation cut-off values, ﬁnding community structure within the
network (Chen 2006, Newman 2006), or measuring the differences among multiple
models of network types. Further research may focus on investigating the links between
certain places, or the geographic network of a GIScience theme. Knowing the relation-
ship between the research locations and the themes could assist in describing the diffusion
patterns of GIS research (Chen et al. 2007, Singh 2005).

LSA is based on SVD, which uses two dimensions of analysis. Higher-order Singular
Value Decomposition (HOSVD) (Omberg et al. 2007) analyzes matrices in three or
higher dimensions. A higher-order LSA could explore multiple dimensions of analysis,
incorporating authorship, research location, publication time, or other measures into
the analysis. Doing so would provide a method for removing noise from multiple

2-dimension analyses. Using thematic keywords in a higher-order LSA to examine the
publications in GIScience will remove some publication frequency noise.

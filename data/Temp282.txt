Abstract. Many spatially distributed environmental models have been developed
for small spatial units (e.g. individual plots or (cid:142) elds). Their application at a
regional scale (e.g. large drainage basins) was hitherto not very successful since
most models are ‘scale-speci(cid:142) c’. In most cases the lack of input data is a limiting
factor for an appropriate model application at a regional scale. The use of
simpli(cid:142) ed models on the other hand, can only be successful if they have the
appropriate degree of complexity. This leads to the following paradox: on the
one hand a model should be based on process knowledge so that it will react
correctly to changes imposed by the modelling system. Including all available
process knowledge, however, will
lead to an overparametrisation. The error
propagation involved in the poor data quality can then deteriorate dramatically
the accuracy of the output results. For optimal model predictions at a regional
scale the model complexity has to be in balance with the quality of the available
input data. The error involved in a model application can be split in two parts:
on the one hand the intrinsic model error because of an incomplete description
of the processes and on the other hand the input error because of the use of low
quality data. The total error is the sum of both parts. A simpli(cid:142) cation of the
modelling structure will lead to an increase of the intrinsic model error and a
decrease of the input error. If observed (cid:142) eld values are available they can be used
to determine which model structure gives the best results, given the available
data. In many cases such validation data are not available. However, also in these
cases, a model user should be able to select an optimal model structure. In this
paper a technique is presented that allows the determination of the optimal degree
of model complexity for an application at a regional scale if no observed (cid:142) eld
data are available. If the uncertainty of a model parameter exceeds a certain
threshold, the model structure must be further simpli(cid:142) ed by replacement of this
parameter by an aggregated value or a constant. The use of the technique is
illustrated via the application of a soil erosion model.

Introduction
Systematic research with respect to soil erosion started in the 1930s in the United
States. From that time on, a range of soil erosion models has been developed. The
methods used can range from simple equations often expressing a statistical relation-
ship, to complex equations related to the fundamental physics or mechanics of the

process. The former are more common in empirical models whereas the latter provide
the foundation for physically based models.

Advances in computational power and information technology and the develop-
ment of environmental databases made it possible to apply soil erosion models at a
regional, national or even continental scale, which is the level at which land managers
and environmental agencies operate.

However, the application of existing soil erosion models at a regional scale has
not been very successful so far (Ja¨ ger 1994, de Roo and Jetten 1999, Van Rompaey
et al. 1999, de Jong et al. 1999, Brazier et al. 2001). Reasons for the disappointing
results of existing models must be looked for in:

1. The uncertainty involved in estimating and measuring the large number of
input variables for the application of physically-based models at a regional
scale. It is often technically or (cid:142) nancially impossible to gather data with the
required precision for model application at a regional scale. In some cases the
initial error on the input data is propagated to such an extent that the model
output is merely ‘much ado about nothing’. In many cases it is not even
known what the magnitude of this uncertainty is. Jetten et al. (1999) evaluated
the results of several erosion models and came to the conclusion that detailed
physically based erosion models do not necessarily produce better results than
much simpler models taking only the main parameters into account. De Wit
(1999) came to the same conclusion when evaluating four diVerent nutrient
(cid:143) ux models run at the scale of large river basins. The most complex and data
demanding model did not perform better. Therefore, a lot of researchers in
geomorphology raise the question whether there is much bene(cid:142) t to be gained
from developing even more complex models when the necessary inputs cannot
be collected with the required spatial and temporal resolution (Beven 1989,
Grayson et al. 1992, de Roo 1993, Perrin et al. 2001 ).

2. The lack of high-quality input data resulted, on the other hand, in the develop-
ment of simpli(cid:142) ed models. In general existing models are taken as a theoretical
basis and are further simpli(cid:142) ed by elimination of some of the model parameters.
A good example is the CORINE soil erosion assessment methodology
(Giordano et al. 1991 ), which was used to produce large scale soil erosion risk
maps of southern Europe. Because of the problem of data availability the
USLE (Universal Soil Loss Equation, Wishmeier and Smith 1978) was reduced
to a very simple model based on classi(cid:142) cation tables. Each parameter (rainfall,
soil susceptibility, slope angle, slope distance, land cover and prevention meas-
ures) was classi(cid:142) ed as low (1), moderate (2) or strong (3). The (cid:142) nal erosion
risk was estimated by summing up the scores for each parameter. Finally the
output results were classi(cid:142) ed as low, moderate or high erosion risk. The
approach was a (cid:142) rst attempt to obtain comparable erosion risk estimates for
Europe. The CORINE model is not very data demanding since the required
resolution for the input parameters (land use, climate data, soils and topo-
graphy) is only 1 km2 . However, nothing is known about the accuracy of the
results since the model has never been validated. Because of its over-simpli(cid:142) ed
structure, the predictions of the CORINE-model are probably very inaccurate
even when the input data are totally error-free.

In general, the limiting factor for appropriate model application at a regional
scale are the input data. The use of simpli(cid:142) ed models, however, can only be successful

if they have an appropriate degree of complexity. This leads to the following paradox:
on the one hand a model should be based on process knowledge so that it will react
correctly to changes imposed on the modelling system. On the other hand, including
all available process knowledge may lead to a model structure that is too complex,
given the quality of the available input data. This will also lead to large errors in
the predicted values, as the error on the input values propagated through the model
calculations. In order to make an optimal prediction of erosion rates for a given
area the model complexity should be in balance with the quality of the available
input data. If the uncertainty of a parameter estimate exceeds a certain threshold,
the model structure must be further simpli(cid:142) ed. However, oversimpli(cid:142) cation should
also be avoided as it implies that the full potential of the input data is not exploited.
In this paper a technique is proposed that allows determining the optimal degree
of complexity of a soil erosion model for application at a regional scale if no observed
values are available. The technique will be illustrated with an example application,
the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE, Renard et al. 1997), but may be
applied to other models as well.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Input-error and model-error

Heuvelink (1998) de(cid:142) nes error as the diVerence between reality and our represen-
ation of reality. This representation of reality consists of two parts: (1) the mathemat-
ical representation of processes within the model and (2) the representation of the
input data. This means that the total error involved in a model application can be
split up in two components: the ‘model-error’ resulting from of the incomplete
representation of the processes and the ‘input-error’ resulting from an inaccurate
representation of the input data. Model-error is the part of the error on the model
output caused by the model structure. Input-error is the part of the error on the
model output that is caused by inaccurate input data.

The initial error on the available input data propagate s via the sequence of
computational operations in a model. The propagation of this initial error through
the model can be described mathematically by means of random variables. If the
true value of a spatial attribute at some location x is a(x) and if the representation
of it be b(x), then the error v(x) at x is simply the arithmetical diVerence v(x)=
a(x) - b(x). The error v(x) is not known exactly, but if we have some idea about the
distribution that it is likely to take, it is possible to represent the error v(x) as a
random variable V (x). Capitals are used to distinguish random variables from the
deterministic values. A random variable is associated with the outcome of a proba-
bilistic experiment such as the throw of a die. Random variables can be used to
model the uncertainty attached to an attribute. V(x) can be considered as a value
drawn from a certain probability distribution. A random variable V(x) that is de(cid:142) ned
on a domain of interest in a 2-dimensional space can be considered as a random
(cid:142) eld V (.). The value of the random (cid:142) eld V(.) at a location x is V (x).

The input layers for a soil erosion model can be considered then as random (cid:142) elds
that satisfy the equation Ai(.)=bi(.)+Vi(.). Here bi(.) is the available input map and
V i(.) a random (cid:142) eld representing error or uncertainty. If the input-data are unbiased,
V i(.) has a zero mean. Running a computational model (equation 1) with these input
layers results in an output map (U(.).

U(.)=g(Ai(.), ..., Am(.))

Where Ai(.) the available input map, g(.) a mathematical function representing the
sequence of computational operations.

The model output U(.) is also a random (cid:142) eld with a mean E(.) and a variance
s2 (.). In a standard model application without error propagation, the objective is to
derive the expected value E(.) which is estimated by g(bl (.), ..., bm(.)). However, when
studying error propagation the main interest goes to the uncertainty in U(.), which
is represented by its variance s2 (.). The variance s2 (.) can be considered as the input-
error: it is the uncertainty on the predicted model results, caused by errors on the
input layers.

The input-error can be calculated analytically if the model is decomposed in
elementary computational operations. Usually two types of computational opera-
tions are considered (Heuvelink et al. 1989): local operations and global operations.
Local operations refer to operations for which the value of the output map at some
location only depends on the value of the input maps at that same location, or
possibly on their values within not too large a window surrounding that location.
Local operations thus include point operations and neighbourhood operations.
Contrary to local operations global operations can have far-reaching spatial inter-
actions, so that the value of the output map at some location may be aVected by
input map values at remote locations. Since global operations render the analytical
calculation of error propagation diYcult, Monte Carlo analysis is often the only
appropriate technique (Hammerley and Handscomb 1979, Lewis and Orav 1989,
Wesseling and Heuvelink 1993, Heuvelink 1998). With this technique several model
outputs are generated but instead of using the available parameter values, they are
randomly selected from their stochastic distributions. This results in a set of output
layers that can be used to determine the uncertainty on the output.

Monte Carlo analysis can determine how much each individual input contributes
to the output error. This kind of sensitivity analysis may be very useful, because it
allows users to explore how much the quality of the output improves, given a
reduction of error in a particular input. If no negative correlation exists between the
error on the diVerent model parameters it can be assumed that the more parameters
are included in the model the higher the input-error will be.

The quality of the model results, however, does not only depend on the quality
of the input data but also on the quality of the model structure. A model is always
a simpli(cid:142) ed representation of the ‘real’ processes. Model-error can be de(cid:142) ned as the
diVerence between the simpli(cid:142) ed representation and reality. This is the same as the
diVerence between model result and reality when error-free input data are used. The
more detailed the processes are described, the more correctly the model system will
react to changes imposed on it. In general, highly complex models should therefore
have a lower model-error. This means that if error-free data are available, highly
complex models should perform better than simpli(cid:142) ed models. Of course, the latter
is only valid if the complex model structure does not incorporate incorrect process
descriptions.

Finally, the total error involved in a model application is the sum of both the

input-error and the model-error.

2.2. Optimal model complexity

Since it is impossible in most cases to acquire error-free data, the optimal model
structure at a regional scale is not necessarily the most complex structure. The
optimal model complexity, therefore, depends on the quality of the available data.

Suppose a soil erosion model in its full complexity has n parameters (equation

2):

E= f ( pi(.) ... pn (.))
Not all of these n parameters are of equal importance for the prediction of the (cid:142) nal
result. The model can be simpli(cid:142) ed by replacing one or more of the involved
parameters pi(.) by a constant pi. This will reduce the input-error since the uncertainty
on the averaged value pi may be expected to be lower than the uncertainty of the
individual pixels of the (cid:142) eld pi(.) because the random errors on individual pixel
values will be (cid:142) ltered out (Van Rompaey et al. 1999). However, the error on
the constant value pi will not be reduced to zero if the input-map pi(.) has a
systematic error.

(2)

If the spatial distribution of pi is important for a correct process description, the
replacement by a constant value will result in a signi(cid:142) cant increase of the model-
error. If a model requires n distributed input parameters, n simpli(cid:142) ed models can be
derived by replacing one of the n parameters by a constant value.

Next, the increase in model-error involved in the model simpli(cid:142) cation can be
evaluated by means of a regression analysis. If observed values are available, they
could be used as reference. In such a case, however, it is not necessary to analyse
both input and model-error separately, because a comparison with observed values
results immediately in an evaluation of the total error for each model-data
combination.

If no observed reference values are available, the results of the full-complexity
model may be used as reference. It is then implicitly assumed that a full complexity
model performs better than a simpli(cid:142) ed model if error-free data are available. This
assumption is not valid if the full complexity model is conceptually (cid:143) awed: if this is
the case, a simpli(cid:142) ed model model may have a lower model error than the full
complexity model.

For each simpli(cid:142) ed model the results can be compared with the reference model
results, i.e. the results obtained using the full complexity model. The better the
correlation between the results of the full-complexity model and the results of a
simpli(cid:142) ed complexity model the less important the eliminated parameter is. The
Mean Square Error (MSE_mod ) can be used as a measure for model deterioration
(equation 3).

MSE_mod=

n
å
i=1

(Fi - Si)2

n

(3)

Where MSE_mod=the mean square model-error involved in the simpli(cid:142) ed model,
Fi=the result of the ‘full complexity model’ at pixel i; Si=the result of a simpli(cid:142) ed
model at pixel i, n=the number of pixels.

The latter MSE-value is dependent on characteristics of the study area. In an
area with rather homogeneous soil properties, for example, the replacement of soil
parameters in a soil erosion model will only result in a small increase of model-
error. The replacement of the topographic parameters in the model, on the other
hand may result in a huge model deterioration. The opposite is valid in drainage
basins with homogeneous slope gradients but very heterogeneous soil properties.

Moreover, it is important at which scale the model is run: at a catchment scale
soil properties may explain the main part of the variance while at a regional scale

topography may be important and at a continental scale the spatial variation of the
precipitation characteristics can be the main explaining factor. This implies that this
error-analysis should be carried out each time the model is applied in another study
area or at another scale level, as the optimal model complexity is dependent on the
spatial heterogeinity of each input parameter.

The decrease in input-error due to model simpli(cid:142) cation can be evaluated by
means of a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. For each input parameter a realistic
error distribution is estimated. Next for each input parameter a set of simulated
layers can be constructed by stochastical sampling from their distributions. If the
error on spatially distributed input parameters is not random but spatially correlated,
measures for autocorrelation must be taken into account. Next, the stochastically
generated input layers are used to produce a set of model outputs. This set of model
outputs can be used then to calculate the variance for each pixel separately. This
variance can be considered as a Mean Square Error (MSE_input). The average of
an MSE-map is an indicator for the amount of input-error caused by the tested
model parameter. The same procedure can be carried out after replacement of one
parameter by a constant value. Since this constant value is the average of a whole
input-layer, it can be considered as an error-free value if the original input map is
not biased. The MSE_input of a simpli(cid:142) ed model will therefore be lower than the
MSE_input of the full-complexity model.

Finally the impact of each parameter on the total error involved in the model
application can be evaluated. Under the assumption that the model-error and the
input-error are not correlated, the total error (MSE_tot) can be estimated as the
sum of both the model-error (MSE-mod ) and the input-error (MSE_input).

MSE_tot=MSE_mod+MSE_input

(4)

It is important to realize that the latter formula can be used for the assessment of
an average trend if many observations are involved. The formula is not valid for
individual observations. At some locations input-error and model-error will compens-
ate each other to a certain extent while at other locations input-error and model
error reinforce each other. Figure 1 shows a hypothetical example. The black squares
are hypothetical model predictions when error-free input data are used. The white
circles are model predictions when erroneous input data are used. The deviation
between the black squares and the line of perfect agreement is the model-error. The
white circles are the actual model predictions. The deviation between the white
circles and the black squares is the input-error. At points 2 and 3 the (cid:142) nal predictions
are worse than the hypothetical model predictions. At points 1 and 4, however, the
input-error compensates to a certain extent the model-error. (See also table 1).

The most eYcient model, given the available input-data, is the model with the
lowest MSE_tot. If the potential increase of model-error is higher than the potential
decrease of input-error, then the parameter should be kept in the model, otherwise
it should be replaced by a constant value.

3. Application

In order to illustrate the methodology described above, its use is shown in the
application of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The RUSLE was
applied for 250 ha agricultural catchment near Leuven (central Belgium) locally called
the Kinderveld ((cid:142) gure 2).

The catchment has a rolling topography with slopes up to 20% . The soils within

the catchment are mainly loess-derived luvisols but on some places sandy outcrops
exist. Wheat, maize, sugar beet, potatoes and chicory are the main crops in the
catchment but on the steeper slopes and in some thalwegs, woodland and pasture
can be found. The mean annual sediment export at the outlet of the catchment is
about 945 ton y - 1 or 3.78 ton y - 1ha - 1 . (Steegen et al. 2000 ).

3.1. T he model

The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was developed at

the Soil
Conservation Service of the US as a design tool for conservation planning (Wishmeier
and Smith 1978). This equation is still the most widely used soil erosion model and
its development continues. The incorporation of more validation data has led to a

further re(cid:142) nement and revision of the model. These changes were incorporated in
the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) (Renard et al. 1997 ). The
RUSLE was originally meant for application at a parcel-scale, but due to a topo-
graphic extension proposed by Desmet et al. (1996) it can be used for prediction of
annual soil erosion rates of small catchments including complex land units. It consists
of a multiplication of (cid:142) ve map layers: a rainfall erosivity map (R), a soil erodibility
map (K), a slope length map (L ), a slope gradient map (S), a crop map (C) and a
soil conservation measure map (P).

The equation is:

E=R.K.L .S.C.P
(5)
Where E=the mean annual soil loss (ton ha - 1 y - 1 ), R=the rainfall erosivity factor
(MJ mm ha - 1 y - 1 ), K=the soil erodibility factor (ton h MJ - 1 mm - 1 ), L = the slope
length factor (-), S=the slope gradient factor (-), C=the crop management factor
(-) and P=the erosion control practice factor (-).

The RUSLE predicts the volume of sediment production but does not take into
account deposition processes. In general, only a fraction of the produced sediment
will reach the outlet of the catchment, the other part of the sediment is deposited
within the catchment.

3.2. Assessment of the RUSL E-parameters

For each parameter a rastermap with a resolution of 20 m×20 m was compiled.
Since the selected study area ((cid:142) gure 2) is only 250 ha, the rainfall erosivity factor
(RUSLE R) can be
constant. Therefore a (cid:142) xed value
considered to be
(650 MJ mm ha - 1 h - 1 y - 1 ) proposed by Bollinne (1982) was used.

RUSLE K-values were derived from a digitised soil map of Flanders. This soil
map provides textural
information based on the Belgian classi(cid:142) cation system
(Verheye and Ameryckx 1988). For each textural class, an average geometric mean
particle size was calculated. Using the equation of Declercq and Poesen (1991), the
K-value can be estimated then:

area

Digital elevation data for the study area were made available from the Belgian
National Geographic Institute (NGI ). The original dataset consists of a regular grid
sampled every 1’’ in latitude and every 2’’ in longitude from scanned topographic
maps at a scale of 1:50 000. Interpolation and (cid:142) ltering with a low-pass (cid:142) lter resulted
in a raster Digital Elevation Model (DEM) representing the topography as a continu-
ously varying surface with a resolution of 20 m. The accuracy of this DEM was
evaluated with more accurate DEMs (derived from 1:10:000 topographic maps) for
eight test areas. The overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the altimetric
diVerences between the two DEMs is 3.1 m. The correspondence is better in (cid:143) at
valleys and less accurate on the incised plateau. Slope gradients were derived from
this DEM using the algorithm of Zevenbergen and Thorne (1987). The mean
S-factor ((cid:142) gure 3) in the study area is 0.28(-).

A vector layer with the (cid:142) eld boundaries of all parcels used for agriculture was
made available from GIS-Flanders (GIS-Flanders 1998). The (cid:142) le was rasterised using
a resolution of 20 m. L -factors for each grid were derived from the rasterised parcel
map and the DEM, using the (cid:143) ux decomposition algorithm proposed by Desmet
and Govers (1996b). Each parcel was assumed to be a hydrologically isolated entity.
The mean L -factor ((cid:142) gure 3) in the study area is 1.82 (-).

A map with the crop for each (cid:142) eld in 1998 was made available from GIS-Flanders
(GIS-Flanders 1998). Biesemans et al. (2000) selected a possible minimum and
maximum C-value selected for every growing stage of the crops from the Agriculture
Handbook No. 537 (Wishmeier and Smith 1978) and weighted them with the erosiv-
ity value of that period. This resulted in a minimum, maximum and mean annual
C-factor for each crop (table 2). The values proposed by Biesemans et al. (2000 )

were used in this study. According to their analysis, the mean C-factor in the study
area is 0.15 (-) ((cid:142) gure 3).

The dimensionless support practice factor, P, takes into account the eVect of
special management practices such as strip cropping and terraces. In the study area
no erosion conservation practices are carried out resulting in a constant P-value of 1.
Finally the mean annual erosion rates in the study area were calculated via the
multiplication of the 6 RUSLE layers ((cid:142) gure 3). The mean soil erosion rate for the
year 1998 was estimated as 4.84 ton ha - 1 .

3.3. Derivation of simpli(cid:142) ed models

Four simpli(cid:142) ed models were derived from the full complexity RUSLE: SIMP1
with constant K-factor, SIMP2 with a constant L -factor, SIMP3 with a constant
S-factor and SIMP4 with a constant C-factor (table 3). Thus, for each simpli(cid:142) ed
model a spatially distributed input ((cid:142) gure 3) was replaced by a single constant value,
being the mean value of the eliminated factor.

With each of the simpli(cid:142) ed models new soil erosion rate maps for the Kinderveld

catchment were calculated ((cid:142) gure 4).

3.4. Assessment of model-error

The model results from the four simpli(cid:142) ed versions of the RUSLE were compared
with results from the full complexity model by means of a regression analysis
((cid:142) gure 5).

The scatterplots of SIMP1 and SIMP4 show distinct linear relationships because
the K-factor and the C-factor maps contain only a limited number of discrete values.
For each simpli(cid:142) ed model the Mean Square Error (MSE, equation 3.), the Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Relative Root Mean Square Error (i.e.
RMSE/mean) were calculated (table 4).

The SIMP1 model-error is only 12% while the model-error for SIMP2, SIMP3
and SIMP4 is very high, indicating that the replacement of the RUSLE-L, the
RUSLE-S and the RUSLE-C by a mean value results in signi(cid:142) cant model
deterioration.

3.5. Assessment of the input-error

As mentioned above, the input-error involved in model applications can be
estimated by Monte Carlo analysis. Therefore the model must be run with stochastic-
ally generated input layers. For each input-paramete r (K, C, L and S) a probabilistic
distribution was assessed.

K-values were derived from the median grainsize (Dg) that was determined for
each textural class via the centroid of that class on the textural diagram. The
minimum and maximum Dg in that textural class was used to determine a minimum
and maximum K-value (see equation 5). The K-factor was considered to be uniformly
distributed between this minimum and maximum K-value, as insuYcient data were
available to make a more informed choice. By means of stochastic sampling 100
K-layers were simulated. The error on the estimated C-values were simulated using
a procedure proposed by Biesemans et al. (2000). The errors on the C-values are
considered to have a normal distribution with a zero mean (table 2) and a standard
deviation of one half of the range between the minimum and maximum C-value. By
sampling out of this distribution 100 stochastic C-layers were generated.

The topographi c factors L and S were derived from a 20 m resolution DEM with

spatial structure of the diVerence between both DEM’s, was constructed ((cid:142) gure 6).

The variogram was used to generate 100 autocorrelated error-surfaces. The addition
of the autocorrelate d surfaces with the original DEM resulted in 100 new DEMs.
The latter DEMs were used to generate 100 L-factor maps and 100 S-factor maps.

100 simulations for each parameter was considered as suYcient as standard
deviations at the pixel level for the various factors considered did not change anymore
when the number of simulations was further increased. Finally, for each model
parameter 100 alternative versions were available: this allowed to assess the uncer-
tainty involved in each model parameter separately. For each parameter the Mean
Square Error was assessed by taking the mean of the individual pixel variances
(table 5).

Next, the stochastically generated layers were used as a model-input. For each
model structure 100 possible outputs were generated. For each pixel of these output
maps the variance was calculated. The MSE of the total output map was considered
then to be the average of the individual pixel variances. This procedure was completed
for each model structure separately. The results are listed in table 6.

It appeared that the SIMP1 model (constant K-factor) performs best (total error
78% ) because the assessment of the RUSLE K-factor is rather uncertain and its
replacement by a constant value increases the model-error with only 12% . The full
complexity RUSLE is the second-best model with a total error of 111% , which is
slightly better than SIMP2 model (constant L -factor). The replacement of the S- and
C-layers by constant values is not recommended since this results in total errors of
more than 170% .

4. Discussion

The method described can be applied to any model structure for which distributed
input parameters are required. It is assumed that each distributed layer can be
replaced by a constant value. In the application presented above, the constant value
was considered to be the average of the individual pixels on the distributed layer
because over- and underestimated values are (cid:142) ltered out. This approach, however,
is only successful if there is no systematic over- or underestimation of the parameter
values. The replacement strategy is the most eVective if there is no strong correlation
between the diVerent input layers. In the presented application, for example, there
is a negative correlation between the S-factor and the C-factor. The slope gradients
under forest are signi(cid:142) cantly higher than those under arable land. As a consequence,
the replacement of the S-factor by a constant value, resulted in an overestimation of
this factor on arable land and an underestimation under forest. Since the soil
erodibility of arable land is much higher than under forest, the over- and underestima-
tion is strengthened resulting in a large increase of the model-error. If there had
been no correlation between both layers, a replacement of the S-factor would have
been more eVective.

A separate analysis of model-error and input-error can be used to determine a
minimum quality for the input data. A criterion for the minimum quality of the

input data is that its incorporation does not increase the total error involved in the
model application or at least:

(8)

MSE-input(FUL L )4MSE-input(SIMP)+MSE-model(SIMP) - MSE-input(FUL L )

(9)

(10 )

(11 )

(12 )

For example, the incorporation of a K-factor is only relevant if:

MSE-input(FUL L)413.84+0.33 - 0=14.17

or

Or after division by the mean soil erosion rate:

RMSE-input(FUL L )43.76

RRMSE-input(FUL L )478%

The full-complexity RUSLE is a multiplication of four parameters. Therefore the
RRMSE-input(FULL) can be assessed as:
RRMSE-input(FUL L )=ã RRSME2 (K )+RRMSE2 (L )+RRSME2 (S)+RRSME2 (K)
(13 )

This means that:

RRSME2 (K )+RRMSE2 (L )+RRSME2 (S )+RRSME2 (K)4(78% )2

(14 )

Taking the values from table 5 this results in

RRSME(K )4

=12%

(15 )

Thus, if RUSLE K-values cannot be assessed with a minimum accuracy of 12% , the
SIMP1 model is more accurate than the full complexity RUSLE. Table 8 gives the
minimum accuracy for the other input layers.

Out of table 8 it appears that, except from the RUSLE K, all parameters have
the required accuracy. The minimum accuracy for a model application, however,
depends on the heterogeneity of the area where the model is applied. In this study
the spatial pattern of the C-factor is the most heterogeneous one, resulting in a high
minimum accuracy. The error tolerance for the K-factor, on the other hand, is very

low because the study area has rather homogeneous soils. In an area with a homo-
geneous land use but variable soils, the minimum accuracy for the K-factor will be
lower and the minimum accuracy for the C-factor will be higher.

5. Conclusions

From the analysis it appeared that there is a correlation between the quality of
the input layers and the optimal complexity of a model. An example application
illustrated that the most complex model does not necessarily result in the most
accurate output. The two main error sources are an incomplete model structure on
the one hand and a propagation of errors on the input-layers on the other hand. A
separate analysis of both errors can be used to determine the optimal model
complexity. The method presented here has three major advantages:

1. The total error of simpli(cid:142) ed models can be assessed.
2. Depending on the involved model and input-error, a model user can decide

to further simpliciation of the model.

3. For each model parameter a minimum accuracy of estimation can be deter-
mined. If available data do not allow to estimate the model parameter with
this minimum accuracy it is better to use a simpli(cid:142) ed model that does not
incorporate the model parameter.

It should be kept in mind that the results obtained using the procedure described
in this paper are speci(cid:142) c for each combination of model and input data. Extrapolation
to other locations/models is not possible as the results depend on the model structure
as well as the spatial pattern and the heterogeneity of the diVerent data input layers.

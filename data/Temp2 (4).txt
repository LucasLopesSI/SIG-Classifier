Abstract
This  research  accounts  for  spatial  autocorrelation  by  including  latent  map  pattern
components  as  predictor  variables  in  a  malaria  mosquito  aquatic  habitat  model
specification.  The  data  used  to  derive  the  model  was  from  a  digitized  grid-based
algorithm,  generated  in  an  ArcInfo  database,  using  QuickBird  visible  and  near-
®
infrared (NIR) data. The Feature Extraction (FX) Module in ENVI 4.4
 was used to
categorize individual pixels of field sampled aquatic habitats into separate spectral
classes, convert remotely sensed raster layers to vector coverages, and classify output
layers  to  vector  format  as  ESRI  shapefiles.  These  data  were  used  to  construct  a
geographic weights matrix for evaluation of field and remote sampled covariates of
 aquatic habitats, a major vector of malaria in East Africa. The
Anopheles arabiensis
principal  finding  is  that  synthetic  map  pattern  variables,  which  are  eigenvectors
computed for a geographic weights matrix, furnish an alternative way of capturing
spatial  dependency  effects  in  the  mean  response  term  of  a  regression  model.  The
spatial  autocorrelation  components  suggest  the  presence  of  roughly  11  to  28%
redundant information in the aquatic habitat larval count samples. The presence of
redundant information in the models suggest that the sampling configuration of the
An.  arabiensis
  aquatic  habitats,  in  the  study  sites,  may  cause  field  and  remote
observations of aquatic habitats to be dependent, rather than independent, moving
data  analysis  away  from  the  classical  statistical  independence  model.  A  Poisson
regression  model,  with  a  non-constant,  gamma-distributed  mean,  can  decompose
data  into  positive  and  negative  spatial
field  and  remote  sampled 
autocorrelation eigenvectors, which can assess the precision of a malaria mosquito
aquatic  habitat  map  and  the  significance  of  all  factors  associated  with  larval
abundance and distribution in a riceland agroecosystem.

1 Introduction

Analytic  methods  commonly  used  in  malaria  ecology  do  not  account  for  spatial
correlation  (i.e.  autocorrelation)  between  field  and  remote  sampled  mosquito  aquatic
habitat observations. Traditionally, regression models have been used to model complex
relationships  between  larval  abundance  and  environmental  predictors  (e.g. Savage  et  al.
1990, Rejmankova  et  al.  1991,  Roberts  et  al.  1991,  Beck  et  al.  1994,  Rodriguez  et  al.
1996).  However,  these  models  do  not  take  into  account  the  location  of  the  samples
and  often  fail  to  distinguish  between  different  spatial  patterns  and  scales.  Prediction
based  on  regression  residuals  alone  has  a  tendency  to  produce  values  that  are  pulled
toward  the  mean  (Liebhold  and  Gurevitch  2002).  When  georeferenced  data  are  used,
residuals are assumed not to be spatially autocorrelated; otherwise the regression model
is said to be misspecified (Getis and Griffith 2002).

Spatial  statistics  can  address  the  spatial  autocorrelation  among  georeferenced
malaria  mosquito  aquatic  habitats  (Klienschmidt  et  al.  2000,  2001;  Jacob  et  al.  2005,
2007b,  2008b).  Spatial  autocorrelation  in  data  analyses  occurs  when  the  values  of
variables  sampled  at  nearby  locations  are  not  independent  from  each  other  (Tobler
1970). The causes of spatial autocorrelation in mosquito data analyses are manifold, but
three factors are particularly common: (1) biological processes, such as mosquito dispersal
or species interactions, are distance-related; (2) non-linear relationships between environ-
ment  and  mosquito  species  are  modeled  erroneously  as  linear;  and  (3)  the  mosquito

aquatic habitat model fails to account for an important environmental determinant that,
in  itself,  is  spatially  structured  and,  thus,  causes  spatial  structuring  in  the  response
(Besag  1974,  Jacob  et  al.  2007b).  In  all  of  these  cases,  spatial  autocorrelation  may
confound the analyses of mosquito data.

Spatial  autocorrelation  can  be  indexed  with  a  Moran  Coefficient  (MC:  a  product
moment correlation coefficient type of spatial autocorrelation index) or a Geary Ratio
(GR: a paired comparisons coefficient type of spatial autocorrelation index), which can
describe  distribution  of  malaria  mosquito  aquatic  habitats  (Jacob  et  al.  2005,  2007b,
2008b). In highly heterogeneous environments, however, the MC and GR indices may
fail to detect hidden negative spatial autocorrelation, though all of the visual and con-
ventional  numerical  evidence  suggests  the  presence  of  positive  spatial  autocorrelation
(Griffith 2005). Recent quantitative geographical analyses methods have supplemented
spatial statistics with an approach to determine latent autocorrelation, by decomposing
the MC and GR into synthetic variates, whose linear combinations constitute a spatial
filter model specification.

Spatial filtering uses a set of spatial proxy variables, which usually are extracted as
eigenvectors from an underlying spatial relationship matrix that ties the spatial objects
together  and  implants  these  vectors  as  control  variables  into  a  model.  These  control
variables  identify  and  isolate  the  stochastic  spatial  dependencies  among  observations,
thus allowing model building to proceed as if the observations were independent. This
independence  of  observations  permits  application  of  standard  linear  and  generalized
linear models to spatially distributed data for comparison of competing specifications of
underlying  relationship  structures  among  spatial  objects.  Additionally,  these  variables
can  evaluate  local  and  global  spatial  heterogeneities  necessary  to  capture  network
autocorrelation in spatial interaction flows, and simplify model specifications.

spatial  dependency  effects  with  linear  operator  filters  analogous  to  those  used  in
constructing  time-series  impulse-response  functions  to  demonstrate  equivalency.
Meanwhile,  Jacob  et  al.  (2007b,  2008b)  used  this  view  for  spatial  sampling  malaria
mosquito aquatic habitat data.

Visualization of redundant information in spatial autocorrelation includes specialized
scatter plots and two dimensional maps (Griffith 2003). Calculations of eigenfunctions

Mwea rice irrigation scheme is located in the west central region of Mwea Division and
covers  an  area  of  13,640  ha.  More  than  50%  of  the  scheme  area  is  used  for  rice
cultivation. The remaining area is used for subsistence farming, grazing, and community
activities. The mean annual precipitation is 950 mm, with maximum rainfall occurring
in  April–May  and  October–November.  The  average  monthly  temperatures  range  from
°
C. Relative humidity varies from 52 to 67%. According to the 1999 Kenyan
16 to 26.5
national  census,  the  Mwea  Rice  Scheme  has  a  population  of  150,000,  spread  among
25,000  households.  The  Karima  study  site  is  located  at  the  central-west  region  of  the
scheme  and  has  223  homesteads,  with  approximately  900  residents.  The  Kiuria  study
site is located in the northwest of the scheme and has 356 homesteads, with approximately
750 residents.

2.2 Larval Sampling

Field  sampling  was  conducted  from  July  2006  to  July  2007.  Fifty  two  temporary,
permanent,  and  semi-permanent  mosquito  larval  habitats,  in  the  study  sites,  were
mapped  and  classified  using  a  differentially  corrected  global  positioning  system  (CSI
DGPS Max) receiver, relying on the OmniStar L-Band satellite signal yielding, a positional
 0.392 m) (Jacob et al. 2007a). Habitats were defined as temporary
error of 0.179 m (
if  water  was  held  for  up  to  2  weeks,  semi-permanent  if  water  was  sustained  for  up  to
three months, or permanent if the water was held for a period equal to, or longer than,
six  months.  Water  bodies  were  inspected  for  mosquito  larvae  using  standard  dipping
techniques,  with  a  350-ml  dipper  to  collect  the  mosquito  larvae  (Service  1993).  The
number of dips per habitat was 20. All data, from the habitat characterization of each
aquatic larval habitat, were recorded on a field sampling form. Larvae, and a sample of
water  from  each  larval  habitat,  was  placed  in  whirl-pack  bags  and  transported  to  the
Mwea  Research  Station  for  further  processing.  All  3rd  and  4th  instar  larvae  were
immediately  preserved  in  95%  ethanol  and  later  morphologically  identified  to  species
using taxonomic keys (Edwards 1941, Giles and Coetzee 1987). The 1st and 2nd instars
were reared in plastic pans under semi-field conditions, and larvae that survived to 3rd
instar,  were  preserved  and  morphologically  identified  to  species.  The  pupae  were  kept
in  mosquito  emergent  cages  (Bioequip  Products,  Inc.),  and  the  resultant  emergent
mosquitoes were identified morphologically.

QuickBird multispectral products provide four discrete non-overlapping spectral bands,

in  the  0.45  to  0.72 
An.
www.digitalglobe.com for additional details). This information was used to identify 
 aquatic habitats in each study site. Optimal mapping of differences in riceland
arabiensis
mosquito  vector  habitats,  such  as  transitions  in  human  settlement  patterns,  requires
information  that  is  produced  from  the  visible  and  NIR  regions  of  the  electromagnetic
spectrum (Wood et al. 1991). Information from visible and NIR channels of the Quick-
  aquatic  habitats  (Jacob  et  al.

two  rice-village  complexes,  were  used  to  determine  land  use  land  cover  (LULC)  for
identifying riceland larval habitats.

Imagine

QuickBird imagery was classified using the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis
 v.8.7™ (ERDAS, Inc.,
Technique (ISODATA) unsupervised routine in ERDAS 
Atlanta,  Georgia).  An  unsupervised  classification  is  commonly  used  for  the  identifica-
tion of land covers and mosquito habitats associated with intermediate hosts and disease
vectors (Hugh-Jones 1991, Beck et al. 1994, Pope et al. 1994, Rejmankova et al. 1995,
Thomson  et  al.  1999).  The  images  were  co-registered  manually,  using  ground  control
points  (GCP)  and  geo-rectified  images  from  the  QuickBird  data.  The  images  were
co-registered  by  applying  a  first  order  polynomial  algorithm  with  a  nearest  neighbor
resampling method. The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 37S datum WGS-84
projection was used for all of the spatial datasets.

2.5 Environmental Parameters

Distance  and  canopy  coverage  measures  were  calculated  in  ArcInfo  9.2
  with
QuickBird  visible  and  NIR  data  or  by  field  sampling.  The  distance  to  the  nearest
house  was categorized into seven classes (e.g. 1: 50–100 m, 2: 101–200 m, and so on,
with 7 for distances greater than 600 m). Canopy cover was defined as the proportion
of  terrestrial  vegetation  and  other  objects  in  the  habitat.  The  selected  non-mosquito
aquatic  invertebrates  collected  in  the  dipper  samples  during  field  sampling  were  pre-
served  in  100%  ethanol  and  later  identified  to  family  using  the  taxonomic  keys  of
Merritt and Cummins (1996). The number of individuals of each family identified was
counted  and  recorded.  Shade  coverage  was  measured  in  percentage  of  water  surface

2.6 Riceland Habitat Characterization

Land use land cover (LULC) classification for all riceland 
An. arabiensis aquatic habitats
was  based  on  QuickBird  visible  and  NIR  data  and  classified  as:  (1)  ploughing:  field
preparation prior to transplanting of rice seedlings; (2) flooding: comprised of areas of
intensive  use  with  much  of  the  land  covered  by  water;  (3)  tillering:  extends  from  the
appearance of the first tiller or until the maximum tiller (5 –9) number is reached. Stem
elongation  occurs  and  the  tillers  continue  to  increase  in  number  and  height,  with
increasing  ground  cover  and  canopy  formation;  and,  (4)  fallow/post-harvest:  after
harvesting, the land is left bare waiting the next crop cycle (Figure 2).

2.7 Digitized Grid

Images for each riceland An. arabiensis aquatic habitat were digitized in an ArcInfo 9.2®
database. For remote identification, the first step is often to construct a discrete tessel-
lation of the region, using a GIS grid-based algorithm (McKinney and Tsai 1996). Each
riceland  An.  arabiensis  aquatic  habitat/polygon  was  assigned  a  unique  identifier.  Field
attribute tables were then associated to the polygons. The polygons were used to define
the sampling frame, which extended to include a 1 km buffer from the external boundary
of the study sites (Figure 3).

2.8 Spectral Analyses

In ENVI®, a spectrum plot, known as a Z-profile, was run through all bands of the QuickBird
data of the study sites. The basic workflow involved importing the spectral signatures,
collected in the field from the study sites, into a spectral library. The spectral library was
used in the Endmember Collection workflow to perform a supervised classification, based
on the known spectral signatures for riceland An. arabiensis aquatic habitats (Figure 4).

data. The ENVI preview window displayed all An. arabiensis aquatic habitat classification
results and allowed for ad-hoc adjustments and changes to the dataset. The raster classi-
fication of both study sites contained scattered individual riceland aquatic habitat pixels
of one class surrounded by a larger area of another habitat feature (i.e. islands). Sieving and
clumping  was  used  for  minimizing  clutter  in  the  habitat  pixel  classification.  The  post
classification results were converted from raster class images to vector layers. Vector layers
were overlaid onto image data, to compare raster and vector information of riceland An.
arabiensis aquatic habitats, in both study sites, using ENVI Vector Format. The ENVI data
was read in ESRI Shapefile vector format, using ENVI Reader 1.2® for ArcGIS 9.2®.

2.9 Regression Analyses

Variable selection for the multiple regression models was carried out by a combination
of automatic (stepwise) procedures and goodness-of-fit criteria, and by selecting ecological
covariates that explained urban malaria prevalence in terms of vector, host, and parasite
dynamics. A logistic regression with statistical significance, determined by a 95% con-
fidence level, was used to ascertain whether the proportions of riceland aquatic habitats,
positive for An. arabiensis larvae, differed by strata and by study site.

Logistic  regression  assumes  independent  Bernoulli  outcomes  denoted  by Yi  =  0  or
1,  taken  at An.  arabiensis  aquatic  habitat  locations i  =  1,  2, . . . ,  n,  at  each  study  site.
The  binary  values  were  described  by  a  set  of  field  and  remote  sampled  explanatory
variables  denoted  by  Xi,  a  1-by-(K + 1)  vector  of  K  covariate  values,  and  a  1  (for  the
intercept term), for an aquatic habitat location i. (see Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000).
The probability of a 1 being realized for these data was given by:

ββββ)]

ββββ)/[1 + exp(Xi

P(Yi = 1 | Xi) = exp(Xi

(1)
where ββββ was the (K + 1)-by-1 vector of the non-redundant parameters and P(Yi = 0 | Xi) =
1  −  P(Yi  =  1 | Xi).  Equation  (1)  has  been  employed  in  previous  urban An.  gambiae  s.l.
aquatic habitat modeling (Jacob et al. 2005). Its simplest form is for a constant probability
across  areal  units:  P(Yi  =  1 | Xi)  =  P(Yi  =  1 | α)  =  exp(α)/[1  +  exp(α)],  for  a  constant  α
(using bivariate regression notation, which in this research was denoted by the multiple
regression notation β0), where P(Yi = 1 | α) → 0 as α → −∞, P(Yi = 1 | α) → 0.5 as α → 0,
and P(Yi = 1 | α) → 1 as α → ∞.

The  n-by-n  0/1  binary  weights  matrix  C  was  used  to  represent  the  geographic
arrangement of An. arabiensis aquatic habitats in both study sites. Accordingly, cij = 1
if two An. arabiensis aquatic habitat locations i and j were neighboring aquatic habitats,
and  cij  =  0  otherwise  (note:  cii  =  0);  matrix  C  contained  n2  0/1  values.  Pairwise-only
spatial dependence often is assumed when specifying auto-models in terms of matrix C
(see Tjelmeland and Besag 1998). Retaining this assumption, for a spatial autoregressive
situation, An. arabiensis aquatic habitat parameters were estimated using the following
probability function:

In this research, spatial autocorrelation was measured with the join-count statistics
(Cliff  and  Ord  1981),  denoted  by  BB  if  two  ones  were  geographically  nearby  (i.e. cij  =
1),  BW  if  a  one  and  a  zero  were  geographically  nearby,  and  WW  if  two  zeroes  were
geographically nearby (Griffith 2003). These join-count statistics were converted to
z-scores  by  subtracting  their  respective  means  and  dividing  the  resulting  differences  by
their  respective  standard  deviations.  These  parameters  were  established  under  a  null
hypothesis of zero spatial autocorrelation (see Cliff and Ord 1981).

A  Poisson  regression,  with  statistical  significance,  was  also  determined  by  a  95%
confidence  level  and  used  to  ascertain  whether  the  proportions  of  riceland  aquatic
habitats, positive for An. arabiensis larvae, differed by grid cell and by study site. Poisson
regression  analyses  have  been  used  in  previous  research  on  riceland  An.  arabiensis
aquatic  habitats  (Jacob  et  al.  2007b).  The  regression  analyses  assumed  independent
counts  (i.e.  ni),  taken  at  locations  i  =  1,  2, . . . ,  n,  where  each  of  the  An.  arabiensis
aquatic  habitat  larval  counts,  from  each  study  site,  was  from  a  Poisson  distribution.
These larval counts were described by a set of explanatory variables denoted by matrix
Xi, a 1 × p vector of covariate values for a aquatic habitat location i. The expected value
of these data was given by:

i(Xi) = ni(Xi)exp(Xi
μ
where  ββββ  was  the  vector  of  non-redundant  parameters  and  the  Poisson  rates  parameter
was given by:

(3)

ββββ)

i(Xi) = μ
λ

i(Xi)/ni(Xi)

(4)

The rates parameter λ

i(Xi) was both the mean and the variance of the Poisson distribution
for an An. arabiensis aquatic habitat i. The dependent variable was the total larval count
in  an  An.  arabiensis  aquatic  habitat.  The  regression  analyses  were  performed  in  SAS
PROCREG. Larval data were log-transformed before analyses to normalize the dis-
tribution and minimize standard error. All of the covariates for the models were tested
for  multicollinearity,  using  the  partial  F  test  in  SAS,  and  no  problematic  correlations
were found.

2.10 Spatial Autocorrelation Analyses

To perform the spatial analysis on the field and remotely sampled riceland An. arabiensis
aquatic  habitat  data,  the  SAS/GIS®  software  (see  http://www.sas.com/products/gis/  for
additional details) was used. SAS PROC GENMOD was also used to build the Poisson
model  with  a  non-constant,  gamma-distributed  mean.  In  each  study  site,  both  positive
and  negative  spatial  autocorrelation  eigenvectors  were  selected  by  a  stepwise  negative
binomial regression procedure (Griffith 2006, Jacob et al. 2008b). To expand the inferential
basis with a random effect, a GLMM was used to account for latent non-spatial residual
correlation. The GLMM was computed using SAS PROC NLMIXED.

Spatial autocorrelation was evaluated among An. arabiensis aquatic habitats, based
on larval count, in both study sites. An analogous variant of conventional correlation is
serial correlations, which pertains to the correlation between values for observations of

a  single  variable,  according  to  some  delivery  of  those  values  (e.g.  time  series)  (Griffith
2003).  Neighboring  georeferenced  An.  arabiensis  aquatic  habitats,  in  both  study  sites,
were  identified  based  on  larval  count  values,  using  the  n-by-n  binary  geographic  con-
nectivity/weights matrix, C (Equation 5). As such, spatial autocorrelation was expressed
in  terms  of  the  product  moment  correlation  coefficient  formula,  but  with  neighboring

2.11 Spatial Filter Analyses

A  Box-Cox  type  of  power  transformation  was  employed  for  normal  approximation
analysis  purposes,  so  that  the  frequency  distributions  of  the  An  arabiensis  aquatic
habitat  larval  counts  better  approximated  a  bell-shaped  curve.  The  spatial  filter  con-
struction  methodology  transformation  procedure  was  used,  as  proposed  by  Griffith
(2002)  that  depends  on  the  eigenfunctions  of  matrix  (I  −  11T/n)C(I  −  11T/n),  where  I
denotes  the  identity  matrix,  1  is  an  n-by-1  vector  of  ones,  and  T  denotes  matrix
transpose a term appearing in the numerator of the MC and GR. According to Griffith
(2003),  the  first  eigenvector,  E1,  is  the  set  of  numerical  values  with  the  largest  spatial
indices  achievable,  by  any  set,  for  the  spatial  arrangement  defined  by  the  spatial
connectivity  matrix  C.  The  second  eigenvector  is  the  set  of  values  with  the  largest
achievable MC and GR, by any set that is uncorrelated with E1. The third eigenvector
is  the  third  such  set  of  values,  and  so  on.  This  sequential  construction  of  eigenvectors
continues through En, the set of values with the largest negative MC and GR achievable
by any set uncorrelated with the preceding (n − 1) eigenvectors.

To  identify  spatial  clusters  that  can  be  uncovered  with  spatial  filtering,  Thiessen
polygon  surface  partitions  were  generated  to  construct  geographic  neighbor  matrices,
each denoted by matrix C, which also was used in the spatial autocorrelation analysis.
Entries in matrix C were 1, if two points shared a common Thiessen polygon boundary
and 0 otherwise. The diagonal was coded 0. Next, the linkage structure for each surface
was edited to remove unlikely geographic neighbors to identify pairs of sample locations
sharing a common Thiessen polygon boundary (Griffith and Peres-Neto 2006). Eigenvectors
of  a  modified  version  of  this  matrix  C,  furnished  synthetic  variates  that  constituted
distinct  map  patterns  representing  the  full  range  of  autocorrelation  possibilities.
Attention was restricted to those map patterns associated with at least a minimum level
of  spatial  autocorrelation,  which  for  implementation  purposes  was  defined  by  | MC j/
MCmax | > 0.25, where MCj denoted the jth value and MCmax the maximum value of MC.
This  threshold  value  allowed  two  candidate  sets  of  eigenvectors  to  be  considered  for
substantial positive and substantial negative spatial autocorrelation, respectively.

Given this MC decomposition result, we next determined whether or not Equation

(2) can be replaced by:

P(Yi = 1 | Ei,K) = exp(α + Ei,K

β)/[1 + exp(α + Ei,K

β)]

(7)

This was determined by K denoting some subset of the n eigenvectors derived from the
spatial  filter  analyses  of  the  field  and  remote  covariates  of  An.  arabiensis  aquatic
habitats, chosen by the supervised selection criteria (i.e. Ei,K is an n-by-K matrix whose
jc y1
columns  are  the  K  selected  eigenvectors).  This  allowed  dispensing  with  the 
ij
term by shifting spatial dependence effects to the large scale variation term represented

β,  forcing  ρ  to  0,  and  letting  α

i  be  the  constant  α.  Only  the  field  and  remote
by  Ei,K
covariates of An. arabiensis aquatic habitats, other than eigenvectors, were included in
the specification. A link between Equations (2) and (7) was gleaned from the following
algebraic manipulations: P(Y = 1 | CY) = P(Y = 1 | EΛΛΛΛ ETY) = P(Y = 1 | Eδ), where ΛΛΛΛ was
a  diagonal  matrix  of  eigenvalues  whose  order  was  the  same  as  the  corresponding
eigenvectors in matrix E, δ was a vector of coefficients, and superscript T denoted the
matrix  transpose.  A  straightforward  extension  of  Equation  (7)  included  the  field  and
remote covariates in the An. arabiensis aquatic habitat model specification; the version
selected  focused  on  the  eigenvector  spatial  filter.  The  parameters α  and  β  of  Equation
(7) were estimated with the method of maximum likelihood.

This equation was used so that the eigenvectors could be extracted from the expression
(I  −  11T/n)C(I  −  11T/n).  One  of  these  eigenvectors  was  proportional  to  the  vector  1,
which was associated with the constant parameter α (the intercept of a model), leaving
n − 1 eigenvectors as candidates for describing latent spatial autocorrelation in the field
and remote sampled datasets of the An. arabiensis aquatic habitats in both study sites.
Restricting attention to only those eigenvectors describing positive spatial autocorrelation,
when  latent  spatial  autocorrelation  was  positive,  further  reduced  the  candidate  sets  in
both study sites. The symmetry of expression (I − 11T/n) C (I − 11T/n) ensured that the

eigenvectors  were  orthogonal;  the  projection  matrix  (I  −  11T/n)  ensured  that  the
eigenvectors were uncorrelated. Unfortunately, these properties were lost to some degree
in  the  logistic  regression  analysis,  because  of  the  weighting  involved  in  parameter
estimation (see Appendix A). The collinearity among the weighted eigenvectors caused
some difficulty in estimation. Collinearity increases standard error of model parameters,
leading to false acceptance of null hypotheses (Fotherigham 1992).

Negative  binomial  regression  was  used  to  determine  the  relationship  between  the
habitat parameters measured and the observed count of rice land Anopheles larvae, as
an  examination  of  the  data  indicated  that  overdispersion  was  a  significant  problem  in
the  Karima  study  site.  Negative  binomial  regression  models  can  estimate  a  dispersion
parameter  that  can  remove  the  effects  of  overdispersion  from  a  model  (Neter  et  al.
1992).  Although  the  Kiuria  study  site  did  not  appear  overdispersed,  application  of
negative binomial regression, to both study sites, facilitated the derivation of a common
model, which incorporated all regions to explain the variation in larval counts in rice-
land  An.  arabiensis  aquatic  habitats.  Because  the  Poisson  distribution  is  a  special  case
of the negative binomial distribution, coefficients estimated using Poisson regression will
not  differ  significantly  from  coefficients  estimated  using  negative  binomial  regression,
although the standard errors estimated by the negative binomial regression will not be
as efficient (Haight 1967). As a result, we offer the caveat that some factors identified
as  significant,  using  Poisson  regression,  can  become  insignificant  when  using  negative
binomial regression.

Table  2  lists  the  improvements  of  fit  in  the  adjusted  and  unadjusted  models.  The
unadjusted  model  compares  the  univariate  model,  of  the  effect  of  interest,  to  a  model
containing  only  the  intercept  term  (Griffith  2003).  Interactions  were  examined,  and
significant  interactions  were  included.  Improvement  of  fit  was  also  calculated  for  the
interaction models to determine whether including significant interactions improved fit,
when  compared  to  the  full  main  effects  model.  The  saturated  model  included  every
possible  combination  of  independent  variable,  that  is,  all  possible  interactions.  The
saturated  model  was  compared  to  simpler  models  (full  main  effects,  selected  effects
models,  and  interaction  models).  The  most  parsimonious  model  was  selected  as  the
“final” model.

The information in Table 2a indicated that, in the Kiuria study site, rice height and
levels of turbidity of habitat significantly improved fit when controlling for all factors.
No  significant  interactions  were  found,  and  the  model  controlling  for  rice  height  and
turbidity  of  habitats  fit  as  well  as  the  full  main  effects  model  which  controled  for  all
factors in the analyses and the saturated model which controled for all interactions.

Table 2b identified the covariates number of tillers, depth of habitat, canopy cover,
distance to the nearest house and distance to the nearest animal in the Karima study site.
The selected model contained only the variables canopy cover and distance to the nearest
animal and these covariates fit as well as the full main effects and saturated models.

The estimates from the spatial autocorrelation analysis, for both study sites, are reported
in Table 3. Results indicate that negligible positive spatial autocorrelation is detected for
the sample geographic distribution of An. arabiensis larvae in each of the study sites.

Estimation results, from SAS PROC GENMOD for these models, appear in Table 4.
Positive and negative spatial autocorrelation spatial filter component pseudo-R2 values
are  reported.  These  values  do  not  exactly  sum  for  the  complete  spatial  filter;  however
they are very close to their corresponding totals, suggesting that any induced multicol-
linearity was quite small.

4 Discussion and Conclusions

A  digitized  grid-based  algorithm  overlaid  on  the  QuickBird  visible  and  NIR  data  of
both  study  sites  identified  all  highly  productive  An.  arabiensis  larval  habitats  in  the
post-transplanting  and  tillering  stages  of  the  rice  cycle.  Muturi  et  al.  (2007)  observed
that  An.  arabiensis  occur  throughout  the  cycle,  but  are  more  abundant  four  weeks
post-transplanting with peaks after fertilizer application, while Mwangangi et al. (2006)

found that, in Mwea rice fields, the daily survivorship of aquatic stages of An. arabiensis
was  significantly  higher  during  the  early  stages  of  rice  development.  All  QuickBird
polygons generated were conformed to larval habitat boundaries within the 1 km buffer
of each study site. The spatial location of each grid cell/polygon was implicitly contained
within  the  ordering  of  the  matrix.  Each  grid  cell/polygon  within  the  matrix  contained
all field and remote attributes of An. arabiensis aquatic habitats based on sampled time
frames.  Multiple  data  layers  of  spatial  and  attribute  data  were  created,  using  different
coded  values  for  various  rice  field  attributes,  which  were  linked  to  the  same  grid  cell.
This  digitized  grid-based  algorithm  allowed  retrieval  and  transformation  of  seasonal
larval  habitat  data,  regardless  of  spatial  dimensionality  of  a  riceland  An.  arabiensis
aquatic habitat, in both study sites.

In this research, ENVI software automatically categorized individual pixels of An.
arabiensis  aquatic  habitats  into  separate  spectral  classes,  converted  remotely  sensed
raster  layers  to  vector  coverages  and  the  output  classified  layers  to  vector  format  as
ESRI  shapefiles.  ENVI  data displayed  all  georeferenced An.  arabiensis  aquatic  habitats
by land use factors, accounting for larval development by rice stage, in both study sites.
Use of ENVI Reader 1.2® for ArcGIS can support the production of intuitive workflows
in an ENVI module. The ENVI Feature Extraction module and newer GIS software can
help automate the process of performing accurate segmentations, using spectral processing
for image classification of An. arabiensis aquatic habitats. An object-oriented classifica-
tion  for  quantification  of  surface  patterns  of An.  arabiensis aquatic  habitats,  based  on
larval  productivity  and  QuickBird  data,  can  provide  LULC  change  information,
throughout  the  rice  cycle,  that  may  not  be  adequately  addressed  with  per-pixel
approaches. Traditional pixel-based approaches, for feature extraction, use the spectra
of each pixel to classify imagery, which typically depends upon the availability of a large
number of spectral bands, limiting the types of information that can be extracted from
pan and multi-spectral imagery (see http://www.ittvis.com for additional details).

The  regression  analyses  identified  rice  height,  levels  of  turbidity  and  number  of
tillers as significantly influencing the count of An. arabiensis mosquitoes in both study
sites.  Muturi  et  al.  (2007)  reported  a  positive  association  between  turbidity  and  An.

larvae, could disfavor the production of larvae, while water turbid from food particles
represents a very suitable habitat.

The spatial filtering analyses generated positive and negative spatial autocorrelation
eigenvectors  for  the  riceland  study  sites.  The  data  suggest  both  sites  have  Anopheles
mosquito  larval  counts  that  contain  hidden  negative  spatial  autocorrelation  which  is
masked  by  positive  spatial  autocorrelation  not  obvious  in  the  Moran’s  scatterplot.
Because  the  MC  is  asymptotically  normally  distributed,  MC  may  fail  to  detect  hidden
negative spatial autocorrelation in highly heterogeneous environments, though all of the
visual  and  conventional  numerical  evidence  suggests  the  presence  of  positive  spatial
autocorrelation (Cliff and Ord 1973).

The  geographic  distribution  of  the  log-larval  count  of  An.  gambiae  s.l.  aquatic
habitats,  in  both  study  sites,  exhibit  positive  autocorrelation  in  all  models  tested.  The
use of door and window screens, mosquito repellant, and breeding site mosquito control
programs,  tend  to  have  socio-economic/demographic  dimensions  with  spatial  expres-
sions  (Griffith  2005;  Jacob  et  al.  2007b,  2008b).  All  of  these  factors  tend  to  impact
upon contagion diffusion, inducing positive spatial autocorrelation. Meanwhile, LULC
changes throughout the rice cycle result in leaps across geographic space (i.e. hierarchical
diffusion),  which  initially  introduce  a  negative  spatial  autocorrelation  dimension  into
the distribution of riceland An. arabiensis aquatic habitats, in the study sites. Anopheles
mosquitoes  prefer  shallow  and  open  sunlit  pools  for  oviposition  in  Mwea  ricefields
(Muturi et al. 2007), where they occur in large numbers during the early stages of rice
development (Jacob et al. 2007c, Mwanagangi et al. 2008) and show a marked increase
following application of basal and topdressing fertilizers (Mutero et al. 2000, Muturi et
al.  2007).  Implementation  of  larval  control  efforts  during  the  first  8–10  weeks  of  the
rice  cycle  significantly  reduce  the  larval  densities  of  An.  arabiensis  and,  consequently,
malaria  transmission  and  associated  biting  nuisance  (Mwangangi  et  al.  2006).  As
diffusion  paths  become  reinforced  through  cyclical  repetition  over  time,  accompanied
by  repeated  annual  waves  of  local  contagion  diffusion,  a  more  uniform  geographic
distribution of aquatic habitats materializes, causing the negative spatial autocorrelation
dimension to fade away. In the end, An. arabiensis aquatic habitats are characterized by
positive spatial autocorrelation, reflecting the effects of riceland LULC change patterns
and  the  effectiveness  of  public  health  programs  that  attempt  to  minimize  the  size  of
mosquito larval populations.

The inclusion of a random effects term had little impact upon the resulting spatial
filters.  The  spatial  filters  obtained  with  the  Poisson  spatial  filtering  model  and  GLM
analyses were almost identical for the study sites. The spatial dependency in the models
revealed both negative and positive components are present, suggesting the presence of
redundant  information  in  the  riceland  An.  arabiensis  aquatic  habitat  data.  Redundant
information  can  overestimate  degrees  of  freedom  because  spatial  units  are  considered
pseudo-replication  of  the  phenomenon  (Dutilleul  1993).  Redundant  information  can
also lead to underspatial autocorrelation (Hawkins and Porter 2003). Therefore, if there
is  autocorrelation  in  regression  residuals,  due  to  unknown  factors  or  intrinsic  depend-
ence of the covariates sampled of the An. arabiensis aquatic habitats, this would lead to
underestimation  of  the  standard  errors  of  regression  coefficients  and,  consequently,
strongly inflated Type I errors.

Overall general findings in this research suggest several rules that should help guide
an analyst in riceland An. arabiensis aquatic habitat map modeling efforts. Foremost, switch-
ing between non-spatial and spatial An. arabiensis aquatic habitat model specifications

should  yield  dissimilar  intercept  values.  Secondly,  non-normal  data  are  best  described
with non-normal probability models (see Griffith 2005). Third, a spatial filter model can
be used to explore whether both positive and negative spatial autocorrelation components,
underpin a riceland An. arabiensis aquatic habitat map; a spatial filter model specification
enables a detailed understanding of latent spatial autocorrelation.

To  verify  the  accuracy  of  spatial  eigenvector  mapping  of  An.  arabiensis  aquatic
habitats  in  a  riceland  environment,  model  “checking”  procedures  are  advocated.  For
example,  in  this  research,  eigenfunction  decomposition  yielded  eigenvectors  describing
substantive positive/negative spatial autocorrelation, but only after statistical  restrictions
were applied (e.g. MC > 0.25), reducing the candidate set to a more manageable number
for  describing  a  riceland  An.  arabiensis  aquatic  habitat  map.  Restricting  the  set  of
eigenvectors over which a stepwise selection search is performed is sensible for several
reasons. First, if a homogeneous process underlies a set of georeferenced data, then the
nature of spatial autocorrelation components should not vary. A Moran scatterplot may
help  assess  the  feasibility  of  this  characterization.  Second,  if  a  parsimonious  set  of
eigenvectors is to be selected, then eigenvectors depicting near-zero spatial autocorrelation
should  be  avoided,  since  they  fail  to  capture  any  geographic  information.  Third,  as  n
increases,  the  number  of  eigenfunctions  increases,  and  hence  the  numerical  intensity
involved in executing a regression also increases. This issue is of paramount importance when
dealing with remotely sensed data where the number of eigenfunctions is in the hundred
thousands, millions, or billions (Griffth 2005). Finally, selection experience with positive
spatial  autocorrelation  analyses  suggests  that  virtually  all  prominent  eigenvectors are
contained in the set of eigenfunctions whose eigenvalues constitute the top quartile.

In  conclusion,  the  regression  analyses  identified  levels  of  turbidity  and  number  of
tillers and rice height as significantly influencing the count of An. arabiensis mosquitoes
in both study sites. The geographic distribution of An. arabiensis aquatic habitats, based
on  larval  productivity,  in  the  study  sites,  exhibit  positive  autocorrelation  in  all  models
tested; similar log-density riceland larval counts aggregate in geographic space. A spatial
filter  analyses  selected  eigenvectors  as  regressors  in  the  two  study  sites,  resulting  in
spatial  autocorrelation  being  filtered  out  of  the  residuals  of  the  georeferenced  riceland
An.  arabiensis  aquatic  habitat  data.  The  spatial  filtering  analyses  transformed  all
variables,  containing  spatial  dependence  into  covariates  free  of  spatial  dependence  by
partitioning the original georeferenced An. arabiensis aquatic habitat attribute variable
into two synthetic variates: (1) a spatial filter variate capturing latent spatial dependency,
that  otherwise  would  have  remained  in  the  response  residuals,  and  (2)  a  nonspatial
variate  that  was  free  of  spatial  dependence.  These  spatial  autocorrelation  components
suggest the presence of roughly 11 to 28% redundant information in the An. arabiensis
aquatic habitat larval count samples in the study sites.

In  future  analyses,  the  eigenfunction  spatial  filter  derived  from  the MC  should  be
used  to  determine  the  mean,  variance  and  statistical  distribution  characterizations  and
descriptions  of  field  and  remote  sampled  predictor  variables  of  An.  arabiensis  aquatic
habitats  and  their  interrelationships  in  different  environments.  Simulation  models  and
field  studies  have  shown  that  malaria  transmission  varies  greatly  between  irrigated
and non-irrigated areas (Muturi et al. 2008). Uneven distribution of blood-meal hosts and
larval habitats can create a spatial mosaic with significant variation in larval abundance.
Moreover mosquito populations fluctuate temporally, forced by environmental variables
such  as  rainfall,  temperature  and  LULC  changes  (Jacob  et  al.  2007c).  Implications  of
the  eigenfunction  spatial  filter  should  be  outlined  for  multiple  simulation  experiments

and coefficient correlation analyses using field and remotely sampled predictors of An.
arabiensis aquatic habitats sampled in various ecosystems. Additionally, spatial filtering
should be used to estimate missing georeferenced values in An. arabiensis aquatic habitat
datasets, as the asymptotic variance of the MC is unaltered by spatial filtering.

Loss of Eigenvector Orthogonality in Logistic Regression

Suppose P(Yi | Xi) = pi = exp(α + Xi
β)], i = 1, 2, . . . , n, where Xi is
a 1-by-K vector of K predictor variables. Let Y be the n-by-1 vector of observed binary
1–0 values. Then the log-likelihood function is given by:

Maximizing this function can be accomplished efficiently with a quasi-Newton method,
which approximates its appropriate second-order derivatives in terms of squared residuals.

A Spatial Filtering Specification

The first term in Equation (A.1) reveals that some relief from multicollinearity problems
may  be  realized  when  the  predictor  variables  contained  in  matrix  X  are  orthogonal.
Maximization, with respect to the elements of vector β and scalar α, and orthogonality
of  matrix  X,  results  in  an  absence  of  covariation  among  the  partial  derivatives  with
respect to the individual β
js that would be attributable to the YTX term. When the mean
of  each  Xj  variable  is  zero,  there  also  is  an  absence  of  covariation  among  the  partial
derivates  that  would  be  attributable  to  vector 1.  But  the  partial  derivative  of  the  third
∑
term in Equation (A.1) with respect to β
 results
in  covariations  among  LN(Xj)  and  Xk(j  ≠  k).  This  covariation  is  present  regardless  of
the orthogonality of matrix X. A more explicit illustration of how the orthogonality of
matrix  X  is  corrupted  in  logistic  regression  is  furnished  by  considering  an  asymptotic
equivalence  to  the  maximization  of  Equation  (A.1).  The  variance  of  the  population
probability parameter pi is given by pi(1 − pi), indicating heterogeneous variance when
pi  is  not  constant  (i.e.  variation  across  the  n  observations).  This  feature  of  logistic
regression is exploited in a second criterion that can be used for parameter estimation,
namely minimizing the weighted sum of squares quantity:

where  pi  is  given  above.  Equation  (A.2)  reveals  that  orthogonality  not  only  is  lost
through the nonlinearity of the logistic function (e.g. through the third term in Equation
A.1),  but  also  through  adjusting  for  heteroscedasticity  with  the  weights  Pi(1  −  Pi),
which  are  not  included  in  the  orthogonalization  of  the  original  predictor  variables
represented  by  matrix  X.  The  algebra  of  this  situation  can  be  studied  in  terms  of
iteratively reweighted least squares (see, for example, Fox 1997). Therefore, if matrix X
is the eigenvectors EK, collinearity complications are introduced because these eigenvectors
retain their orthogonality only for simple linear models.

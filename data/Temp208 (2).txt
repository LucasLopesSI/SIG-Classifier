Soil erosion poses a serious problem for sustainable agriculture and the environment.
There is a need to develop a simple and practical approach for broad area mapping of
soil erosion risk that uses the uncertain but available information as input data within
the constraints of reasonable cost and time. In this work, a predictive approach for
conducting analytical erosion risk assessment across broad areas is developed, which
combines a fuzzy decision tree (FDT), remote sensing and Geographic Information
System (GIS). This approach is applicable to situations with a limited amount of input
data and can easily adjust assessment factors according to actual need. In this study, four
dominating factors affecting soil erosion were considered: soil, topography, land cover
and climate. GIS thematic layers of these factors were constructed followed by fuzziﬁed
analysis through trapezoidal shaped membership functions. Based on subdivided ero-
sion response units (ERUs), an optimal FDT was determined to classify monthly soil
erosion risk into ﬁve levels. High-risk and very high-risk soil erosion in the study area
is mainly concentrated from June to August, with July and August showing the highest
risk covering more than 80% of the study area. November to March is dominated by
low risk over more than 90% of the study area, while medium risk is dominant in April,
May, September and October. Compared with ﬁeld survey data, the fuzzy decision ero-
sion risk assessment approach was shown to be applicable and economical for rapidly
identifying and locating soil erosion risk with limited input data by means of remote
sensing and GIS.

Introduction

1.
Soil erosion by water is often not only the on-site effect of land degradation but also con-
tributes largely to negative downstream off-site impacts such as ﬂooding, pollution and
siltation of waterbodies. Soil erosion affects an area of 3.6 × 106 km2 in China, account-
ing for about 37% of its total national territory (Ministry of Water Resources of PR China
2009). Not surprisingly, soil erosion has become an important topic on the agenda of local
or national policy-makers. In subtropical China, which is dominated by monsoonal cli-
mate conditions, rainfall is characterized by an extremely uneven monthly distribution,

which mostly occurs in 10–25 events of high magnitude per year which generate signiﬁcant
surface runoff during the monsoon period from May to October (Lin et al. 2011). These
concentrated heavy rains cause severe soil erosion (Wei et al. 2007, 2009). Therefore, there
is an increasing demand for a more cost-efﬁcient and timely assimilation of tabular and
spatial information for identifying speciﬁc periods of high-risk soil erosion across broad
areas. This has considerable importance at a regional scale for decision making. Moreover,
thematic maps showing the spatial distribution and temporal variation of soil erosion risk
are conducive to effective resource allocation (Mitra et al. 1998).

There are many approaches for soil erosion assessment, including reconnaissance ﬁeld
surveys, prediction with erosion models (i.e. empirical or physical) and erosion hazard
assessment. However, detailed ﬁeld measurements are time-consuming and expensive.
Empirical models can quantitatively and accurately express erosion losses if models are
validated, but their accuracy is difﬁcult to maintain when the models are extrapolated to
other regions or over a broad range of modelling conditions (Nearing et al. 1989). Although
physically based models continuously simulate erosion processes and predict spatial and
temporal variation of soil loss, a major limitation in their use has been their requirement of
a large number of input parameters with extensive ﬁeld data collection and the difﬁculties
involved in operating across broad areas (Jakeman et al. 1999). In contrast, erosion hazard
assessment methods provide a simple and efﬁcient means for assembling available data sets
to facilitate rapid investigations into the physical processes and mechanisms governing soil
erosion.

For broad area erosion risk assessment, data acquisition at low cost is the primary
issue. Remote sensing provides consistent data over broad areas with the capability of reg-
ular revisits (Vrieling 2006a), by which long-term continuously dynamic monitoring can
contribute greatly to data acquisition for regional erosion assessment (King and Delpont
1993). Moreover, optical satellite sensors, of which the most frequently applied in soil
erosion research are the Landsat series, Terra ASTER and MODIS are available for free
access. This brings about a decreasing expense for rapid data collection of erosion risk
assessment to delineate target zones where soil and water conservation practices are likely
to be the most effective. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allows for large quantities
of information on different themes and from different sources to be integrated (Burrough
and McDonnell 1998). Signiﬁcant advancements in the application of GIS for solving soil
conservation problems have taken place over the past decades.

Currently, a decision support method derived from data mining technology has been
widely used. This essentially exploratory method (Bayes and Mackey 1991) uses the avail-
able information in an optimal way rather than requiring numerous additional variables that
need to be estimated to process the data and support future decision making. The machine-
learning, probabilistic, non-parametric decision tree method has been extensively exploited
for vegetation mapping (Lees and Ritman 1991), ecological modelling (Michaelsen et al.
1994) and remote sensing studies such as land-use classiﬁcation based on threshold val-
ues of various band data (Huang and Jensen 1997). Moreover, a fuzzy approach has also
been used to assess soil erosion (Nisar Ahamed et al. 2000, Saadatpour et al. 2011). The
fuzzy decision trees (FDTs) method is based on fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory. Fuzzy
sets deﬁning the fuzzy terms for building the tree are imposed on the splitting criteria in
accordance with fuzzy restrictions and inference procedures. Compared to conventional
decision trees, FDT has not only been regarded as explainable, efﬁcient, problem indepen-
dent and relevant to broad area applications, but also as being more stable in the training
data owing to the ﬂexibility of fuzzy set formalisms (Olaru and Wehenkel 2003).

The study presented in this article was undertaken against this background. The speciﬁc
objectives include the following: (1) to develop a practical approach, combining an FDT,
remote sensing and GIS technology, for rapidly evaluating monthly soil erosion risk across
broad areas, and (2) to validate this approach through ﬁeld survey data.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study area
This study was conducted in the Danjiangkou Reservoir Area (DRA), which is situated in
central China, between latitudes 32◦ 14(cid:3) to 33◦ 48(cid:3) N and longitudes 109◦ 25(cid:3) to 111◦ 52(cid:3)
E, and has an area of approximately 17,916 km2 (Figure 1). It is characterized by a typical
subtropical monsoonal climate, with a mean annual temperature of 15.9◦C and annual pre-
cipitation varying between 850 and 950 mm. More than 80% of the rainfall occurs from
June to October in the monsoon season. During this period, the surface materials suffer
considerable scouring forces which induce soil erosion. The elevation ranges from 86 to
2084 m, and approximately 65% of the total area consists of relatively steep slopes (>15◦).
Soil types are dominated by yellow-brown soils, calcareous soils, paddy soils and purple
soils according to the Chinese soil classiﬁcation system (National Soil Survey Ofﬁce 1992).
The dominant land cover, including forests, shrubs and grasslands, accounts for approxi-
mately 70% of the land area, while farmlands and residential areas represent approximately
22% and 2.3%, respectively. Land cover is closely related to elevation and topography.
Residual forests are located only in the mountainous areas, while shrubs, grasslands and
farmlands are mainly distributed on slopes with gradients below 10◦. Although a series of

national water-soil conservation programmes have been implemented since the 1990s, soil
erosion is still a serious issue because of long-term human activities including overuse and
inappropriate development.

2.2. General research framework
The general framework of this study is illustrated in Figure 2. First, spatial data of envi-
ronmental impact factors, which are closely pertinent to soil erosion, were collected and
processed. Then, erosion response units (ERUs) were prepared as the basic study units. The
monthly soil erosion risk of each ERU was then evaluated using the FDT method. Finally,
cartographic generalization of the monthly erosion risk in the study area was conducted
using GIS. Based on the above processes, the drainage basin was conceived as an assembly
of spatial process entities with different soil erosion risks.

2.3. Data collection and preparation

The basic data used for this study included the DEM, remote-sensing images, climate data,
soil maps and ancillary information. The DEM with a grid resolution of 25 ×25 m was
supplied by the State Bureau of Surveying and Cartography. In order to acquire satel-
lite data with high spatial and temporal resolution, Landsat TM images (three scenes for
the DRA, path/row: 125/37, 125/38 and 126/37) and a series of MODIS images were
prepared, coming from the sharing plan provided by the Earth Observation and Digital
Earth Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Climate data were avail-
able for 20 meteorological stations, of which 15 were located within the DRA, with the
remaining 5 stations located outside the DRA. Nevertheless, they were situated close

enough to the study area to be considered. The soil data, including a soil type map
(1:100,000 scale) and related soil properties, came from the Soil Survey Ofﬁce of Hubei
Province.

For erosion risk assessment, a slope map was generated from the DEM. Soil erodibility
was derived by using expert judgement to classify soil properties from the original soil type
data. A monthly precipitation map was prepared using the kriging interpolation method
(Isaaks and Srivastava 1989). In this study, only the monthly average precipitation has been
used to characterize the rainfall erosivity (Nigel and Rughooputh 2010); the rainfall inten-
sity, although an important parameter to induce soil erosion, was not considered because
of the unavailability of appropriate data. After pretreatment, the high-frequency tempo-
ral information from MODIS and the high-resolution spatial information from Landsat
were fused using intensity hue saturation (IHS) transformations (Carper et al. 1990) for
obtaining monthly images with high resolution in both time and space. Then, the monthly
vegetation coverage, coming from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), was
extracted from prepared remote-sensing images:

NDVI = (NIR − R)/(NIR + R)

(1)

(2)

where NIR is the near-infrared band and R is the red band. Then, the corresponding
vegetation coverage was estimated by the following formula (Carlson and Ripley 1997):

VC = (NDVI − NDVIsoil)/(NDVIveg

− NDVIsoil)

where VC is the vegetation coverage and NDVIsoil and NDVIveg represent the NDVI
value of the pixel with bare soil or non-vegetation cover and pure vegetation coverage,
respectively.

Because of their different sources and formats, all data were further processed by uni-
ﬁcation of the geographic reference using the WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_49N, rasterization
of the vector data and transformation of the uniform raster size. Moreover, large value
differences between assessment factors and the different units employed make indirect
assessment of erosion risk extremely difﬁcult. Therefore, all variables were normalized
and directionalized to a uniform measurement system (Locantore et al. 2004), that is, the
suitability rating scale. Then, data fuzziﬁcation was executed for constructing an FDT.
A detailed description is provided in Section 2.6.

2.4. Erosion Response Units
ERUs were proposed to characterize the unique hydrological related erosion processes
caused by water and their integrated dynamics that are linked to associations of system
components and physical properties (Marker et al. 2001). The ERUs can be considered as
basic cells consisting of parameter variables. In each unit, the properties are uniform and
change only with variation of spatial scales and study objects. Thus, any ERUs with the
same individual properties are identiﬁed as having the uniform erosion characteristics (Ni
et al. 2008). In this study, the ERUs were used to spatially identify the areas subject to dif-
ferent levels of erosion risk on a continuous monthly time step, which provide information
about the spatial distribution and intensities of erosion features and processes active within
the study area.

The delineation of ERUs in the DRA was carried out in the light of the Geographical
Information Coding Models (GICM) presented by Ma (1992). In particular, the factors
dominating erosion including underlying surface parameters, that is, topography, land
cover and soil properties were ﬁrst encoded and the codes were stored in the ERUs by
their respective attribute tables. The magnitudes of the codes denote diverse ranges for
quantitative factors and different kinds for qualitative factors. The encoded factors were
then subjected to a spatial overlay analysis and relatively smaller units were merged with
their larger neighbours. The aforementioned data administration and manipulation were
achieved by GIS. The entire study area was ﬁnally divided into 15,290 irregular units
(Figure 3).

2.5. Field survey for method validation
Validation of the presented method is crucial for this study. A ﬁeld survey was thus per-
formed to evaluate soil erosion level. Using ‘Create Random Points’ in ArcGIS, 100 survey
points were selected by a stratiﬁed random sampling method to cover each of the categories
on the 2005 soil erosion map, and then we visited each investigation point in turn using a
handheld Global Positioning System (GPS). Upon arrival at the survey sites, we observed
the general physical environment and soil conditions within a 10-m radius and assigned the
points to an erosion category (Table 1). The survey points were placed no closer than 10 m
to the edges of the observation areas to compensate for potential spatial precision errors of
the GPS and in geo-referencing of the map layers (Warren et al. 2005). As a result, ﬁve soil
erosion categories were deﬁned based on the survey results, consistent with the ﬁve levels
of evaluated erosion risk maps (Table 1).

2.6. Fuzzy Decision Trees

2.6.1. Fuzzy classiﬁcation
In the process of constructing an FDT for erosion risk assessment, a primary step is to
establish an appropriate measurement system for related factors which are being consid-
ered. As most factor images hold cell values for the original map codes, they have to be
standardized to a rating scale. In this study, ratings of 1 to 3 for soil and climate and 1 to
5 for topography and land cover were used for ease of analysis. Assigning the values to
speciﬁc factors requires speciﬁc decision rules in the shape of thresholds for each factor.
Applying fuzzy logic to assess soil erosion risk entails considering the spatial objects as
members of a fuzzy set, which allows objects to take membership values between zero and
one (Zadeh 1965).

The fuzzy rule bases for the three-factor model consisted of prepared raster maps of
the slope, vegetation coverage and precipitation. Because of the simplicity in both design
and implementation based on limited information (Rihani et al. 2009), trapezoidal shaped
membership functions were selected in this study for the variables for the optimal FDT con-
struction. An initial classiﬁer was obtained, and then four scalar parameters of trapezoidal
shaped membership functions were reﬁned until satisfactory outputs were obtained with
respect to the set of rules (Mitra et al. 1998). The trapezoidal curve indicates membership
function of a vector x, deﬁned by scalar parameters a, b, c and d as follows:

The quantitative description of the trapezoidal shaped membership function used for
slope, vegetation coverage and precipitation in the three-factor model is listed in Table 2.
Moreover, the shape and range of each class for fuzzy sets used to explain the factor rating
of the three-factor model for evaluating soil erosion risk are shown in Figure 4. As a result,
the input raster factor maps were converted into fuzziﬁed variables.

So as to balance the simplicity and predictive accuracy, the established FDT was pruned

to its optimal size by the following algorithm:

argsubtrees min MAEPS

where MAE is the best mean absolute error in all subtrees generated from FDT. A subtree is
acquired by contracting the testing nodes. The tree pruning considers as candidate subtrees
only a sequence of nested subtrees and the number of candidate subtrees is linear in the
complete tree complexity.

2.7. Monthly erosion risk mapping based on ERUs

Integrating the foregoing processes, based on the superimposed ERUs map which was
acquired by the GICM system to conditionally characterize every response unit, the deci-
sion results of monthly erosion risk from the optimal FDT was ultimately converted into
predictive risk maps of monthly soil erosion within a GIS environment.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Fuzzy decision tree
The exploratory FDT with 49 terminal nodes is shown in Figure 5. The number of observa-
tions per terminal node ranged from 1 to 4, with no further partitioning. The description of
soil erosion risk at ﬁve levels (very low, low, medium, high and very high) for a given termi-
nal node is the estimated degree of each ERU falling in this node. Based on four pertinent
factors, slope, soil erodibility, vegetation coverage and monthly average rainfall, according
to the principle of maximal information gain, partitioning of this FDT always started from
rainfall, and then by two cases: (1) the slope followed by soil erodibility and vegetation
coverage when the rainfall is at a medium level, and (2) vegetation coverage followed by
the slope and soil erodibility when the level of rainfall is high. To a certain extent, this
reﬂects the relative importance of the predictive erosion-dominating factors impacting on
soil erosion in different periods. As shown in Figure 5, this decision tree follows a pattern
of soil erosion risk being at a level of low or medium, when the rainfall is relatively low,
no matter what degree the other three factors are. However, when the rainfall is relatively
high, soil erosion risk is inﬂuenced by more complex integrated effects from the slope, soil
erodibility and vegetation coverage.

and VC denotes the vegetation cover. For the FDT output, the letters VL, L, M, H and VH for

3.2. Dynamic and distribution characteristics of soil erosion risk
On the produced monthly soil erosion risk maps with ﬁve levels derived from the results of
the FDT (Figure 6), high-risk and very high-risk soil erosion in the DRA is mainly concen-
trated in June to August, of which July and August show the highest erosion risk covering
the largest area (greater than 80%), followed by June which has a proportion of 65%.
November to the following March is dominated by low-risk erosion, which accounts for
more than 90% of the area, while the medium risk level is dominant (greater than 79%) in
April, May, September and October (Table 3). Furthermore, close to the northern tributaries
(in Henan Province) of the Danjiangkou reservoir are distributed large tracts of farm-
land, sparse grasslands and wastelands on steep slopes, which show a relatively high-risk
soil erosion in most rainy months. Simultaneously, a similar situation also exists in other
regions surrounding the reservoir. The above results illustrate the combined effects of rain-
fall, slope and land cover on the occurrence of soil erosion. Owing to long-term anthropic
pressure, including overuse and inappropriate development, soil erosion has become a seri-
ous issue in the DRA, which restricts regional sustainable development. Moreover, most
water erosion takes place in the rainy season, which is dominated by monsoonal climate
conditions. Therefore, the effects of broad area assessment of monthly soil erosion risk are
increasingly sought by regional stakeholders and managers, which provide useful informa-
tion for planners to make decision and allocate resources in a responsible manner.

3.3. Method validation with ﬁeld observation data
A confusion matrix was developed to compare ﬁeld observation data of soil erosion with
the predicted erosion risk levels. This matrix indicates a good overall accuracy of 76%
(Table 4), with the user accuracy ranging from 67% to 81% and the producer accuracy rang-
ing from 60% to 87%. Therefore, veriﬁcation shows that the evaluation method predicts the
spatial distribution of erosion very well. Furthermore, assessment often overestimates the
risks but rarely underestimates them (Boggs et al. 2001, Renschler and Harbor 2002). This
can be considered as a positive point for management planning considerations because
the possibility of overlooking actual risk decreases. In addition, the possible causes of
classiﬁcation error are diverse. The results of validation samples from the ﬁeld survey
were inferred from measurement at the on-site observation sites which in fact are subject

to more complex environmental inﬂuences than the assessment results of the four main
factors conducted in the evaluation by the FDT method. The training sample data may also
not be sufﬁcient to entirely represent all kinds of erosion state in the study area, and cer-
tain categories of the training samples may be sufﬁciently similar to others to be confused.
Moreover, data precision and timeliness may lead to errors and uncertainty in the assess-
ment results such as the continuous rainfall maps generated from discrete points using
spatial interpolation whose accuracy could potentially be improved. Therefore, increasing
the training samples and improving data quality will greatly contribute to the assessment
accuracy.

3.4. Method performance
Historically, soil erosion modelling has used a number of different methods, ranging from
almost entirely empirical to largely theoretical physical and stochastic models (Aksoy and
Kavvas 2005). The empirical models have a statistical basis, whereas physically based
models intend to describe the acting processes on a storm event basis and many other
models contain diverse components (Vrieling 2006a). Multiple model styles are there-
fore needed, depending on potential applications. However, in support of policy decisions,
arguably the greatest need is developing models that can produce robust results using
readily available data (Renschler and Harbor 2002), which is precisely the objective of
this study.

Combining the superiorities of the FDT and GIS-based conditional analysis, an
approach for broad area mapping of monthly soil erosion risk with readily available data
is developed here. In particular, the fuzzy decision method can reﬂect the heterogeneous
characteristics of soil erosion level and the complex synergism of various environmental
factors with intelligible and concise fuzzy logic methodologies. This enables us to classify
and quantify uncertain environmental conditions with a powerful and convenient formal-
ism. The FDT is ﬂexible in its data requirement as it does not speciﬁcally demand the
measured data, which is often difﬁcult to acquire across broad areas. Moreover, it does
not require exact soil erosion modelling solutions based on experimental statistics or com-
plicated process description and can adjust assessment factors according to actual need.
Therefore, this method is especially appropriate for regions where complete broad area
monitoring systems are unavailable. Furthermore, taking advantage of remote sensing, the
difﬁculties of data acquisition can be greatly alleviated at low cost and time consumption.
The evaluation maps from the presented approach were validated through comparison
with ﬁeld survey results, which indicates an accuracy of 76% for modelling in soil erosion
risk (Bou Kheir et al. 2006, Vrieling et al. 2006b, Keﬁ et al. 2011). However, the limi-
tations of this study are hard to avoid because of the uncertainty inevitable in any system
which is likely to cause confusion in decision making (Shen et al. 2010). Model uncer-
tainty includes uncertainties in structure of the model, model parameters (Van Rompaey
and Govers 2002), and uncertainties in the solution of the model (Addiscott et al. 1995).
The approach presented here requires detailed data pertaining to topography, vegetation
cover, soil and climate. The input data may cause uncertainty because the meteorologi-
cal data, land-use map, soils and their related attributes and DEM cannot be completely
accurate. In addition, several algorithms have been used when preparing data for assess-
ment factors and each step has the potential to accentuate errors. Furthermore, because of
data limitation, only the average precipitation has been used for characterizing the rain-
fall factor in erosion risk assessment. Although temporal variation on a monthly scale

has been considered, it may be too simpliﬁed for an accurate description of the real sit-
uation (Jenny 1961). Therefore, the need to recognize and deal with problems associated
with data and model uncertainty provides challenges for future studies that, if properly
addressed, will enhance the value of this approach to users and extend their potential
applications.

The temporal approach used here is the main difference between the presented
approach and most other models. This approach was applied to deﬁne soil erosion risk
maps from the point of view of each month, which so far is the ﬁrst of its kind to be
attempted in the DRA. In fact, only a few examples of temporal soil erosion risk evaluation
have been reported elsewhere. Le Bissonnais et al. (2001) considered erosion risk assess-
ment on cultivated soil for the four seasons of France and Europe, respectively. Vrieling
et al. (2008) used coarse-scale multi-temporal satellite imagery to determine the period
of a year when soil erosion risk is the highest. Mutekanga et al. (2010) evaluated ero-
sion risk for six months of April, May and August to November in Uganda. Nigel and
Rughooputh (2010) produced monthly soil erosion risk maps to assess erosion hazard in
a basin unit of mainland Mauritius. Keﬁ et al. (2011) compared the spatial distribution of
soil erosion risk by water with different models for 1999, 2005 and 2007. Furthermore,
previous studies in the DRA have focused more on the average annual and inter-annual
variation on soil erosion (Zhang et al. 2006, Song et al. 2011). However, most surface
runoff and soil erosion in the DRA occurs in 10 to 25 heavy storms from May to October,
and this period is critical for crop management associated with fertilizer application and
tillage. The eroded soil carries considerable amounts of nutrients and pesticides, which may
pose a danger to the aquatic ecology. Therefore, there is a real need for concentrated rain-
fall erosion risk assessment outcomes for regional decision makers to design conservation
measures such as ﬁlter strips, wetlands and grassed waterways, which are helpful in pre-
venting contaminants from entering the river and/or reservoir during the high erosion risk
period.

4. Conclusion
An FDT approach for broad area mapping of monthly soil erosion risk has been developed
in this article. The approach is economical and practical for aiding policy development
and decision support by remote-sensing dynamic monitoring and GIS spatial processing.
The risk assessment maps at a monthly time-scale can better determine critical periods
and unstable areas of potential erosion generation based on the seasonal variation in intra-
annual rainfall, which demonstrates that the highest risk erosion is mainly concentrated
from June to August. November to February was dominated by a relatively low-risk ero-
sion, while a medium-risk erosion was dominant in March to May, September and October.
As a consequence, the DRA illustrated a marked tendency for soil erosion to be more likely
to occur in the wet months. The assessment results are conducive to regional environmental
protection and development planning.

The presented method was applied to evaluate the monthly soil erosion risk, which has
not been attempted previously in the DRA. With a validated accuracy of 76%, integra-
tion of remote sensing, GIS and FDT has actually proven to be effective for classiﬁcation,
assessment and mapping soil erosion risk in this region. The efﬁciency of this method sug-
gests that it is worth attempting in other analogous broad area regions. Moreover, if further
data sets were more detailed and precise, such as higher resolution remote-sensing images
or/and DEMs as well as more indicators to characterize factors, the evaluation maps of
soil erosion risk for the DRA could be improved to better represent the actual conditions.

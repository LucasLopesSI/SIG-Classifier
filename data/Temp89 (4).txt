Introduction to the Special Issue on Spatial modeling to explore land use

is a central

Land Use and Land Cover Change (LUCC)
theme of global
environmental change research (Turner II 1994, Vitousek et al. 1997). The LUCC
project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IBGP) and the
International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change
(IHDP) aims at stimulating and coordinating research on land use change (Lambin
et al. 2000, Turner II et al. 1995). Scientists associated with the LUCC community
ranging from anthropology to
have a background in different disciplines,
mathematical programming. However, this diverse group of scientists shares a
common, geographic, interest: the future of the land. Much of the integration of
knowledge on land use change takes place through (spatial) models that aim at
explaining the causes, locations, consequences and trajectories of land use change.
The variety in disciplinary origin of the researchers contributing to LUCC has lead
to a wide range of different modeling approaches and techniques. The papers in this
special issue provide an overview of a number of representative approaches for land
use modeling that have evolved since the start of the LUCC project in 1995.

The papers are selected contributions out of a series of nine conference sessions
dedicated to land use modeling at the ‘‘Framing Land Use Dynamics’’ conference at
Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands, 16–18 April 2003. The contributions
provide an overview of the state-of-the art in land use modeling by presenting a
range of different modeling techniques as well as methods for integrating the
contribution of different disciplines into land use research. At the same time, the
papers address some of the big issues identified as priorities in land use modeling
(Lambin et al. 2003, Veldkamp and Lambin 2001): integration of knowledge over
different scales and disciplines; the focus on land use changes at the rural-urban
interface and the validation of land use models.

The integration between the social, economic and spatial sciences at different
scales is still one of the main challenges for LUCC research. For many of the
disciplines participating in LUCC research the integration with the spatial sciences is
troublesome and some of the researchers in the social sciences are not able to make
optimal use of the wealth of information available through remote sensing and
spatial analysis methods. At the same time, spatial modelers face difficulties in using
the insights obtained from case studies of land use change conducted by sociologists
and anthropologists. The LUCC implementation strategy (Lambin et al. 2000) made
the integration of disciplinary approaches one of the main objectives of the
programme: ‘‘The depth of understanding brought to bear from bottom-up, field-
based approaches must be made spatially explicit, including efforts to integrate
results with remote sensing information (‘pixeling the social’); remote sensing

approaches that potentially increase spatial and temporal dimensions of land-use/
land-cover change understanding must be pushed beyond its biophysical dimensions
(‘socializing the pixel’). The connection between micro-level behavior of individuals
and communities and macro-level structures and patterns is critical’’. The LUCC
community paid serious attention to this issue and much has happened since the
LUCC implementation strategy was published. As an emerging field of research,
combined with the advantage of an interdisciplinary approach, the community has
been able to make big steps forward over the past few years. Integration of the social
and spatial dimensions of LUCC research is documented in numerous papers, books
and special issues (Bian and Walsh 2002, Fox et al. 2002, Haberl et al. 2001,
Nagendra et al. 2004, Veldkamp and Lambin 2001, Veldkamp and Verburg 2004)
and the emergence of a generation of new modeling approaches for land use change
research (Benenson and Torrens 2004, Parker et al. 2003, Verburg et al. 2004).

Also in this issue different contributions reflect the progress in this field. In one of
the papers a new approach to integrate household survey information with spatial
analysis of GIS and remote sensing data is suggested (Overmars and Verburg 2004),
contributing to the use of social science data in spatial analysis. At the same time, others
have taken the challenge to actually model individual behavior to simulate the outcome
of micro-level interactions between agents of land use change that result in spatial
patterns of landscape change (Brown et al. 2004, Caruso et al. 2004). Multi-agent
models are now becoming an accepted tool for land use analysis and certainly provide a
link between the underlying processes of land use change and the resulting spatial
pattern. Also within the new Global Land Project proposed to IGBP and IHDP multi-
agent models play a major role in modeling decision-making underlying changes that
affect the functioning of the earth system (Ojima and Moran 2004).

Land use models focusing on either deforestation or agricultural land use change
have mostly been developed separate from urban models. Little exchange has
occurred between both research communities, leading to a different set of research
approaches and modeling techniques. However, some of the modeling techniques
used in urban models are relevant for rural applications and vice versa. At the
Utrecht conference we were happy to see a mixed community of urban and rural
modelers exchanging ideas and discussing the challenges for integrating urban and
rural simulation techniques. An exchange of techniques equips the modeler with a
wider range of options for modeling specific situations. A wide range of techniques
is available, each having its own strengths and limitations. The papers in this issue
represent a number of these techniques, including: logistic regression approaches
(Overmars and Verburg 2004), neural networks (Pijanowski et al. 2004), Cellular
Automata (Dietzel et al. 2004, Jantz and Goetz 2004), Markov chains (Pontius and
Malanson 2004), micro-economic (Caruso et al. 2004) and multi-agent simulations
(Brown et al. 2004), applied to case studies ranging from the forest fringe in the
Philippines to the urban periphery of Brussels, Belgium.

The development of tools and techniques for validation of spatial models has
gained more attention of land use modelers recently. At the end of the twentieth
century only a few operational land use models were available apart from the
models focusing on urban development (Hall et al. 1995, Lambin 1997, Veldkamp
and Fresco 1996). Land use modeling has passed this pioneering stage and a wide
range of models is currently available, many of those are considered to be useful for
policy making. A quantification of uncertainty and validity of the model simulations
has, therefore, become one of the priorities in land use modeling. Standard validation

techniques are often not applicable to land use models resulting in the development of
new validation methods (Oreskes et al. 1994). Some aim at validating the outcomes of
the model and to compare the performance of different model specifications (Jantz
and Goetz 2004, Pontius and Malanson 2004) while others specifically aim at
validating the modeled processes that have given rise to the dynamics of the model
(Brown et al. 2004). Both validation approaches are essential, since multiple processes
can generate the same pattern whereas the same process can generate different
patterns. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that the aim of validation is not
solely the improvement of model performance; many models are just tools to conduct
experiments to test our understanding of land-use change processes and describe them
quantitatively. In this case, validation techniques can be a tool to compare simulations
and identify the missing links in our understanding.

Most papers in this issue do not provide clear-cut solutions or answers to the
issues discussed above. However, they provide new directions for tackling these
issues and raise awareness for the potential of sharing insights from different
disciplines to deal with the complex functioning of the human-environment system
that leads to changes in the land use pattern of the earth’s surface. The importance
of understanding and managing the land use system to increase resilience towards
vulnerability and sustained development of the earth’s resources make it necessary
to continue our effort to meet the challenges LUCC research is facing.

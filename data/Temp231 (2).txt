Abstract. Con(cid:142) dence in the conclusions of GIS and remote sensing analyses
depends on our ability to specify their accuracy. The square error matrix, which
is commonly used for accuracy assessment when the database contains continuous
digital choropleth data, allows computation of user’s, producer’s, overall, and
Kappa coe(cid:141) cient accuracy values. However, when the underlying assumptions
of the square error matrix method are violated, these accuracy values may become
unreliable. We demonstrate how traditional forms of accuracy assessment can fail
for discontinuous binary surfaces and provide an improved spatial assessment
method. We developed 15 new accuracy measures that allow analysts to assess
scene- and feature-level accuracy from many new perspectives.

1.

Introduction
Assessing the accuracy of continuous categorical maps, generated by classifying
remotely sensed imagery, is common. Several well-documented accuracy assessment
procedures using point-in-polygo n techniques (Blakemore 1984), polygon overlays
(Chrisman and Lester 1991), and error matrices (Congalton 1991) have been
developed. Error matrices are widely used and simple to construct (Rosen(cid:142) eld 1986,
Congalton 1991) and allow the computation of Kappa (Cohen 1960, Rosen(cid:142) eld and
Fitzpatrick-Lins 1986), a measure of actual agreement minus the agreement expected
by chance (Næsset 1996). However, these procedures can become unreliable when
their underlying assumptions are violated (Congalton 1991).

The error matrix assumes that map categories exhibit spatial continuity and
evenness thus allowing simple random sample points realistically to represent the
surface. With binary representations of data, this continuity and evenness of categor-
ies can be compromised. Further, if the category of interest only represents a small
proportion of the entire image, polygons (or cells) representing the category of

interest may be considered discrete features on a vast background. We refer to this
categorical condition as a discontinuous binary surface. Sampling methods speci(cid:142) c
to the error matrix may yield biased results for discontinuous binary categorical
maps (Congalton 1988).

The Kappa coe(cid:141) cient is a preferred measure of accuracy compared with the
traditional overall accuracy value from the error matrix (Rosen(cid:142) eld and Fitzpatrick-
Lins 1985; Fitzgerald and Lees 1994). The estimator of the Kappa coe(cid:141) cient, KHAT,
has been widely used to test signi(cid:142) cant diŒerences between and among various error
matrices (Congalton and Mead 1983, Congalton et al. 1983). However, if simple
random sampling is not conducted, the con(cid:142) dence of the Kappa coe(cid:141) cient may also
be biased for discontinuous binary surfaces (Stehman 1992).

To reduce attribute errors due to positional inconsistencies between maps, all
data must be properly co-registered and checked by comparing distances between
point locations (Barrette et al. 2000) or by measuring the root-mean-squar e (RMS)
error (Jensen 1996, Ferna´ndez et al. 1997). These assessments are especially important
when datasets are combined for analysis, which can result in multiplication and
propagation of errors leading to improper conclusions (Heuvelink et al. 1989,
Congalton 1991, Lunetta et al. 1991 ).

This paper provides a new approach for computing accuracy for discontinuous
binary maps, using (cid:142) re mapping in a northern boreal forest as a case study. Annual
(cid:142) res in northern Ontario (discrete features) represent # 1% of the 43 million ha study
area (background), providing an ideal discontinuous binary surface for analysis. The
methods we describe allow several variations of spatial accuracy to be quanti(cid:142) ed,
explained and presented both numerically and graphically. In general, this paper
demonstrates the superiority of a discrete-feature accuracy assessment over the
traditional error matrix and Kappa approaches for discontinuous binary surfaces.

2. Methods
2.1. Fire mapping

Decreases in the Normalized DiŒerence Vegetation Index (NDVI), calculated
from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), have been used
to map vegetation senescence and forest (cid:142) re disturbances in various biomes
(Raza(cid:142) mpanilo et al. 1995). By subtracting pixel values between two spatially comple-
mentary images and applying a threshold (Lunetta and Elvidge 1998), it has been
shown in boreal Alaska that all change values exceeding the threshold value can be
coded as (cid:142) res (Kasischke et al. 1993, Kasischke and French 1995). Three thresholds
developed in Alaska (table 1) were applied to imagery (Eidenshink and Faundeen
1994) obtained for the area north of 51ß
latitude in Ontario, Canada, for the 1992,

1993, and 1995 (cid:142) re seasons to map large (cid:142) res. Unmanaged boreal forests that
undergo little or no (cid:142) re suppression dominate this geographical area, allowing (cid:142) res
to reach 1000 s to 10 000 s of ha. More detailed descriptions of the (cid:142) re-mapping
methods are provided in Remmel (2000) and Remmel and Perera (2000, 2001 ).

The resulting binary (cid:142) re maps (images) were resampled from 1063 m to 531.5 m
spatial resolution (doubling the original resolution) and geocorrected to match the
projection of the GIS reference data. The increased resolution ensured a smoother
(cid:142) re boundary after the second-order geocorrection with nearest neighbour resampling
(ERDAS Inc. 1997). Twenty-one ground control points were selected along distinct-
ive hydrological features (e.g. shorelines, islands, rivers, and coastlines) as per the
approach of MartÌ´n and Chuvieco (1995). The ground control and corresponding
image reference points were used to calculate the RMS error. A RMS error of
approximately 400 m was considered acceptable (MartÌ´n and Chuvieco 1995, Lunetta
and Elvidge 1998). Each contiguous cluster of (cid:142) re pixels was assigned a unique code
for discriminating individual mapped (cid:142) res. Finally, (cid:142) re maps were converted to
vector format.

2.2. Reference data

Reference data for assessing the accuracy of (cid:142) re mapping consisted of a (cid:142) re-
pattern GIS database describing the dates and locations of (cid:142) res in Ontario between
1921 and 1995 (Perera et al. 1998). We only used reference (cid:142) res for the years of
study (1992, 1993, and 1995). The database was compiled from hardcopy maps
derived from (cid:142) eld data, aerial photographs , and interpretation of Landsat images.
The (cid:142) re perimeters were originally digitized at varying scales, representative of their
source data. These represent a historical account of (cid:142) re in the province.

Fire polygons within the reference database often abutted or were adjacent to
other (cid:142) re polygons, forming clusters (i.e. not always dispersed ). Given the variability
in delineation scale and source, these nearby (cid:142) re polygons could represent diŒerent
areas of the same (cid:142) re event, or each (cid:142) re event could consist of several independently
digitized polygons. Thus, all (cid:142) re polygons within 1063 m (one AVHRR pixel dimen-
sion) of each other and belonging to the same year, were coded to indicate that they
are a part of a common reference (cid:142) re event. To remove eŒects of varying map scale
among reference (cid:142) re events, the reference database was rasterized to the same
resolution as the mapped (cid:142) res (531.5 m) and converted back to vector format,
allowing direct area comparisons. Since 531.5 m resolution was larger than the (cid:142) re
boundary variability within the original reference data, this coarser resolution served
to standardize the scale.

2.3. Preparation for accuracy assessment

For each treatment (NDVI threshold value), the geometric intersection (union)
between mapped (cid:142) res and the reference database were computed using ArcInfo
(ESRI Inc. 1997 ). Overlapping polygons were split and given attributes from both
original polygons ((cid:142) gure 1 ). The original reference and mapped (cid:142) re polygons
remained available by querying with original polygon identi(cid:142) ers (i.e. event and code).
These part-polygon s in (cid:142) gure 1 were su(cid:141) cient to calculate proportions of areas
mapped within reference boundaries but not for calculating the total contiguous
mapped area associated with a reference (cid:142) re event (discrete feature).

In (cid:142) gure 1 all parts of the large reference polygon (comprising of both R and DmR)
contain a common event number. However, the adjoining part-polygo n labelled D, has

no event associated with it. To compute various measures of total mapped areas
associated with reference events, unique event numbers were added to the external,
contiguous part-polygo n records using an algorithm written by the authors.

To transfer the event number to D in all unique cases, the devised algorithm
located all part-polygon s adjoining reference polygons and associated them with the
proper number. These linkages were possible because of the GIS database structure
(table 2). The devised algorithm selected a unique event number (e.g. 4) from the
union database. It would store each unique poly-id value (reference (cid:142) re, part-polygon
identi(cid:142) er) associated with that (cid:142) re event (i.e. 29). Then, for each of those poly-id
values, the algorithm stored all unique code values (i.e. 0, 95, 105). These codes were
then parsed in sequence; e.g. if code >0, then the event number was updated. Each
unique (cid:142) re event was automaticall y processed until all updates were completed.

2.4. T raditional error matrix approach

For each treatment, an error matrix was generated. Two thousand reference
points were selected for the study area using a simple random sampling design.
These reference data were compared with the (cid:142) re map data in each treatment to

Notes: The detected and reference columns are populated to indicate whether polygons
represent detected (cid:142) res or reference (cid:142) res. Since a reference (cid:142) re may consist of more than one

compute producer’s, user’s, overall, and Kappa coe(cid:141) cient measures of accuracy
(Congalton 1991).

2.5. Discrete-feature approach

The discrete-feature approach allowed 15 accuracy measurements to be computed
from two levels of observation: (1) scene and (2) feature. The levels of observation
were further dissected by considering three diŒerent perspectives (i.e. map, event, and
reference). Scene-level variables returned one non-site-speci(cid:142) c accuracy value per
treatment, while the individual reference event-level variables returned accuracy
values for each detected (cid:142) re within a treatment. The bene(cid:142) t of the feature level of
observation is that accuracy values for each event can be linked back to the original
(cid:142) re polygons as attributes, allowing accuracy to be mapped spatially for each event.
Figure 2 describes the possible components resulting from the intersection of
reference (cid:142) re polygons with mapped (cid:142) re polygons. Each component is given a unique
hatch pattern that is used to describe various area combinations used for calculating
the 15 new accuracy variables. The scene-level variables consider undetected and
falsely detected (cid:142) re areas even when they are not associated with features (events)
because accuracy values are generalized for the entire scene (non-site-speci(cid:142) c). The
perspective de(cid:142) nes the denominator for each variable, regardless of the observation
level. At the feature level of observation, there are no map perspective variables
because falsely detected (cid:142) res would never intersect with reference (cid:142) re polygons;
therefore, those components would never enter computations.

The variables de(cid:142) ned in (cid:142) gure 2 are aligned to indicate similarities between
observation levels. The scene-level correct, incorrect, and omission variables corre-
spond to the feature-level interior, exterior, and omission variables. The diŒerences
stem from the inclusion of undetected (cid:142) re and falsely detected (cid:142) re areas in scene-
level variables. The mapped-to-referenc e ratio variable measures the ratio of mapped
to reference area for each (cid:142) re event, regardless of their proportion of intersection.
The map perspective calculates accuracy relative to the total area mapped by the
(cid:142) re-detection algorithm. The event perspective computes accuracy relative to the total
area of mapped events, disregarding all falsely detected (cid:142) res. Finally, the reference
perspective computes accuracy relative to the total area of reference (cid:142) res.

3. Results/discussion

dominated study area resulted in the majority of reference locations representing the

background class. This led to almost perfect producer’s and user’s accuracy values
for background. However, the few points residing in the (cid:142) re class returned more
varying results (table 3 ). Given the low count of reference points within the (cid:142) re class,
the accuracy values do not necessarily represent true ground conditions.

The misrepresentation of accuracy is viewed as a drawback of the error matrix
approach. Since a simple random sample is required to meet the assumptions of
Kappa coe(cid:141) cient and overall accuracy calculation (Congalton 1988), the discontinu-
ous binary surface accuracy is automaticall y biased owing to a disproportionat e
distribution of class areas.

The overall accuracy reported for each treatment was >99%. However, when
the numbers of correctly and incorrectly detected (cid:142) res are considered (table 4 ), this
level of accuracy appears much too high. Kappa coe(cid:141) cient values (table 3) appear
to be better estimates of overall accuracy, but given the drastic diŒerences in reference
sample numbers between the two classes, the Kappa coe(cid:141) cient and overall accuracy
calculations can be easily in(cid:143) ated (Fitzgerald and Lees 1994).

3.2. Feature-oriented , scene-level accuracy measures

Three measures of accuracy (i.e. correct, incorrect, and omission) were computed
from each of three perspectives (i.e. map, event, and reference) for the scene level of
each treatment (table 5). Since these values were based on all mapped and reference
areas, the entire population, rather than just a simple random sample was assessed
for accuracy. The scene-level feature-oriented assessments of accuracy diŒer drastic-
ally from the values of overall accuracy calculated from the error matrix approach.
Since the feature-oriented values were more realistic, they con(cid:142) rm the need for these
alternative assessment approaches. Furthermore, nine measures per treatment are

The map perspective answers the question: how well (or poorly) were (cid:142) res mapped
with respect to the total mapped area? The event perspective indicates how well (or
poorly) (cid:142) res were mapped with respect to all mapped areas associated with reference
(cid:142) re events. Finally, the reference perspective allows accuracy to be assessed with
respect to all reference (cid:142) re areas.

The three measures within each perspective provided a means for further discrim-
inating areas correctly mapped from those not mapped or incorrectly mapped. These
measures indicate the relative proportion of the indicated condition with respect to
a reference area as governed independently by each of the three perspectives ((cid:142) gure 2).
The accuracy values reasonably re(cid:143) ect the expected diŒerences among mapping
methods and years. For example, mapping method 3, representing the lowest thresh-
old of NDVI change, correspondingl y exhibits lowest omission. It does not always
exhibit highest correct values because the lenient nature of the threshold increases
increasing the denominator acts to decrease
incorrect detection simultaneously;
observed accuracy. Mapping method 2 uses the strictest (highest) threshold value;
consequently, omission errors are highest owing to the limited areas mapped.
Conversely, values for incorrect (cid:142) re mapping are lowest. Values for correctly mapped
(cid:142) res vary depending on the amount of mapped/non-mapped area in(cid:143) uencing the
denominator.

We believe that thin clouds present in the imagery in 1992 and 1993 acted to
depress NDVI values resulting in poor accuracy (e.g. Kasischke and French 1997).
The considerably better values in 1995 were partly due to the occurrence of several
large, easily detected (cid:142) res (Kasischke et al. 1993), but also to cloud-free imagery.

3.3. Feature-oriented , feature-level accuracy measures

Aside from calculating scene-level accuracy measures,

the discrete-feature
approach can partition accuracy into components providing a means for calculating
accuracy measures for sub-scenes and individual features. We calculated accuracy
measures ((cid:142) gure 2) for all detected (cid:142) res individually, which allowed us to determine
accuracy among and within individual (cid:142) res on the background.

Feature-level assessment provides site-speci(cid:142) c accuracy values. The event per-
spective’s interior and exterior values indicate the percentage of the mapped area
(without regard for absolute reference (cid:142) re size) that lies inside/outside the reference
(cid:142) re perimeter with respect to the total area mapped. Thus, it measures the positional
accuracy of the mapped area (overlap of mapped and reference area). The omission
value indicates the reference (cid:142) re area remaining unmapped in relation to the area
of the mapped portion for that object.

The reference perspective’s interior and exterior values indicate the percentage of
reference area correctly and incorrectly mapped. The mapped-to-reference measure
of accuracy provides insight to the areal correspondence between reference and
mapped area without regard for absolute location. Thus, the mapped-to-reference
ratio reduces the concern of spatial misregistration, an issue of confusion as indicated
by Congalton and Green (1993).

The bene(cid:142) t to calculating percentages is that they can be used to compare among
treatments and discrete features. Therefore, accuracy can be compared for individual
features. Feature-oriente d accuracy assessment does not assume homogeneous error
across the entire image, allowing this potential variability to be tested from two
perspectives, potentially providing a distribution of varying accuracy levels across
the (cid:142) re map.

3.4. Spatial distribution of accuracy values

The computed feature-level accuracy measures were linked back to the original
GIS database as attributes for each reference (cid:142) re event. This allowed the construction
of choropleth maps showing accuracy distributions for each of the accuracy measures

independently. As an example, (cid:142) gure 3 displays the 1992, 1993, and 1995 interior
accuracy results for the (cid:142) re map generated by mapping method 3. The (cid:142) gure
categorizes each (cid:142) re into one of three levels of accuracy described in the caption.

Visualization of spatial accuracy could help indicate regions of the image where
accuracy was especially poor or good. Signi(cid:142) cant diŒerences in accuracy may be
related to misregistration, ecological phenomena, or user error. By combining quant-
itative accuracy assessment results with the ability to spatially recognize patterns,
overall evaluation will become more rigorous.

4. Conclusions

Accuracy assessment techniques relying on the square error matrix method may
return incorrect values for discontinuous binary surfaces. In this study, overall
accuracy and Kappa coe(cid:141) cient values were unreasonable for the square error matrix,
owing to the disproportionat e distribution of reference data stemming from the
simple random sampling design. Since simple random sampling is required to meet
the assumptions for calculating these values, the error matrix approach was con-
cluded to be insu(cid:141) cient for assessing mapping accuracy of discontinuous binary
surfaces.

The proposed object-oriented method of accuracy assessment for discontinuous
binary surfaces using an existing GIS database showed many bene(cid:142) ts over the error
matrix approach. Most importantly, an image could be partitioned, allowing accu-
racy assessment of either the entire scene or various subsets thereof. Furthermore,
since the reference data were in polygon GIS format, all data were used for accur-
acy assessment, eliminating the need for a sampling procedure to select reference
locations.

Combinations of three perspectives, seven accuracy measures, and two levels of

observation allow various aspects of accuracy to be assessed. This reduces the reliance
on an all-encompassing accuracy value, and allows discrimination of accuracy
depending on speci(cid:142) c user requirements. Underlying this is the ability to focus on
areal and/or positional accuracy. By disregarding precise positional accuracy, areas
of individual mapped features can still be compared to reference areas. Thus, if
calculating (cid:142) re areas were the major concern, small spatial misregistration problems
could be ignored.

Generation of choropleth maps from accuracy measures linked to the original
GIS database as attributes provides a powerful method for visualizing the distribution
of accuracy. These distribution maps can be used to isolate regions of high or low
accuracy leading to further hypotheses, analyses, and explanations of data quality.

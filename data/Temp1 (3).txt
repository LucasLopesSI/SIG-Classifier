Jiantao Bi, Jean Brodeur, Jiankun Guo, and Xingxing Wang

Abstract: Discovery and access of Web services for geographic information on the Semantic
Web has not been addressed yet by the Semantic Web community or by the geographic
information community. However, ISO/TC 211 in the ISO Technical Specification ISO/TS
19150-1:2012, Geographic information — Ontology — Part 1: Framework provides a plan to
cover this purpose. Recently, ISO/TC 211 approved a new project ISO 19150-4, Geographic
information — Ontology — Part 4: Service ontology, for the development of a new ISO stan-
dard that deals with Web services for geographic information. This ISO standard has
reached the draft international standard stage. This paper aims at providing an overall
description of the standard including the ontological framework for geographic informa-
tion services and a crosswalk with other frameworks for Web services (such as OWL-S,
SWSO, WSMO) to support interoperability with them.
Key words: ontology, Semantic Web, geospatial information, web service, interoperability.

1. Introduction

The development of Web services for geographic information (hereafter called GeoWeb
Services) appeared at the beginning of the millennium with the publication of the
OpenGIS Web Map Server Interface Implementation Specification (Open Geospatial
Consortium Inc. 2000). Several other types of GeoWeb Services followed such as Web
Processing Service, Web Feature Service, Web Coverage Service, and so on. Today,

GeoWeb Services have been realized widely on the Web especially as part of Spatial Data
Infrastructures (SDIs) for delivering and processing geographic information. However, the
discovery of these resources on the Web may be an issue because they are frequently not
indexed properly in Web registers.

GeoWeb Services are of interest not only for Web users, but also for Semantic Web users.
Typically, Semantic Web resources are described as part of ontologies in RDF (W3C 2014) or
OWL (W3C 2012). As such, a standard ontological framework for describing GeoWeb
Services on the Semantic Web will ease and simplify browsing this information. There were
a few attempts to standardize the description of Web Services (e.g., Semantic Markup for
Web Services (OWL-S), Semantic Web Services Ontology (SWSO), and Web Service
Modeling Ontology (WSMO)) for the Semantic Web. However, none of them were approved.
In addition, none of these addressed the very specific needs of Web services with respect to
geographic information.

In 2009, the ISO technical committee 211 (ISO/TC 211) issued a review summary report on
the topic of Geographic information — Ontology after a 2-year study that identified the
various components that require specific attention with respect to international standards
to support geographic information on the Semantic Web. Among others, it was recom-
mended that ISO/TC 211 shall review service description to support discovery of GeoWeb
Services on the Semantic Web and decide about an ontological framework (OWL-S,
WSMO, or another) to use for this purpose. More specifically, ISO/TS 19150-1:2012
Geographic information — Ontology — Part 1: Framework (ISO/TC 211 2012) recognized
the requirement for geographic information Web service ontologies and gave a special
attention to it. This technical specification recognized that the Semantic Web could facili-
tate the interaction with Web services by introducing semantics and ontologies for Web
services. Automation of Web service discovery, composition of Web services, and their
invocation to enable seamless machine interoperation with minimum human interaction
can be supported by the Semantic Web. However, it requires ontologies providing semantic
annotations of services in terms of capabilities, selection, access, composition, and invoca-
tion. Therefore, in 2016, a new ontology project on services (i.e., ISO 19150-4, Geographic
information — Ontology, Part 4: Service ontology) was approved by ISO/TC 211. The scope
of this project is to establish a framework for geographic information service ontology
and the description of geographic information Web services in OWL with consideration of
the standards on metadata (ISO 19115-1) and services (ISO 19119).

This paper aims at providing an overall description of the framework to support the
ontological description of GeoWeb Services. This framework is central for ISO 19150-4.
Also, the paper provides additional information for interoperability with existing
framework.

The paper is structured as following: Section 2 provides an understanding of services on
the Web and the Semantic Web. Section 3 describes the requirements for discovering and
accessing GeoWeb Services on the Semantic Web in terms of use cases. Section 4 fleshes
out the details of the ontological framework for GeoWeb Services. Section 5 relates the
OWL-S, the SWSO, and the WSMO frameworks to the ISO 19150-4 framework to illustrate
how to interoperable between them. Finally, concluding remarks are provided in Section 6.

2. An account of GeoWeb Services

2.1 Web services

The Web Services Glossary (W3C 2004b) defines a Web service as “a software system
designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has
an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically Web Service
Definition Language (WSDL)). Other systems interact with the Web service in a manner

prescribed by its description using Simple Access Object Protocol (SOAP) messages, typically
conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization in conjunction with other Web-related stan-
dards” (W3C 2004b). It is essentially a software application that can perform particular tasks
over intranets, extranets, and (or) the Internet (Daconta et al. 2003).

A Web service shall have the three following properties: discoverable, describable, and
accessible. To be discoverable, a Web service should be registered on the Web. The
Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) is one of the first Web technolo-
gies that was set to discover information about Web services. When a service of interest is
identified from a registry, it is then important to get a description (i.e., describable) of its
functionality and how it can be invoked (protocol, location, format, interface, etc.). This is
possible with technologies such as WSDL, which provides the service interface definition
in machine-processable format. A Web service is accessible when it can be invoked. This
can be done, for example, with a SOAP request typically encoded in XML.

Web technologies have progressed impressively during the last two decades for example
with the advent of REST (“representational state transfer”) architecture (Fielding 2000),
which is based on the HTTP protocol and Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs).

3.2 Geographic information Web services

Access to geographic information on the Web has been widely implemented by the way
of Web services. The Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (OGC), has pioneered the develop-
ment of Web services in the context of geographic information. The OpenGIS Web Map
Server Interface Implementation Specification (also called WMS) (Open Geospatial
Consortium Inc. 2000) was the very first definition of Web services that provided map
images registered with geographic coordinates served by one or more distributed geospa-
tial databases. The images can be displayed after in a web browser application.

Other OGC Web services specifications were developed after to enable multiple function-
alities on the Web. That is the case for the Web Feature Service (WFS), which enables the
retrieval and access to information on specific geographic features and properties instead
of on a file basis. This kind of service enables direct access to information for specific pur-
pose including the update of geographic information databases.

Another type of OGC Web services is the Web Processing Service (WPS), which defines,

among others, the handling of inputs and outputs and the execution of the service.

Nowadays, these GeoWeb Services are widespread on the Internet. The OGC Catalog
Service for the Web (also known as CSW; Open Geospatial Consortium Inc. 2016) constitutes
the OGC mechanism to publish and search metadata about data, services, and related infor-
mation objects. It is via such catalogs that services can be discovered and identified for their
uses by other applications.

Most of these catalogs are integrated in SDIs (GSDI 2012). Fundamentally, an SDI facili-
tates the sharing of geographic information. As such, it coordinates resources (policies,
standards, human and technological resources, and data) required for that purpose. In addi-
tion, an SDI involves all the stakeholders at the different levels (local, regional, and global)
of the geographic information community that it serves. Among others, an SDI enables the
documentation through metadata, the management, the access, the delivery, and the uti-
lisation of geographic information to support multiple applications.

In the geographic information realm, ISO/TC 211 has also addressed Web service as part
of ISO 19119, Geographic information — Services (ISO/TC 211 2016), and ISO 19115-1,
Geographic information — Metadata (ISO/TC 211 2014). ISO 19119 defines a framework to
standardize the description of geographic information services, whereas ISO 19115-1 sets
the structure for the documentation of geographic information services in terms of meta-
data elements.

3.3 Geographic information Web services and the Semantic Web

However, the discovery, access, and use of Web services are also of interest for the
Semantic Web. The Semantic Web can facilitate the interaction with and between Web ser-
vices by adding semantic descriptions (Sycara et al. 2005). Semantic Web can support Web
services to automate the Web service discovery, the composition of Web services, and their
invocation to enable seamless machine interoperation with minimum human interaction.
As such, ontologies are required for the semantic annotation of services in terms of capabil-
ities, selection, access, composition, and invocation. There were a few attempts in the W3C
to standardize an ontology for describing Web services, namely OWL-S, SWSO, and WSMO.
OWL-S (W3C 2004a; DAML 2008) comprises three parts that are the profile, the model,
and the grounding of the service (Fig. 1). The profile is the part that describes the service
and what it fulfills in terms of capabilities. It includes a number of metadata about its iden-
tification and description, its category, and its parameters, preconditions, and results
(Fig. 2). The model part aims at providing details on how to use the service by describing
the semantic content of requests, the conditions to observe, and as appropriate, the steps
to follow to get the expected outcomes. Grounding is the component describing the way

to access a service in terms of protocol, message formats, serialization, transport, and
addressing. Grounding is the practical component that enables service interaction.

SWSO (W3C 2005a) is described by the way of a conceptual model that underpins the
ontology and a set of first-order logic axioms that shape the model-theoretic semantics of
the ontology. It is an attempt to extend OWL-S with additional functionalities. SWSO is
made of service descriptors that provide basic information of the service such as service
name, author, contacts, contributors, description, url, identifier, version, release date, lan-
guage, trust, subject, reliability, and cost. It also includes the FLOWS (i.e., First-order Logic
Ontology for Web Service) process model that sets the set of first-order logic axioms for
specifying services and service composition and interaction.

WSMO (W3C 2005b) is meant as an ontology to describe the several characteristics of a
Web service. WSMO includes four components: an ontology, goals, Web service description,
and mediators (Fig. 3). In WSMO, the ontology defines a terminology in terms of a set of con-
cepts and relationships that occur between concepts such as non-functional properties,
ontology, mediators, concept, relation, function, instance, and axiom. Each of these con-
cepts are further defines in more details with additional properties and relationships. A
class for Web service is defined, which allows for the description of the Web service, the
description of the capabilities of the service, and the description of its interface providing
the functionality of the Web service. The goals of the Web service provide a description of
what the service can fulfill or accomplish. Finally, the mediators are the components that
make possible the interoperability between different ontologies’ Web Service descriptions
and Web service goals. They resolve the heterogeneities on data, process, and protocols.

Up until now, there have been no attempts to address Web services in geographic infor-
mation for the purpose of the Semantic Web. However, at the end of 2016, ISO/TC 211
approved a new project on ontology, ISO 19150-4, to address the description of GeoWeb
services for the purpose of the Semantic Web. This project has reached the draft
international standard stage and proposes a framework and an ontology that take into
consideration the above W3C member submissions and the relevant ISO/TC 211 and OGC
works on Web service. The ISO 19150-4 framework is described at Section 4 of this paper.

3. Discovering and accessing GeoWeb Services on the Semantic Web — use cases

Before describing the framework for GeoWeb services, it is essential to understand the
actors who are involved in the field of GeoWeb services, how they are related to each other,
and what their requirements are. To address this, this section identifies the relevant actors
and depicts the use cases that have been considered for the definition of the ISO 19150-4
framework.

Geomat. Vol. 72, 2018

3.1 Actors

In the context of geographic information service and the Semantic Web, we are consid-
ering four types of actors, namely GeoWeb Service, GeoWeb Service Provider, GeoWeb
Service Registry, and Semantic Web (SW) Client, which are all depicted in Fig. 4.

A GeoWeb Service is a specific kind of Web Service especially defined to provide geo-
graphic resources and information about them. There are a number of specific kind of
GeoWeb Services currently defined such as (see Fig. 4): Web Mapping Services that provide
georeferenced map image; Web Feature Services that provide geographic data (features and
(or) coverages) according to some criteria; Web Coverage services that provide access to data
such as raster image, polygon overlay, or digital elevation matrix; Web Processing Services
that enables the execution of computing processes (e.g., georeferenced transformation or
data encoding transformation) and to get the description of their purpose and functionality
through metadata. Other types of services may also be deemed under GeoWeb Services
which are growing constantly.

A GeoWeb Service provider is an organization that deploys GeoWeb Services and sup-

plies them to other actors (end user, another Web service, etc.) on the Web.

A GeoWeb Service Registry is an information system accessible on the Web to maintain
and provide access to a register of GeoWeb Services, which contains identifiers and descrip-
tions of the GeoWeb Services being registered. The GeoWeb Service Registry enables the
discovery of GeoWeb Services on the Semantic Web.

A Semantic Web Client (SW Client) is an individual or a software (another Web service, a
Web API, etc.) that wants to locate a Web Service (or a Geo Web Service in our specific case)
that can supply a specific task and, then, to invoke it.

3.2 Use cases

Figure 5 illustrates the use cases that relate the actors together. On the right-hand side of
the figure, there is the GeoWeb Service Provider who wants to make a service available to
SW Clients. First, the GeoWeb Service Provider has to register the service in a GeoWeb

Service Registry to make the service known to the SW Client. In registering the service, the
GeoWeb Service Provider provides the description and the capabilities of the service and
the GeoWeb Service Registry assigns an identification to the service. Second, the GeoWeb
Service Provider must deploy the service and make it accessible on the Web such that a
SW Client May invoke it.

On the left-hand side of the figure, there is the SW Client that wants to discover GeoWeb
Service resources from the GeoWeb Service Registry. The SW Client may want to get addi-
tional information on discovered GeoWeb Services by getting their respective description
and capabilities and goals from the GeoWeb Service Registry. With that information, the
SW Client may be in better position to select the required GeoWeb Services. After, the SW
Client can invoke the selected GeoWeb Services to get the expected service.

The following sub-sections describes each of these use cases.

3.2.1 The register use case

To register a GeoWeb Service on a GeoWeb Service Registry to enable its discovery on the
Semantic Web, a GeoWeb Service Provider has to send a request for service registration to a
GeoWeb Service Registry (Fig. 6). Then, the GeoWeb Service Registry responds back to the
GeoWeb Service Provider with approval or not of the service registration.

Figure 8. Discover use case.

Figure 9. Describe use case.

3.2.2 The deploy use case

To make a GeoWeb Service accessible on the Web and to make it invokable by SW
Clients, a GeoWeb Service Provider shall upload and put into operation the GeoWeb
Service such that it can then be invoked by SW Clients (Fig. 7).

3.2.3 The discover use case

To discover GeoWeb Services performing a specific task (Fig. 8), a SW Client must submit
an inquiry to a GeoWeb Service Registry to identify such GeoWeb Services. The GeoWeb
Service Registry will then respond back to the SW Client with a list of discovered services
that corresponds to the request.

3.2.4 The describe use case

To get a detailed description on discovered GeoWeb Services to identify their fitness for
use, a SW Client can submit a request for service description to the GeoWeb Service
Registry (Fig. 9). The GeoWeb Service Registry sends back the corresponding descriptions
of the GeoWeb Services to the SW Client.

3.2.5 The capabilities and goals use case

To get a detailed account of the capabilities and goals of the GeoWeb Services including
service trust, reliability, accuracy, performance, robustness, security, scalability,

transactional, and extent, a SW Client can submit a request for the capabilities to the
GeoWeb Service Registry (Fig. 10). The GeoWeb service registry then responds back with
the GeoWeb service detailed capabilities accounts.

3.2.6 The invoke use case

By invoking a GeoWeb Service, a SW Client gets access to it to request performing a spe-
cific task with the appropriate parameters and to receive back the expected response
(Fig. 11). The response can take the form of a set of data from a database or from a transfor-
mation of input data, of a Boolean value in the case of a validation process, of a transaction
to a database, etc. The range of possible response from the GeoWeb Service is wide.

3.2.7 Playground of ISO19150-4

The use cases described above are essential to understand the roles and relationships
between the actors. However, not all of these use cases are part of the playground of ISO
19150-4, Geographic information — Ontology, Part 4: Service ontology. ISO 19150-4
addresses specifically the use cases register, discover, describe, and capabilities and goals
before.

4. Geospatial Web Services ontological framework

This section depicts the detailed content of the ISO 19150-4 framework for the represen-
tation of GeoWeb Services on the Semantic Web. The framework has been defined based on
or with consideration to a number of existing Web service resources (Table 1).

The ISO19150-4 framework, which is hereafter illustrated in UML, addresses the follow-
ing aspects of GeoWeb Services: identification, description, capabilities, goals, and finally,
metadata.

4.1. GeoWeb service identification and description

This section addresses the components for the identification and the description of

GeoWeb Services.

4.1.1 Identification

The identification of GeoWeb Services includes five elements, namely identifier, name,

taxonomic and function identification, lifecycle descriptor, and description (Fig. 12).

Figure 12. GeoWeb Service identification. [Colour online.]

The identifier is a mandatory element that takes the form of an HTTP Universal Resource
Identifier (URI) and provides an unambiguous reference. The name is a mandatory human
readable designator of the GeoWeb Service. The taxonomy and function element consists
of a pair of values providing the nature (i.e., taxonomy) and purpose (i.e., function) of the
GeoWeb Service. At least one pair, but possibly multiple pairs, of taxonomy and function
can be associated to one GeoWeb Service. However, the function value is not mandatory
and can therefore be an empty value. The possible taxonomy values are listed in the
GeoWeb Service Taxonomy list of values shown in Table 2. For each taxonomy value, there
is a corresponding set of function values that is enumerated in Table 3. The lifeCycle element
is a descriptor of the GeoWeb Service usage-oriented life cycle perspective. At least one
descriptor is required but multiple descriptors are allowed. The GeoWeb Service life cycle
set of acceptable values is listed in Table 4. Finally, a description of the service is associated
to each GeoWeb Service Identification. The description elements are detailed in Section 4.1.2.

4.1.2 Description

The description of GeoWeb Services is composed of 12 elements, namely description,
subject, version, date, language, source, contact, rights, cost, url, parameters, and service
chaining information (Fig. 13).

The mandatory description element is of type character string and aims to give a brief
account of the GeoWeb Service such as a summary of the service offering and any require-
ments it has. The mandatory subject element is of type of GenericName (see ISO 19103,
Geographic information — Conceptual schema language) and provides the topic of the
GeoWeb Service. The mandatory version element is of type character string and identifies
the release of the GeoWeb Service at a given time. The date element is optional of the type
CI_Date (see ISO 19115-1, Geographic information — Metadata, Part 1: Fundamentals). It tells
when one or multiple events happened in the life cycle of the GeoWeb Service.

Figure 13. GeoWeb Service description. [Colour online.]

The mandatory language element identifies the ISO 639 language code in which the GeoWeb
Service is available. The service may be offered in multiple languages. The optional source
element provides URI references to elements such as data sources that are at the origin or
are used by the GeoWeb Service. The optional contact element identifies individuals or
organizations responsible for the GeoWeb Service or any specific aspect of the service. The
optional rights element provides details about any right that could be held in and over the
GeoWeb Service. The optional cost element provides details on fees requested for accessing
and using the GeoWeb Service the service may be accessed for free. The cost of the service
can be simply a cost value in a given currency or it can be described in a more detailed man-
ner if the cost mechanism is complex. The optional url element indicates the various urls
where the service is accessible on the Web. The optional parameters element identifies those
that are required for the good operation of the GeoWeb service, which includes parameter,
input, output, precondition, and result. The optional serviceChainingInformation element
identifies the service metadata for operation chaining (see ISO 19115-1).

4.2 GeoWeb Service capabilities and goals

The capabilities and goals of GeoWeb Services is composed of nine elements that are
trust, reliability, accuracy, performance, robustness, security, scalability, transactional,
and extent (Fig. 14).

The optional trust element is of type character string and describes the trustworthiness
of the GeoWeb Service. The optional reliability element is a measure providing the amount
of failure of the GeoWeb Service in a given time interval, which provides a performance
ability indication. The optional accuracy element is a notification of the error rate that
the GeoWeb Service generates. The optional performance element is a speed indication in
terms of throughput, latency, execution time, transaction time, or response time of a
request execution. The optional robustness element is of type character string and
describes how the GeoWeb Service can operate correctly with incomplete or invalid inputs.
The optional security element mentions if authentication, authorization, confidentiality,
traceability or auditability, data encryption, and non-repudiation are provided by the
GeoWeb Service. The optional scalability element is a measure of the number of solved
requests in a certain time interval that shows its ability to process more requests in a cer-
tain time interval. The optional transactional element is of type character string and
describes the transactional properties of the Web Service (i.e., information on how to nego-
tiate with the Web Service). The optional extent element describes the extent, scope, or cov-
erage of the GeoWeb Service.

4.3 GeoWeb Service metadata

The metadata of GeoWeb Services is described by only one optional element
geoWebServiceMetadata (Fig. 15) which is further composed of multiple service metadata
elements that are part of the SV_ServiveIdentification type described in ISO19115-1:2014.

4.4 ISO 19150-4 OWL ontology

The corresponding OWL ontology to this framework is available on the ISO/TC 211
GitHub repository at https://github.com/ISO-TC211/GOM/tree/master/isotc211_GOM_
harmonizedOntology/19150-4/2019.

5. Interoperating with other Web Service ontological frameworks

As mentioned in Section 2, there are few other frameworks for the ontological descrip-
tion of Web services in addition to existing standards such as ISO 19115-1:2014.
Interoperating with other Web service ontological frameworks is necessary but is also a
challenge. In the definition of the ISO 19150-4 ontological framework, OWL-S, WSMO,
SWSO, and the OGC Web Service Common (OWS-C) (Open Geospatial Consortium Inc.
2010) were used as background documents. A crosswalk (Table 5) was developed to ensure
that the 19150-4 ontological framework covers all the elements identified in these
documents.

The crosswalk essentially illustrates how the elements from OWL-S, WSMO, SWSO, and
OWS-C are mapped to ISO 19150-4 elements. As you can see, ISO 19150-4 consolidates the ele-
ments from OWL-S, WSMO, SWSO, and OWS-C and adds others (elements that are not covered
by these other frameworks). However, not all ISO 19150-4 elements can be mapped to one
another framework. As you can see from the crosswalk, this is unavoidable since these frame-
works do not cover all the same set of elements.

However, this crosswalk provides an excellent introduction for the interoperation
between ISO 19150-4 and one of OWL-S, WSMO, SWSO, or OWS-C. The crosswalk is not
meant to support interoperability between OWL-S, WSMO, SWSO, or OWS-C although it
can help.

Base on the crosswalk, equivalences to ISO 19150-4 properties could be added in the other
framework ontologies and, conversely, ISO19150-4 could be extended to add equivalences to
these other framework’s properties. For example, an extension of the OWL-S OWL ontology
can state that the property GeoWebServiceIdentification.name from ISO19150-4 is equivalent
to its serviceName property.

<owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:abaout=“&owlsProfile:serviceName”>
<owl:equivalentProperty rdf:resource=“&iso19150-4Service:GeoWebServiceIdentification.
name”/>
</owl:DatatypeProperty>

And conversely, an extension of the ISO19150-4 OWL ontology can state that the property
serviceName from OWL-S is equivalent to its GeoWebServiceIdentification.name property.

However, the development of these OWL equivalency axioms was outside of the scope of

the development of ISO19150-4.

6. Concluding remarks

This paper presents a description of the ISO 19150-4 framework for the ontological
description of GeoWeb Services on the Semantic Web. First, a review of related works on
services on the Web and Semantic Web has been provided. It includes a description of
Web services, a review of GeoWeb services, a description of Spatial Data Infrastructure
(SDI), and the description of services and GeoWeb Services on the Semantic Web. Second,
the requirements for the discovery and access of GeoWeb Services have been stated by
the way of use cases. Third, the ISO 19150-4 ontological framework has been described in
detailed, and lastly, a crosswalk with OWL-S, SWSO, and WSMO frameworks has been pro-
vided to support interoperability between these ontological frameworks and the
ISO19150-4 ontological framework. There are still additional works that needs to be done
to end up interoperability with OWL-S, SWSO, and WSMO, but ISO 19150-4 brings a good
foundation.

The ISO19150-4 ontological framework has been developed taking in consideration
OWL-S, SWSO, and WSMO. However, it has been designed for the purpose of providing an
ontological and detailed description of GeoWeb services on the Semantic Web. By provid-
ing such a description, it makes possible to Semantic Web users to discover easier
GeoWeb Services published in GeoWeb Service Registries that fits their specific needs and
where to get access to them. This framework enables GeoWeb Service providers to supply
a standardized description of their services for the purpose of the users.

The next logical step will be to develop the structure of the GeoWeb Service Registry. The
ISO19150-4 ontological framework will serve as a foundation for the development of
the GeoWeb Service Registry structure. A new work item is in process to be submitted
to ISO/TC 211 for its development and will become part 6 of ISO 19150, Geographic
information — Ontology, as Service ontology registry.

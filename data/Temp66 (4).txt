Abstract. The present
Decision Support System (SDSS) for a test Nagwan watershed situated in the
Damodar–Barakar catchment in India, the second most seriously eroded area in
the world, for not only estimating sediment yields under prevailing resource
management systems but also designing a linear programming (LP)-based

optimized land-use plan for soil
proposed SDSS was validated on 9 years (1981–1983, 1985–1989, and 1991) of
sediment yield data for the test watershed. This showed that the SDSS could
mimic the annual dynamics of the total sediment yields at the test watershed
outlet with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.65, model efﬁciency coefﬁcient of
0.70, mean relative error of 217.97%, and root mean square prediction error
of 9.63 t ha21. It could also be used as an efﬁcient tool for assessing sediment
yields from different parts of the test watershed and for designing a linear
programming (LP)-based optimized land-use plan for reduced total sediment
yields from the test watershed. The LP-based land-use plan proposed no

change in the total areas under paddy, corn, and forest land-use types but
suggested their re-distribution within the test watershed, thereby leading to
not only a reduction in the test watershed’s total sediment yield by about
14.61% but also an increase in its paddy and corn crop productivities by 2.80
and 68.14%, respectively. The proposed LP-based land-use plan for the test
watershed could thus lead to an enhanced productivity beneﬁt of about
Rs 3735 ha21,
in monetary terms, from corn crop cultivation at its optimal
locations.

1.

Introduction
Soil erosion is one of the normal aspects of landscape development. However,
extensive soil erosion has contributed signiﬁcantly to the impoverishment of the
land and people of India. Out of a total geographic area of 328 Mha, about
187 Mha is subject to varying degrees of water erosion problems. Sheet erosion
exists almost throughout the country (Anon. 1996). With growing population and
demands for improved living standards, land is becoming an increasingly scarce
resource. It has been estimated that about 5334 MT of soil is lost annually at an
annual average national soil erosion rate of about 16.75 t ha21 yr21 against a
permissible level of 7.5–12.5 t ha21 yr21 for various regions. The eroded soil carries
with it huge amounts of essential nutrients. It is estimated that annually there is a
loss of about 6.2 MT of plant nutrients and about 40 MT of food grains, which in
monetary terms is estimated to be equal to a loss of about Rs 28 000 million (Bhan
1997). It is speculated that if the present rate of 1 mm of soil loss per year is
sustained, about one-third of the arable land in the country is likely to be lost
within the next 20 years. Although the erosional lowering of the land surface at a
few millimetres per year has little apparent effect in human lifetime, its long time
effect is considerable and can jeopardize the life of future generations. Thus, in the
process of passing good farmland to the next generation, it is imperative not to
allow soil erosion at a rate which depletes soil resources faster than they can be
renewed. This can be achieved by maintaining a tolerable level of erosion by
adoption of effective land use and conservation practices.

such as Spatial Decision Support Systems

A variety of techniques can be used to minimize the impact of various
agricultural and other activities on total soil loss from a large area. These practices
are generally area-speciﬁc, and thus general guidelines are not feasible. The cost-
effectiveness of these practices also varies signiﬁcantly from site to site. Evaluating
alternate resource management strategies through experiments at each site within a
large area is generally not feasible. In this context, to calculate the effectiveness of
existing resource management systems or hypothetical solutions, more quantitative
system tools
including
simulation models and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), are of great use.
Currently, a battery of hydrologic models are available for simulating water and
sediment yields at watershed/basin scales. However, at these scales, the most
commonly used modelling techniques include SWRRB (Arnold et al. 1989, 1991),
ANSWERS (Beasley and Huggins 1981), AGNPS (Young et al. 1986), LISEM (De
Roo et al. 1995), and SWAT (Arnold et al. 1995). For developing a SDSS for
assessing the impact of existing and proposed (optimized) resource-management
plans on regional soil and water conservation,
it is essential that the selected
is not site-speciﬁc; has no subjective bias; has the
(regional) hydrologic model

ability to assess the impact of land use and other resource-management strategies
on water quantity, silt production, and crop growth; has an easy methodology and
is based on readily available input data; and has the ability to link to GIS and has
sufﬁcient documentation and degree of support available. Although the contribu-
tion of GIS in decision support systems (comprising simulation models) is largely as
a method for gathering data and visualizing results yet the two tools can be fully
integrated with an optimization tool to provide a powerful tool for spatial decision
support.

Any spatial decision support system’s capability for supporting spatial decisions
can be analysed in the context of the decision-making process which in general has
three basic phases: Intelligence (Is there a problem or an opportunity for change?),
design (What are the alternatives?) and choice (Which alternative is best?). Each
stage of the decision-making process requires different types of information. Phases
II and III of any decision-making process involve inventing, developing, and
analysing a set of possible solutions (alternative courses of action) to the problem
identiﬁed in the intelligence phase. This is generally achieved through the use of the
optimization tools and mathematical models linked with the common GIS
software. Broadly speaking, the output of any optimization process is a prescription
of a strategy, while that of a simulation model is the evaluation of that strategy.
Linear programming (LP) is a type of optimization technique (Greenberg 1978)
in which both objective function and constraints are linear and additive. Many
variations of the basic linear programming model have been developed, including
integer programming, mixed-integer programming, 0–1-integer programming, goal
programming, and network ﬂow optimization (Ghosh and Rushton 1986). Integer
programming is the most immediate specialization of the linear programming, while
the remaining methods are the modiﬁcations of the integer programming method.
Goal programming is an extension of the linear programming method, which
provides the decision-makers and analysts with the ability to minimize deviations
over more than one objective (Goicoechea et al. 1982, Steuer 1986). These models
are thus essentially multi-objective decision tools. Dynamic programming is another
related optimization tool wherein an optimization problem is broken down into a
sequence of stages, and a smaller optimization sub-problem is solved at each stage.
In this approach, the objective function developed at each stage contributes to the
overall (global) function plus the optimal objective function for the next stage. All
these techniques have proved to be useful tools for many environmental and human
resource planning and management applications (Killen 1983, Dykstra 1984,
Anjomani and Saberi 1992, Campbell et al. 1992, Chuvieco 1993, Djokic and
Maidment 1993, Ralston 1994, Herzfeld and Merriam 1995, Begur et al. 1997,
Camm et al. 1997). However, out of all these techniques, linear programming and
related optimization techniques have proved to be among the most ﬂexible tools for
generating various decision-making scenarios and for analysing the complex
relationships between decision variables and constraints (Arthur and Nalle 1997).
In India, many soil- and water-conservation studies (Singh et al. 1990, Bali
1998) have been initiated at the watershed scale since the early 1970s. However, a
review by Vaidyanathan (1991) revealed that although there is sufﬁcient technology
available, there is some reliance on intuition, engineering experience, rules of
thumb, and site-speciﬁc simple techniques for making management decisions that
implications. The review also

indicated an acute shortage of systematic impact studies, without which no
decision-making is possible, as one of the major shortcomings associated with these
soil- and water-conservation programs in India. The present study was thus an
attempt to develop a SDSS, comprising a watershed-scale hydrologic model and a
linear programming tool not only for estimating sediment yields from a (test)
Nagwan watershed in Damodar–Barakar catchment, under existing resource
management systems, but also for proposing an optimized land-use plan and
assessing the impact of this LP-optimized land-use plan on the test watershed’s total
sediment yield.

2. Test-area characteristics

Encompassing a total area of nearly 9576 ha, the test Nagwan watershed
(No. 7 A in ﬁgure 1) is located at the upper part of the Sewani river between 23‡59’–
24‡05’N and 85‡18’–85‡23’E within the Damodar–Barakar catchment in India, the
second most seriously eroded area in the world (EI-swaify et al. 1982). The test
watershed, just 7 km from the soil conservation department of Damodar Valley
Corporation (D.V.C.) at Hazaribagh (Jharkhand), is well connected by road/rail
network and has a well-documented long-term time-series database on hydrology
and sediment yield from 1959 onwards. Its measuring station is located at 85‡24’E
and 24‡03’N. Geologically the area is quite complex, having rocks of varying
composition. The soils of the area are mainly of the clay loam type. The maximum
and minimum elevations of the area are 637 m and 564 m, respectively. About 86%
of area is under a slope range of 1–6%. The area experiences a sub-humid sub-
tropical monsoon climate, characterized by hot summers (40‡C) and mild winters
(4‡C). The total annual precipitation of 1206 mm is distributed mainly between
June and September, with about 15 rainy days per month. The average storm
intensity, considering storms of more than 30 min duration, is about 10 cm h21. Out
of the total watershed area of 9576 ha, about 55.00% is under agriculture, 17.22% is
under forest, and about 21.77% is wasteland. The test watershed comprises of 42
villages with about 5976 families making up a total population of about 49 508. Of

this total population, about 25 637 are males, 23 870 are females, 4548 are
cultivators, 3715 are agricultural labourers, and 1771 are marginal labourers. Thus,
there are about 10 034 total agricultural labourers in the area. Most of the farmers
in the area are either small (17 009 with 1–2 ha landholding size) or marginal (13 955
with a landholding size less than 1 ha) with an average landholding size of about
0.16 ha. The main agricultural crops grown during Kharif season (June–October)
are paddy and corn, and in the Rabi season (November–April) are wheat, gram,
and mustard. Paddy–mustard, paddy–wheat, and corn–mustard are the main crop
rotations but the majority of the watershed is mostly single-cropped with paddy as
the major crop and corn as the second most common crop. Agriculture is mostly
rainfed, as only 20% of irrigation available in the area is from sources other than
rain, and the cropping intensity is also quite low at 98%. The irrigation is mainly
from wells. The prevalence of conventional cultivation practices, characterized by
conventional tillage or no tillage,
low fertilizer/manure consumption and local
varieties of the crops, is mainly responsible for the low crop productivity in the
area. The area was fully treated about 30 years ago, with about 50% of the area
requiring re-treatment. This information on the test area was obtained from
secondary sources like the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Directorate of Census (data Center), DVC, Hazaribagh ofﬁcials and
the Hazaribagh district, and through primary
the Sadar block ofﬁce of
Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) exercises conducted in the test area. Analysis
of the above data revealed subsistence-level agriculture, rainfed farming, dominance
of marginal and small farmers, fragmented landholdings, low productivity, lacunae
in the resource-management practices, and obsolete technical know-how on
improved crop production as the dominant socio-economic characteristics of the
test watershed.

3. Proposed SDSS
3.1. Structure

The proposed SDSS comprises a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The
SWAT is a river basin- or watershed-scale hydrologic model developed by the
USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS). It operates on a daily time step and is
developed to predict the impact of land-management practices on water, sediment,
and agricultural chemical yields in large complex watersheds with varying soils,
land use, and management conditions over long periods of time. It is in fact a
combination of the SWRRB, GLEAMS, and ROTO models, and hence is able to
model both the hydrology and water quality of a watershed. The model can operate
on both raster and sub-watershed (hydrologic response unit) basis. In addition, the
model is linked to GIS packages like GRASS via the SWAT–GRASS interface
(Srinivasan and Arnold 1994) and ARC-View through the SWAT–ARC View
interface (Di Luzio et al. 1997), thus facilitating data-input and -output display.
The current SWAT–Arc-View interface (AVSWAT) is a tight coupling between the
model and the GIS. The export of data from the GIS to the SWAT model and the
return of results for display are accomplished by Avenue routines that are
addressed directly by the interactive tools of the GIS, and the exchange of data is
fully automatic. The SWAT Arc-View system consists of three key components:
input parameters;

(2) editing input data set and executing simulations; (3) viewing graphical and
tabular results. Figure 2 illustrates the proposed SWAT–Arc View based SDSS.

3.2. Generation of input maps and data ﬁles
3.2.1. Map themes

The SDSS basically requires four map themes, viz. Digital Elevation Model
(DEM), Land use/Land cover, Soil and Groundwater in Arc Info–Arc View Grid
format.

3.2.1.1. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) grid

A DEM is the surface interpolation from contour data points of an area.
Figure 2 illustrates the DEM generated (Kaur and Dutta 2002) from a basic 10 MT
for the test Nagwan sub-watershed in
interval contour data (1:25 000 scale)
Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand.

3.2.1.2. Land-use grid

The land-use/land cover map (ﬁgure 2) of Nagwan was obtained from the soil
conservation department of D.V.C., Hazaribagh, Jharkhand in analogue form and
was converted into digital form.

3.2.1.3. Soil grid

The soil map of the Nagwan watershed (ﬁgure 2) was also obtained from the soil
conservation department of D.V.C., Hazaribagh, Jharkhand in analogue form. The
map comprised 10 different themes, viz. Soil series, Surface texture, Slope, Depth,

79

Stoniness, Rockiness, Gravelliness and Land Capability and Erosion classes. This
map was also converted into digital form for further processing.

3.2.1.4. Groundwater grid

From a grid ﬁle of actually observed groundwater parameters, the interface
extracts the relevant groundwater inputs needed for SWAT to run. In the present
study, owing to a lack of groundwater data, this ﬁle could not be developed and the
default values for the groundwater parameters stored in the SWAT model were
used.

3.2.2. Arc view tables

The SDSS requires the following data ﬁles/tables also:

3.2.2.1. Soil-class table

This is a table that connects the category code of the soil map with the
corresponding soil ﬁles generated for each soil type existing in the test watershed.
This table comprised six soil category codes: (1) LMSND (Loamy Sand), (2)
SLOAM (Sandy Loam), (3) LOAMY (Loam), (4) SILM (Silty Loam), (5) CLYLM
(Clay Loam), and (6) SICLM (Silty Clay Loam).

3.2.2.2. Land-use class table

This is a table which connects the category code of the land-use/land cover map
with the corresponding SWAT land-use/land cover classes. This table comprised
ﬁve land-use category codes: (1) (Upland) RICE, (2) (Upland) CORN, (3) (Long
Duration Kharif) RICE, (4) (Forest with good canopy) FRST, and (5) (Gullied
land with poor canopy forest) FRST.

3.2.2.3. Tables to import rain gauge, temperature gauge, and weather-generator
gauge locations

For the present study, the nearest meteorological station to Nagwan watershed
was India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Hazaribagh station. Since both
rainfall and temperature were measured from the same station,
the same
longitude and latitude (i.e. 85‡24’E and 24‡03’N, respectively) were used for all
three ﬁles.

3.2.2.4. Tables to store daily precipitation and temperature data

These comprised of 11 years daily precipitation and temperature data, from

1981 to 1992, corresponding to the test watershed-gauging station.

3.2.2.5. Soil ﬁles

Since six soil category codes were distributed over Nagwan watershed, six
independent ﬁles were prepared for each soil type. Table 1 gives a detailed account
in the
of the soil
proposed SDSS, for each of the soil types found in the test watershed. To make
these ﬁles, information on sand, silt, clay, organic carbon percentages, and soil
hydrologic group were obtained from the soil conservation department of DVC,

Hazaribagh. Other soil parameters such as bulk density, available water capacity,
saturated hydraulic conductivity, moist soil Albedo, and soil-erodibility factor
required for SWAT implementation were estimated from the (available) basic
soil properties such as sand, silt, clay and organic carbon, and soil hydrologic group
information using stand-alone software developed by the Grassland soil and
water research laboratory of USDA/ARS. Soil erodibility factors, for each soil
layer and soil type, were estimated using the following equation (Wischmeier et al.

3.2.2.6. Crop ﬁle

The Crop ﬁle contains the crop-input parameters for SWAT. This ﬁle resides in
the program ﬁle directory of the SWAT–ARC View interface (AVSWATPR) and is
copied when a project is created through the interface. In the present study, the
original crop ﬁle was altered for paddy and corn by replacing the values for the
index,
maximum total biomass, maximum harvest
maximum potential leaf area index, maximum crop height, and maximum rooting
depth parameters with their actual values for the Hazaribagh district, obtained
from Damodar Valley Corporation (table 2).

3.2.2.8. Weather-generator ﬁle

The weather variables necessary for driving SWAT are precipitation, air
temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity. If daily precipita-
tion and maximum and minimum air-temperature data are available, they can be
inputted directly to SWAT. If not, the weather component of the model can
simulate daily rainfall and temperature. Solar radiation, wind speed, and relative
humidity are always simulated. The input parameters required for simulating these
weather variables were obtained, from an 11-year daily weather data, by means of a
WXPARM program developed at Blackland research center.

3.3. Implementation on the test watershed

The delineation of the test Nagwan watershed and the development of the
watershed and sub-watershed database were the ﬁrst set of fundamental steps
performed by the proposed SDSS. The test Nagwan watershed and its sub-
watershed boundaries were delineated from the DEM of the test area (Kaur and
Dutta 2002) by setting a threshold value of 300 ha or 834 cells for starting the
stream delineation. This led to the delineation of 15 sub-watersheds within the test
watershed (ﬁgure 2). This was followed by determination of all the geometric
parameters of sub-basins and stream reach by means of the raster-grid functions of
the GIS. These were stored as attributes of derived vector themes. Next, the land-
use and soil grids and the related data ﬁles were loaded and clipped in the
watershed area followed by their re-classiﬁcation and re-sampling at the DEM cell
size. In order to capture the heterogeneity in soil and land-use of the test watershed,
each sub-watershed within it was further divided into one or more Hydrologic
Response Units (HRU), representing a unique combination of the land use and soil
types. For example, sub-watershed 1 had 3 HRUs with upland paddy on silty loam
soil, upland paddy on loamy sand soil, and long-duration paddy on clay loam soil,
while sub-watershed 3 had just 1 HRU with upland paddy on silty loam soil, and
sub-watershed 11 had 4 HRUs with corn on sandy loam soil, poor canopy forest on
wasteland, upland paddy on loamy soil, and upland paddy on silty loam soil. This
resulted in a total of 44 HRUs for the whole test watershed. Precipitation,

temperature, and weather-generator data were deﬁned by loading the station
location and data ﬁles. All
the SDSS-required input ﬁles were generated
sequentially through the interface, and the SDSS was run for the calibration and
the validation periods, after setting the initial soil moisture storage and base-ﬂow
factor values at 1 and using the Pristley–Taylor method for evapotranspiration
estimations.

3.4. Calibration and validation

The two hydrologic years, 1984 and 1992, associated with the highest and the
lowest water and sediment yields, respectively, were selected from an 11-year period
(ranging from 1981 to 1992) for the proposed SDSS calibration. The input variables
used for calibration were soil properties and curve number. The curve numbers
(USDA Soil Conservation Service 1972) were allowed to vary within the categories
for good and fair hydrologic conditions, and the available water capacity was set
within the range of its natural uncertainty for the study region. The remaining input
data for the 9-year period (comprising the years 1981–1983, 1985–1989, and 1991)
was used for the proposed SDSS validation. Square of Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient (R2), Mean Relative Error (MRE), Root Mean Square Prediction
Difference (RMSPD; Green and Stephenson 1986) and model efﬁciency coefﬁcient
(Nash and Sutcliffe 1970) statistical measures were used to assess the annual
sediment yield predicting potential of the proposed SDSS, at the test watershed
outlet, for the calibration and the validation data sets (tables 4 and 5).

It is not economically feasible to collect silt data from all parts of the watershed.
Hence, under Indian conditions, water and sediment yields contributed by a
watershed are generally monitored only at its outlet. As for even this watershed
there were no actual sediment yield (validation) data available for each HRU or a
sub-watershed contained within it (besides the sediment yield data available at its
outlet), therefore for the present study a moderately good validation of the

proposed SDSS at the test watershed outlet was considered to be a reasonable
criterion for judging the proposed SDSS’s potential to realistically mimic the
individual HRU and sub-watershed scaled-sediment yields.

4. Formulation of an LP model for the optimized land-use plan

A Linear Programming (LP) technique, which has been used since the late 1950s
in a wide variety of planning situations (Dantzig 1963), was used to design a model
to propose an optimum land-use plan for the test watershed.

4.1. Deﬁning decision variables

Any LP analysis starts by deﬁning ‘decision variables’, which are the different
alternatives stated by the problem; for example, in a land-use planning situation,
the decision variables may be the different land-use types (LUTs) to be allocated.
Strictly speaking, LP is not a spatial technique, because it does not take into
account the spatial distribution of the decision variables. However,
it can be
tailored to deal with spatial problems, if previous regionalization is performed by
means of any GIS tool in a SDSS. In the present investigation, in order to capture
the soil,
land-use, topography, and climate heterogeneity (the four important
variables controlling soil and water loss) in a watershed, the delineated test
watershed was divided into 15 sub-watersheds and 44 HRUs using the Arc-View
GIS and the Arc-View Spatial Analyst packages. In the proposed LP algorithm,
these individual HRUs were treated as decision variables, representing speciﬁc land-
use types under a speciﬁc soil type in a particular sub-watershed in the test
watershed. By doing so, it was possible not only to take into account the spatially
distributed character of constraints, to obtain more practical and realistic plans for
reduced total soil and water losses from the test watershed, but also to spatially
distribute the LP-optimized resource plan (i.e. different land-use types) for better
planning and decision-making.

4.2. Establishing objectives

This is in fact the most important step of any LP analysis, as it is the deﬁnition
of the objectives that guides the decisions to be taken for solving the problem.
Often, these objectives are mutually contradictory, so they can be conceived as
either objectives or constraints. In the present exercise, the main objective of
planning new land uses was to reduce the total soil loss from the test watershed.
Thus, the objective here, in a way, was to maximize the most soil loss reducing
land-use type(s). This objective function (Z); i.e. minimization of total soil loss (in
tonnes) from the test watershed was hence expressed as:

m

Z~ X
j~1

cjxj

the xj values are the decision variables, each representing the total
where:
(optimized) area (ha) under a given LUT in a jth (with j~1, 2, † m; m~44) HRU
within the test watershed, and the cj values refer to the (known) soil loss rates
(t ha21) from each of these HRUs under a given LUT (and soil and topography).
These cj values can be either the actual plot-experiment-based soil-loss values under
each LUT or the values simulated through a well-tested and validated hydrologic
model. Under real-world conditions, it is not practical to obtain actual soil-loss
values, under varying soil, climate, and topographic conditions, for each LUT
through ﬁeld/plot experiments. Hence, in the present investigation, these cj values
represented the proposed SDSS-estimated, 9-year (validation period) averaged
(Kharif season), soil-loss values for each HRU, within the test watershed, under
existing resource-management conditions.

4.3. Identifying key constraints

The above objectives are constrained by economic, resource, and environmental
limitations as well as by a set of secondary objectives. For this exercise, three sets of
constraints were considered. These constraints were ecological (soil
loss con-
straints), technical (paddy-yield, corn-yield, labour, afﬁnity for forest and total area
constraints), and ﬁnancial (beneﬁt from paddy cultivation, beneﬁt from corn
cultivation). Since the proposed land-use (LU) planning model was designed only
for the Kharif season (i.e. the season with maximum soil and water loss from the
test region), the major LUTs considered in the proposed LU-optimization problem
for the test area were forests, paddy, and corn. These constraints, for the proposed
land-use planning LP model, were mathematically expressed as detailed in the
following subsections.

4.3.1. Sub-watershed area constraints

In general, soil

losses are minimal from areas under forest covers. Hence,
designing a single area constraint for the whole test watershed, with 44 decision
variables, each representing an HRU with either (long-duration Kharif or upland)
paddy upland corn or (open or closed) forest would have led to a vast allocation of
forested area in the test watershed, thereby leading to a infeasible land-use plan for
the area. To take care of this problem, each sub-watershed was considered to be a
compact and self-sufﬁcient unit as far as the selection of LUTs was concerned. By
doing so, land-use allocations within a watershed were restricted to only the LUTs
found within each sub-watershed. This was expressed in the form of the following

sub-watershed.

4.3.2. Sub-watershed soil-loss constraints

Soil loss rate (sj) is a function of land topography, physiography, climate, and
index
it was considered to be an important
hydrology. Hence,
constraining suitability of a land under a particular land-use type. The total soil loss
from a test watershed is a function of soil loss from each HRU in a sub-watershed.
Thus, to minimize the total soil loss from the test watershed, following 15 sub-
watershed soil loss constraints were designed so as to constrain the total soil loss
per HRU (or a decision variable or a LUT), within a particular sub-watershed, to
either less than or equal to the total (current) soil loss from that sub-watershed.
These 15 soil-loss constraints were expressed as:

LUT in a jth HRU (ha) in the kth sub-watershed; and sj~the current soil loss rate

yield values under each soil type and climatic and management conditions or the
values simulated through a well-tested and validated crop model. In real-world
conditions, it is not practical to obtain actual paddy-yield values, under varying
soil, climate, and topographic conditions through actual ﬁeld/plot experiments.
Hence, in the present exercise, these ypj values represented the proposed SDSS-
estimated, 9-year (validation period) averaged (Kharif season), paddy-yield values
for each HRU in the test watershed under the existing resource-management
practices. These (simulated) paddy-yield values estimated through the proposed
SDSS for each HRU within the test area were observed to be ranging between 0.74
and 0.94, with an average of about 0.901 t ha21 for the whole test area. Thus, in the
above expression, TPp~total (current) paddy productivity (in tonnes) in the test
watershed was equated to 0.901 t ha2165898 ha (i.e. total current area under paddy

from 0.189 to 1.904, with an average of about 0.907 t ha21 for the whole test area.
Thus, in the above expression, TPc~total (current) corn productivity (in tonnes) in

Implementation of the LP model
After obtaining the necessary coefﬁcients as detailed in the previous section, the
objective function and the constraints for the proposed LP model were designed
and implemented on a standard MS-DOS personal computer and public-domain
software, QSB (Quantitative Systems for Business V 2.0; Chang and Sullivan 1986).
The input matrix for the proposed land-use LP model was solved in 32 iterations.

6. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed LP model

Sensitivity analysis is one of the most interesting contributions of LP to land-use
planning as it helps in testing the inﬂuence of any change in the problem’s
assumptions on the optimal solution. In the proposed LP model, the coefﬁ-
cients of the decision variables in both the objective function and the soil loss and
the yield constraints for paddy and corn, obtained through a watershed-scale
in the present
hydrologic model, contained some estimation errors. Hence,
investigation, a sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of
these estimation
errors associated with the coefﬁcients of the decision variables, in the soil loss and
yield constraints and the objective function, on the solution matrix was also
attempted.

7.

Incorporation of the optimized land-use plan in SDSS
It is important to notice here that presently there is no means to change the
LUTs of the HRUs within the SWAT–Arc View interface. In fact, these HRUs are
virtual units, which cannot be geo-referenced within a test watershed outside the
SWAT–Arc View environment. Hence, to quantify and assess the impact of these
LP model proposed alternate (optimized) resource-conservation plans on total
watershed soil loss through the proposed SDSS, it was felt essential ﬁrst to map
these LP results. Mapping of LP results could not only give a visual depiction of the
spatial distribution of various LUTs but also enable easy incorporation of the
optimized land-use plan in the proposed SDSS.

The auxiliary themes (or variables) like sub-watershed boundary,

land use,
soil type, and slope-based-site suitability criteria were used to provide a spatial
allocation for a suggested LUT in a sub-watershed. First, a particular HRU
within a sub-watershed was located by means of the sub-watershed boundary, soil
type, and land-use themes by means of the query tool of Arc-View GIS. Next,

the number of those cells (within the selected HRU), with a particular slope
range, which equalled the area allocated to a particular HRU (or a decision
variable) suggested by an LP model was identiﬁed and allocated to the LP-
proposed LUT by means of the map analysis tool within the GIS. The slope
ranges within which a particular land-use type can be best located in a watershed
were ascertained through standard agricultural practices. In the present study,
paddy and corn crops were generally assigned to areas with slopes less than 1%,
while forest covers were assigned to areas with slopes higher than 1%. Figures 3(a)
and 3(b) illustrate the existing and the proposed land-use plans for the test
watershed.

8.

Implementation of the proposed SDSS with optimized land-use plan
In the proposed SDSS, the old land-use plan was then replaced by the new
spatially distributed LP-optimized land-use plan. This was followed by the
sequential generation of the other input ﬁles required by the proposed SDSS
and its operation over the same 9-year validation period (i.e. the years 1981–1983,
1985–1989, and 1991), with the initial soil moisture storage and base-ﬂow factor
values set at 1 and the evapotranspiration method set as for the Pristley–Taylor
method.

years (1984 and 1992) at the test watershed outlet. It can be seen from these
results that the calibrated available soil water capacity and curve number values
in the proposed SDSS yielded a moderately good correlation coefﬁcient and
model efﬁciency coefﬁcient values of 0.54 and 20.67, respectively for the observed
vs. predicted total sediment yields for the calibration years. The observed data
for the validation period indicated an annual average total sediment yield
(table 5) of 25.35 t ha21 from the Nagwan watershed during the Kharif seasons.
In comparison with this, the proposed SDSS predicted an annual average total
sediment yield of 21.28 t ha21, with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.65, model
efﬁciency of 0.70, relative error of 217.97%, and root mean square prediction
error of 9.63 t ha21 for the same validation period. The above results clearly
showed that, even under Indian conditions, with data sets of poor spatial
resolutions, the proposed SDSS could simulate the annual dynamics of the total
sediment yield at the test-watershed outlet reasonably well and quite close to those
reported for model runs for regions in the US and Germany (King and Arnold
1998, Srinivasan et al. 1998). Hence, it was assumed that the proposed SDSS was
capable of mimicking even HRU and sub-watershed-scaled sediment yields
realistically.

9.2. LP model proposed sediment yields under the optimized land-use plan

The results of the land-use planning LP model are summarized in table 8. It is
important to note here that the constraints limit the optimal solution, but not all of
them actually bind it. The amount of any resource that is not used in the optimal
solution is called a ‘slack’. However, when the slack of any constraint is zero,
there is an actual restriction on the optimal solution. The importance of this
limitation was expressed by the column called ‘reduced cost’, which in fact refers
to the rate of increase in the optimal solution that would be expected if that
particular constraint were augmented by one unit. Sometimes, the limit is a ‘less
than or equal to’ type, which implies negative reduced costs (table 8). It is
also important
to mention here that although the total areas under paddy
(61.60%), corn (7.58%), and forest (29.76%) LUTs in the LP-proposed land-use
plan were the same as those under the existing land-use plan, that plan suggested a
re-distribution of these LUTs (ﬁgure 3) within the test watershed in the following
manner:

. replacement of all long-duration Kharif paddy areas, which are more erosive

than the upland paddy areas (Singh et al. 1981), with upland paddy;

. replacement of all upland paddy in sub-watershed 7; all forest in sub-
watershed 12 and all upland paddy and forest in sub-watershed 13 with corn
LUT;

. replacement of all forest in sub-watershed 10 with upland paddy;
. replacement of all corn and upland paddy in sub-watersheds 11 and 15 with

forest and

. reduction in 40.73% area under the upland paddy in sub-weatershed 14 to just
18.87% area under the upland paddy and the replacement of the remaining

land-use plan (18.11 t ha21) with those under existing land use (21.28 t ha21), it can
be seen that the LP-optimized land-use plan could lower the total sediment yield
from the test watershed by about 14.89%.

validation period under the LP-model proposed land-use plan.

9.3. SDSS proposed sediment yields under the LP model proposed optimized land-use
plan

Incorporation of the LP model proposed land-use plan in the proposed SDSS
resulted in an average annual total (Kharif season) sediment yield of 18.17 t ha21, as
compared with the 21.28 t ha21 under the existing land-use plan, for the 9-year
validation period (ﬁgure 4). It could be clearly seen that even the proposed SDSS
predicted an annual average reduction of 14.61% in the total watershed sediment
yield under the LP-optimized land-use plan. This decrease could also be seen at the
sub-basin level from the annual average spatial distribution map of the test
watershed (ﬁgure 5). Besides this, the proposed land-use plan resulted in an increase
in the paddy (0.926 t ha21) and the corn (1.523 t ha21) crop yields in the test
watershed by 2.80 and 68.14% over the present paddy (0.901 t ha21) and corn
(0.907 t ha21) crop yields, respectively. Thus, with the same percentage area under
existing LUTs, a re-distribution of the existing LUTs at their desired optimal
locations could not only lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in the total sediment yield
from the test watershed but also lead to a signiﬁcant increase in the corn crop yields
in the test watershed. It is worth noting that even at the present yield levels, the net
returns from corn crop cultivation (~Rs 3639.34 ha21) are signiﬁcantly higher than
those from paddy crop cultivation (~Rs 1010.28 ha21). Thus, an increase in the
corn yield, under the new land-use plan, was associated with an additional
economic beneﬁt of Rs 2500 ha21, from an additional grain yield (of 0.618 t ha21),
and of Rs 1235 ha21, from an additional straw yield (of 2.47 t ha21), thereby leading
to a total economic beneﬁt of Rs 3735 ha21 from corn crop cultivation at its
optimal locations in the test watershed.

sediment yields from the Nagwan watershed with the proposed land-use plan.

9.4. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed LP model

The validation of the hydrologic model component of the proposed SDSS for
sediment yield estimations revealed that it was associated with a mean relative error
of 217.97%. Based on these ﬁndings, it was further assumed that the hydrologic
model of the proposed SDSS was thus capable of mimicking even HRU and sub-
watershed-scaled sediment yields with the same mean relative errors. Hence, to
investigate the effect of this soil loss estimation error on the optimal land-use plan
for the test watershed, the load coefﬁcients in the objective function and/or the 15
sub-watershed soil loss constraints were varied between ¡10% and ¡20%. This
was done to take care of both under- and overestimation of sediment yields from
each HRU. Further, as the total soil loss from each sub-watershed is the sum of soil
losses from all the HRUs contained in that sub-watershed, the right-hand sides of
loss constraints were also simultaneously varied
these 15 sub-watershed soil
between ¡10% and ¡20%, respectively,
these under- and
overestimations of sediment yields from each sub-watershed. Further, implementa-
tion of the LP proposed optimized land-use plan in the proposed SDSS clearly
demonstrated that the new optimized land-use plan was associated with not only a
reduction in the soil loss by about 14.61% but also an increase in both paddy and
corn yields by 2.80 and 68.14%, respectively. Hence, any positive or negative change
in the load coefﬁcients in the soil loss constraints should ideally be associated with a
simultaneous negative or positive change, respectively, in the load coefﬁcients for
paddy and corn yield constraints. In order to account for these changes in the load
coefﬁcients for paddy and corn yield constraints, with each (¡10% or ¡20%)
change in the load coefﬁcients for soil loss constraints, it was assumed (from the
above observation) that every 1% reduction or increase in soil loss was associated
with about 0.19 and 4.66% increase or decrease, respectively, in the paddy and corn
yields from the test watershed. As in the soil loss constraints, the right-hand sides of
the paddy and corn yield constraints were also proportionately increased or

decreased with each percentage decrease or increase in the soil loss in the proposed
LP model during the sensitivity analysis. In fact, to analyse the effect of these
changes in the load coefﬁcients, associated with the soil loss and yield constraints in
the proposed LP model, modiﬁcations in the objective function and constraints
were attempted in the following two ways:

1. (Method I) Keeping the load coefﬁcients in the objective function the same as
those in the proposed LP model but changing the load coefﬁcients and right-
loss constraints by ¡10% and ¡20% with a
hand sides of
proportionate change in both the load coefﬁcients and the right-hand sides of
the paddy- and corn-yield constraints in the proposed LP model.

the soil

2. (Method II) Changing the load coefﬁcients in the objective function as well
as the load coefﬁcients and right-hand sides of the soil loss constraints by
¡10% and ¡20% with a proportionate change in both the load coefﬁcients
and the right-hand sides of the paddy- and corn-yield constraints in the
proposed LP model.

The results of these sensitivity analyses are presented in table 9. Sensitivity
analysis, as per Method I, led to a land-use plan the same as that proposed by the
unmodiﬁed LP model (table 8). It could further be observed from table 9 that even
the minimized soil loss (or objective function) values for the sensitivity analysis as
per Method I were almost the same (i.e. 18.1 t ha21) as that for the proposed LP
model (table 8). This shows that with the problem (or objective) remaining the
same, a ¡10% or ¡20% error/change in the load coefﬁcients for the soil loss and
paddy- and corn-yield constraints has almost no effect on the proposed optimized
land-use plan and minimized soil-loss values for the test watershed. In contrast to
this, as expected, the sensitivity analysis as per Method II (table 9) with 210% and
220% change in the load coefﬁcients for the soil loss and paddy and corn yield
constraints and the objective function projecting a lower minimum soil loss (or
objective function) values than the proposed LP model, and vice versa. However,
even in this case, the optimized land-use plan was the same as that proposed by the
unmodiﬁed LP model (table 8). In fact, the sensitivity analysis as per Method II led
to the generation of four different objective functions (or LP problems). A
comparison of the minimized soil loss values (table 9) obtained from these four
different objective functions (or LP problems) with ¡10% and ¡20% of total soil
loss value (of 21.28 t ha21) simulated by the proposed SDSS, under the existing

land-use plan for the test watershed, respectively, further revealed that the soil loss
reductions proposed by even these four LP models were the same (i.e. 14.9%) as
that proposed by the unmodiﬁed LP model (table 8). The above sensitivity analysis
could thus clearly show that the proposed optimized land-use plan for the test area
was robust within the range of the uncertainty associated with the load coefﬁcients,
obtained from a catchment model, in the proposed LP model.

10. Conclusions

The present investigation could thus quite realistically demonstrate the potential
of the proposed SDSS for assessing the impact of on going resource management
practices on the sediment yields from the test-Nagwan watershed. Besides this, it
also demonstrated the immense application potential of such spatial decision
support systems in designing an LP-optimized regional soil conserving-land-use
plan and assessing its impact on the total sediment yield from the test watershed.

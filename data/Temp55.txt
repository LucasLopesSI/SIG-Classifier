ABSTRACT
The article describes the evolution of the cartography and toponymy of the second largest
geyser ﬁeld in the world – the Valley of Geysers in the Kronotsky Reserve (Kamchatka
Peninsula, Russia), discovered in 1941. The toponymy evolved in close connection with the
development of the cartographic base that passed through the three stages from the ﬁrst
manual drawings to large-scale maps and to 3D models of the territory. The number of
geysers with personal names increased gradually from twelve to more than one hundred.
The article presents examples of diagrams and maps as well as tables of thermal features
with coordinates. All main sources of literature were analysed for the period of 1941–2017,
and the article presents a comprehensive historiography on the investigated topic. The
evolution of instruments for the measurement of geyser activity is also brieﬂy overviewed
with examples of data obtained using the diﬀerent methods.

Introduction

The Valley of Geysers is the second largest geyser ﬁeld in the world after Yellowstone National Park, United
States (Bryan, 2008: 422). The ﬁeld is located in the remote and hard to access central part of
the
Kamchatka Peninsula near its eastern coast. Although two minor geysers in the south of Kamchatka
Peninsula were described as early as the eighteenth century (Krasheninnikov, 1755), the Valley of Geysers
was completely unknown to people before 1941.

The geysers of the Valley of Geysers were described systematically in several publications (Ustinova, 1946b;
1949; 1955; Naboko, 1954; Raik, 1963; Vinogradov, 1964; Semenov, 1973; Sugrobova, 1982; Bryan et al., 1991;
Nechayev, 2000; 2007; Sugrobov et al., 2004; 2009; Leonov, 2012a; 2012b; 2017). Although the later descriptions
generally considered the previous ones, the evolution of toponymy was in no way a linear process. Old names went
out of use and new names arose; some thermal features disappeared and others emerged, especially after two
catastrophic landslides in 2007 and 2014 (Leonov and Leonov, 2014).

The history of cartography and toponymy of the Valley of Geysers can be divided into three main stages. In the
ﬁrst stage, the location and names of geysers and other geothermal features were documented using manual maps

(1941–1975). In 1975, the large-scale topographic map of the region was published, which became the basis for the
second stage of mapping and naming of geysers that lasted for more than 30 years. A catastrophic landslide in 2007
led to the emergence of new geysers and hot springs and accordingly a new stage of evolution of the toponymy. This
event also inspired a new wave of investigations of the Valley. The third stage began in 2009 when the ﬁrst high-
resolution multispectral satellite image of the territory was produced and accurately georeferenced in the WGS84
coordinate system, and the data of remote sensing started to be used actively to prepare geo-referenced maps and
3D models of the territory.

Generally, these three periods coincide with the stages of the development of tools for the measurement of geyser
activity including manual measurements (1941–1971), automatic measurements using water level gauges (1972–
late 1990s), sensors based on contact closure (1988–2006), autonomous temperature loggers (since 2007) and
long-term automatic videotaping (since 2014).

History of the discovery

The discovery of large geysers in Kamchatka in 1941 was one of the signiﬁcant geographical events of the twentieth
century. Seven of the discovered geysers had a fountain size larger than ten metres.1 The total number of geysers
was estimated as more than one hundred: ‘В долине речки Гейзерной находится не менее 22 крупных и около
сотни мелких гейзеров’ (There are no less than 22 large and approximately one hundred small geysers in the
the Geyzernaya River) (Vlodavets, 1949: 96). This estimation was conﬁrmed later by several
Valley of
researchers including the expedition of the American Geyser Observation and Study Association (GOSA) in
‘ … we actually watched no fewer than 116 geysers actually in eruption … Certainly there are many
1991:
geysers that we never saw … ’ (Bryan et al., 1991: 10).

Geysers are primarily grouped in the lower basin of a small river, which originates on the west slopes of the
Kikhpinych volcano. The river was unnamed before 1941 and then named the Geyzernaya (geyser) River. This river
is a tributary of the Shumnaya (noisy) River that ﬂows from neighbouring Uzon Caldera to the south-east and ends
in the Paciﬁc Ocean. There are also two known geysers in the Uzon Caldera (one is extinct and one is active)
(Figure 1).

The territory in the central part of the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula belongs to the Kronotsky State
Natural Biosphere Reserve established in 1934. The discovery of geysers was a result of an expedition organized by
the authorities of the reserve to investigate the upper reaches of the Shumnaya River and clarify the location of its
origin. Although the origin was shown on existing small-scale maps, employees of the reserve and local hunters
doubted the correctness of the maps in this area.

Two employees of the Kronotsky Reserve – geologist Tatiana Ustinova (1913–2009) and observer Anisifor
Krupenin (1914–1990) – followed the Shumnaya River upstream, travelling by dog sled. On 14th April 1941,
they reached an unnamed tributary and stopped for a dinner. A large geyser suddenly erupted on the opposite
river bank. This geyser was later named Pervenets (ﬁrstborn). The ﬁrst report about the discovery of a geyser
on Kamchatka was published by Ustinova and Krupenin on 15th June 1941 in a local newspaper
«Kamchatskaya Pravda» (Zhilin, 2014: 34).

springs are located.

In July 1941, the second expedition was organized with the same participants. The basin of the unnamed river was
explored and the main group of geysers was discovered. The war with Nazi Germany (1941–1945) hindered further
investigations, and in 1945 the third expedition was organized. Ustinova and Krupenin were joined by Yuri Averin
(the husband of the Ustinova and the director of the Kronotsky Reserve). The ﬁrst photographs of the Valley of
Geysers were taken in 1945 during this expedition, mainly by Averin.

Ustinova wrote the ﬁrst description, mapped the main geysers, and provided them with names. In 1946, she
published two scientiﬁc articles (Ustinova, 1946a; 1946b). The ﬁrst article describes only the ﬁrst discovered
geyser (without a name), whereas the second one contains descriptions of the twelve geysers with names and
several of the unnamed geysers. One more article was published by Ustinova in 1949 with the description of
the same twelve geysers, the ﬁrst map of the location of the geysers and the results of a chemical analysis of
the water (Ustinova, 1949). In 1951, Ustinova took part in one more expedition to the Valley and in 1955
ﬁnally published 20,000 copies of her famous book (Ustinova, 1955). The book contained a detailed
description of the discovered thermal ﬁeld, including 25 main geysers and two main boiling springs.

Furthermore, Ustinova never called the discovered place, ‘the Valley of Geysers,’ at least in her publications. The
name ‘Valley of Geysers’ ﬁrst appeared in print in 1952 in the Large Soviet Encyclopaedia (Ovchinnikov, 1952), but
its author is unknown.

1941–1975: A time of manual schemes

Before the expeditions of Ustinova and Krupenin in 1941, only a small-scale map of the investigated territory existed,
which was based on interview data (Ustinova, 1955: 5). The upper course and origin of the Shumnaya River were
mapped incorrectly on this map. The small-scale map was corrected in 1943 based on the results of the 1941
expeditions (Zhilin, 2014: 51) but no large-scale topographic map of the investigated area was published until 1975.
During 1941–1975, the mapping of the geysers and other objects was based on manual drawings based primarily
on ﬁeld surveys of the territory. Some researchers probably used small-scale military maps (1:100,000 and smaller)
and black-and-white military aerial photographs but their scale was not adequate for mapping individual thermal
features and could only be used for general orientation. For example, the area with greatest concentration of
geysers occupies only approximately 2 square cm at a scale of 1:100,000.

In the absence of published large-scale maps, researchers needed to prepare their own manual large-scale maps of
the territory. These manual maps contained only simple hydrography and approximate contour lines (Figures 2–6).
The ﬁrst set of maps was prepared and published by Ustinova, including a general map of the locations of the
geysers in the lower basin of the Geyzernaya River (Figure 2), and large-scale maps of the most interesting
thermal areas (an example is shown in Figure 3). She named 22 geysers and two large boiling springs. Twenty-
ﬁve geysers are shown in her map including the 22 geysers with individual names and 3 geysers with descriptive
titles (Figure 2) (Ustinova, 1955). Sofya Naboko described two more geysers with individual names. No map is
given in her article (Naboko, 1954).

Ants Raik described ﬁve new geysers with individual names. At the same time, several geysers from Ustinova’s
book were not included in Raik’s systematic description. Twenty-three geysers are described in detail in Raik’s
publication and 22 of them are shown on a map (Raik, 1963). Vladimir Vinogradov described two new geysers
and four boiling springs with individual names. Thirty thermal features are shown on his map: nineteen geysers
and eleven springs (Figure 4) (Vinogradov, 1964). In 1964, an oﬃcial tourist route («All-Union tourist route №
264») to the Valley of Geysers was established. Large groups of tourists from all regions of the Soviet Union
also started informally contributing to the naming of minor thermal features.

Vladimir Semenov, a famous popularizer of the tourism in Kamchatka (and in the Valley of Geysers in
particular), devoted a quarter of his book to the description of the Valley of Geysers and its thermal features

(Semenov, 1973). Forty geysers and springs with individual names are shown on two maps in his book (Figure 5).
Some of these were possibly named by Semenov or unknown tourists. He also likely prepared a simple map of the
Valley of Geysers for two popular tourist booklets (Semenov, 1974; 1975); this map contains 28 geysers and springs
with individual names (Figure 6). In 1976, the Valley was oﬃcially closed to visitors because of the resource damage
caused by tourists. Nevertheless, many tourists continued to visit the Valley unoﬃcially.

Thus, the ﬁrst stage of mapping and naming of the thermal features continued for approximately 30 years
and was based on manual maps of the territory. The initial toponymy established by Ustinova was later
expanded by other researchers and tourists. The number of thermal
features with individual names in
systematic descriptions grew successively from 12 (1946) to 25 (1955), 30 (1964) and 40 (1973). Considering
all the names (including the descriptive ones) from all publications during 1941–1975, the total number of
named geysers and boiling springs reached 48 by 1975, see Table 1.

1975–2009: A time of large-scale maps

In the early 1970s, the research activity in the Valley changed. In 1971, systematic geological and geothermic
investigations in the basin of the Geyzernaya River and neighbour areas were started by scientists2 of the
Institute of Volcanology of the Far Eastern Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (hereinafter
‘Institute of Volcanology’) led by Viktor Sugrobov. These methodical studies stopped in 1994 after the
disintegration of the USSR and a crucial decrease in ﬁnancing. The construction of a wooden house was started
by scientists in 1972 to make life in the Valley more comfortable and enable year-round geyser observation.
Before 1972, temporary tents housed reserve employees, researchers and tourists during the summer.

At the same time, in view of the increasing tourist load, the authorities of the reserve decided to actively manage
the area. Since 1970, Vitaly Nikolayenko became a permanent employee of the reserve at the headquarters of the
Valley of Geysers. Soon afterwards, he built his own two-story house attached to the one-story house of scientists;
these two initial buildings gave birth to the famous ‘old house in the Valley of Geysers.’ For more than two decades,
this residence was a base for protection of the area and scientiﬁc research as well as a shelter for numerous unoﬃcial

tourists who managed to reach the Valley. The
GOSA expedition, welcomed by Nikolayenko, also
lived in this house in 1991. This house was
destroyed by ﬁre in 1996.

Soon after the beginning of the regular geological
and geothermal research studies, Sugrobov initiated

the creation of a large-scale plan of
thermal ﬁeld (1:2000) and a large-scale map of the
basin of the Geyzernaya River (1:10,000). Large-
scale topographic mapping and aerial photography
was performed in 1973; the originals of the maps
were prepared in 1974 and published in 1975 with
300 copies of each type (Dvigalo and Melekestsev,
2009). The location of 25 geysers and boiling
springs were shown on the 1:2000-scale map. The
creation of large-scale maps was the result of the
collaboration of specialists from the Institute of
Volcanology and Novosibirsk Institute of Engineers
in Geodesy, Aerophotography and Cartography
(NIIGAiK).

the secret status made it
impossible to publish
these maps (and derivative maps and diagrams) for
public access. Soon after the publication, ﬁeld researchers started using both maps for mapping thermal and
other physical features. They manually wrote the symbols and names of numerous small geysers, springs and
creeks on the maps (Figures 7 and 8). Thus, 1975 can be considered the starting point for the second stage of
the mapping of thermal features in the Valley.

gave

During the 1970s and 1980s, the research and tourist activity in the Valley of Geysers was at its apogee. Although
the initial toponymy of Ustinova remained practically untouched, many other thermal features received alternative
names (Table 1). Additionally, several dozen minor geysers and boiling springs were named by scientists and
tourists (Table 2). These individuals also named many other thermal features (mudpots, pools, steam vents,
thermal walls and platforms) and other geographical objects (lakes, rocks, creeks, waterfalls). The process was
never regulated by the authorities of the reserve, resulting in duplication and triplication of names for many
thermal features as well as using similar names for diﬀerent features. This spontaneous naming activity together
large-scale maps in public access caused a gradually increasing naming confusion.
with the absence of
Generally, during the second stage, two traditions manifested themselves in the naming of geysers, boiling
springs and other objects. These traditions can be referred to as ‘scientiﬁc’ and ‘touristic’.

The names used by researchers were documented primarily in their ﬁeld books and work papers, and partially in
several scientiﬁc articles. For example, in 1982, an article was published with the results of the automatic
measurement of geyser activity during 1972–1978. These results were compared with data collected manually
during 1941–1971, and an analysis of the inﬂuence of diﬀerent factors on geyser activity was performed
(Sugrobova, 1982). In 1989, an article was published with the analysis of the tritium concentration in thermal
water (Sugrobova et al., 1989). These scientiﬁc articles, as well as others, did not include a systematic
geographical description of geysers but contained many ‘scientiﬁc’ versions of names in text and tables.

Unfortunately, ‘the tough 1990s’3 hindered the preparation and publication of a ﬁnal monograph with the
investigations in the Valley. The monograph was never

oﬃcial guidebook or popular edition about the Valley was published in the Soviet era after Semenov’s book possibly
because the Valley was oﬃcially closed to tourists beginning in 1976.

In 1991, visiting Kamchatka became possible for foreigners. Six members of the GOSA from Yellowstone
National Park, USA visited the Valley on 1–8 July 1991 and created a thorough description (T. Scott Bryan,
Bob Colvin, Martha Fenimore, Jack Hobart, John Rinehart and Bill Warnock). The expedition was led by
Bryan, the author of many popular guidebooks related to the Yellowstone geysers.

The Americans were invited by Sergey Alekseev, the director of the Kronotsky Reserve, and guided by
Nikolayenko, who had shown and described the thermal features of the Valley to them. The GOSA special
report about the expedition contains 104 numbered thermal features, although several of them are not localized
(Bryan et al., 1991). The report included 73 geysers and springs with names that were known before the
expedition; the lists of thermal features in (Bryan et al., 1991) and (Sugrobov et al., 2009) partially diﬀer. In

addition, fourteen thermal features in the GOSA report have names coined by Nikolayenko or by the Americans
during the expedition. The report is supplemented by a map of geyser locations based on a 1:2000 topographic plan.
The map contains 82 geysers and springs with names. A draft of this map was initially drawn in Russian by
Nikolayenko, and then translated for publication in English by Bryan (Figures 11 and 12).

The report, prepared by Bryan and his colleagues, became the most comprehensive catalogue of geysers and
springs of the Valley of Geysers for many years (at least, until the publication of the book of Sugrobov et al.,
2004; 2009) and the ﬁrst one (and still the only one) published in English. This book was an impressive
achievement for a one-week expedition. As a result, the English-speaking community became aware of the
second largest geyser ﬁeld in the world.

At the same time, the Americans did not know about the work being done by Russian researchers of Sugrobov’s
team. The Russian scientists were not involved in preparation of the report and their working maps and
publications were not considered. As a result, the GOSA report documented mainly the oral ‘tourist’ tradition,

presented by Nikolayenko and did not consider some previously published ‘scientiﬁc’ names. If the collaboration
between Russian and American researchers was established in 1991, it surely would have led to more detailed
descriptions of the thermal features and improved cartography in the report.

In addition to the GOSA report, the ‘tourist’ tradition of naming was also documented in books of Nechayev
(2000; 2007). These richly illustrated books contain systematic descriptions and colourful photos of 40 geysers
and springs as well as simple maps of the location of the thermal features in thermal areas. The ﬁrst book
(2000) was prepared with the direct participation of Nikolayenko.

Thus, the second stage of mapping and naming of thermal features continued for more than 30 years and was based
on large-scale maps of the territory. Minor geysers, springs and other thermal features (mudpots, hot pools, steam vents)
were named by researchers and tourists without any regulation as well as other tourist attractions (like rocks, creeks,
waterfalls, and so on). The number of geysers and boiling springs with documented names in systematic catalogues
exceeded 70 (Bryan et al., 1991; Sugrobov et al., 2004; 2009). The total number of geysers and boiling springs with
documented names published during 1941–2007 reached 116, although the exact location of ten of them is still
unknown, see Tables 1 and 2. Due to the parallel evolution of the two naming traditions, approximately one-third
of all thermal features had more than one name at the end of the second stage.

During 1991–2007, the landscape and thermal features were quite stable, and no new active naming
was documented. Sugrobov and Sugrobova left Kamchatka in the beginning of the 1990s. Nikolayenko left the
Valley in the 1990s and devoted himself to the photography and research of the brown bears; he was killed by a
bear in 2003. Ustinova died in Vancouver, Canada in 2009. Her death was the end of an era.

Since 2009: A time of 3D documents

A huge landslide severely damaged the Valley of Geysers on 3rd June 2007. About one-half of all geysers and
springs were buried by the landslide or ﬂooded by the landslide-dammed lake and later buried with alluvium
that ﬁlled the lake (Leonov and Leonov, 2014). The volume of the landslide reached 21 million cubic metres
(Dvigalo and Melekestsev, 2009). It is no doubt the largest landslide in Kamchatka on record and one of the
largest in Russia. This shocking natural disaster inspired a new wave of interest in the Valley and its
research. For example, in 2008 during a national contest, the Valley of Geysers was voted as one of the
‘Seven Wonders of Russia.’

After the investigation of the 2007 landslide, several researchers alerted in their articles that new landslides
are possible in the Valley in future without any practical possibility to prevent them (Dvigalo and Melekestsev,
2009; Leonov, 2007). In 2009, an international conference ‘GeyserValley 2009’ was organized to discuss
methods for the digital preservation of information about the Valley.4 After the conference, a project on the
virtual modelling of the Valley of Geysers began.5 Three ﬁeld expeditions were organized during 2009–2011
features and to prepare the ﬁrst version of the 3D model
to collect data about the surviving thermal
(Leonov et al., 2010; 2011).

Just prior to the conference, the ﬁrst high-resolution multispectral image of the Valley and the neighbouring
area became available (GeoEye-1, 0.5 m, 06 September 2009). A sponsor of the conference, ScanEx, purchased
100 sq. km of satellite imagery and later the full frame (more than 300 sq. km) was provided to the project by
the GeoEye Foundation. The image was precisely geo-referenced during the ﬁeld expedition in 2009 with the
use of a dual-frequency geodetic GPS receiver. Specialists of ScanEx also created a digital elevation model of the
territory based on a pair of 2007 panchromatic images (CartoSat, 2.5 m, 19th September 2007). This satellite
data became the basis for the virtual 3D model of the territory (3D document) (Figure 13).

To develop a virtual model of the Valley of Geysers, it was necessary to prepare a systematic description of
thermal features and other physical features and to overcome discrepancies between the ‘scientiﬁc’ and ‘tourist’
traditions of naming. A thorough investigation of the literature was performed, including the comparison of old
maps with the current landscape using the digital 3D model. As a result, a catalogue of surviving geysers,
boiling springs and other features was prepared and published in 2012 (Leonov, 2012a; 2012b). One of the
major advances of the new catalogue was the compilation of a uniﬁed list of thermal features and other
features and the selection of a primary name for each thermal feature for further use. Additionally, for the
ﬁrst time, maps indicating the location of the geysers in geographic coordinates were published. Later, this
information was used in other publications to prepare maps of the location of the geysers (Zavadskaya
et al., 2014; 2015).

The predictions of the scientists came true sooner than anticipated. On 4th January 2014, another huge
landslide occurred in the upper reaches of the Geyzernaya River. This landslide caused a powerful mudﬂow
that damaged many thermal features downstream along the river course (Leonov, 2014). In September 2014,
aerial photography of the territory along the Geyzernaya River was performed by the specialists of the

Kronotsky Reserve. Based on this aerial photography, a digital 3D model of the territory and maps of the geyser
locations were updated (Figure 14).

Old maps were compared with the actual landscape on the basis of the 3D model to analyse the location of the
buried thermal features (Figure 14). This comparison proved that some of the buried geysers and boiling springs
were restored near their previous locations, see for example, ‘Малый’ (Malyy (small), 5MAL) and ‘Малая Печка’
(Malaya Pechka (small oven), 5MPE) in Figure 14.

Major changes in landscape morphology after the landslides caused the formation of new geysers and boiling
springs. These geysers began to receive new names (Table 3). Moreover, a new geyser arose in the Uzon
Caldera in 2008; this event was probably connected with the 2007 landslide in the Valley (see 0SHA in Table 3).
The 2007 and 2014 events also caused changes in the behaviour of many existing thermal features. For

example, after the 2007 landslide, the Krepost (fortress) geyser (6KRE) on a right bank of the Geyzernaya River
started to erupt regularly. This change in the behaviour prompted an attempt to provide it with a new name
(Table 2). New names were oﬀered for Paryashchiy (steaming) geyser (7PAR) and unnamed geyser 7ROZ.2
(Table 1). Thus, the 2007 landslide was a trigger for the start of a new stage of mapping and naming of geysers
and springs. The year 2009 can be considered a starting point of this stage, since the ﬁrst high-resolution
multispectral satellite image was created and geo-referenced digital 3D modelling of the territory was started as
well as a new wave of studies regarding the systematization of thermal features. Geysers and boiling springs
with documented names that were ﬁrst described and named after 2007 are presented in Table 3.

In 2017, a new catalogue of geysers and springs was published (Leonov, 2017). This catalogue contains more
than 150 geysers and springs, both existing and buried. The catalogue contains many unique historical and
modern photographs and aims to create a durable bridge between the past and future of cartography and
toponymy in the Valley and a basis for further research.

Development of the tools to measure geyser activity

The stages of development of cartography and toponymy correlate well with the development of tools to measure
geyser activity. An analysis of this correlation reveals the dramatic role of personal factors and force major
circumstances (such as the state disintegration or catastrophic natural disasters) on the evolution of research
tools and methods.

The start of routine research in the early 1970s led not only to creation of large-scale maps (and a new stage of
naming thermal features) but also to the application of a new technology for measuring the activity of the geysers.
For example, the water level gauges that were installed on ﬁfteen geysers enabled accurate automatic measurements
of their activity (Figure 15). The automatic measurement of geyser activity with the use of water level gauges
continued regularly until the early 1990s (for the Velikan Geyser); the sporadic use of water level gauges
continued to the late 1990s. In 1974–1975, year-round monitoring was organized, although a heroic eﬀort was
required in the everyday maintenance of the water level gauges.

Political turbulence in the Soviet Union at the end of the 1980s led to ‘the tough 1990s’ and decline of regular
research in the Valley but at the same time it coincided with the implementation of a new technology for the
measurement of geyser activity. In 1988, Valery Droznin and Igor Kalyaev started to develop their system based
on contact closure. Two electrodes were placed into the geyser outﬂow channel in such a way that contact
closure occurred only during the outﬂow and eruption stages during geyser operation (Figure 16). This system
worked successfully for more than ﬁfteen years. These data were collected in real-time on a personal computer
in a house of a scientist in the headquarters of the Valley of Geysers (using wires from geysers to the house).
The system was stopped only in 2006 due to the absence of ﬁnancing.

The landslide of 2007 stimulated a new wave of research in the Valley that attracted a new generation of
researchers with new tools and methods. Alexey Kiryukhin started to use temperature loggers for the
measurement of geyser activity beginning in 2007. The loggers were installed both in the outﬂow channel of the
geyser and inside the vent. An example of the collected data is presented in Figure 17. After the 2014 landslide,
Alexander Belousov and Marina Belousova started widely using automatic long-term videotaping for the
documentation of geyser activity. Manual processing is required to register the activity but at the same time this
method is simpler in implementation than automatic detectors.

Conclusions

An analysis of the history of mapping and naming of thermal features in the Valley of Geysers shows that the
development of the toponymy of this area was limited mainly by the quality of the cartographic base that was
accessible to researchers. The use of manual maps or diagrams enabled the documentation of more than 40
geysers and boiling springs (1973); the publication of large-scale topographic maps in 1975 resulted in the
documentation of approximately one hundred thermal features by 1991. Catastrophic landslides in 2007 and
2014 damaged the Valley severely and more than one half of the thermal features were destroyed. The use of
high-resolution data by remote sensing since 2007 provided a base for the further development of the
toponymy that is now in its initial phase. For the moment, there are approximately 50 active geysers and
boiling springs with personal names in the Valley.

The cartography and toponymy in the Valley of Geysers evolved gradually, although with a regrettable
under-documentation in the late Soviet Union timeframe (1970–1991). The classiﬁcation of large-scale maps
of
the Valley was evidently excessive and led to confusion. The maps were used by researchers but
unavailable to the general public and researchers could not publish them. The closure of the Valley to

Note 4: These thermal features (5MAL and 5MPE) were ﬂooded in 2007 by the landslide-dammed lake, but stayed active underwater (approximately 8–9 and 15–16 metres under the water level accordingly). After the formation of the alluvial

plain in place of the lake, ‘new’ thermal features were formed on the surface of the plain close to the previous locations of 5MAL and 5MPE, as can be observed on the map in Figure 14.

geyser (because the direct translation of the ‘Monkey Face’ in Russian sounds quite strange and not appropriate to use).

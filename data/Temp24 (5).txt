Abstract.
In absence of other limitations, the growth rate of a plant is dependent
upon the amount of heat it receives. Each species, whether a crop, weed or disease
organism, is adapted to grow at its optimum rate within a speci(cid:142) c temperature
range. Within this range, the growing degree days (GDD) is the heat accumulation
above a given base temperature for a speci(cid:142) c time period, such as a crop’s growing
season or phenological stage. In this paper we detail a methodology to predict
GDD for synthetically generated average growing seasons derived from long term
average climate data over the Australian continent. An application of these
techniques has been made using the GEODATA 9 second DEM, with temperature
threshold values estimated to characterize optimum growth in citrus (Citrus
sinensis (L.) Osbeck). Three major determinants of the annual growth cycle of
Citrus sp. were established and predicted on a spatial basis including the starting
day of the growing season, the GDD for a growing season, and the time required
to accumulate an arbitrarily selected 2000 GDD from the estimated starting day.
When these critical environmental factors are expressed on a spatial basis, covering
the Australian continent, the combination can be used to identify locations where
new crop varieties can most eŒectively be grown to maximize fruit quality and
productivity, or to extend the harvest season. Likewise, new germplasm introduced
to Australia from overseas can be horticulturally assessed at sites climatically
matched to the source location.

Introduction
The most commonly available climatic data are averages of monthly maximum,
minimum or mean daily temperature and precipitation. These data describe the
general climatic characteristics of a region and are useful for comparing one location

with another (Richardson 1985). However, these monthly summaries are often too
generalized and out of phase with critical stages of crop development making their
use in agriculture limited. Daily average temperatures can be used to determine
when the seasonal temperatures are su(cid:141) ciently warm or cool enough to initiate or
limit plant growth. Generally, plant growth and development is closely related to
the rise or fall of critical temperatures as well as to accumulations of temperature
and precipitation between phenological stages (Richardson 1981).

The concept of growing degree days (GDD) resulted from observations that:
there is a base temperature below which plants do not grow; the rate of growth
increases with temperature above this base; and diŒerent crop hybrids require
diŒerent GDD accumulations to reach maturity.

Much of the early application of GDD was undertaken in studies on the popula-
tion dynamics of insect pests of agricultural and agronomic crops such as corn. Corn
was established to have a minimum base temperature of 50ß F. This threshold allowed
the number of GDDs for corn to reach maturity to be calculated for diŒerent
climatic regions (Neild et al. 1983). The days to maturity will be greater or less when
the season is cooler or warmer than normal and varies with planting time.

Climatic analysis over large geographic regions to create GDD and climatic
suitability coverages has been undertaken both globally (Booth 1990) and regionally
(Mackey et al. 1996). Recently, the concept of GDD using point based climatic
observations has been used by the South African citrus industry to identify four
climatic zones ranging from hot through intermediate, cool and cold areas in which
preferred varieties are de(cid:142) ned according to their horticultural performance. These
varieties were then supplied for each region from the South African Citrus
Improvement program (CIP) scheme. At this stage however no attempt has been
made to spatially interpolate temperature data either on a regional or national level.
An important feature of daily indices of growth, such as GDD, is their use in
assessing seasonal crop-weather conditions on a real time basis. When only monthly
averages are available, it is necessary to wait until the end of a month to determine
if seasonal temperatures or precipitation are ahead or behind the normal (Neild
et al. 1983 ). Daily ‘normals’ permit assessments to be made on a daily or real time
basis. A signi(cid:142) cant disadvantag e of methods which require daily observations of
climate however, is that daily data are not as generally available as monthly observa-
tions and at regional, continental and global scales daily climate data are often
incomplete and data accuracy can be questionable (Coops et al. 2000). Therefore, it
is desirable to generate synthetic daily weather data to meet such needs. Reliable
generated daily weather data must have similar statistical characteristics as actual
weather data for a given area.

This paper details the derivation of GDD for Citrus sp. over the entire Australian
continent as a (cid:142) rst step in an initial strati(cid:142) cation for the possible introduction of
new varieties of crop species. As spatial estimates of daily climatic data are unavail-
able over the entire Australian continent, daily temperature estimates were derived
from mean monthly temperature data using a set of trigonometric equations. These
daily temperatures were then converted into GDD using speci(cid:142) ed threshold values.
These procedures were completed for the entire Australian continent using a broad
scale Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and derived mean monthly climatic surfaces.
As a result, these GDD estimates can be easily analysed and queried using
Geographic Information System (GIS) or image processing systems.

2. Methods
2.1. Estimating daily temperature from monthly records

Meteorological data are frequently utilized to evaluate the short and long-term
eŒects of temperature and rainfall changes on crop growth. These evaluations are
often undertaken using empirical or physiological models of plant growth using daily
or hourly meteorological data. One possible method to circumvent the lack of
meteorological daily data is to use weather generators, such as the method proposed
for crops by Richardson and Wright (1984) to generate inputs to crop and vegetation
models. The generation of daily meteorological data from monthly means has been
applied successfully in the USA (Richardson and Wright 1984), where the model
parameters derived from long-term meteorological records have accurately simulated
both short and long-term (cid:143) uctuations in temperature and rainfall. A variety of
stochastic weather generation algorithms have been developed (see Hutchinson
(1986) for a review). In this study, a method developed by Neild et al. (1978 ) was
used to estimate daily minimum and maximum temperatures from average monthly
daily minimum and maximum temperatures. The technique involves the (cid:142) tting of a
5-parameter trigonometric function to the mean monthly values. These functions are
shown in equations (1) and (2):

where p1 to p5 and q1 to q5 are the coe(cid:141) cients and X is the day number in the year.
The average monthly maximum and minimum temperatures are assumed to be
known for each spatial location. Using the day number for the 15th of each month
with the 12 temperature values, 12 equations with 5 unknown variables were solved
to determine coe(cid:141) cients which describe maximum or minimum daily temperatures
for the year. This required development of a numerical computation routine to solve
these equations for the 5 unknowns individually using the technique of singular
value decomposition (SVD) (Press et al. 1992). The shape of these trigonometric
functions are shown in (cid:142) gure 1.

In order to test the accuracy of the technique for predicting daily estimates of
minimum and maximum temperature from monthly averages, daily temperature data
were extracted for four stations covering a range of environments in Australia from
long term records held by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. At each station,
mean monthly and daily minimum and maximum temperature data were acquired
for selected years. At each station the mean monthly minimum and maximum data
were used to derive the 10 (5 each for maximum and minimum temperature data)
coe(cid:141) cients and these coe(cid:141) cients were then used to generate 365 days of daily
temperature data. The diŒerence and the maximum diŒerence was then calculated
between the actual daily minimum and maximum temperatures recorded at the
station and the estimated daily temperature from the coe(cid:141) cients over the year.

2.2. Predicting growing degree days

The Daily Heat Contribution (DHC) is the individual daily contribution of the
temperature conditions at a given location, above a speci(cid:142) c threshold temperature.

is the daily maximum temperature, T min

where T max
is the daily minimum temper-
ature and b is the base temperature below which no plant growth is assumed to
occur. As the DHC is the average daily temperature minus the base temperature,
for some geographical areas the DHC may be negative for part or even all of the year.
GDD for a particular period, or growing season, is computed using the formula

below (adapted from Neild et al. 1978 ):

GDD 5

max

In addition to being used to calculate GDD, the DHC can also be used to de(cid:142) ne
the start of the ‘growing’ season. This was taken to be the (cid:142) rst day in the year with
positive DHC, following a day of negative DHC. If DHC never became negative
then the day of minima DHC was taken as the growing season starting day.

When the GDD methodology is applied spatially over large regions, two addi-
tional thresholds can be speci(cid:142) ed to better match the physiological response of the
crop species. The minimum temperature absolute threshold de(cid:142) nes regions where,
for example, frost may occur which would make the region unsuitable for crop
growth regardless of the annual GDD of the site. Above this temperature it is
assumed that plant growth is a function of the diŒerence between daily average air
temperature and the lower threshold or base temperature (equation 3). The second
is an upper temperature threshold, above which it is assumed that extra heat cannot
be utilized by the plant. At this high temperature threshold, the GDD is assumed
to increase but only at the rate de(cid:142) ned by the average of the minimum daily

temperature and the maximum threshold temperature. If, for example, the upper
temperature threshold of the plant is 30ß C and the maximum temperature is 32ß C,
then GDD would be calculated using a maximum temperature of 30ß C.

2.3. Spatial extrapolation of GDD

In order to apply GDD predictions over the entire Australian continent mean
monthly minimum and maximum temperature surfaces were required. Monthly mean
climate surfaces for Australia have been developed and maintained at the Centre for
Resource and Environmental Studies (CRES) of the Australian National University
for over 10 years. These surfaces were derived from the ANUCLIM package
(Hutchinson 1989, Hutchinson 1991, McMahon et al. 1995) with the accuracy of
these surfaces being crucially dependent on calibrating for the eŒects of spatially
varying topographic eŒects. The ANUCLIM monthly mean, daily minimum and
daily maximum, temperature surfaces were created from approximatel y 1120 sites
with standard errors in the minimum temperature surfaces of approximatel y 0.5 ß C.
Standard errors in the maximum temperature surfaces were generally slightly less
than 0.5ß C (Hutchinson 2000). In order to utilize the ANUCLIM layer a DEM is
required to provide latitude, longitude and elevation to the thin plate multi-variate
smoothing splines.

The Australian GEODATA 9 second DEM was used to spatially extrapolate the
ANUCLIM surfaces and thus the GDD estimates over the Australian continent.
The DEM covers the whole of Australia with a grid spacing of 9 seconds in longitude
and latitude which equates to a spacing of approximatel y 265 m at Cape York in
Northern Australia to 194 m in southern Tasmania (AUSLIG 1998). The ANUDEM
package (Hutchinson 1988, Hutchinson and Dowling 1991) was used to create the
DEM. The DEM has an estimated positional standard error of 35 m and a maximum
error of 90 m. Comparison between elevations of 49 control stations and the nearest
cell in the 9 second DEM resulted in an average diŒerence of 20 m with a standard
deviation of 35 m.

An analytical program was written to solve each the (cid:142) ve coe(cid:141) cients in equations
(1) and (2) using the SVD routine (Press et al. 1992). For each grid cell in the DEM
the 12 monthly mean maximum and minimum temperature were input to the SVD
routine to solve for the coe(cid:141) cients. These were then saved as GIS surface grids
which were then used to calculate the long term daily average minimum and long
term daily average maximum temperatures for each day of the year.

Two key growing citrus regions were selected to verify the calculation of GDD
and the use of the minimum and maximum thresholds. Meteorological data for the
two regions were obtained and GDD was calculated from (a) point based observa-
tions of monthly temperature from meteorological data and (b) the mean monthly
climatic data as calculated by the ANUCLIM package for the corresponding cell
on the DEM. The locations and elevations of the two selected stations are listed
in table 2.

2.4. GDD parameters for Citrus sp.

The selection of the major determinants of the annual growth cycle of Citrus sp.
were chosen on the basis of
long-term experience gleaned from both practical
experience and the vast body of literature dealing with citrus culture. For citrus,
climate is the most important component of the climate-soil-culture complex which
results in diŒerences in growth and fruit characteristics among the commercial citrus-
producing areas of the world. Climatic variation between regions is most readily
seen in diŒerences in time elapsed between (cid:143) owering and market maturity and it is
also strongly expressed by diŒerences in fruit growth rate and (cid:142) nal fruit size at
harvest. Three key indicators of citrus growth were selected as being most signi(cid:142) cant
in understanding if new crop varieties can eŒectively be grown to maximize fruit
quality and productivity, or to extend the harvest season establishment in Australia.
These three determinants of Citrus sp were:

1. Starting day of the growing season:
As vegetative vigour and root growth is limited under low temperature conditions
when root hydraulic conductivity is almost zero, the starting day of the growing
season (de(cid:142) ned as the (cid:142) rst day in the growing season above a set threshold) is an
important variable.

2. GDD for the growing season:
Daily heat contributions are summed for the year (365 days) or for a de(cid:142) ned
period within the growing season to identify spatial variation in eŒective heat sums
occurring across continental Australia. This allows an identi(cid:142) cation of climatic
diversity which can be used to extend the supply line of single varieties or to plant
imported varieties in areas of similar climatic conditions to their origin.

3. T ime to accumulate a 2000 target GDD:
An annual heat sum of 2000 GDD falls in the median range of climatic suitability
for world citrus growing areas ranging from a low of 800 heat units in New Zealand
up to 5000 heat units in Northern Australia and Thailand with most major commer-
cial citrus species ranging from 1780 to 2500 heat units. Selection of a target 2000
GDD was used to stratify continental Australia in relation to other producing areas
of the world.

Previous studies in the growth of Citrus sp. indicate a base temperature threshold
of 12ß C and a maximum temperature threshold of 32ß C were suitable for Citrus sp.
When these critical environmental factors are expressed on a spatial basis, covering
the Australian continent, the combination can be used to identify locations for new
crop varieties in addition to additional factors including soil type and distribution
networks.

3. Results

Table 1 shows the average and maximum temperature diŒerences between the
observed and the modeled daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the four
stations. The distribution histograms of the diŒerences between actual and estimated
daily temperatures, at each of the four stations, are shown separately for minimum
and maximum temperatures in (cid:142) gure 2(a) and (cid:142) gure 2(b) respectively.

Table 1 indicates the Gri(cid:141) th simulations were the most accurate with a 0.01ß C

minimum and actual minimum or the predicted maximum and the actual maximum

Figure 4 (a) indicates that the daily maximum temperature at Bourke is greater
than 30ß C in the summer months which is above the optimal growing temperature
for Citrus sp. Using 32ß C as the upper temperature threshold, the estimation of DHC
at these times would be limited by a maximum temperature of 32ß C rather than the
predicted daily maximum on these days. As a result new DHC and GDD curves
can be predicted using an upper threshold of 32ß C ((cid:142) gure 5).

Incorporation of the maximum threshold temperature (cid:143) attens the DHC curve,

simple correlation analysis indicates the two are highly correlated (r 5 0.99 ) with a
standard error of 21 GDD units. It is acknowledged however that this is not a
completely independent test of the accuracy of the predicted GDD as the monthly
data obtained from the ANUCLIM mean monthly surfaces utilized, in its interpola-
tion, data from the Yanco meteorological station. As a result, the gridded value of
GDD and the calculated GDD have not been calculated from independent datasets.
The close agreement however, does indicate the ANUCLIM estimates of min-
imum and maximum climate using the GEODATA 9 second DEM appear to be
su(cid:141) ciently accurate to predict station based estimates of GDD and demonstrate s
this GDD technique can be applied over the entire landscape at a spatial scale
commensurate with the DEM.

Figure 7 shows a frequency distribution of accumulated GDD for a full growing
season (12 month period) using a base temperature threshold of 12ß C and a maximum
temperature threshold of 32ß C for the Australian continent. The growing conditions
range from 0 GDD in 400 100 ha cells to a maximum of 5500 GDD. A value of
0 GDD was predicted in cells where the monthly minimum temperature was
lower than the absolute minimum temperature threshold resulting in a zero GDD
accumulation for the year.

Figure 8 shows the spatial variation of GDD over the Australian continent. The
pattern of the GDD is primarily a function of latitude with terrain and the prevailing
meteorological conditions over the continent also having an eŒect. The GDD estim-
ates are directly aŒected by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which
primarily diŒerentiates climate over the Australian continent as either monsoonal/
tropical conditions in the north of the continent or Mediterranean type climate in

the south. In the winter months, the extensive cloud in the Great Australian Bight
in(cid:143) uences the temperatures in the south of the continent, producing the lower GDD
values. In the central regions of Australia, where there is signi(cid:142) cantly less cloud
cover and rainfall than in the north or south, the GDD values steadily increase. This
increase in GDD continues into the tropical, equatorial regions of Australia where
the largest GDD values are in excess of 5000 units.

Howe in the far south. At any given latitude this mountain range reduces temper-
atures resulting in a reduced annual total GDD. This is especially the case in the
Snowy Mountains region (the main alpine region of Australia situated at around
Õ 35ß S, 150ß E) where there is virtually no possibility of crop development or growth.
Figures 9 and 10 present the results of a commonly asked query of this type of
database. Given that a certain crop requires a predetermined number of GDD to
reach maturity, where are the most suitable spatial locations to plant the species?

GDD of 2000 for the entire continent. Figure 10 is derived from the same set of
thresholds for the continent as (cid:142) gure 8 and shows the spatial distribution of (cid:142) gure 9
(number of days required to reach a user speci(cid:142) ed maximum GDD of 2000). This
time is computed as the time from the starting day of the growing season until the
time GDD accumulation reached 2000 and, like (cid:142) gure 8, varies widely over the
continent.

In this analysis some cells may require more than a single growing season to
exceed 2000 GDD’s or alternatively some cells may never reach the 2000 GDD limit
as their mean temperature is close to, or less than, the speci(cid:142) ed base temperature of
12ß C. As a result, the number of days presented in (cid:142) gure 9 has been limited to cells
that reach 2000 GDD within two growing seasons (730 days). Figure 9 shows the
time to reach 2000 GDD for the majority of cells is distinctly bi-modal over the
continent with the majority of cells reaching 2000 GDD within the (cid:142) rst growing
season and a small number reaching 2000 GDD during the second season.

In addition to predicting the maximum GDD and the accumulation of GDD at
each cell, it is also possible to predict when the DHC curve begins to increase,
indicating the commencement of the annual growing season. Figure 11 shows the
spatial map of the start day of the growing season. In the cooler parts of the continent
the start of the growing season is delayed until average temperatures rises to the
base temperature of 12ß C. In extreme cases, the start of the growing season is delayed
well into the summer months, if it occurs at all. As a result there is a range of days
from the potential start of the growing season (de(cid:142) ned as July 1 ) well into January
of the following year. The majority of the data, however, occurs between days 180
to 260.

4. Discussion and conclusions

The use of minimum and maximum temperature thresholds in the calculation
of the GDD essentially limits the eŒect of extreme climatic events on the GDD
calculations over the continent. This minimization provides robustness to the overall
technique as the GDD equations, as developed here, limit their eŒect thereby reducing
the need for accurate estimates of the number and severity of extreme temperature
events.

However, the success or failure of many crops is highly dependent on freak
occurrences of frost and other events. Therefore additional suitability indices, based
on risk assessment or probabilities analysis, may be required to provide additional
information as to locational suitability.

The results represented here indicate that the prediction of GDD over an entire
continent using monthly minimum and maximum GIS temperature surfaces is pos-
sible. In this study we have used temperature threshold values estimated to character-
ize optimum growth in citrus (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) however minimum and
maximum temperature thresholds for many species are available for a variety for
crops and forest tree species. A key bene(cid:142) t of incorporating this technique into a
GIS framework is that the results can be easily overlaid with other variables in(cid:143) uen-
cing the growth and distribution of a crop species such as rainfall distribution
patterns and soil variables. In addition, infrastructure variables, such as roads net-
works and the distribution of local markets, can be easily overlaid and compared to
the prediction of growth conditions.

The results presented detail a methodology to predict GDD with a synthetically
generated average growing season derived from long term average climate data over
the Australian continent. An initial application of these techniques has been made
using the GEODATA 9 second DEM using temperature threshold values estimated
to characterize hypothetical crop species. Three major products were predicted on
a spatial basis including the starting day of the growing season, the GDD for a
growing season, and the time required to accumulate 2000 GDD from the estimated
starting day.

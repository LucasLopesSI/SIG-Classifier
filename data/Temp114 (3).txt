Abstract

Geographic  citizen  science  has  much  potential  to  assist 

in  wildlife  research  and  conservation,  but  the  quality 

of  observation  data  is  a  key  concern.  We  examined  the 

effects  of  sampling  design  on  the  quality  of  spatial  data 

collected  for  a  koala  citizen  science  project  in  Australia. 

Data  were  collected  from  three  samples—volunteers 

(n  =  454),  an  Internet  panel  (n  =  103),  and  landowners 

(n  =  35)—to  assess  spatial  data  quality,  a  dimension  of 

citizen science projects rarely considered. The locational 

accuracy  of  koala  observations  among  the  samples  was 

similar  when  benchmarked  against  authoritative  data 

(i.e.,  an  expert‐derived  koala  distribution  model),  but 

there were differences in the quantity of data generated. 

Fewer koala location data were generated per participant 

by  the  Internet  panel  sample  than  the  volunteer  or  land‐

owner samples. Spatial preferences for land uses affecting 

koala  conservation  were  also  mapped,  with  landowners 

more  likely  to  map  locations  for  residential  and  tourism 

development and volunteers less likely. These spatial pref‐

erences have the potential to influence the social accepta‐

bility of future koala conservation proposals. With careful 

sampling  design,  both  citizen  observations  and  land  use

preferences  can  be  included  within  the  same  project  to 

augment scientific assessments and identify conservation 

opportunities and constraints.

The number of participatory mapping methods—including participation GIS (PPGIS), participatory GIS (PGIS), and 

volunteered geographic information (VGI)—has increased significantly over the last two decades (Brown & Kyttä, 

2018). However, the rapid pace of mapping application development and innovation has exceeded the capacity to 

adequately evaluate the validity and impact of the methods used. The diversity of spatial content generated from 

participatory and crowdsourced methods requires evaluations that transcend traditional geospatial assessment 

based on authoritative data (Antoniou & Skopeliti, 2015). Sampling design (i.e., who is selected from the popu‐

lation and how) and response bias are recognized as key issues for data quality in participatory mapping (Brown, 

2017; Brown & Kyttä, 2014; Bubalo, van Zanten, & Verburg, 2019), which contribute to uncertainties in inferring 

relationships between participant mapping data and the geographic mapping context (Robertson & Feick, 2018). 

Further, there is some evidence that participants map responses that reflect their general, non‐spatial values and 

preferences (Brown, 2013).

Participatory mapping data can be evaluated from a traditional GIS validity‐as‐accuracy perspective (Spielman, 

2014), such as spatial resolution, position and attribute accuracy, logical consistency, and completeness. The best 

example  is  OpenStreetMap  (OSM),  a  VGI  system  that  has  been  effectively  benchmarked  against  authoritative 

geospatial data (Girres & Touya, 2010; Haklay, 2010). However, many participatory mapping applications generate 

subjective  spatial  attributes  such  as  place  values,  experiences,  and  preferences  that  lack  authoritative  criteria 

to assess spatial accuracy. In this situation, the credibility of the mapping participants (i.e., validity‐as‐credibility) 

is of central importance to the quality of the spatial data. Thus, sampling design and participant characteristics 

emerge as key variables to evaluate the quality of spatial data generated. For example, in a study of public land 

management, Brown, Kelly, and Whitall (2014) found that volunteer participants mapped more utilitarian values 

and consumptive use preferences compared to participants from a random household sample. In another study, 

Brown, Strickland‐Munro, Kobryn, and Moore (2016) found that participants from different stakeholder groups 

mapped  different  management  preferences.  Thus,  “who”  participates  is  essential  to  understand  and  interpret 

mapping outcomes.

Without  authoritative  data  to  evaluate  subjective  mapping  data,  Brown,  Weber,  Zanon,  and  de  Bie  (2012) 

proposed mapping effort as one potential variable to assess subjective spatial data quality. In the first, multi‐study 

analysis of participatory mapping data quality, Brown et al. (2012) found that participants from an online Internet 

panel, a group of pre‐screened respondents, who are willing to participate in surveys, demonstrated less mapping 

effort, resulting in lower‐quality spatial data compared to a random household sample, an in situ sample (individuals 

selected on site in the study area), or a volunteer sample. In an expanded study of sampling design and response 

bias, Brown (2017) found that Internet panel samples had higher response rates but lower spatial data quality than 

household samples, which had greater mapping effort, on average, compared to volunteer samples.

In this study we assess the effects of sampling design and response bias in the participatory mapping context 

of geographic citizen science (i.e., citizen science that uses VGI), where the collection of location information is 

central to the activity (sensu Haklay, 2013). Specifically, we evaluate sampling effects (i.e., whether samples differ 

in their responses) and response bias in a geographic citizen science project (Brown et al., 2018) that sought to 

identify the location and frequency of sightings in Australia of one of the nation's most iconic mammals—the koala 

(Phascolarctos  cinereus)—and  to  identify  land  use  preferences  with  potential  impact  on  koala  conservation.  As 

BROWN et al.    |  3

McAlpine et al. (2015) point out, the koala presents the problem of managing a wide‐ranging species that now pri‐

marily occurs in human‐modified landscapes. Koalas are one of a small number of species that are ideal for citizen 

science studies because they are so readily identifiable and memorable, but they are also cryptic, being difficult 

to observe in their forest habitats. Over the last three decades, a series of successful community‐based surveys 

of koalas, now called citizen science surveys, have identified locations of koalas across a wide landscape in New 

South Wales, as well as focused locations, such as a shire or group of shires. Further, repeat surveys have iden‐

tified changes in the distribution of koalas, as well as rates of decline or increase (Lunney, Crowther, Shannon, & 

Bryant, 2009; Lunney et al., 2016; Lunney, O’Neill, Matthews, & Coburn, 2000; Predavec et al., 2016, 2018; Reed, 

Lunney, & Walker, 1990). It is these surveys that have been the underpinning of government policies to protect 

koalas, or their habitat, and a major contribution to the koala being formally recognized as a threatened species. In 

this study, we assess the quality of koala observation data across three samples (volunteers, an Internet panel, and 

landowners) against an authoritative koala distribution likelihood model for the study region. We further examine 

the data collected for potential sources of bias related to demographic characteristics, mapping responses and 

behavior, and participant attitudes and beliefs toward koalas and their conservation.

Within the context of geographic citizen science, this study provides an opportunity to evaluate both objec‐

tive (koala observations) and subjective spatial attributes (land use preferences such as where koala conservation 

should  occur,  or  where  various  development  activities  should  occur)  from  multiple  samples.  We  posit  that  the 

mapping of koala observations would be less subject to sampling and response bias than the mapping of prefer‐

ences that are related to participant values, beliefs, and motivations for participation.

The purpose of this study is to identify sampling effects that arise from different samples which can influence 

the quality of spatial data and related text‐based survey data. This study builds on previous research by examining 

the following research questions:

1.  How  are  participant  characteristics  and  mapping  responses  similar  or  different  across  samples  and  which 

attributes  appear  important  to  assess  data  quality  in  a  project  for  research  and  conservation?

2.  How does mapping effort differ by samples and does this effort affect the quality of the data (quantity and 

accuracy)?

3.  What are the potential sources of response bias from sampling design in geographic citizen science?

2.1 | Study design and data collection

In 2018, we implemented a geographic citizen science survey to identify the locations of koalas in a study area 

on the far north coast of the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia (Figure 1). In the study area, the koala 

is listed as vulnerable under both state and commonwealth legislation. A major NSW state‐wide citizen science 

survey in 2006 identified the coastal shires on the far north coast as being a koala stronghold (Lunney et al., 2009), 

while Adams‐Hosking et al. (2016) confirmed that the study area lies within a bioregion that contains an important 

koala population, but one with a predicted steep decline. The study area contains four local governments with the 

following population estimates: Byron Shire (31,556); Ballina Shire (41,790); City of Lismore (43,135); and Tweed 

Shire (91,371) (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016).

A  Google®  maps  application  was  developed  where  participants  were  asked  to  drag  and  drop  markers 

representing koala observations and land use preferences in the study area. The first “tab” panel had markers 

allowing  participants  to  record  places  where  they  had  observed  koalas  in  the  following  categories:  weekly, 

monthly, yearly, once, and dead/injured. The second and third tab panels allowed participants to record their 

land use preferences. The second tab panel contained markers that participants could use to identify places

where  they  supported  specific  land  uses  (e.g.,  for  residential  and  commercial  development),  while  the  third 

panel contained markers that participants could use to indicate places where they opposed specific land uses 

(Figure  2).  After  completing  the  mapping  part  of  the  study,  participants  went  on  to  complete  a  survey  that 

comprised questions about participant demographic variables, including home location, age, gender, and for‐

mal education. There were also survey questions that assessed participants' knowledge of koalas and places in 

the study area, attitudes towards koalas, threats to koalas, and level of support for various koala conservation 

efforts (Figure 3).

2.1.1 | Volunteer sample

Participants were crowdsourced through: (a) local government newsletters and websites; (b) a koala‐specific wild‐

life care and rehabilitation organization, “Friends of the Koala”; (c) Facebook® promotions; (d) news stories in local 

media; and (e) friend and relative referrals. The volunteer data collection ran from December 2017 to March 2018.

2.1.2 | Panel sample

We contracted a commercial vendor, Pureprofile®, to administer the survey to an Internet panel of residents in 

the study area. We required at least 100 completed surveys that included both the mapping and text‐based survey 

questions. Panel data were collected from October 2017 through March 2018.

BROWN et al.    |  7

2.1.3 | Landowner sample

With agricultural interests under‐represented in the volunteer and panel samples, we sampled rural landowners 

who were geographically distributed across the study area, who owned 20 acres (8 ha) or more, and who used 

their land for horticulture and/or cattle grazing. Participants were identified using a snowball approach by con‐

tacting koala field researchers, local government representatives, and industry associations. The mapping survey 

was  completed  using  a  “facilitated”  mode,  where  a  member  of  the  research  team  interviewed  the  participant 

face‐to‐face and recorded the responses online. The landowner data were collected from November through mid‐

December 2018, resulting in 35 completed surveys.

2.2 | Analyses

We assessed the representativeness of the samples by comparing demographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, 

education, residence location) to population data from the 2016 Australian census for NSW. We analyzed mapping 

behavior by tabulating the number and type of digital markers placed in the study area by each sample. Mapping 

effort was calculated as the elapsed time between the first and last marker placement, adjusted for obvious time 

breaks in mapping activity. The propensity for participants in a sample to map more or less of a specific type of 

marker was analyzed by coding whether a participant mapped one or more markers (yes) or not (no). Chi‐square 

analysis (test for independence) with standardized residuals was calculated for these binary frequencies to de‐

termine if the frequency of individuals mapping a specific marker type deviated significantly from the expected 

distribution across the three samples. A residual is the difference in the observed frequency and the expected 

frequency (i.e., the value that would be expected under the null hypothesis of no association). A standardized re‐

sidual is calculated by dividing the residual value by the standard error of the residual. Standardized residuals are 

a normalized score, like a z score without units, and if greater than 2.0, indicate that a significantly greater number 

of individuals mapped a specific marker type than would be expected, while standardized residuals less than −2.0 

indicate that fewer individuals mapped a specific marker type than expected.

Questions measuring attitudes towards koalas, perceived threats, and support for various koala conservation 

measures were operationalized on Likert scales and analyzed by sample using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 

Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post‐hoc comparisons. A Likert‐scale question measures a respondent's 

opinion  or  attitude  on  a  given  subject,  such  as  a  respondent's  attitude  toward  living  amongst  koalas,  typically 

recorded using a five or seven‐point agreement scale. The responses are quantified and analyzed using statistics. 

ANOVA tests were used to find statistically significant differences in the means of three sample groups (i.e., vol‐

unteer, panel, landowner). With a statistically significant result, the Tukey HSD post‐hoc test was run to identify 

pairwise differences between sample groups. The Tukey HSD test compares all possible pairs of means to find 

those that are significantly different from each other.

The quality of koala observation data by samples was assessed by: (a) examining the number and distribution 

of  koala  observations  for  each  sample;  and  (b)  benchmarking  sample  participant  observations  against  a  koala 

likelihood model (Predavec et al., 2015) that indicates probable koala occurrence within 5‐km grid cells located in 

the study area. The 5‐km grid was selected for the likelihood model based on acceptable levels of spatial autocor‐

relation in the reporting of koala observations in the study region. The likelihood model generates a confidence 

level (high, medium, low) associated with the probability of koalas being present and was derived from historical 

observation records of koalas and other mammals based on a 20‐year data window (1997–2017). To assess the 

consistency between participant observations and the model, cross‐tabulations between the likelihood map and 

participant observations were tabulated for the 173 grid cells that were coded based on the presence or absence 

of one or more koala observations in each cell. The phi coefficient (φ), a measure of the degree of association 

between two binary variables that ranges between +1.0 and −1.0, was calculated to provide an overall measure of 

the association between the presence and absence of cells. Fitz‐Gibbon and Morris (1987) suggest the following

(moderate association); φ ≥ 0.6 (strong association). We also cross‐tabulated the distribution of participant obser‐

10  |    

vations by cell confidence levels.

3 |  R E S U LT S

3.1 | Participant characteristics and mapping effort

The number of participants in each sample that mapped one or more locations was 454 volunteer, 103 panel, and 

35 landowner (Table 1). Conventional survey response rates could not be calculated because it is not known how 

many people received an invitation to take part in the study. However, completion rates were calculated from 

those who accessed the website and completed the survey through the mapping activity. The completion rate was 

56% for the volunteer sample, 71% for the panel sample, and 97% for the landowner sample.

Analysis  of  demographic  variables  indicates  significant  sample  bias  compared  to  the  general  population 

(i.e.,  census  data).  The  volunteer  and  landowner  participants  were  older,  while  the  panel  participants  were 

younger  than  the  general  population.  The volunteer  and  panel  participants  were  disproportionately  female, 

while the landowner participants were disproportionately male. All samples had a higher level of formal ed‐

ucation than the general population, but the volunteer sample was especially biased toward a higher level of 

formal education.

The geographic distribution of the participants in all samples deviated from the general population distribution 

by local government area. For example, participants in the Tweed local government area were over‐represented 

in the panel sample but under‐represented in the volunteer sample. Landowner participants lived in the study area 

the longest (mean 45 years) compared to volunteers (20 years) and the panel (18 years). The landowners sample 

expressed the highest self‐rated knowledge of the study area, while volunteers expressed the highest self‐rated 

knowledge of koalas. Panel participants appeared the least knowledgeable about koalas.

The greatest mapping effort was observed with volunteers, who averaged 15 markers per person (Table 1), 

taking about 40 s per marker. The least mapping effort was from the panel, where participants mapped 9 markers 

each at about 20 s per marker. Landowner mapping effort was similar to that of volunteers, averaging 14 markers 

and a clock time of over 1 min per marker. The longer average clock time for landowners can be attributed to the 

“facilitated” mode of data collection, where the interviewer recorded the map locations for the landowner.

3.2 | Sample attitudes and beliefs

All samples expressed positive attitudes toward koalas and their conservation, but volunteers expressed signifi‐

cantly more positive attitudes than the panel (Table 2). The positive attitudes of landowners toward koalas were 

similar to those of volunteers and greater than those of the panel. Volunteers and landowners considered themselves 

to be strongly environmentally oriented, significantly more than panel participants. Overall, the stronger environ‐

mental orientation and positive attitudes of volunteers manifested in a significantly higher likelihood of supporting 

koala conservation strategies (e.g., increasing habitat, preventing development, and using public money to buy 

reserves) and participating in specific activities related to koala protection (e.g., joining a community conservation 

group or advocating for government protection of koalas). Of the three samples, the panel was most likely to “do 

nothing.” As a caveat, these reported differences between samples in scores were statistically significant, but the 

differences are in fact small and do not reflect substantially different responses between the samples.

With  respect  to  the  long‐term  survival  of  the  koala,  volunteers  and  the  panel  perceived  most  threats  (e.g., 

roads/traffic,  housing  development,  tree  clearing)  to  be  significantly  greater  than  did  the  landowners.  Of  all 

threats, landowners perceived the logging of native forests to be the least threat and wild dogs to be the greatest 

threat. The panel perceived bushfire to be a significantly greater threat than did either volunteers or landowners.

3.3 | Quality of observation data

There were large differences in sample sizes, resulting in significantly fewer koala observations in the panel (179) 

and landowner (129) samples than in the volunteer sample (1,695), with the volunteer observations covering a larger 

geographic area within the study region. The nearest‐neighbor ratio is a measure of observation point dispersion. 

Ratios less than 1 indicate observation clustering, while ratios greater than 1 indicate a tendency toward observa‐

tion dispersion. The nearest‐neighbor ratios were 0.37, 0.59, and 0.25 for the volunteer, panel, and landowner sam‐

ples, respectively, indicating that koala observations were clustered in the study area. The landowner observations 

were the most clustered and the panel observations were the least clustered (Figure 1). These results highlight the

BROWN et al.14  |    

The accuracy of koala observation data was benchmarked against a koala likelihood model (Predavec et al., 

2015, with updated data from 2017) using presence/absence analysis and by examining the distribution of koala 

observations by cell confidence levels. The statistical association between volunteer observations and the likeli‐

hood model was weak (Table 3), but significant (φ = 0.25, p < 0.01). The presence/absence analysis for volunteers 

indicated 96% cell consistency (137/142) with the model where participants had observed koalas. Where partici‐

pants had not observed koalas, consistency was 19% (6/31). Overall, volunteers did not record koala observations 

in 15% (25/162) of the model cells indicating historical presence of koalas. For the volunteers, 70% of the incon‐

sistent cells were classified as low confidence in the likelihood model. In practical terms, this finding reflects pos‐

itively on the putative accuracy of participant observations. If the inconsistency in observations were associated 

with high rather than low model confidence locations, this would suggest larger error in participant observations.

The statistical association between panel observations and the likelihood model was weak (Table 3), but sig‐

nificant (φ = 0.19, p < 0.05). There was 100% consistency (59/59) where participants had observed koalas. Panel 

consistency with the model was only 10% (11/114) where participants had not observed koalas. Overall, panel 

participants did not record koala observations in 64% (103/162) of the model cells indicating historical presence 

of koalas. Of the inconsistent cells, 46% were classified as low confidence.

The statistical association between landowner observations and the likelihood model (Table 3) was the weak‐

est of the samples (φ = 0.13, p < 0.10). There was 100% consistency (34/34) where landowner participants had 

observed  koalas.  The  consistency  was  only  8%  (11/139)  where  participants  had  not  observed  koalas.  Overall, 

landowners did not identify 79% (128/162) of the model cells indicating historical presence of koalas. Where cells 

were inconsistent, 41% were classified as low confidence.

The lower spatial concurrence of panel and landowner observations with the model can largely be attributed 

to the smaller quantity of mapped koala observation data arising from the smaller size of the panel and landowner 

samples. Small sample sizes limit the geographic coverage of koala observations and thus reduce overall agree‐

ment with the model. Where the panel and landowners did record koala observations (61% and 62%, respectively), 

they were located in cells with a high confidence level compared to 49% of cells for volunteers. These findings 

allow the suggestion to be made that the quantity (i.e., too few participant observations) is a greater threat to data 

quality than the locational accuracy of the observations.

3.4 | Propensity to map by marker type

We assessed the propensity of participants to map more (or fewer) of specific types of markers by examining the 

frequency of individuals in each sample that mapped one or more markers using a chi‐square test of independ‐

ence. With respect to koala observations, volunteers were more likely to map weekly observations of koalas and 

less likely to map yearly or once observations compared to the panel (Table 4). With respect to preferences, volun‐

teers were more likely to map preferences wanting more koalas, with fewer preferences favoring tourism develop‐

ment (Table 4). Landowners were more likely to map preferences favoring both residential and tourism development. 

Landowners were also more likely to map preferences opposing prescribed fire. These propensities to map specific 

types of markers were consistent with the positive attitudes of volunteers toward koalas and the lower perceived 

threat to koalas from development among landowners.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of sampling design on the quality of spatial data in the 

context of a geographic citizen science project for koala conservation. To do this we compared three samples: 

volunteers, panel members, and landowners. Consistent with previous mapping research (Brown, 2017), we found 

that volunteer participants demonstrated greater mapping effort than an Internet panel, resulting in significantly

more spatial data, both observation and preference data. Also consistent with previous research (Zolkafli, Brown, 

& Liu, 2017), we found that a “facilitated” mode of participatory mapping with landowners generated more spatial 

data per participant than the self‐administered mode with the panel sample. Overall, the results demonstrate the 

importance  of  sampling  design  because  different  groups  within  the  target  population  contribute  different  but 

equally valid data, thereby increasing the inferential power of geographic citizen science. Specifically, the three 

samples  contributed  different  numbers  of  koala  observations,  but  showed  96%  (volunteer),  100%  (panel),  and 

100% (landowner) consistency with the model where participants had observed koalas.

4.1 | Sampling implications for spatial data quality

Spatial data quality for citizen science projects involving wildlife observations is a function of both locational ac‐

curacy and data completeness. The latter is affected by the quantity of spatial data generated, as has been noted 

previously  for  koalas  in  citizen  science  surveys  (Lunney  et  al.,  2009,  2016).  Previous  analysis  of  the  volunteer 

data  found  that  the  koala  observations  were  sufficiently  accurate  to  augment  field‐based  koala  research,  with 

the added benefit of engaging a broader public in conservation efforts (Brown et al., 2018; Predavec et al., 2016, 

BROWN et al.16  |    

2018). For geographic citizen science, the larger concern is the quantity of koala observations generated by the 

samples. The quantity of observation data from the panel was significantly less per participant than for the volun‐

teer or landowner samples. For an Internet panel to generate a similar number of koala observations as the volunteer 

sample would require more than 900 panel participants, while the landowner sample would require at least 400 

participants. Sampling designs based exclusively on an Internet panel or interviews with landowners would not 

have been feasible (insufficient number of panel members living in the study area) or cost‐effective (landowner 

interviews across a large geographic area would be particularly time‐consuming and expensive). Thus, volunteer 

sampling was a pragmatic choice for this geographic citizen science project focused on koala observations across 

a large geographic area. Indeed, one of the outstanding strengths of citizen science is its capacity to cover a wide 

area quickly, and in that context focusing on recruiting volunteer participants is the most effective.

The sample size needed to achieve acceptable observational data quality is not a statistical determination, 

but rather is guided by the sample size needed to obtain adequate geographic coverage of the study area. This 

sample size will vary based on the size of the study area and the geographic distribution of people living in the 

study area. As a general principle, the larger the study area and the more heterogeneous the spatial distribution 

of the human population, the larger the sample size needed to achieve geographic coverage, with greater re‐

cruitment effort needed for sparsely populated areas. While we considered the sample size of 450+ volunteers 

sufficient to meet a minimum threshold of observational data quality for the study area, there was still relatively 

poor geographic coverage of the hinterland in the study area, which prompted our decision to supplement the 

sample with landowners from these areas. As a sampling strategy in future geographic citizen science, we would 

suggest intentional participant recruitment in rural areas, which are unlikely to achieve enough observations 

based purely on volunteerism.

4.2 | Sample representativeness

When  a  geographic  citizen  science  project  also  contains  subjective  preference  variables,  as  in  this  study,  it  is 

possible to assess the extent to which the samples are biased, that is, unrepresentative of the population from 

which they are drawn. For example, a koala citizen science project in South Australia found that project volunteers 

were not representative of the entire South Australian population (Hollow, Roetman, Walter, & Daniels, 2015). 

Similarly, in this study, volunteers were not representative of the study area population and were biased toward 

older, highly educated females, with positive attitudes toward koalas and their conservation. They were also most 

knowledgeable about koalas. In contrast, the panel was younger, had less formal education, and was significantly 

less knowledgeable about koalas. Their attitudes toward koalas and conservation, while positive, were less posi‐

tive than those of the volunteer sample. The landowner sample represented an important perspective that was 

largely absent in the volunteer and panel samples—rural farmers who considered that they would be impacted by 

koala conservation measures involving habitat. This sample was disproportionately male, older, and had lived in 

the region the longest. Their attitudes about living near to koalas were less positive and they were less likely to 

engage in koala conservation efforts that might adversely influence their livelihoods.

4.3 | Importance of sample attitudes

The differences in attitudes among the samples are important if the data are to be used to guide conservation ef‐

forts. Clearing of koala habitat for urban or regional development is a significant threat to the viability of the koala 

population in the study area. Landowners were more likely to map spatial preferences in support of residential 

and tourism development than the volunteer or panel samples. These types of development run counter to koala 

conservation. A sampling design that is exclusively rural landowners may be biased toward more residential and 

tourism development, while an exclusive volunteer sample may be biased toward conservation action that limits 

residential and tourism development, particularly if a significant proportion of the volunteers are members of a 

BROWN et al.    |  17

conservation organization such as “Friends of the Koala” and potentially hostile to the interests of landowners. 

The panel sample may most closely approximate general public sentiment toward koala conservation activities, 

but this supposition cannot be confirmed or rejected without representative sampling of the general population.

4.4 | Combining sample responses to increase inferential power

An important question for geographic citizen science is whether spatial data from multiple sample groups can be 

combined to increase the inferential power of the spatial data. For koala observation data, the responses of sam‐

ples can be aggregated because there was no difference in locational accuracy. For preference data, the question 

of sample aggregation is less clear. For most spatial preferences, there was little difference in the propensity for 

individuals from different samples to map preferences. And yet there were a few important preference differences 

for wanting more koalas and for residential and tourism development. In identifying the location of koala conservation 

opportunities, our judgment is to keep the preference data separated by group for analysis and reporting.

A missing sampling component in this project was a random household sample of residents in the study region. 

A random household sample would be a useful addition to the sampling design to increase data completeness and 

increase the geographic representativeness of participants in the study region. And yet, the response rate would 

likely be low (i.e., around 10%) and the sample would likely be biased toward older, more formally educated male 

participants with higher incomes (Brown & Kyttä, 2014).

Based on our findings, the sampling design for geographic citizen science to inform conservation policy should 

be differentiated. For citizen science, data completeness for geographic coverage appears most important, while 

general  population  and  stakeholder  representativeness  appears  more  important  for  participatory  mapping  in‐

tended for land use planning and decision support. With careful design, sampling for citizen science and planning‐

driven participatory mapping can be combined in the same project. However, there are trade‐offs when including 

both observation and preference attributes in the same spatial survey. Including both elements increases the com‐

plexity of the survey for participants and, given that participant mapping effort appears finite regardless of the 

number of markers, response data would be spread out over more markers rather than focused on key variables. 

On the contrary, including both elements allows participants to contribute preferences about koala conservation 

even if the participant has not observed many koalas. A further rationale for including both elements is that the 

relationship between the presence of the subject wildlife species and potential actions that support or reduce 

its viability is made explicit in the mapping process, thus enhancing public education about conservation efforts.

4.5 | Approach and limitations

The  use  of  citizen  science  for  koala  surveys  has  been  a  successful  venture  in  Australia,  and  NSW  in  particular 

(Harris & Goldingay, 2003; Lunney et al., 2009, 2016; Lunney, Stalenberg, Santika, & Rhodes, 2017; Predavec et al., 

2016, 2018; Santika, McAlpine, Lunney, Wilson, & Rhodes, 2014). These studies have been able to identify trends 

in koala populations over time, reveal spatial preferences for planning, and present options for management that 

were not possible without the spatial reach and wider public participation where citizens share their knowledge 

and contribute to the koala conservation debate. With geographic citizen science, there are limitations. The first 

is spatial: with a clustering of most of the population near the coast, the hinterland is less well represented. The 

hinterland supports more landowners with 20 acres or more land. Without explicit sampling for landowners, this 

important perspective would be missed. For example, of all threats, landowners perceived the logging of native 

forests to be the least and wild dogs to be the greatest. Dogs, rather than the conspicuous koala roadkill, were 

found  to  be  the  silent  killers  during  a  3‐year  radio‐tracking  study  of  koalas  in  the  NSW  coastal  shire  of  Port 

Stephens (Lunney, Gresser, O'Neill, Matthews, & Rhodes, 2007). This finding lends support to the landowners' 

view. The panel perceived bushfire to be a significantly greater threat than either volunteers or landowners, but the 

BROWN et al.18  |    

Port Stephens koala population recovered quickly from a major fire, while being susceptible to prescribed, low‐in‐

tensity fire used as a fire management technique.

A second limitation is the proportion of state forests in the shires, and their location. This is a weak zone for 

citizen science, including volunteer sampling, as there are simply too few citizens spending extended amounts of 

time in forests, and people are more often there by day and miss the night‐time movements of koalas and the 

bellowing calls of adult males in spring (Law et al., 2018). In this regard, well‐designed field surveys are most im‐

portant. A third limitation is that caution must be taken when interpreting key threats identified by citizens which 

can potentially mislead managers to address visible threats while missing primary causes such as land clearing. The 

key result of habitat loss is a reduction in population size, but the public manifestation of the loss and fragmen‐

tation of habitat is a sick or injured koala, a roadkill, or a dog attack. Notwithstanding, there is sufficient capacity 

for ecologists and planners to see the connections and manage the land and the planning provisions accordingly.

Finally, we are well aware that the koala, being such an iconic species, is readily co‐opted to a cause and geographic 

citizen science may, intentionally or not, play a political role. One of the local causes is an anti‐logging stance, both 

logging on private native forests and state forests (i.e., commercial forests owned and managed by the state, in this 

case NSW). We are also aware of the political divisions in the communities on the far north coast of NSW, with the 

major political parties, and the Green Party, all vying for local votes in these marginal electorates. Unsurprisingly, the 

koala is being used as the flagship species to prevent logging, restore habitat, or slow vehicles on shire roads. Given 

such wide social divisions, the concept of the “general public” may not be so relevant in the far north coast of NSW. 

Sampling in this project likely identified the competing interest groups, the relative size of which is changing with the 

years—less logging, more conservation—but with solid support remaining for a sustained agricultural industry.

Previous citizen science wildlife research has not examined data quality from multiple samples having different 

origins. In this study, three sample groups produced spatially accurate observation data despite originating from 

different sources (volunteer recruitment, Internet panel, or landowner interviews). A second important finding was 

that  the  sample  groups  differed  in  some  mapped  preferences  for  land  use,  confirming  previous  findings  that 

participant characteristics (e.g., experience, knowledge, livelihood, values, and attitudes) can influence subjective 

spatial  preferences  that  are  linked  to  land  use  decisions.  Conservation  strategies  and  actions  typically  require 

commitment of public resources and support and therefore, obtaining participant representativeness of the gen‐

eral population is important for assessing the social acceptability and political viability of potential conservation 

actions.

A  key  conclusion  from  our  assessment  of  sampling  effects  on  data  quality  in  geographic  citizen  science  is 

that sampling design plays an important role in implementing and interpreting citizen science studies of wildlife. 

Sampling for wildlife distribution and sampling for the acceptability of various land uses have different, but re‐

lated,  purposes.  Whereas  citizen  observations  seek  to  augment  scientific  assessments  of  wildlife  populations, 

identifying land use preferences seeks to identify conservation opportunities and constraints that need to be rec‐

onciled with wildlife habitat. If these two research purposes are included in the same geographic citizen science 

project, the sampling design should reflect the different criteria used to assess data quality. A sound sampling de‐

sign for observation data would target a large, geographically distributed population within the study area, while 

sampling for conservation opportunity would target study area population subgroups that are representative and 

important in providing evidence of public support for conservation action.

These study findings serve to inform future geographic citizen science methods wherein: (a) sample size, not 

sample  group  per  se,  is  most  important  to  data  quality  for  observational  data;  and  (b)  sample  group  based  on 

population representativeness is important for data quality when mapping subjective spatial attributes such as 

BROWN et al.    |  19

land use preferences. Both types of data—the location of koalas and preferences for land use—are important to 

effective koala conservation outcomes.

From  a  socio‐political  perspective,  our  study  findings  are  consistent  with  the  way  that  an  iconic  species  is 

viewed in a community of diverse interests where the species becomes a visible symbol of the success (or failure) 

of government efforts at all levels (local, state, and commonwealth) to be proactive in addressing threats. The 

approach  adopted  here,  namely  identifying  sampling  effects,  enables  ecologists  and  planners  to  acknowledge 

the values and knowledge of different segments of the general population to tailor a conservation approach that 

incorporates the full range of social perspectives and land tenures that provide a greater chance for the effective‐

ness of any plan or action. We advocate incorporating an assessment of sampling effects on data quality in future 

geographic citizen science projects.

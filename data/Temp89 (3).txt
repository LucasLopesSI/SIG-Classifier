Abstract
Progress in GIScience has advanced the ability to represent and analyze view characteristics. GIS-derived
view measures requiring digital elevation surface models are used in hedonic property models to quantify
the amenity value of view for parcel sales transactions. Ideally models should represent surface elevations
that are temporally synchronized with parcel sale dates. Temporal synchronization for studies spanning
multiple years may require signiﬁcant effort. Few studies have undertaken this effort, leading us to inves-
tigate in this research the need to be temporally explicit. We evaluate two competing surface model
approaches based on: (1) a single year 2000 LiDAR surface product; and (2) annual-speciﬁc surface prod-
ucts for 1995–2002. Two competing view measures based on the different surface approaches are con-
structed for 561 parcel transactions during 1995–2002 in a coastal North Carolina county and are input
into hedonic regression models. Results showed that being temporally explicit did matter in terms of
ﬁnding signiﬁcantly different view measures but did not matter in terms of ﬁnding signiﬁcantly different
effects of view on parcel sales prices. Despite mixed results for our case study, we advise that future
research involving GIS-based view measurement should consider the spatial and temporal contexts of
study area development patterns when evaluating the need to be temporally explicit.

1 Introduction

Landscape intervisibility is a concept with wide ranging application commonly implemented
using viewshed analysis techniques using various GIS softwares (Sander 2010). Progress in
GIScience has advanced our abilities to conceptualize and represent landscape intervisibility
including development and reﬁnement of viewshed algorithms (Kim et al. 2004, Wang et al.
1996), treatment of multiple data models (De Floriano and Magillo 1994, Kidner et al. 2001,
Maloy and Dean 2001), visibility graphs (Jiang 2005, O’Sullivan and Turner 2001, Turner
et al. 2001), visualscapes (Llobera 2003), and error modeling and analysis (Fisher 1991, 1995,
Nackaerts et al. 1999).

Property valuation studies using the hedonic property model (HPM) framework (Rosen
1974) have used GIS to construct environmental amenity variables hypothesized to affect
observed sales prices (Geoghegan et al. 1997). GIS-derived view characteristics, the focus of
this research, have increasingly been used in HPM studies (Lake et al. 2000). The HPM is

based on the assumption that differences in home sales prices reﬂect the differential value of
each home’s bundle of housing attributes (e.g. square-footage, number of bedrooms, distance
from the central business district, etc.). The market price of property observed via sales trans-
actions represents the value of the collection of attributes. The hedonic price function can be
written as:

= (

P P S N E

,

,

)

(1)

where P represents a vector of observed housing sale prices, S represents a matrix of structural
characteristics (e.g. age, number of bathrooms, size), N represents neighborhood characteris-
tics (e.g. distance to market centers, school districts, socio-economic contexts), and E repre-
sents environmental characteristics which can include view attributes, amounts of open space,
or environmental quality. The hedonic framework is most often implemented using a paramet-
ric regression model utilizing parcel data represented by P, S, N, and E for each property. Mar-
ginal willingness to pay for the various structural, neighborhood, and environmental attributes
is determined by estimation and partial differentiation of the hedonic price function (Palmquist
2005).

1.1 Space and Time Considerations for View Analysis

Constructing GIS-based view measures for hedonic modeling requires consideration of the
dual roles of space and time. To measure view, a 3D surface representation of the landscape is
required. Different approaches (Maune 2010) include: (1) digital elevation model (DEM), (2)
digital terrain model (DTM), and (3) digital surface model (DSM). Generically, DEM refers to
digital topographic representation in various forms. In common practice it often refers to bare-
earth elevation z-values at regularly spaced intervals in the x and y directions and is operation-
alized within a grid or lattice data model. For this article, we refer to DEM in this latter sense.
DTMs are bare-earth representations similar to DEMs but differ by including elevations of sig-
niﬁcant topographic features such as mass points or breaklines that are irregularly spaced for
improved ﬁdelity to actual terrain relief. DSMs are similar to both DEMs and DTMs but differ
by accounting for elevations of built structures or vegetation and therefore are particularly rel-
evant for hedonic models that include view measures.

Sander and Manson (2007) investigated the effects of different surface representation
approaches in an article titled “Heights and locations of artiﬁcial structures in viewshed calcu-
lation: How close is close enough?”. They created a baseline DSM incorporating actual build-
ing footprints and heights as estimated by the actual number of stories. The baseline DSM was
assumed to be the best approximation of reality and derived view measures were compared
against measures derived from three test DSMs that alternately incorporated generalized build-
ing footprint locations (i.e. at the parcel centroid) and uniform building heights. Results
showed statistically signiﬁcant differences between parcel-level view measures between the
baseline DSM and the three test DSMs for almost all view measures. While they did not
perform hedonic modeling, results suggested the need for the more labor intensive approach of
DSM construction to ensure spatial ﬁdelity of building footprints and heights.

Our research follows Sander and Manson (2007) but differs by focusing on the effects of
temporal representation with regard to DSMs as opposed to spatial representation. Many
examples of hedonic modeling utilize parcel transactions spanning multiple years, though few
of these use GIS-derived view measures. New construction and vegetation establishment can
change over the time period of study such that for DSM construction it is relevant to also ask

how current is current enough? or how important is temporal explicitness and ﬁdelity? For
studies using transactions from a single year, this question is not relevant except for the need
ideally to use a DSM that corresponds temporally to the focal year. For studies over multiple
years, this question is relevant. A July 2012 Google Scholar search on the terms “GIS”,
“hedonic”, “viewshed”, and “view” yielded eight peer-reviewed articles (Table 1) that ana-
lyzed parcel sales spanning multiple years and used GIS-based view variables. Four of these
utilized a single date bare-earth DEM. Three articles (by the same team and for the same study
area) utilized a single date DSM accounting for built structures in 2006 but no vegetation.
Only one article (Bin et al. 2008) utilized a multi-temporal DSM accounting for built struc-
tures spanning 1995–2002 and vegetation in 2000 that enables both spatially and temporally
explicit view measures.

Bin et al. (2008) disentangled the independent effects of ocean view and location in the
ﬂood hazard zone ﬁnding a marginal willingness to pay $995 for one additional angular
degree of ocean view and $36,082 to avoid locations in the ﬂood zone. Signiﬁcant effort was
required to create temporally explicit DSMs used to construct annual-speciﬁc ocean view
measures. This research revisits this study and uses the same dataset to determine if results
differ with the use of a single-date DSM as opposed to the original multi-temporal approach.
The strategy in Bin et al. (2008) was as follows. First they constructed a DSM using LiDAR
data for the year 2000, referred to as LiDAR 2000 hereafter. Second, using data fusion
methods incorporating LiDAR 2000, cadastral information and air photos, they backcasted
and forecasted, where necessary due to new building construction, by adding or subtracting
elevation from LiDAR 2000 to create annual-speciﬁc elevation surfaces for years other than
2000. This produced a time series of DSMs for 1995–2002 yielding eight separate surfaces.
The rationale was that, for example, parcel price for a sale in 1995 would be inﬂuenced by the
view in 1995 and not the view as derived from the LiDAR 2000 surface. Last, they used GIS
to calculate a quantitative measure of ocean view for all parcels and performed hedonic mod-
eling using spatial lag regression to assess effects of view and other variables.

1.2 Does Being Temporally Explicit Matter?

With our current research, we address the importance of temporal explicitness by evaluating
differences in view measures and their regression effects for two competing DSMs approaches:
(1) the singular LiDAR 2000 surface, and (2) the eight annual-speciﬁc surfaces for 1995–2002
corresponding to parcel sale dates. Speciﬁc hypotheses are:

H1: View measures derived using annual-speciﬁc elevation surfaces differ from those derived
using LiDAR 2000.

H2: The hedonic model parameter estimate for view differs depending upon surface
approach – annual-speciﬁc vs. LiDAR 2000 – used to derive the view measure.

The logic is that, in dynamic built environments where new construction can impede prior
existing views, characterization of parcel views using multi-temporal, annual-speciﬁc elevation
surfaces is preferable. Pairwise comparison of resulting view measures will determine if statis-
tically signiﬁcant differences in view measures are obtained, depending on whether or not a
temporally explicit approach is used. Finally, we estimate hedonic price regression models
using the competing view measures and other variables to determine the degree to which the
alternative surface approaches impacts parameter estimates of view. In short, does temporal
explicitness matter?

Figure 1 Study area beach communities

2 Methods

Our study area encompasses four beach communities: Carolina Beach, Figure Eight Island,
Kure Beach, and Wrightsville Beach (Figure 1) – located along narrow barrier island or penin-
sular settings in New Hanover County, North Carolina. In recent years, property values in this
region have soared and construction projects have accelerated. Newspaper coverage reports
that mean sale prices for residential properties in Wrightsville Beach have increased 420%
from 2001 to 2005, and the number of building permits in Carolina Beach over a 24-month
period in the early 2000s exceeded the number of permits issued over the prior 20 years
(Norton 2005). Prior work by Crawford (2007) reports the development trajectory for all
study area communities from 1970 to 2000. A total of 3,059 parcels were developed during
this period with approximately 18% of this total being developed during 1996–2000. Positive
attributes associated with coastal amenities help drive this dynamic housing market. Pleasing
ocean views are hypothesized to be one such amenity that increases selling price.

2.1 Data

Parcel data were obtained from the New Hanover County government in shapeﬁle format as
polygons (Figure 2). Tabular attribute data were obtained from the tax assessor’s ofﬁce and
joined to this dataset. A GIS layer of building footprint polygons was not available. Identical
to Bin et al. (2008), all 1,075 single family residential parcels that sold during 1995–2002
were initially selected. LiDAR data used to construct view measures did not cover all parcels

so that we retained only the 561 parcel within the LiDAR covered area. Parcels outside of
LiDAR coverage were distant from the ocean leading Bin et al. (2008) to assume no ocean
view and assign these parcels a view value of zero for hedonic modeling. Our use of the 561
subset is justiﬁed due to our speciﬁc interest in evaluating the effects of different view measures
obtained from DSMs requiring LiDAR coverage. Other variables included structural informa-
tion (e.g. number of stories, square footage, number of baths, etc.) and the year built (Table 2).
LiDAR data from early August 2000 were downloaded from the NOAA Coastal Services
Center using the center’s web-based LiDAR Data Retrieval Tool (LDART) (NOAA 2008).
LDART provides capabilities to build gridded elevation surfaces using LiDAR ﬁrst return
points that are interpolated to a user-deﬁned resolution using an inverse distance weighting
algorithm. Using this tool, we constructed a ﬁrst return elevation surface with a 1.52 m (5 ft)
spatial resolution. First return data enabled representation of structures and vegetation in
2000.

Other data included a set of year 2002 true color digital orthophotos from the New
Hanover County GIS Department (Figure 2) which was important for the task of backcasting
and forecasting building footprints and associated elevations over the study period. For
example, structures built in 2001 would not be represented in the LiDAR 2000 surface so that
their footprints digitized from photo imagery coupled with building height estimates from tax
assessor data needed to be added to the original elevation product – an example of forecasting
(Figure 3). A reverse process of backcasting (i.e. building elevation removal from LiDAR
2000) applied for structures built prior to 2000.

year 2001 elevation; shoreline (white) in foreground, observer location as white spike (height exag-
gerated for readability)

2.2 Creation of Elevation Surfaces and Viewsheds

To create annual-speciﬁc elevation surfaces and ocean viewsheds, we developed an eight-step
processing algorithm implemented as a customized Arc/Info script
involving iteration
(Figure 4). Step 1 selects the parcel to be processed and its associated Sale Year attribute. Step
2 queries the parcel to determine its Sale Year, and results direct the algorithm to one of three
processing streams contained in Steps 3 and 4. For Sale Year = 2000, a temporary elevation
surface is set to the original LiDAR 2000 elevation under the assumption that this surface
adequately represents elevation conditions relevant for parcels selling in 2000. For Sale Year >
2000, a temporary elevation surface is set to the LiDAR 2000 elevation plus one or more rel-
evant building footprint elevation grids (e.g. for buildings built after the focal sale year). For
parcels selling in 2001 or 2002, the LiDAR 2000 surface does not contain elevation footprints
for structures built after 2000. Thus, elevation footprints for new buildings needed to be
added to the original LiDAR 2000 surface (e.g. forecasting). Alternatively, for Sale Year <
2000, a temporary elevation surface is set to the LiDAR 2000 elevation minus one or more

relevant building footprint elevation grids (e.g. for buildings built after the focal sale year). For
parcels selling before 2000, the LiDAR 2000 surface contains elevation footprints for struc-
tures present in 2000 that were not present during the year of sale. For these cases, elevation
footprints for selected buildings needed to be subtracted from the LiDAR 2000 (e.g. backcast-
ing). While we discuss accuracy issues and limitations of viewshed derivation later in the dis-
cussion, we note that in principle the technique of forecasting and backcasting reduces error
by representing viewshed tied to the speciﬁc time for which viewshed measurement is desired
and not the time for which data happen to be available.

Preliminary work created annual building footprint elevation grids for all structures newly
developed in each year via heads-up digitizing. It is important that all newly developed build-

ings were subject to this process and not just newly developed buildings from our sample of
561 sale parcels, since all other buildings may act as barriers to view. Building heights were
estimated from tax assessor data reporting the number of stories for each parcel’s structure.
An assumption of 3 m (10 ft) per story was uniformly applied.

Step 4 converts the parcel’s building footprint polygon to grid format and sets its elevation
to zero. This applies only to the footprint for the single parcel currently being processed and is
necessary for subsequent viewshed calculation as described below. Step 5 merges the current
parcel’s building elevation grid (whose cell values all equal zero) with the temporary elevation
surface (from Step 3) to create a ﬁnal elevation surface that is both parcel and year-speciﬁc.
The focal parcel building footprint being processed at this point has an elevation of zero to
permit viewshed calculation from its x,y centroid location as described below.

Steps 6–8 use the parcel-speciﬁc ﬁnal elevation surface to create ocean viewsheds for each
parcel. Step 6 deﬁnes a vector observation point having x,y, and z values. Horizontal position
(x,y) was deﬁned as the centroid of the building footprint polygon. The z-value was deﬁned to
be located at an elevation 3m (10 ft) below the maximum surface height of the parcel’s build-
ing. This explains the prior need in Step 4 to set building footprint elevations to zero. Not
doing so would position the observer inside the interior of the building thereby preventing the
possibility of a non-zero viewshed. In virtual digital terms, this acts to remove the building
elevation altogether and position the observer on a pedestal 3 m (10 ft) below the maximum
building height at the center of the building footprint (Figure 3).

Step 7 calculates a temporary viewshed using the observation point and ﬁnal elevation
surface. All observation points were permitted the potential of 360° horizontal and (cid:3)90° ver-
tical ﬁelds of view with potential visibility limited to a distance of 1,609 m (1 mile) from the
observation points. Viewsheds were calculated using the INTERVISIBILITY routine in the Arc/
Info GIS software to yield a binary grid of landscape visibility. The ﬁnal Step 8 used a vector
shoreline to clip the visible surface area to the ocean target area, effectively creating a ﬁnal
viewshed of ocean view.

To compare resulting annual-speciﬁc view measures with the simpler and more common
single-date approach required a set of comparison viewsheds. To do so, we implemented the
same algorithm with a difference that all parcels where channeled through the center process-
ing stream (Figure 4). Here the LiDAR 2000 surface was used for all parcels to create an alter-
native set of viewsheds from which we constructed two competing view measures described
below to test our hypotheses.

2.3 Constructing a View Measure

Viewsheds are planimetric representations of visible area and are not the same thing as quan-
titative variables measuring some attribute of view. Alternative variables can be created whose
appropriateness varies by application. Viewshed area reported in square units is a common
and easily obtained variable. Since viewsheds frequently are fragmented, second order vari-
ables include the area of the largest single patch or measures of patch size distributions. Dis-
tance bands and overlays with land cover allow for variables quantifying amounts of view by
distance and cover type. These and other view measures are described in Batty (2001),
Germino et al. (2001), Llobera (2003), Stamps (2005) and Sander and Manson (2007).

We initially utilized viewshed area; however, feedback we received suggested that its use
was not easily comprehended. For our context of ocean view, audiences tended to think in
terms of angular widths of view rather than areal amounts. This was particularly so because
the 1,609 m (1 mile) distance threshold we applied causes the potentially visible ocean area to

vary by parcel. Compared to oceanfront locations, parcels further removed from the shoreline
have a smaller target ocean area to potentially view. Related to our subsequent hedonic
models, interpretation of willingness to pay for additional angular degrees of ocean view was
more readily understood than willingness to pay for additional areal amounts. We therefore
opted for a ﬁnal measure that captures the horizontal angular scope of a parcel’s ocean view
by identifying all possible ﬁelds of view from a parcel observation point and summing their
angular widths to calculate the summed total ﬁeld of view in degrees (0°-360°).

We created our ﬁnal view measure by initially constructing circular arc segments at the
outer 1,609 m (1 mile) distance that intersected the ﬁnal viewshed, calculating the individual
arc lengths, and summing the individual arc lengths. In our case, the maximum possible
summed arc length is the circumference of the circle traced by a 1,609 m radius, or approxi-
mately 10,110 m (6.28 miles) since circumference = 2pr. Dividing the summed arc lengths by
circumference and multiplying by 360° provides the desired measure in degrees. In more
formal terms view is deﬁned by:

d

=

∑

⎛
⎜
⎝

arclength

π
r

2

⎞
⎟ ∗
⎠

°

where viewd equals the summed angular width of view in degrees at a speciﬁed distance thresh-
old d, arclength equals the length of a circular arc segment intersecting the viewshed, and r
equals the circular radius (which is identical to d). A simple interpretation is that viewd meas-
ures the proportion of the circumference contained in the viewshed multiplied by 360° to
accommodate situations with any distance d up to the limiting horizon. In our case, a views-
hed having a summed arc length of 5,055 m (3.14 miles) would have a view of 180°. Due to
the straight linear nature of the study area’s shoreline, an approximate maximum value for our
view is 180° for observation points located very near to the shoreline. Figure 5 depicts compet-
ing viewsheds for a single parcel that sold in 2001. Here it is apparent that forecasting to
account for new buildings not present in LiDAR 2000 but actually present during the 2001
sale year makes a large difference.

3 Results

3.1 Temporally Explicit vs. Single Date View Measures

AVIEW denotes the temporally explicit view measure (Table 3). LVIEW denotes the single
date measure derived from LiDAR 2000. Differences between the two measures were calcu-
lated as DIFVIEW = AVIEW - LVIEW. For 2000, AVIEW and LVIEW are identical by deﬁ-
nition. Of the 561 parcels, 346 (62%) had a non-zero AVIEW, and 97 (17%) parcels had a
difference not equal to zero. Percentages of these 97 parcels with differences not equal to zero
tended to decrease from 1995 to 1999 and increased after 2000. Excluding parcels with
AVIEW equal to zero to focus attention on just those parcels with an ocean view results in a
similar trend (Table 3, column 5), although percentages are necessarily higher. These results
suggest that using annual-speciﬁc surfaces as opposed to uniformly applying the LiDAR 2000
surface produces increasingly divergent view measures with greater temporal distance from the
year 2000, although this interpretation is stronger for the years prior to 2000.

Tables 4–6 provide quantitative information on DIFVIEW, the actual difference magni-
tudes obtained using the two approaches. Table 4 includes all 561 parcels. Table 5 limits
parcels to just those 346 having a non-zero AVIEW. Table 6 further limits parcels to the 97

having a non-zero AVIEW that differed from LVIEW. In Tables 4 and 5, all differences for
1995–1999 are greater than or equal to zero, because obstructing structures not actually
present in 1995–1999 but present in LiDAR 2000 have been removed thereby affording
greater ﬁelds of view for some parcels. Alternatively, differences for 2001–2002 are less than
or equal to zero because structures present in 2001–2002 but not present in LiDAR 2000 have
been added to LiDAR 2000 and act as barriers to views for some parcels. An identical inter-
pretation applies to Table 6, although there can be no differences equal to zero due to the
inclusion of only parcels where DIFVIEW (cid:2) 0.

Due to non-normal distributions, one sample Wilcoxon signed rank tests were run to
determine if mean differences were either greater than or less than zero depending on the year.
In every case, means were greater than or less than zero at high signiﬁcance levels (Tables 4
and 5). We describe Table 4 results to emphasize differences for just those parcels actually

having a non-zero ocean view using the annual-speciﬁc surface. Mean differences were greatest
in 1995 for years preceding 2000 and in 2002 for years succeeding 2000 again suggesting
larger impacts with increasing temporal distance from the year 2000. Similar results are dem-
onstrated in Table 6 for the subsetted 97 parcels having a non-zero AVIEW that differed from
LVIEW, although the mean differences are necessarily greater than those in Table 5. We note
that it is meaningless to perform Wilcoxon tests to determine if mean differences are different
than zero for these parcels (Table 6) since, by deﬁnition, they exclude cases with a difference of
zero. For 97 of the total 561 parcels (17%) where using the annual-speciﬁc surface actually
made a difference, the mean difference was 12.5 degrees of view.

These results provide evidence for evaluating Hypothesis 1. View measures derived using
annual-speciﬁc elevation surfaces were signiﬁcantly different from those derived using the
LiDAR 2000 surface. Simple inspection suggests that magnitudes of differences for view meas-
ures were in most cases greater for years more distant from 2000, although this trend was not
perfect.

3.2 Sensitivity of Regression Parameter Estimates of View

lag regression with the GeoDa software
We estimate four different models using spatial
(Anselin et al. 2005) that varied depending on the observations included and the source of
view measure data (Table 7). The model functional form is:

y

=

λ

+
W X
y

β ε
+

(3)

where y is a vector of observations for the dependent variable represented as the natural log
transformed sales price, and Wy is the spatially lagged dependent variable using an inverse dis-
tance weights matrix W. X is a matrix of observations for the explanatory variables, b is a vector
of parameter estimates, and e is a vector of independent and identically distributed error terms.
The spatial autocorrelation coefﬁcient l quantiﬁes the magnitude and direction of spatial
dependence and is interpreted as the inﬂuence of nearby sales prices on the focal sales price.

In Models (1) and (2), we include all observations in our sample. Model (1) uses the view
measures based on the single date LiDAR 2000 surface (LVIEW). Model (2) uses the view

On the Importance of Time for GIS View Measures

measures based on the annual-speciﬁc elevation surfaces (AVIEW). In Models (3) and (4) we
use the parcels with non-zero, annual-speciﬁc views. Our ﬁndings address Hypothesis 2 and
indicate that the effects of view on property values are did not differ when using annual-
speciﬁc (AVIEW) versus LiDAR 2000 elevation surfaces (LVIEW). For Models (1) and (2), we
cannot reject the hypothesis that the estimated coefﬁcient of view (0.003414) based on LiDAR
2000 and the coefﬁcient (0.003399) based on annualized surfaces are not statistically different
(t-value=0.34). We obtain similar results from Models (3) and (4). Model (1) results imply
that, for an average valued house ($365,578), a one degree increase in ocean view would raise
the sales price by approximately $1,288. While it is evident that there is a positive association
between view and property value, results do not support our Hypothesis 2 that the effects
of view on sales price are sensitive to the temporal synchronization of the input elevation
surfaces.

Other amenity variables such as distance to nearest beach and dummy variables for sound
frontage have expected signs and are statistically signiﬁcant at the 95% conﬁdence level. Loca-
tion within the ﬂood risk zone lowers property value by approximately 22.4%. Results indi-
cate that most structural and neighborhood characteristics have expected signs that are stable
across speciﬁcations.

4 Discussion

Focusing on the spatial domain, Sander and Manson (2007) contrasted their results with
speculation by Lake et al. (2000) who suggested that locations and shapes of buildings have
greater inﬂuence on viewshed accuracy than building heights so that the extra effort required
to obtain accurate building heights may not be necessary. Sander and Manson (2007) found
that both location and height were important, revealing, for their study area, the need to
obtain accurate building heights or at least plausible estimates based on story heights. Our
work extends this theme in a different direction by focusing on the temporal domain. Like
Sander and Manson (2007), we utilize building footprints and plausible height estimates. Our
use of edited LiDAR data adds the inﬂuences of annual-speciﬁc building structures and vegeta-
tion present in 2000. Vegetation change therefore was not temporally explicit; however, we
suspect the inﬂuence of such change over our eight year period to be minimal.

Our main contribution was to assess the need for temporal data ﬁdelity by creating
surface elevations speciﬁc to each year of parcel sales and creating parcel-level view measures
temporally synchronized to the sale year. Did this effort, undertaken to be temporally explicit,
pay off? Our case study results showed that statistically signiﬁcant differences in view were
present with the use of multi-temporal versus single-date elevation surfaces. Despite achieving
statistical signiﬁcance, mean difference magnitudes were relatively small, with a mean of 2.2
degrees for all 561 parcels and 12.5 degrees for the 97 parcels having a non-zero difference
(maximum difference was 73.1 degrees). This suggests that for a relatively small number of
cases in critical locations, the use of annual-speciﬁc elevation surfaces was important to
achieve the most accurate view estimates. However, this difference was not a “difference with
a difference” when inserting the two different view measures into competing hedonic regres-
sion models. Results did not support the hypothesis of signiﬁcant differences for view param-
eter estimates. For our case study, we must conclude that the substantial efforts to create
temporally explicit view measures in Bin et al. (2008) did not pay off as Bin et al. could have
used the LiDAR 2000 elevation surface for all sale years with no detrimental effect. We
caution, however, that our results do not universally invalidate the need for temporally explicit
measures of view amenities.

Possible explanations for temporal insensitivity of view in our hedonic models is unob-
served variation and knowledge regarding observer locations such as rooftop or adjoining
decks, window placement, and the potential for multiple parcel observation points that collec-
tively can introduce error. In principle, error related to these factors can be estimated with
costly on site ﬁeldwork. Other error may be related to the use of an inverse distance weighting
algorithm to produce the original LiDAR elevation surface. This acts to taper elevation gradi-
ents rather than producing crisp, discrete edges that more faithfully represent building struc-
tures – a limitation that may be overcome with building extraction algorithms (Gamba and
Houshmand 2000, Sander and Manson 2007). Annual LiDAR would remove the need for
elevation backcasting and forecasting. However, the relatively high price makes annual LiDAR
problematic for most jurisdictions that develop elevation products despite price decreases in
recent years. The development of 3D GIS and 3D virtual built environments also offers
promise for improved surface representation (Yasumoto et al. 2011) although at this point 3D
data products are uncommon for the vast majority of jurisdictions and, if present, the reliabil-
ity of temporal currency remains an issue.

5 Conclusions

Our approach raises important issues on the temporal sensitivity of viewsheds, related view
measures, and their impacts on statistical modeling which should be further investigated.

Perhaps the most important implication of our results is the need for richer consideration
of spatial and historical contexts. Based on our ﬁndings, we suspect that other hedonic studies
with multi-year transactions (Table 1) did not suffer due to not treating temporal issues of
view measurement. We do not make a call for all hedonic studies to go to the lengths of Bin
et al. (2008) in constructing temporally explicit view measures but suggest the need for
researchers to seriously consider the development context of selected study areas as some may
require the need to be temporally explicit. Imagining an S-shaped logistic curve common to
spatial growth processes, we speculate that both view and its hedonic parameter estimates vary
depending on the speciﬁc period and spatial conﬁguration of development. Intuitively, the ﬁrst
house established will generally have the better view compared to the second, third, etc. house
built nearby. These subsequent houses will act to impede view for the initial house and other
houses so that initially view will be relatively dynamic. At the terminal end of the logistic curve
such as dense urban settings with complete build out, view will no longer be dynamic and sta-
bilizes with the exception of minor changes due to redevelopment. New parcel development at
the urban fringe will likely be in a period where view is dynamic until the development frontier
advances. In this way, view and view effects can be conceived as a complex system involving
multiple interacting parts (i.e. many buildings and many homebuyers with varying amenity
preferences) where aggregate view characteristics and the effects of view on parcel sales price
emerge dynamically varying over time and space. It will likely be difﬁcult to observe these
complex system dynamics using traditional regression approaches, although multi-temporal
approaches combined with geographically weighted regression to identify temporal and spatial
variation of view and its effects is one possible approach. In addition, agent-based models and
simulations such as that by Yin and Muller (2007) offer an alternative approach to the topic of
view as a complex system.

In conclusion, our analysis of view and its effect on hedonic property models showed that
being temporally explicit did matter in terms of ﬁnding signiﬁcantly different view measures
but did not matter in terms of ﬁnding signiﬁcantly different effects of view on parcel sales

prices. Our study is the ﬁrst to systematically evaluate the temporal nature of view and view
effects. In doing so, it is in step with advances in GIScience that more rigorously investigate
both the spatial and temporal nature of GIS-based representations of reality (Peuquet 2002,
Yuan 2008) to which our work adds the topic of view.

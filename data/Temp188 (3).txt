Abstract. The organizational value of GIS has been studied in several ways,
including their use as decision support systems and their potential as the inte-
grating backbones for the organizational information systems. A valuable new
perspective emerges when GIS are considered as a means for enhancing organiza-
tional learning (OL). OL refers to the learning activities of individuals and groups
within an organization, especially with respect to the competitive environment,
the state of the organizational system and the products and processes of the
organization. GIS can in(cid:143) uence the way in which OL occurs. GIS can also aŒect
to what extent OL occurs. A model is developed to assess the value of GIS for
OL. An evaluation of GIS based on this model shows that GIS oŒer, in varying
degrees, facilities and conceptions to enhance OL. However, GIS lack speci(cid:142) c
facilities attuned to the requirements of OL, such as speci(cid:142) c querying functions
and group-based facilities for dealing with con(cid:143) icting interpretations. An empirical
case study of an environmental consultancy (cid:142) rm is presented to support the
argument.

1.

Introduction
A generally accepted assertion—some would call it fashionable or even cliche´—
is that the ever increasing turbulence in their competitive environment forces both
commercial and non-commercial organizations into an almost continuous process
of adaptation (Morgan 1986, 1997, Senge 1990, Helleloid and Simonin 1994). Perhaps
somewhat less trite is the assertion that this alleged need for continuous adaptation
involves more than just (cid:142) nding the adequate reactions to actual or projected changes
outside the organization. It also implies the need to consider or reconsider what the
organization itself stands for. The question of how the organization is conceived and
how its environment is understood are inextricably linked. Neither of these concep-
tions exists in its own right. Adaptation involves adjusting the self-conception of
the organization to how it conceives its environment, and vice versa. In other
words, the core activity for organizations is constructing and matching two (cid:142) rmly
interrelated mental models, one of the organization and one of its environment.

GIS may aŒect the setting for reconsidering and reconstructing the two classes
of mental models in various ways. If GIS is used extensively within an organization,
this almost inevitably aŒects the competencies of the organization as a whole. It
aŒects how the organization conceives itself and its products, and how it will advertise

itself to its customers. For instance, after introducing GIS, a consultancy (cid:142) rm may
present part of its services as interactive GIS maps on the Internet (Harder 1997: 85
Œ.) or as a spatial database with a dedicated user interface. GIS also aŒects what the
organization sees as its environment, whom it considers its potential partners and
competitors, and what its substitute products are. For instance, an electricity provider
may turn to GIS as a lever for co-operation with other utility (cid:142) rms in the same
district. Thus it could provide, through GIS, a common interface for discussing and
linking water, electricity and gas related issues with their clients. GIS also provides
means to facilitate the process of building the mental models referred to, such as
scanning the environment and monitoring one’s own organization. GIS may, for
example, provide tools for detecting regional trends in current or prospective markets
(Obermeyer and Pinto 1994, Chapter 9).

The process of actively reconsidering the relation between how an organization
conceives itself and its competitive or economic environment is commonly discussed
in the literature under the heading of organizationa l learning (OL). Since GIS oŒer
an integrated package of speci(cid:142) c tools that relate to the broad spectrum of aspects
associated with ongoing organizationa l adaptation, trying to establish the relations
between GIS and OL seems a logical research goal. Linking GIS and OL is not a
matter of purely academic interest. In a study comparing the introduction of GIS in
two counties, Robey and Sahay (1996) established that the concept of OL provides
the appropriate focus for distinguishing success and failure of GIS introduction, and
that it oŒers a logical explanation for the associated organizationa l transformation .
On the basis of this study, which follows a more traditional IT assessment paradigm,
they suggest that, when studying the introduction of GIS, ‘the theoretical perspective
of organizationa l learning might pro(cid:142) tably be exploited in future research on the
transformation s of organizations’ (Robey and Sahay 1996, 107). An OL perspective
on GIS thus appears critical for understanding and directing the GIS implementation
process. As will be argued below, it also appears important for appreciating more
fully ‘what GIS is’ and for conceiving the functionalities GIS should oŒer.

The cause for linking GIS-related competencies (at the organizationa l and
individual levels) and ongoing organizationa l adaptation seems therefore justi(cid:142) ed.
However, it should also be noted that a systematic attempt to address this link in
the GIS literature is lacking. Alternative perspectives on the assessment of the
organizationa l value of GIS have received substantiall y more attention. The most
popular of these alternative perspectives is probably the approach to assessing GIS
as decision support systems (DSS). Some authors even assert that GIS are ultimately
a technology for supporting spatial decisions (Cowen 1988, Grupe 1990, Densham
1991, Wilson 1994, Dobson 1997, Dennis and Carte 1998, O’Looney and Garson
1998 ). Grimshaw (1994, 26), for instance, simply de(cid:142) nes GIS as a decision support
system: ‘A geographical information system is a group of procedures . . . to support
the decision-making activities of the organization’. However, the DSS perspective
on GIS does not provide the paramount touchstone for attuning the conception and
design of GIS to their use within organizations. The OL perspective provides a
diŒerent, and in several situations more suitable way of looking at the organizationa l
merits and pitfalls associated with GIS introduction and use. OL is diŒerent from
organizationa l decision-making for various reasons. One reason is that OL has a
distinct subject characterized by its broad, integrative nature. Also, as a task, OL is
diŒerent as it belongs in the ‘generate’ and ‘resolve’ quadrants of McGrath’s task
circumplex, whereas decision-making has more a(cid:141) nity with the ‘choose’ or ‘execute’

quadrants (Hollingshead and McGrath 1995, 91). Furthermore, diŒerences occur
because learning, which ideally is continuous and unprovoked, is unlike decision-
making, which is, at least partially, of a discontinuous and directed nature as it is
focused on discrete events (the decisions to be taken). When looking at GIS from
an OL perspective, the picture of the value of GIS is therefore almost inevitably
diŒerent compared to when GIS are valued as DSS. The main advantage of an OL
perspective on GIS compared to other perspectives is that it provides a focus on the
organization as a whole instead of on isolated aspects of work that are aŒected by
GIS use. In situations where such an integral perspective on GIS is called for, as is
the case when studying the GIS implementation process (Robey and Sahay 1996)
or the overall organizationa l impact of GIS, an OL perspective will prove valuable.
It may help avoid that while highlighting local advantage s—e.g. individuals working
better because of GIS—global disadvantage s are overlooked—e.g. the organization
functioning worse because its competencies are not attuned to GIS use.

The relation between OL and GIS is a multifaceted one. Reaching a full under-
standing of this relation is beyond the scope of this article. Its aim, more modest, is
to provide the fundamental building blocks of an OL perspective on GIS. The
objective of this article is twofold: (cid:142) rstly, it develops a model for assessing the relation
between GIS-related competencies and OL. The term ‘competencies’ is used here to
refer to two distinct issues. GIS, when properly or competently used, may oŒer tools
for OL-relevant functions (such as scanning the environment) . Also, using GIS may
aŒect what the organization stands for (what its core competence is) and, con-
sequently, what its environment looks like. Secondly, based on this model, the article
aims to address the question how well the current GIS conceptions and tools are
attuned to OL. Before considering the relation between OL and GIS, the two
elements constituting the relation have to be de(cid:142) ned (cid:142) rst. The next section discusses
one of these elements, namely the concept of OL. As to GIS, the other element, a
broad de(cid:142) nition is adopted here in which GIS is used as an umbrella term to cover
various types of computer systems dealing with spatial data. For the discussion there
is no need to distinguish between such GIS subforms as ‘View GIS’, ‘Consumer GIS’,
‘Desktop Mapping’, ‘Desktop GIS’, ‘Professional GIS’, or ‘Workstation GIS’ (ESRI
1996 ). All these types of applications are treated as manifestations of an overarching
GIS conception.

2. Organizationa l learning

What is organizationa l learning (OL)? A generally accepted de(cid:142) nition of OL is
lacking, although myriad de(cid:142) nitions of OL can readily be found that together
constitute a veritable Tower of Babel. Two important sources for this confusion of
tongues can be identi(cid:142) ed. Firstly, several independent traditions have developed
their own perspectives and conceptual frameworks concerning OL, which appear
hardly commensurable with those of the other traditions (e.g. the ‘systems theoretical
school’, the ‘organizationa l learning school’, and the ‘strategic learning school’ distin-
guished by Johannessen 1995). Discussions on OL have remained largely within the
boundaries of these individual traditions, as is re(cid:143) ected in Huber’s complaint about
‘the general lack of cumulative work and the lack of synthesis of work from diŒerent
research groups’ (Huber 1991, 90). Secondly, multiple disciplines have claimed OL
as part of their subject (including psychology, industrial economy, management
theory, educational studies, etc.). This has led to a further divergence of ideas since,

as Dodgson (1993, 376) notes,
what learning is, let alone agreement between disciplines’.

‘there is rarely agreement within disciplines as to

In spite of the many diŒerent perspectives on OL, a certain undercurrent can be
detected in the discussions on the subject. This undercurrent derives from the meta-
phorical nature of the concept (Morgan 1986, Argyris and Scho¨ n 1978, Pedler et al.
1989 ). In the genuine meaning of the word, only individuals are capable of learning.
If questions are raised concerning the learning capacities of groups or whole organiza-
tions, the concept of learning is used in a derived sense. Three important observations
can be made based on the recognition of the metaphorical nature of OL. Firstly, the
concept of OL refers to a learning subject. It therefore calls for a conception of the
organization (or part of the organization or a network of organizations) as a type
of wholeness or system. Secondly, and following from the (cid:142) rst observation, OL
presumes the distinction and speci(cid:142) cation of the economic or competitive environ-
ment of the learning subject. As described in the introductory section, OL addresses
the question how the adaptation of the organization (as a whole) to its economic
environment and vice versa can be conceived. OL is about understanding and
reconsidering what the organization is in relation to its environment. Thirdly, since
only individuals can truly be said to learn, an important (cid:142) eld of tension to be
addressed in OL studies concerns how individual learning eŒorts may in(cid:143) uence each
other. OL is essentially about ‘learning by individuals in groups’.

3. The occurrence and types of OL

Of the three observations made above, the (cid:142) rst two (concerning a learning subject
and a competitive environment ) relate to the occurrence of OL. The standpoint
taken here, induced by the metaphorical character of OL, is that not all learning
within an organization is automatically designated OL. Clearly the picture here is
not black-and-white. To state that learning either is or is not OL seems hard to
sustain. A more accurate description asserts that various learning activities and
processes within the organization may contribute, to a greater or lesser degree, to
the occurrence of OL. To discern diŒerent types of OL, we will start from the
standard system theoretical conception of an organization as a bounded system
operating within an environment and transforming input into output (Forrester
1968, Flood and Jackson 1991). On the basis of this conception, we may distinguish
four elements in the object of OL: (cid:142) rstly, an organization may learn about its
products or services (its output); secondly, it may learn about the transformation
tasks and processes involved in producing these (the transformation of the input);
thirdly, it may learn about the state of the organizationa l system (organizational
workforce, characteristics of the workforce, etc.); and fourthly, it may learn about
the environment of the system (customers, competitors, etc.). Figure 1 shows these
four elements in the object of OL, or types of OL, in boxes A to D.

A further delineation of the types of learning activities that make up OL can be
given by means of the well-known distinction between single-loop and double-loop
learning (Argyris and Scho¨n 1974). Single-loop learning occurs ‘when the error
detected permits an organization to carry on its present policies or achieve its present
objectives’ (Argyris and Scho¨ n 1974: 2; single-loop learning is also called ‘Learning
I’ by Bateson 1972, ‘lower level learning’ by Fiol and Lyles 1985, ‘adaptive learning’
by Senge 1990 and ‘tactical
learning’ by Dodgson 1991). Double-loop learning
‘occurs when error is detected and corrected in ways that involve the modi(cid:142) cation
of an organization’s underlying norms, policies and objectives’ (Argyris and Scho¨ n

377

Figure 1. Types of organizational learning.

1974: 3; double-loop learning is also called ‘Learning II’ by Bateson 1972, ‘higher
level learning’ by Fiol and Lyles 1985,
‘generative learning’ by Senge 1990 and
‘strategic learning’ by Dodgson 1991). Single-loop learning forms an important
element of OL, but double-loop learning is even more relevant to OL. Reassessing
the relation between an organization and its environment, which constitutes the core
of OL, presumes an active re(cid:143) ection on current practices, and thus presumes
double-loop learning.

The combination of the distinctions made between the four types in (cid:142) gure 1 and
between single-loop versus double-loop learning, may further our understanding of
the diŒerent types and gradations of OL. This combination is open to misinterpreta-
tion. Wiig (1993) and Van der Spek and Spijkervet (1997 ) associate learning activities
in boxes A and B (learning about products/services and tasks/transformation pro-
cesses) with single-loop learning, and learning in boxes C and D (learning about the
system and its environment ) with double-loop learning. A more careful consideration
of both distinctions, however, learns that these are, to a certain degree, independent
of each other. Learning within each of the boxes A to D may be either single-loop
(if the current state of the object in the respective box is not reconsidered) or double-
loop (if the norms and objectives are questioned). For instance, an organization may
learn about its environment without challenging the validity of its current mental
model of the environment, thus engaging in single-loop OL. It may also reconsider
its environment with the use of the norms underlying its current conception, which
will result in double-loop OL. However, both distinctions do not just represent
independent dimensions, their mutual relations are somewhat more complex (and
interesting). Within each of the four boxes, the norms, objectives, etc. that form the
basis for double-loop learning come from the other three boxes. For instance, double-
loop learning about the tasks and transformation processes ( box B) may involve
reconsidering whether the norms underlying these are eŒective for producing the
appropriate current or conceivable products and services (box A). It may also involve
rethinking whether they are aligned with the current or conceivable state of the

system (work routines etc., box C). Finally, it may concern re-examining whether
they are in line with the current or conceivable conception of the environment
( box D). Figure 2 shows these relations.

The links between the four types of OL in boxes A to D that double-loop learning
introduces, shows that OL does not refer to isolated activities, but to activities that
should be related to each other. The concept of a ‘learning chain’ may be introduced
to further emphasize this need of integration. Two such chains may be discerned
(see (cid:142) gure 1). One chain marks the translation of altered intelligence about the
environment into new objectives, new processes and new products. A second chain
re(cid:143) ects that rethinking the product and processes may lead to a diŒerent perspective
on what constitutes the environment of the organization. Particularly these two OL
chains de(cid:142) ne the essence of OL, as they represent the integrative perspective OL
intends to introduce (cf. Dodgson 1993 ). The concepts of single-loop learning (learn-
ing within boxes A to D), double-loop learning ( learning across boxes A to D) and
learning chains (combining single-loop and double-loop learning within and across
boxes A to D) represent increasing gradations of OL. An organization engaging only
in single-loop learning is much less of a learning organization than one whose
learning chains are operating eŒectively. In this sense, there is a clear connection
between what learning is about (the objects or types of OL ) and the gradation.

4. The degree of OL

The third observation related to the metaphorical character of OL, i.e. the one
concerning the tension between individual and group learning, further speci(cid:142) es the
notion of diŒerences in the degrees of OL. How eŒective OL is, relates to how deeply
OL pervades the organization and how well the organization succeeds in stimulating
and co-ordinating individual learning eŒorts. A useful elaboration of the degree of
OL can be found in the notions of breadth, elaborateness, and thoroughness of OL,
as introduced by Huber (1991; see (cid:142) gure 3). Huber argues that the existence of OL
refers to the question whether any organizationa l unit acquires knowledge that it
recognizes as potential useful for the organization (this de(cid:142) nes the object of OL as
described above). As to the breadth of OL, Huber asserts that ‘more OL occurs when
more of the organization’s components obtain this knowledge and recognize it as
potentially useful’ (Huber 1991, 90). An organization shows a higher degree of OL
if learning is not just con(cid:142) ned to management circles or individual departments
(such as the Research and Development department or the Business Intelligence
function), but pervades the organization. The more departments, groups and indi-
viduals learn, the broader OL is. According to Huber, the elaborateness of OL is

addressed by the assertion that ‘more OL occurs when more and more varied
interpretations are developed’ (Huber 1991, 90). OL is about considering and recon-
sidering mental models of the organization and its environment. An organization
shows a higher degree of OL if its learning subjects do not converge on one possible
mental model, but conceive of and build on several mental models. The more an
organization succeeds in achieving variation in its relevant conceptions (of itself and
its environment) , the more elaborate its OL is. Finally, Huber argues that ‘more OL
occurs when more organizationa l units develop comprehensions of the various
learning; Huber 1991, 90). An organization
interpretations’ (the thoroughness of
shows a higher degree of OL if it manages to confront and combine the various
mental models and conceptions developed by its members and departments. The
more the outcomes of OL at one place are linked to those at other places, the more
thorough OL becomes.

5. A model for linking GIS and organizational learning

When linking GIS to OL, it is presumed that the role of GIS vis-a`-vis the types
of OL and vis-a`-vis the factors determining the degree of OL has been established.
GIS may aŒect OL in several ways. The presence of GIS may lead to OL. The fact
that various departments use GIS, even if they use it for diŒerent purposes and in
diŒerent ways, may create links between people that would perhaps never have met
otherwise. The introduction of GIS may lead to the establishment of discussion
groups dealing with conceptual or data issues of GIS, which may expand their
discussions into areas concerning the organizationa l value of GIS and other links
between various departments. Most of the examples of how GIS and OL may be
linked given by Robey and Sahay (1996 ), inducing these authors to propose an OL
perspective on GIS-related transformation processes, fall in this class. For example,
they discuss the acquisition and distribution of knowledge about GIS in relation to
OL. The potential roles of GIS go beyond the fact that their mere introduction
may remove barriers to OL or even induce OL. GIS oŒer standard functions that
may be relevant to OL. For instance, GIS oŒer tools for performing a market analysis
that may result in a new or adapted mental model of the organization (cf. Obermeyer
and Pinto 1994, Chapter 9). GIS may also oŒer facilities for building a corporate
database, which may become part of the organizationa l memory. Thus GIS may
provide the means for retaining knowledge and, consequently, for improving OL in
future settings.

These two roles of GIS in OL, their introduction and use bringing people
together, and the presence of standard GIS functions that are relevant to OL,

P. H. J. Hendriks

represent increasingly ambitious goals with respect to the design of GIS. These two
levels will be labelled levels one and two, at which GIS and OL can be linked. At
both levels current implementations of GIS are taken as the starting point. These
levels concern the assessment as to how the presence (level one) and facilities (level
two) of GIS may in(cid:143) uence OL. GIS may also play roles based on functions that are
more directly linked to OL than the standard GIS functions. These roles de(cid:142) ne two
additional
levels. Firstly ( level three), GIS may oŒer tools for providing meta-
information about situations in which OL occurs. Functions may be introduced to
provide the means for tracing which GIS-based market analyses were performed by
various subjects (individuals, departments, etc.) and which steps were taken in these
analyses. Secondly (level four), GIS may oŒer tools that direct the activities that
make up OL (as opposed to level two, where they merely support these). For instance,
one may conceive of a GIS that oŒers functions for constructing and adapting a
model of the organization (5 double-loop learning about the state of the system; box
C in (cid:142) gure 1) as a strongly suggested analysis step after performing an environmental
analysis (5
single-loop or double-loop learning about the environment of the system;
box D in (cid:142) gure 1). These two steps then form part of learning chain two identi(cid:142) ed
in (cid:142) gure 1; GIS thus ‘forces’ the combination of individual learning activities into
the learning chain. Figure 4 summarizes the four levels at which GIS and OL may
be linked.

The model for linking GIS to OL proposed here is based on the combination of
the three dimensions discussed above: when and in which types or forms does OL
occur?, what determines the degree of OL?, and what are the potential roles of GIS
with respect to OL? Combining these three dimensions provides the outline of the
model for linking GIS and OL as developed here (see (cid:142) gure 5). The (cid:142) rst dimension,
the x-axis in the (cid:142) gure, refers to the types of OL as described in (cid:142) gures 1 and 2. The
second dimension, the y-axis, addresses the roles of GIS as elaborated in (cid:142) gure 4.
The third dimension, the z-axis in the model, re(cid:143) ects the variations in degree of OL
as depicted in (cid:142) gure 3. The model includes the core dimensions and central variables
to be addressed when linking GIS and OL. However, it is somewhat incomplete for

Figure 5. Outline of a model for linking GIS and organizational learning.

it leaves out certain contingencies that may aŒect how GIS furthers or hinders OL
in an individual organization. These contingencies include the speci(cid:142) c type of GIS
used, the types of applications for which GIS is utilized and the type of organization.
For instance, a utility (cid:142) rm using GIS to manage its networks of cables and pipes
(cid:142) nds itself in a completely diŒerent situation than a consultancy (cid:142) rm using GIS
primarily as a research tool. For both (cid:142) rms all three dimensions in the model are
essential for assessing the OL value of their GIS; how to crystallize these dimensions
in both (cid:142) rms is likely to diŒer.

6. Applications of the model

The model for linking GIS and OL presented above may be used in several ways.
When used for individual organizations, it may provide the yardstick for assessing
the breadth and depth of OL and GIS support for OL both prospectively and
retrospectively. Possible uses of the model include normative applications (e.g. ‘How
should we develop our GIS policy with respect to OL?’), descriptive applications
(e.g. ‘Which areas of current GIS use are related to OL?’) and evaluative applications
(e.g. ‘Does our use of GIS further or frustrate OL?’). Each of these possible applica-
tions asks for a speci(cid:142) c elaboration. A full exploration of these diŒerent uses and
their elaborations is beyond the scope of this article. Here, we will only discuss the
framework in a descriptive and evaluative sense, mainly for the purpose of furthering
the understanding of the model as such. Figure 6, which elaborates the framework
of (cid:142) gure 5 as a three-dimensional matrix, is presented to provide structure to the
discussion. The six columns represent the diŒerent types of OL (four single-loop and
double-loop learning activities, two learning chains). The four rows represent the
four levels in the potential roles of GIS in relation to OL. The three layers represent
the concepts contributing to the degree of OL: the breadth, elaborateness, and
thoroughness of OL. The individual cells in the matrix provide the focal points for
linking GIS to OL. The discussion below uses these focal points in two ways. Firstly,

Figure 6. A matrix representation of the model in (cid:142) gure 5.

it presents a case study of an organization to describe possible roles of GIS with
respect to OL. Secondly, it aims to assess how the functionalities of mainstream GIS
are attuned to the support of OL. In other words, the question is which cells in
(cid:142) gure 6 can be coloured with commonplace GIS functionality and which cells remain
grey areas. The primary goal of these exercises is to illustrate the model; no systematic
and complete evaluation of all types of GIS is intended.

The case study, used to provide an illustration of the framework, concerns an
international environmental consultancy (cid:142) rm, specialized in civil engineering related
projects. The spatial component is important in practically every project the (cid:142) rm
engages in. How serious, for instance, ground pollution in a speci(cid:142) c location is,
always depends on the presence or absence of related activities or phenomena in
the vicinity (e.g. ground water). Insight into spatial characteristics and relations is
therefore a crucial element in the knowledge of the environmental engineers employed
by the (cid:142) rm. The importance of the spatial element in their object of study is also
re(cid:143) ected by the fact that most of the information systems used for supporting the
primary process involve spatial data. This holds true for the extensive databases
with environmental data, and also for the automated programs running advanced
explanation, exploration or simulation models. Also, most reports include maps
presenting the research outcomes. At the time of the study, the (cid:142) rm used various
isolated GIS, ranging from View GIS and Desktop Mapping GIS to Workstation
GIS (ESRI 1996). The data for the case study were collected as part of a project

aimed at rede(cid:142) ning the information policy of the (cid:142) rm in question. Interviews with
the managers responsible for the information policy were held to assess the role of
GIS in relation to OL in the (cid:142) rm. The relation between GIS and OL was discussed
in two respects. First, the interviewees were asked to assess how GIS supported OL
at the time of the interview. Next, they were asked to evaluate from the OL perspective
the plans concerning GIS laid down in the outline of a new information policy that
was available at that time. The interviews were based on a mix of closed and open
questions. As a starting point for each stage of the interview, a set of statements was
presented, describing the state of OL in each individual cell of the matrix. These
statements were then used as the starting points for an open discussion.

The next sections will discuss the application of the framework on a layer-by-
layer basis, that is, by addressing the concepts of the breadth, elaborateness, and
thoroughness of OL successively. For each of these constituents of the degree of OL
the discussion is ordered as follows. Firstly, the speci(cid:142) c OL perspective on GIS that
each of these concepts introduces is discussed at a general level. Secondly, a selection
of the results of the case study is presented, ordered by the framework (see tables 1
and 2 that present elaborated versions of two layers in (cid:142) gure 6). Thirdly, the question
as to whether, and to which degree, an OL focus is present in current GIS conceptions
will be addressed. This part of the discussion only deals with levels two to four of
the possible OL roles of GIS (the y-dimension in the model). The goal at the (cid:142) rst
level (GIS as a vehicle to stimulate OL) will not be addressed here, as it does not
concern speci(cid:142) c functionalities of GIS. Special attention will be given to the link
between the functionality of GIS and OL at those levels for which no examples were
found in the case study.

7. GIS and the breadth of organizational learning

(Shepherd 1991, Bastiaansen 1995),

An important mechanism for supporting the breadth of OL, i.e. involving more
people and more departments in OL activities, is information distribution. The
concept of a distributed GIS (Clarke 1991, Goodchild 1991, Shepherd 1991) and the
associated notion of geographical information sharing (including data sharing, shar-
ing of analysis and visualization models and tools, e.g. Onsrud and Rushton 1995)
are therefore logical focal points for discussing the role of GIS in relation to the
breadth of OL. Prevalent reasons for geographical
information sharing include
considerations of e(cid:141) ciency (Shepherd 1991, Grimshaw 1994, 77), data quality
enhancements
improved decision-making
(Obermeyer and Pinto 1994, Chapter 7, Bastiaansen 1995, Pinto and Onsrud 1995),
the desire to strengthen ties with partners or increase the stability of these ties (Azad
and Wiggins 1995), and the desire to display innovativeness (Azad and Wiggins
1995 ). The antecedents (barriers, enhancing factors) for geographical information
sharing are likely to be very diŒerent, depending on the objective to be supported
(yet, studies of these antecedents rarely refer to underlying objectives and treat
barriers and enhancing factors in an absolute sense; e.g. Craig 1995, Meredith 1995).
The motivation to enhance OL through geographical information sharing provides
a new perspective on information sharing. This perspective is in some ways related
to the other perspectives, but also introduces new elements into the discussion. The
diŒerences revolve around the argument that, in an OL context, sharing spatial
information should support sharing experiences. To become fruitful for OL, experi-
ences are not to be shared (at least not primarily) for the purpose of others reliving
these experiences (reusing or reapplying the data and information) , but for the

purpose of coming up with new ideas, new insights into how old solutions may help
solve new problems. Simply passing data sets around has only limited value here.
What is important here is to facilitate and promote the exchange of ideas with
respect to these data and their use in analysis and visualisation models, i.e. to
stimulate the spread of spatial knowledge of data.

7.1. T he breadth of OL in the case study

Several examples of GIS aŒecting the breadth of OL through altered information
distribution were identi(cid:142) ed in the case study (see table 1). Some of these will be
discussed in more detail here.

The case study provides several examples of GIS support for OL at level one
(GIS presence as a lever for OL). One such example concerns the use of GIS as a
vehicle for community building within the (cid:142) rm (item 5 in table 1). As an element of
its new information policy, the agency intends to establish enterprise-wide news
groups, discussion meetings, etc., with a focus on GIS. It should be noted that, in
themselves, discussion groups, and the like, do not necessarily enhance OL; the
discussions in these groups may very well involve pure single-loop learning. Once
such discussion groups are established, it may, however, prove easier to introduce
OL elements into the knowledge sharing and exchange processes. An OL-friendly
setting is de(cid:142) ned by such cross-project, cross-department discussion processes. GIS
expertise de(cid:142) nes an extra dimension, next to, for instance, dimensions of professional-
ism and market specialization, which provides a rationale for bringing people with
diŒerent backgrounds together within a dedicated forum. Enhancing GIS expertise
throughout the (cid:142) rm provides therefore an important condition for putting GIS
matters of organizationa l relevance on the agenda of these fora.

As an example of how generic GIS tools may aŒect OL (level two in (cid:142) gure 4),
consider the use of GIS to facilitate retracing individual, closed projects (item 8 in
table 1 ). A key problem for the organization at the time of study was how it could
prevent the disintegration of accumulated project-related knowledge. Usually, there
were only some vague notions about how similar problems had been dealt with in
the past. It proved nearly impossible to trace these notions to individual projects.
Cross-project fertilization appeared to occur only in a haphazard fashion and usually
only across at least partially synchronous projects. Suggestions were made that
spatial information about a project might prove a useful vehicle for signi(cid:142) cantly
enhancing the means to retrace projects. It appeared that very often links between
projects were asked for, mainly on the basis of spatial criteria. For instance, often
the need arose to trace projects dealing with particular problems in the same or
overlapping areas. Also, closed projects dealing with similar spatial objects (networks,
comparable shapes) or within a certain spatial range of the new project were fre-
quently asked for. Another example refers to demands for projects in areas connected
through some network (waterways, watersheds, ground water (cid:143) ows, etc.) with the
area of the new project. To facilitate queries identifying such connections between
projects, it was proposed to store location-related project data in a company-wide
GIS-based project information base. GIS are thus made useful for enhancing the
re-traceability of
individual, closed projects. The learning objective was to take
knowledge developed and applied in closed projects and reuse and reinterpret it in
new settings (referring to associated aims such as avoiding having to reinvent the
wheel over and over again, or using past experiences as stimuli for creative thinking).
Apart from GIS-related practices and initiatives associated with just one cell in

the matrix, the case study also showed practices and initiatives that fell in more than
one cell. These were instances of GIS use that aŒected OL in more than one way.
As an example, consider proposals for publishing interactive maps on the intranet
for projects in progress (items 2 and 5 in table 1, and items 6, 13 and 14 in table 2).
Thus, participants in the project, other interested parties, and, in some cases, also
the client, are able to view intermediary and (cid:142) nal project results. The participants
in the project are oŒered additional GIS functions for manipulating the contents of
the published work on the basis of their role in the project. Because information
about work-in-progress becomes more easily available within the project team and
other groups involved, this initiative will aŒect the breadth of OL at level one. It
may trigger people who otherwise would have only learned of the results after
completion of the project, to examine links with their own projects or contact team
members for discussion or exchange of ideas. Because the GIS functions oŒered to
the participants in the project directly relate to task performance, this initiative also
aŒects the breadth of OL at level two. Two or more people working on separate
aspects of the project visually presented on the same set of maps are in a position
to learn more easily about the work of others and its relevance for their own work.
The advantage s for OL become even more apparent when these people are members
of diŒerent departments involved in the project, or if they are working on diŒerent
locations, for instance, at the client’s o(cid:141) ce, in the (cid:142) eld, at home, or at diŒerent o(cid:141) ces
of the consultancy (cid:142) rm. The same initiative also aŒects the elaborateness of OL (to
be discussed in the next section). Outside parties, clients, sponsors or other stake-
holders, that are interested in the outcomes of the project but have to rely on
information being provided to them by the project team, are oŒered the opportunity
to get more directly involved in the project. This may induce them to give feedback
and to in(cid:143) uence the paths taken in the project. Thus the use of the Internet, or their
intranet extended into an extranet, oŒers the consultancy (cid:142) rm options for a better
intelligence of, and adaptation to, preferences of the market. If the clients are oŒered
GIS functions, this example concerns level one (item 13 in table 2); if such functions
are not oŒered, it concerns level one (item 6 in table 2).

7.2. T he focus on the breadth of OL in GIS

An inspection of GIS functionalities for supporting geographical information
sharing shows ample opportunities for enhancing OL at level two. One example
refers to facilities for producing maps on the basis of a distributed database and
publishing these on an intranet or the Internet (cf. Harder 1997). Other examples of
GIS support for OL at level two were also identi(cid:142) ed in the case study; these are
given above and in table 1.

The assessment concerning levels three and four (GIS tools for tracing and
directing OL-relevant information-sharin g activities respectively) is less propitious.
GIS, in their current conception, hardly re(cid:143) ect the speci(cid:142) c way of looking at geo-
graphical information sharing generated by OL. From an OL perspective, tracing
information sharing ( level three) is not primarily directed towards simply reusing
old data. Instead, the focus is on (cid:142) nding inspiration in old solutions for dealing with
new problems. This inherently leads to a fuzziness in the approach of the shared
database. This can be illustrated by looking at the way spatial queries may become
relevant to OL. Two types of spatial search queries are commonly discerned, the
one involves regions (e.g. ‘What can be found in region A?’; questions like these may
‘Where is
be addressed with a map browser), and the other involves features (e.g.

X?’; queries like these may be addressed with the use of gazetteers) . For both classes
of queries the formulation of the search criteria in OL situations is usually not crisp
and clear but part of a trial-and-error process. Neither ‘region A’ nor ‘feature X’ are
typically well described during a search which is aimed at (cid:142) nding ‘corresponding
regions’ or ‘similar features’. For some projects it may be relevant to use the location
of the town hall as the footprint of a city, and for others its boundaries. This poses
a problem for retrieving information on the relations between the projects, if retrieval
of information on the (cid:142) rst project has produced a space descriptor that does not
automatically match those of the other projects. As a result, the necessity arises to
reconsider the way in which geographically referenced material is presented in the
search results, and to look at how this material may be manipulated. The fuzziness
of the queries requires retrieval in various forms, including text. The trial-and-error
process demands a high degree of interactivity during the retrieval, allowing the user
to (cid:142) ne-tune the queries by manipulating the results, or by navigating to associated
results by following (hyper)links. The querying and retrieval capabilities of current
standard GIS do not meet the requirements for dealing with such matters of fuzziness.
Particularly such large data sharing research projects as the Alexandria library
project (Smith 1996) oŒer valuable insights that may be used for attuning GIS
capabilities to the needs of OL support.

8. GIS and the elaborateness of organizational learning

The elaborateness of OL refers to how many interpretations are developed with
respect to the object of OL, and how varied these interpretations are. The key
concept for linking GIS to the elaborateness of OL is that of information interpreta-
tion. This concept lies very close to the core of GIS, as it does to the core of any IS.
The analysis models, visualization models, and data models around which GIS are
built, are all, in varying degrees and ways, based on interpretations: they produce
interpretations and they communicate interpretations. Moreover, working with GIS
is embedded within the broader process of making sense of reality in so far as it is
relevant to the organization. For instance, a re(cid:143) ection upon previous uses of GIS
(‘Which analysis models were chosen?’, ‘Why were others rejected?’, etc.) may facilitate
learning processes and lead to more varied interpretations.

8.1. T he elaborateness of OL in the case study

Some examples of how GIS may support the (cid:142) rst-level goal (leveraging situations
in which OL-relevant interpretations are produced) are given in table 2. This (cid:142) gure
presents a selection of the instances leading to more varied interpretations relevant
to OL, as revealed in the case study of GIS use. The consultancy agency proposed
to use GIS as an important vehicle for implementing a ‘one-stop shop’, as opposed
to the current client interface fragmented into several separate areas of expertise
(item 7 in table 2). This idea makes the spatial element in the questions or problems
of the prospective client the focal point in the intake procedure. This will allow the
consultant, irrespective of his or her own individual specialization, to explore links
to alternative (cid:142) elds of expertise relevant to the client’s needs. An initial exploration
of relevant data sources may be performed interactively (presence of con(cid:143) icting
activities or objects, links to regulation databases) . Examples of previous projects
that were dealing with similar problems or situated on the same location may
be retrieved, irrespective of the consultants’ own involvement in these projects.
Suggestions may be made concerning the required expertise in the project team.

From an OL point of view, this is an important GIS application, as it enables the
individual consultant to gain a broad view of the reach of potential projects (content,
how they relate to products, internal processes and conception of the client needs).
This view is much broader when compared to the view based on the client contacts
of the individual consultant.

An assortment of applications based on standard GIS functionality and relevant
to OL was identi(cid:142) ed in the case study. These included partner network review,
registration, analysis and dispatch of customer complaints. Also, GIS use leads to
improved operations by monitoring and analysing customer contacts, by redistricting
service areas and by route planning for service calls. All these applications exemplify
how GIS supports single-loop learning as they describe how GIS may help improve
services and after-sales. They become relevant for a higher gradation of OL if they
can be turned into double-loop learning. This will occur if an additional re(cid:143) ection
step is introduced to help assess how the organization works, and to ascertain
whether implicit or explicit norms are honoured (these examples are therefore classi-
(cid:142) ed as ‘system-related learning’ in table 2, see items 9 and 10). When seen from this
angle, the information interpretation is assessed as a contribution to learning about
the norms determining whether the state of the system is in line with how the system
is supposed to operate.

GIS has led to new products of the agency: it now oŒers to sell its advice partly
as a spatial database in combination with a desktop GIS. The client is thus oŒered
a greater (cid:143) exibility in exploring alternative scenarios for the problems to be dealt
with (see item 2 in table 2). Also, because GIS is increasingly integrated into its own
operations as well as its products, it has decided to start oŒering training courses
on how to use GIS for dealing with environmental issues (see item 3 in table 2).
These developments, leading to new products and new services, alter the competencies
of the (cid:142) rm signi(cid:142) cantly. They change its relations to clients, they change the potential
circle of its clients, they change who its competitors and possible strategic partners
are, etc. These great, if not fundamental, changes have boosted the awareness that
the need exists to facilitate learning chain two: from product to environment (see
item 8 in table 2). Thus, the introduction of GIS has led to rethinking how the (cid:142) rm
operates internally and in relation to its environment.

8.2. T he focus on the elaborateness of OL in GIS

Because working with the analysis functions in GIS is very close to constructing
and adapting interpretations and mental models, several generic functions in GIS
exist that may aŒect the elaborateness of OL, i.e. functionalities of GIS that may be
used to enhance information interpretation within the context of OL. Although no
explicit references can be found in the GIS literature as to how a GIS enhanced
interpretation process aŒects OL, several GIS applications are described in which
the relation to OL is easily established. Harder (1997), for example, describes a range
of GIS applications for supporting market analysis, service area analysis, and advert-
ising. All these may well relate to an important element of OL: learning about the
competitive environment of the organization (box D in (cid:142) gure 1). Grimshaw (1994,
181–252) presents further examples of GIS supported interpretation activities within
organizations which he classi(cid:142) es according to strategic applications (e.g. business
planning, business trend analysis), tactical applications (e.g. dealer network review,
sales territory management ) and operational applications (e.g. locational analysis,
customer service). (There are many examples of how GIS, through their generic

capabilities, support information interpretation within organizations, in which, in a
critical reexamination, OL-relevant activities may be read. Such examples can, for
instance, be found in Maguire et al. 1991, Castle 1993, Huxhold and Levinsohn 1995,
Longley and Clarke 1995, or in business-oriented GIS journals such as GIS World,
GIS Europe, or Business Geographics). Not all learning within organizations is OL,
and also not all information interpretations enhance the elaborateness of OL. The
extra element needed to cross the bridge to OL is a re(cid:143) ection on the object of
the interpretation processes with respect to the occurrence of OL. In other words,
the interpretations involved have to be reviewed as to their value for the organization,
reconsidering its relation with its environment and changing its range of potential
behaviours.

The third-level goal, i.e. facilitating the retrieval of data on geographical informa-
tion interpretation processes, calls for a focus on the use of GIS, as opposed to the
content of GIS. Hine et al. (1996, 58) explore some conditions that have to be met
for inspection of interpretations: ‘All facts, assumptions and relationships for indi-
viduals, groups and the organization would need to be accessed directly . . . Further,
support for temporally tracing all the separate and joint components of individual,
group and organizationa l interpretations should be provided’. Based on these pro-
posals, the system should allow monitoring changes of assumptions, diŒerences
between assumptions by speci(cid:142) c groups, etc. These suggestions refer to a (cid:142) eld for
which the current generation of GIS oŒers only limited support. The call for speci(cid:142) c
tracing facilities has some ground in common with discussions concerning metadata
in GIS, and more speci(cid:142) cally concerning the lineage of datasets, as a subclass of
metadata (Lanter 1990 ). Lineage, however, is studied from the data perspective,
assessing which sources, transformation and analysis steps in(cid:143) uence the content and
quality of certain data products. To match the OL perspective, the concept of lineage
would need to be reinterpreted with respect to the use of the system as opposed to
the outcomes of using the system.

The fourth goal, which refers to the active support of the construction of OL-
focused geographical information interpretations, is even further beyond the capabil-
ities of today’s GIS. To understand the nature of these construction processes, a
conception of their object is needed. Building geographical information interpreta-
tions as part of OL activities amounts to (cid:142) nding and combining the appropriate
qualitative and quantitative chunks of information within the boxes and chains of
(cid:142) gure 1. This process is suitably described by the concept of building a mental or
cognitive map. Although this concept has attracted considerable attention in geo-
graphy (Downs and Stea 1973, 1977, Gould and White 1974, Johnston 1991, 144 Œ.,
Agnew et al. 1996), and is even the basis of at least one prototype geographical
knowledge system (Davis 1986), it only plays a modest role in GIS-related discus-
sions. However, the usefulness of GIS for OL support would signi(cid:142) cantly be enhanced
if these systems could support handling mental maps. Speci(cid:142) c functions for dealing
with mental maps to be incorporated in a GIS environment would include, for
instance, representation, retrieval, assimilation, error correction, investigation, and
guidance in the construction process of mental maps relevant to OL. Given the
central importance of qualitative elements in OL, it is unfortunate that a systematic
and readily available interface is still lacking between the quantitative traditions
from which mainstream GIS has originated and the increasingly rich cognitive and
linguistic traditions in spatial knowledge representations (Davis 1986, Mark and
Frank 1991, Lang et al. 1991, Hernandez 1994).

9. GIS and the thoroughnes s of organizational learning

The third dimension concerning the degree of OL, which refers to the thor-
oughness of OL, addresses the fact that OL may produce multiple geographical
information interpretations. Huber (1991) equates uniform comprehensions with
increased OL. However, more learning may also occur if individuals or groups, when
confronted with the interpretations of others, use the competing interpretations as
an inspiration to elaborate their own interpretation. The identi(cid:142) cation of con(cid:143) icting
interpretations may therefore also result in more thorough OL. A generally accepted
and much tested assertion is that group creativity processes such as OL thrive when
a combination of divergence and convergence elements are present (Vennix 1996 ).
Tools for supporting the process of constructing multiple interpretations should
therefore address matters of con(cid:143) ict as well as consensus. Consensus should not be
treated as the ultimate goal when con(cid:143) icts between individuals or groups occur
during OL. As Hine et al. (1996, 53) note: ‘Con(cid:143) ict can be resolved, left unresolved,
or can create new con(cid:143) icts. . . . It is important to note that it is not necessarily the
resolution of con(cid:143) ict that results in learning. Rather, it is the process of comparing
and understanding various managers’ interpretations that furthers learning and a
shared understanding of the strategic environment’. Two classes of applications may
be discerned which support handling of multiple interpretations. Firstly, methods
and tools may address the overall (cid:143) ow of divergence (e.g. dialectical inquiry and
devil’s advocacy, Vennix 1996, 156–7) and convergence (e.g. Delphi, nominal group
technique and voting ( Vennix 1996, 128 Œ.). Secondly, methods and tools may also
aim at the support of elements within the overall process, such as identifying diŒerent
positions leading to diŒerent interpretations, identifying equivocality within the
individual interpretations, and the identi(cid:142) cation of con(cid:143) ict and overlap between
competing interpretations.

9.1. T he thoroughnes s of OL in the case study

No instances of GIS use for recognizing and handling multiple interpretations

were identi(cid:142) ed in the case study.

9.2. T he OL focus in GIS

Within GIS-related domains, the closest match with approaches for dealing with
multiple interpretations is found in the emerging discussions concerning spatial
group decision support systems (SGDSS). SGDSS are usually conceived as GIS
extensions. Various tools are proposed and implemented in SGDSS addressing the
goal at levels two (oŒering support for confronting multiple interpretations) and
three (tracing multiple OL-relevant interpretations, their diŒerences and overlaps).
These tools include the generic support of distributed GIS. They also include more
dedicated tools such as shared graphics and shared maps allowing multiple problem
views (Armstrong 1994, Faber et al. 1996, 1997, Jankowski et al. 1997, Jones et al.
1997 ) and multi-user access to databases and responses to actions performed by
other group members (Jones et al. 1997 ). When SGDSS tools are compared to the
types of tools that may prove useful when dealing with multiple interpretations, the
conclusion should be that currently available SGDSS tools do not speci(cid:142) cally address
matters relevant to enhancing the thoroughness of OL.

Concerning the fourth level, supporting the alteration of divergence and conver-
gence, a strong bias in SGDSS thinking can be noted towards the support of
consensus building, which constitutes a particular form of convergence. As argued,

P. H. J. Hendriks

this is certainly not the most pressing problem within the context of OL; con(cid:143) icts
may prove far more productive in OL situations. Group negotiations are simply
equated with consensus building in current SGDSS conceptions, and most of
the tools oŒered are directed towards this goal (including voting, prioritizing and
evaluation, see Faber et al. 1996, 1997, Jankowski et al. 1997 ).

While SGDSS developments go some way in transforming GIS into an environ-
ment for dealing with multiple geographical information interpretations, their current
conceptions do not re(cid:143) ect the speci(cid:142) c perspective represented by OL. Consequently,
they oŒer only few leads for developing a conception of how GIS may enhance the
thoroughness of OL. This calls for an elaboration which introduces both divergence
and convergence elements into the support of the group construction of mental maps
(some elements of such an elaboration are discussed by Vriens and Hendriks 1997,
Hendriks and Vriens 2000).

10. Conclusion

The common theme underlying discussions about an OL perspective on GIS is
that these systems are not to be valued as tools for improving the completion of
individual tasks (e.g. better research facilities, better control options), but as tools
for linking individual people and departments and for communicating between them.
In line with the merging of information technology and technologies used for com-
munication into ‘information and communication technology’ (ICT instead of IT)
studying GIS from an OL point of view should induce us to see GIS as GICS, that
is, as Geographical Information and Communication Systems. This should not lead
to negating the importance of the information component of GIS, instead it should
lead to the assessment that information, when communicated and shared, may lead
to new information and therefore to learning. Thus, studying the relation between
OL and GIS leads to a speci(cid:142) c perspective on the value and importance of informa-
tion for the organization. Only some elements of this relation between OL and GIS
were addressed in this article. Many more have remained beyond its horizon. These
include such issues as the broader impact of GIS technology on task division and
coordination, and the assessment of GIS maintenance from an OL point of view.
They also include a more thorough examination of the contingencies determining
whether the introduction of GIS aŒects OL. However elaborate their functionalities
for supporting OL, GIS in themselves cannot enhance OL. In addition to such
factors as the structure and culture of the organization, it is particularly the learning
aptitude and propensity of GIS users that are fundamental to the success of OL
(Robey and Sahay 1996, Sahay and Robey 1996). One important instrument for
enhancing the OL abilities of GIS users is to introduce the proper elements into
GIS education programmes. These include theoretical elements such as an explora-
tion of the concept of OL and an introduction into the particular organizationa l
outlook on systems theory. They also include more practical ingredients such as
training to work in groups and a focus on dialogue and negotiation techniques. Such
elements are clearly missing in discussions concerning GIS curricula (Goodchild and
Kemp 1992, Kemp and Frank 1996, Wikle 1998).

The application of the model for linking OL and GIS has illustrated that GIS
introduction may enhance OL signi(cid:142) cantly. For example, GIS-centred discussion
groups (in (cid:142) gure 4 identi(cid:142) ed as level-one support ) and speci(cid:142) c use of the functions
for geographical information sharing (level-two support) may lead to more people
becoming involved in more extensive and more thorough OL. At the same time, the

conclusion should be that the current conceptions and functionalities of GIS are not
attuned to the requirements of OL. Among the de(cid:142) ciencies identi(cid:142) ed were fuzzy
querying capabilities, (cid:143) exible query result inspection facilities (e.g. using hyperlinks) ,
speci(cid:142) c tools for storing and using meta-information about GIS usage, support for
constructing and using spatial mental models, tools for stimulating con(cid:143) ict and
dealing with con(cid:143) icting spatial information interpretations, and a wider spread of
standard SGDSS functionalities such as shared graphics and multi-user access to
databases. In other words, when looking from GIS to OL, one will detect several
functionalities that may prove very propitious to OL. Also, when looking from OL
to GIS, clear lacunas become apparent, since potentially useful functions (such as
data sharing facilities) are not attuned to the speci(cid:142) c requirements of OL, or because
OL-speci(cid:142) c functions (such as support for the construction of mental models of a
(cid:142) rm) are largely lacking. These assertions call for an extension of the GIS concepts
and functions dedicated to OL.

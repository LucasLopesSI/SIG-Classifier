Abstract.
In many African countries where both Government resources and
donor aid for the control of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis are declining,
there is an increasing need to identify areas where intervention is most likely to
be technically, economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. Activities
then can be focused so that the maximum bene(cid:142) ts are obtained from limited
resources. We describe a decision-support framework based on a geographical
information system to identify areas of high priority for the control of tsetse and
trypanosomiasis in the common (cid:143) y belt of eastern Zambia. Digital coverages
were generated for six environmental variables: (1) cattle density, (2) human
density, (3) land designation, (4) relative arable potential, (5) crop-use intensity
and (6) proximity to existing control operations. The distribution of tsetse in the
area was predicted using a multivariate (maximum likelihood) analysis of areas
of known presence and absence and a series of environmental data. Experienced
Zambian veterinarians and biologists working in the region established criteria
weights for the input variables and the data were integrated in a geographical
information system (GIS), using weighted linear combinations to prioritize areas
for trypanosomiasis control. The results of this exercise and estimates of the errors
involved are discussed.

Introduction

1.
1.1. T setse-transmitted trypanosomiasis in Eastern Zambia

Tsetse (Diptera: Glossinidae) are the vectors of the trypanosome s that cause
‘nagana’ in cattle and sleeping sickness in people. Kristjanson et al. (1999) estimated
some 47.75 million cattle to be at risk from trypanosomiasi s in sub-Saharan Africa.
They further estimate that 38% of these are treated with trypanocidal drugs each
year, at an annual cost of some US$35 million. In southern Africa, a supposedly
discrete infestation of
in Malawi,
Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe, is known as the ‘common (cid:143) y belt’; the highest
densities of tsetse are centred on the drainage systems of the Luangwa and Zambezi
rivers. The geographical focus of this analysis was the Zambian part of the common

tsetse, covering an estimated 322 000 km2

Westwood (Ford and Katondo 1977). The distribution of G. pallidipes Austen is a
subset of that. Districts included in the analysis are labelled in (cid:142) gure 1.

In this part of Zambia, most agricultural land is devoted to rain-fed arable crops;
maize is the staple diet. Oxen and ploughs are used to till the land where livestock
can be kept; in other areas, hand-held hoes are used. Agricultural activity is generally
far greater outside the bounds of the tsetse distribution where there is no restriction
on draft power and much-larger areas can be cultivated. Household surveys (Regional
Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Control Programme (RTTCP), unpublished data) have
shown that, in tsetse-free areas, more households own cattle (49% versus 33%), the
average herd size is larger (5 versus 2), and the calving and weaning rates are

given to herd growth and accumulation of breeding stock, as opposed to the infested
areas where oxen constitute a major proportion of the average herd. They estimated
that mean stocking densities in the areas free of trypanosomiasi s could increase by
50% above present levels, and that in the infested areas, densities could increase
by 400–500%.

Since 1986, donor assistance towards the control of tsetse-transmitte d trypanoso-
miasis in the common (cid:143) y belt has been directed through the RTTCP. This programme
is operated under the auspices of the Southern African Development Council (SADC)
and is funded by the European Commission (EC). The original objective of the
regional programme was to eradicate tsetse from the common (cid:143) y belt (Jordan
1985)—initially by aerial spraying and,
insecticide-
impregnated target technology (Vale et al. 1988). The methodology behind this
approach to tsetse control is that targets are progressively deployed to ‘roll back the
carpet’ of tsetse. With this objective, a number of target control operations was
started in Zambia.

later, using odour-baited,

In spite of the importance of trypanosomiasis , economic instability and donor-
fatigue have lead to a shortage of operational
funds within the Government
Veterinary Department, resulting in a rapid decline of resources available for tsetse
and trypanosomiasi s control in Zambia. This, combined with a relative lack of
success in ‘area-wide’ control, has resulted in a change in emphasis from widespread
eradication towards smaller-scale, community-base d interventions that require dis-
ease management rather than purely vector control. It is, therefore, increasingly
important to identify areas that are of high priority for control.

1.2. Application of GIS in trypanosomiasis control

Geographical information systems (GIS) contain spatial data sets and the tools
with which to display, manipulate and analyse them (Laurini and Thompson 1992;
Burrough and McDonnell 1998). General reviews on their applications in epidemi-
ology are available (Sanson et al. 1991, Elliott et al. 1992, Washino and Wood 1994,
Mott et al. 1995, Clarke et al. 1996, Openshaw 1996, Hay 1997, Vine et al. 1997,
Robinson 2000). Much research has applied these techniques to African animal
trypanosomiasis ; most used multivariate analysis of climate and remotely sensed
data to model tsetse distributions. This has been done for Zimbabwe (Rogers and
Williams 1993, 1994, Williams et al. 1994), Kenya and Tanzania (Rogers and
Randolph 1993, Rogers and Williams 1993, 1994), West Africa (Rogers et al. 1996,
Hendrickx 1999), and in the common (cid:143) y belt of southern Africa (Robinson et al.
1997b).

GIS has also been used to combine data such as livestock distribution, agriculture
and arable potential, at a range of spatial scales, to identify areas where tsetse (cid:143) ies
constrain agricultural development.

At a coarse spatial resolution of c. 14 km Ö 14 km, trypanosomiasi s risk has been
linked to infrastructure and control opportunities in Togo (Hendrickx 1999). At a
(cid:142) nal spatial resolution of c. 1.25 km Ö 1.25 km in eastern Zambia, Robinson (1998)
developed models based on decision trees to combine environmental data on the
distribution of tsetse, livestock, agriculture, arable potential and protected forest and
wildlife areas to produce priority maps for trypanosomiasi s intervention. At a still
(cid:142) ner resolution of c. 100 m Ö 100 m, De la Rocque (1997) generated a GIS model for
an area in Burkina Faso, that combined biophysical and spatial elements to identify

high-risk locations for trypanosome infections transmitted by riverine species of
tsetse.

1.3. Multiple-criteria decision making

Various multiple-criteria decision models were reviewed by (Jankowski 1995)
who categorized them according to whether or not they were compensatory. In non-
compensatory models a higher score on one criterion cannot oVset a low score on
another, and options are eliminated without necessarily considering all criteria
(Hwang and Yoon 1981, Minch and Sanders 1986). In compensatory models, how-
ever, a higher score on one criterion can oVset a low score on another, and all
criteria must be considered.

There are many ways in which decision criteria can be combined. Weighted linear
combination (Rao et al. 1991, Eastman et al. 1993a, b) involves summing the criteria
after multiplying each by a weight. Concordance-discordanc e analysis (Nijkamp and
van Delft 1977, Voogd 1983, Nijkamp et al. 1990, Carver 1991) is a method in which
each pair of alternatives (raster pixels or polygons in a GIS context) is analysed for
the degree to which one outranks the other in the speci(cid:142) ed criteria. Analytical
hierarchical processes (Saaty 1977, 1987) are an adaptation of weighted linear com-
bination, and there also exist various ‘multi-attribute trade-oV systems’ (Brown et al.
1986). A further group of multiple criteria models is based on specifying an ‘ideal
point’ of suitability for an objective in an n-dimensional criterion space (Hwang and
Yoon 1981, Voogd 1983, Lofti et al. 1992 ).

is appropriate to implement

Most of the techniques described above are designed to compare relatively small
numbers of alternatives and are computationall y very intensive and are therefore
diYcult to implement in a raster GIS where each pixel represents an alternative.
Weighted linear combination, however,
in this
context and some GIS programmes such as Idrisi (IDRISI Clarke Laboratories,
USA, http://www.clarklabs.org) and SPANS (Tydac Technologies, Canada,
http://tcp.ca/Aug94/SPANS.html) oVer bespoke modules to conduct such analyses.
Weighted linear combination is the method developed in this paper, and applied to
the problem of prioritizing areas for the control of African animal trypanosomiasis .
Heywood et al. (1995) and Malczewski (2000) discuss some issues concerning
the application of weighted linear combination in a GIS environment. They review
some applications, explain the assumptions behind the methodology and highlight
some common pitfalls. In the discussion section we will address some of these
potential problems in relation to the present analysis.

2. Methods and results

Weighted linear combination in a GIS environment involves a number of steps:
(a) de(cid:142) ne the objective; (b) identify relevant criteria; (c) input, geo-register and stand-
ardize the criteria; (d) develop and evaluate the decision rule; and (e) estimate the
error in the output.

2.1. De(cid:142) ne the objective

Whilst the general objective was to prioritize areas for tsetse and trypanosomiasi s
control, this had to be de(cid:142) ned more precisely because subtle changes in the objective
would be re(cid:143) ected by changes in the decision rule. In this example, with only one
objective, we avoided the complexities that can arise through con(cid:143) icting objectives

Downloaded by [UPM] at 14:23 22 December 2014 Decision support for trypanosomiasis control

349

in multiple objective decision making (Eastman et al. 1993a, b). In the present
example the de(cid:142) ned objective was:

‘To identify areas where tsetse control can best be accomplished using odour-
bated, insecticide-impregnated targets maintained by the community at minimal
donor cost’.

Robinson (1998) discussed two situations where tsetse control can be prioritized.
First, where the disease is constraining agricultural development directly; second,
where the disease prevents expansion from areas of high land pressure, into adjacent
areas that could be utilized to relieve this pressure. In this example we addressed
the (cid:142) rst of these problems, the direct disease constraint.

2.2. Identify relevant criteria

Criteria are selected that are linked to the de(cid:142) ned objective. Criteria may be
continuous variables such as cattle density or discrete classes such as land use that
can be scored for suitability to the objective, or they could be Boolean constraints
that limit the suitability of an area for tsetse control (such as the presence or absence
of tsetse).

The criteria used in the present analysis were (a) cattle density, (b) human density,
(c) crop-use intensity, (d) relative arable potential, (e) land designation, ( f ) proximity
to existing control operations, and ( g) tsetse distribution (Appendix A). In terms of
the de(cid:142) ned objective, areas of relatively high cattle and cropping density are of higher
priority for tsetse control because bene(cid:142) ts arise through intensi(cid:142) cation of agriculture.
For a community-base d operation the higher the density of people, the lower the
per capita costs and the greater the likelihood of success and sustainability. It is
clearly preferable to prioritize areas with a greater potential for arable development,
and because it is important to avoid encroachment of conserved areas by clearing
these of tsetse, land designation must also be considered. Distance from existing
control operations is important when using targets because it is cheaper to build
upon existing operations and because the (cid:143) y-invasion front is minimized.

2.3. Input, geo-register and standardize the criteria

Selected criteria are then processed in a GIS, digitized if necessary, registered to
a common scale and map projection and standardised such that (a)
increasing
suitability to the objective is associated with increasing data values and (b) the
absolute range of data values is similar in each criterion. The six factors listed above
are shown in (cid:142) gure 2 and the ways in which they were generated are described in
Appendix A. The constraint of tsetse presence was derived from the multivariate
predictions shown in (cid:142) gure 1 and described in Appendix A. All data were transformed
to a digital raster-format (on a Platte Carre´e projection) at a resolution of 80 pixels
per degree; at these latitudes this corresponds to a pixel size of approximatel y
1.4 km Ö 1.4 km.

2.4. Develop and evaluate the decision rule

Weighted linear combination is a convenient way to combine continuous or
graded criteria (Rao et al. 1991, Eastman 1992, Eastman et al. 1993b) . In this
technique, each standardized criterion is assigned a weight that re(cid:143) ects its relative
importance in contributing to the objective. S, the suitability to the objective being

where wi is the weight of factor i, xi is the criterion score of factor i, n is the number

of constraints.

In the present example the criterion weights were assigned by a group of experi-
enced Zambian veterinarians and biologists working in the region. They were
assigned randomly into four groups of (cid:142) ve or six individuals and asked to provide
weights for the six criteria listed to meet the stated objective. Speci(cid:142) cally, they were
asked (cid:142) rst to decide which criterion was least important and to give this a value of
1. They were then asked to give weights to the other criteria indicating how much
more important they were, compared to the least important criterion. The weights
were then normalized such that for each group Swi 5 1.

Zambian veterinarians and biologists and their mean values. The standard error of

were generally considered relatively unimportant. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were quite
consistent in their ranking of criteria, each giving similar values, whilst group 1
diVered somewhat from these.

For each pixel the suitability (S) for tsetse control was then estimated from the

mean weights using equation (1)

and the value of S was multiplied by the Boolean product of the criterion scores for
the constraints (in this case 1 if tsetse is present and 0 if tsetse is absent).

The result was the classi(cid:142) ed image given in (cid:142) gure 3, with values ranging from 1
to 6 (the higher values indicating areas of high priority for tsetse control ). The
highest-priority areas (dark) appear to be in(cid:143) uenced strongly by cattle and human
densities ((cid:142) gure 2 (a) and (b)). Within these areas, those that are close to the existing
control operations have been highlighted as being of highest priority. Parts of the
Eastern Province show the highest priority rankings and Lusaka Province comes
next in terms of priority ranking. Very few areas of high priority are indicated in the
Central and Northern Provinces.

2.5. Estimate the error in the output

To explore the eVect of variability in choice of weight among the diVerent groups
(given by the standard error (SE) of the mean weight for each criterion in table 1)
we conducted a sensitivity analysis by creating tsetse control priority maps using
each of the groups’ weights individually. Figure 4 shows these maps, zooming in on
the areas of higher control priority in the Eastern Province. The general pattern
of priority areas is very similar among the groups, suggesting the mean to be a
reasonable summary of the groups’ conclusions, so we need not be too concerned
about accounting for this source of variability.

Each criterion shown in (cid:142) gure 2 has an associated error that can be de(cid:142) ned in

terms of 95% (or other) con(cid:142) dence limits. In this analysis, errors were not measured
but estimated by the authors, and then combined to give con(cid:142) dence limits to the
resulting map of priority areas for tsetse control.

To estimate the sampling errors in S (our (cid:142) nal priority map) we need to know
the sampling errors in xi, the original criteria. We assumed that there was no error
in the constraint of tsetse presence, and we further assumed that the errors in the
six factors (xi) could be estimated as plus or minus some fraction of a class which
we called ai. Choosing numbers from a uniform distribution ranging from Õ
ai to

ai, the variance of the xis is V i 5 a2i /3. The variance of S was then

where wi remained the weight of factors i through n. The standard deviation was
then estimated as Ô
V (S) and to get 95% con(cid:142) dence limits we simply multiplied
the standard deviation by 1.96 (assuming that the errors in S were normally distrib-
uted). This provided the fraction of a class in the (cid:142) nal suitability map within which
we could be 95% certain that the estimated suitability value lied.

were generated. We used equation (2) to calculate the variance of the estimate of S
to be 0.03. The standard deviation of S was then 0.18 and multiplying this value by
1.96 gave us 95% con(cid:142) dence limits of Ô

the priority classes for tsetse control.

3. An example from Petauke in the Eastern Province of Zambia

Figure 5 shows a detail of the mean priority map ((cid:142) gure 3); zooming in on
Petauke, an important part of the Zambian (cid:143) y belt in which tsetse control, using
odour-baited targets, has been going on since 1989. Area A (320 km2 )
is the
Chimpundu area in which tsetse control commenced in 1989 under the Belgian
Animal Disease Control Project (BADCP) using locally made black-screen targets;
area B (550 km2 ) is the Mvuvye area, in which tsetse control was initiated by the
RTTCP in 1990 using black-screen targets imported from Zimbabwe. In 1992 the
management of the Chimpundu area was taken over by the RTTCP. Thus, areas A
and B comprise the original Petauke target control area; black-screen targets are
maintained at a density of 4 per square kilometre.

In 1994 a community-based extension to the Petauke target control area was

proposed, the Msanzara area shown as area C in (cid:142) gure 4 (1272 km2 ). Extensive
tsetse surveys demonstrated a high infestation of G. m. morsitans.

The results presented in (cid:142) gure 5 show quite clearly that the northern part of the
proposed extension to the Petauke control operation was of relative low priority
because it was (a) of relatively low arable potential, (b) of a low crop-use intensity,
and (c) relatively far from the existing control areas. Areas of higher priority are
indicated to the west of area B in (cid:142) gure 5. Had the results of this analysis been
available at the time they could have been used to help plan the extension to the
Petauke control operation by optimizing its location.

Soon after the initiation of the community control programme the RTTCP
activities in the region began to decline as the programme eventually closed down.
It has not, therefore, been possible to assess the impact of this control operation,
nor to evaluate the outputs of this analysis in the (cid:142) eld.

4. Discussion

The results presented demonstrate the application of weighted linear combination,
within a GIS, to integrate relevant criteria for decision making in trypanosomiasi s
control. Heywood et al. (1995) and Malczewski (2000) highlight potential problems

with using weighted linear combination in a GIS environment. Here we combine
the most important of these with our own observations, under seven categories.

a) Objective de(cid:142) nition. De(cid:142) ning objectives is central to multi criteria evaluation:
the more clearly the problem is de(cid:142) ned the more speci(cid:142) c the decision rule can be.
Heywood et al. (1995) discuss some issues surrounding problem de(cid:142) nition. In the
present example we started with the broad objective of prioritizing areas for trypano-
somiasis control, and then made this more speci(cid:142) c by stating that it would be a
community operation, using insecticide-impregnated targets.

b) Attribute completeness. Malczewski

(2000 ) highlights an assumption behind
weighted linear combination that the criteria must be complete, i.e. they should cover
all aspects of the decision problem. Selection of attributes is necessarily driven by data
availability but it is important to ensure that no key attribute s are missing from the
analysis as this could completely invalidate the result. In our analysis we have incorpor-
ated the important variables, though it would be preferable to have more detail in some
of these. For example estimates of disease risk would be better than simple estimates of
tsetse presence and economic data on potential bene(cid:142) ts of control would be better than
estimates of livestock numbers, crop-use intensity and arable potential.

c) Attribute independence. The issue of attribute independence is highlighted both
by Heywood et al. (1995) and Malczewski (2000 ) and clearly needs further research;
the risk being that the in(cid:143) uence of highly correlated variables is overstate d in the
application of the decision rule. There is a high level of cross-correlatio n between some
of the variables used in our analysis, particularly between livestock and human densities.
We cannot simply drop one of a pair of correlated variables such as these since it is
often in areas where the correlation breaks down that are of particular importance, for
example where people occur but cannot keep livestock due to the trypanosomiasi s
constraint. Perhaps to retain one of these variables and a composite (diVerence or ratio)
of the two might be the way forward, though we then run the risk of deriving complex
attributes that become diYcult to scale and assign weights to.

d) Attribute linearity. A further assumption behind weighted linear combination
(and one that we have made in our example) is that of linearity in the input criteria,
in terms of suitability to the speci(cid:142) ed objective. For simple cases of non-linearity in
attribute suitability (e.g. exponential increase in suitability) some simple arithmetic
transformation may be used to scale the data. Malczewski (2000) explains a further
solution to non-linearity in the ‘value function approach’. In the commonly used
‘midvalue method’ (e.g. Lai and Hopkins 1989) the decision maker estimates the
midpoint between the minimum (0) and maximum (1) value of a scaled attribute,
based not on its absolute value but on its suitability to the objective, and assigns
that a value of 0.5. Quartiles are then de(cid:142) ned in the same way, etc. until the required
resolution is obtained.

In situations of non-linearity where the optimal value of a criterion occurs within
a distribution rather than at one extreme, or indeed there is more than one optimal
value, the problem is more complex. The lies in the group of decision support models
in which an ideal point (or points) of suitability for an objective is (are) located in
an n-dimensional criterion space, and each pixel is then classi(cid:142) ed according to its
statistical proximity to that point (or to those points).

e) Scale and aggregation . Malczewski (2000) describes at length the risks associated
with varying spatial scale and levels of aggregatio n in spatial applications of weighted
linear combination; the best alternative at one spatial scale does not necessarily hold at
another. In the present analysis we were fortunate to have data of comparabl e and
relatively high spatial resolutions so these problems did not aVect us.

f ) Weighting. Incorrect speci(cid:142) cation of weights is a common error in weighted
linear combination, as highlighted by Hobbs (1980) and Lai and Hopkins (1989).
Weights are often assigned without due consideration of the scaling or measurement
units of the criteria; the in(cid:143) uence of a weight is clearly dependent on the data range.
Malczewski (2000) describes the ‘swing weights technique’ where the decision maker
compares a change from the least to the most preferable value in one criterion with
the same change in another; ranks the criteria depending on which of these ‘swings’
has the biggest in(cid:143) uence on the decision; and weights criteria relative to their perform-
ance compared to the highest ranking. Some analysts (e.g. Hobbs 1980 ) advocate the
‘analytical hierarchy process’ developed by Saty (1977), in which a pairwise compar-
ison technique is used to ensure consistency in the attribute weights. In the present
example we adopted an approach similar to Malczewski’s (2000) ‘swing weights
technique’, but assigned weights relative to the least important criterion. Here, the
knowledge and experience of local experts was harnessed, though a more rigorous
approach might be to estimate weights statistically, using the evidence on the eYcacy
of control strategies in various environments and on economic models of the costs
and bene(cid:142) ts of diVerent control options. For the present analysis such evidence was
not available but this is an important area for future research.

g) Error assessment. Assessment of errors in weighted linear combination is a
further matter for consideration, and one too frequently ignored. There are essentially
two types of error that are quite diVerent: errors caused by inaccuracies in the
estimated criteria, database uncertainty, and those introduced in the development of
the decision rule, decision rule uncertainty. In the present analysis we estimated
database uncertainty by de(cid:142) ning con(cid:142) dence intervals for the priority classes, based
on out con(cid:142) dence in the attribute values. We assesssed decision rule uncertainty by
conducting a sensitivity analysis of the diVerent weightings provided by diVerent
groups. Various other methods have been reported to address decision rule uncer-
tainty, including Bayesian probability theory (Lee et al. 1997), fuzzy set theory
(Fisher 1991, Lee et al. 1997, Zadeh 1965) and Dempster-Shafe r theory (Lee et al.
1997). Monte Carlo simulation has also been used to investigate sensitivity to
changes in the importance of criteria within the decision rule (Janssen 1992).

The next step that needs to be taken in developing decision support models for
trypanosomiasi s control is to adapt to a GIS environment the group of models
mentioned above, in which an ideal point of suitability for an objective is located in
n-dimensional criterion space. That approach has the potential to overcome many
of the potential problems listed above, in particular that of attribute linearity.

Moreover, this approach has the advantage that it tends towards multiple object-
ive decision making, which may be helpful in deciding which control methods should
be recommended for intervention. The options for trypanosomiasi s control include
disease control using trypanocidal drugs, adoption of trypanotoleran t livestock,
vector control using insecticide-treated animals or arti(cid:142) cial bait technology and
vector eradication using methods such as ground or aerial spraying or the sterile
insect technique. These vary in cost, in whether the bene(cid:142) ts are private (e.g. trypanoci-
dal drugs) or public (e.g. bait technology) and also in whether the onus is on the
individual, the community or some external body to conduct and (cid:142) nance them.

The ecological, epidemiological, social and economic environment will have a
very strong bearing on which alternative, or combination of alternatives, is most
appropriate to a particular area. This choice will depend on criteria such as infection
rate, risk and rate of re-invasion of (cid:143) ies to a cleared or controlled areas, potential

bene(cid:142) ts (including factors such as market access and potential for intensi(cid:142) cation),
costs (including infrastructural considerations) , and a range of social factors. One can
visualize a multidimensional criterion space in which ideal points are located for
diVerent control approaches and, based on these criteria, pixels would be classi(cid:142) ed
according to which point or points they were statistically closest to. In some cases a
combined approach might be the recommended output of the decision support model.
There is clearly enormous potential for decision support tools to be applied to
the problem of trypanosomiasis , and to other livestock diseases, within a spatial
context. The next task is to identify suitable case studies, where detailed data are
available or can be collected, with which to derive more sophisticated decision rules
that can be adapted to a GIS environment.

Appendix A. Origins and accuracy of the criteria used in the analysis
A.1. Cattle density

Cattle density was derived from the 1990 census data for Zambia. These were
summarized as tropical livestock units (TLU) per census standardize d area (CSA).
One TLU is approximately equivalent to 250 kg of live weight; the average unit
value for cattle is 0.7 TLU. Spatial errors arise in the mapping, digitizing and
projection transformation of the original CSA maps. These should be relatively small.
Greater errors occur during collection of statistics for each CSA. When the original
data were considered in detail, these errors were in some cases clearly very large; for
example some CSAs had been assigned impossibly high livestock densities. By
classifying the livestock densities into relatively broad classes, although we lost
precision, the importance of these errors was greatly reduced. Further errors are
inherent in the assignment of average density classes throughout each CSA; these
errors of generalization are greater in larger CSAs.

A.2. Human population density

Human density classes were generated in the same way from the 1990 census
data. Errors are likely to be similar to those in cattle density, and originate in the
same way.

A.3. L and designation

The locations of national parks and game-managemen t areas on the 1:250 000
scale topographic maps were digitized. A map of national forests was also digitized
and geo-registered with the map of national parks. Areas falling into none of the
three classes above were designated ‘common land’. Errors in the land designation
criterion arise only from mapping, digitizing and projection transformation . These
should be relatively small.

A.4. Relative arable potential

A map of relative arable potential, based on soil, relief and length of growing season
data was obtained. This map divides the common (cid:143) y belt of Zambia into (cid:142) ve relative
arable potential classes (indicating the suitability for rain-fed crops with a moderate
level of management) . Errors in estimating relative arable potential are likely to be
quite large. Additional to the mapping errors are those from the source data used to
produce this coverage (soil, relief and length of growing season) and errors resulting
from the subjective process of assigning relative arable potential classes.

A.5. Crop-use intensity

The World Food Programme/Famine Early Warning System’s (WFP/FEWS)
crop-use intensity map for Zambia was used to estimate the amount of cropping.
Landsat imagery was used to divide the area into (cid:142) ve classes: <5%; 5–30%; 31–50%;
51–70% and 71–100% of land under cultivation. The methodology is described in
(Westin and Brandner 1980) and uses a combination of colour, tone, pattern, evidence
of wetness, aridity and saline conditions and, where available, soil, climate, geological,
geomorphic and topographi c information. The coverage originated as a raster-format
GIS (cid:142) le, on a Plate Carre´e projection, at a resolution of 333.367 pixels per degree.
This was re-sampled to the base grid using the nearest-neighbou r method. Spatial
errors in the crop-use intensity criterion arise through the projection and scale
transformation s of the original Landsat satellite imagery. Value errors are introduced
that are inherent in the source data, and there will be additional errors resulting
from the subjective process of assigning crop-use intensity classes.

A.6. Distance from existing control operations

The existing target control operations in Zambia were drawn onto the 1:250 000
scale topographic maps, and digitized. The GIS function of buVering was used to
assign each pixel a value corresponding to the shortest distance to the nearest target
control area. Because of the use of the Platte Carre´e projection these distances are
expressed in decimal degrees. In this region, one decimal degree is approximately
100 km in both the north-south and east-west directions. We decided that proximity
to existing control areas was no longer of any importance at distances of greater
than 0.400 decimal degrees (c. 40 km). Areas further than this (and within the control
operations themselves) were given a value of zero in the class map. Errors in the
criterion of proximity to the existing target control area should be small, result-
ing only from the cartographic and projection transformation errors, and those
introduced in the buVering process.

A.7. T setse distribution

The distribution of Glossina morsitans morsitans was predicted using maximum-
likelihood classi(cid:142) cation of a range of remotely sensed environmental variables, based
upon the distribution maps of (Ford and Katondo 1977 ). The method is described
fully in (Robinson et al. 1997a) . The results of the prediction gave an overall
correspondence of 85.1% with the training data; correctly predicted pixels of suitabil-
ity for tsetse (sensitivity) were 83.2% and correctly predicted pixels of non-suitability
for tsetse (speci(cid:142) city) were 83.2 %. The Kappa index of agreement between the
prediction and the training data was high (0.641) indicating a good model (cid:142) t. For
this exercise, the predicted tsetse distribution was increased by a 10 km buVer zone.

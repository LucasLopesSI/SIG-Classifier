Abstract. This paper presents a new method to discover knowledge for
geographical cellular automata (CA) by using a data-mining technique. CA have
the ability to simulate complex geographical phenomena. Very few studies have
been carried out on how to determine and validate the transition rules of CA
from observed data. The transition rules of traditional CA are usually expressed
by mathematical equations. This paper demonstrates that the explicit transition
rules of CA can be automatically reconstructed through the rule induction
procedure of data mining. The explicit transition rules are more intuitive to
decision-makers. The transition rules are obtained by applying data-mining
techniques to spatial data. The proposed method can reduce the uncertainties in
deﬁning transition rules and help to generate more reliable simulation results.

Introduction
In recent years,

there has been an increasing number of studies on the
for simulating complex
development of geographical cellular automata (CA)
systems. CA have been applied to the simulation of wildﬁre propagation (Clarke et al.
1994), population dynamics (Couclelis 1988), and urban evolution and land-use
changes (White and Engelen 1993, Batty and Xie 1994). They are also used to
generate idealized or optimized urban forms for land-use planning (Li and Yeh
2000, Yeh and Li 2001a). CA were originated from the research of self-reproducing
systems done by Ulam and Von Neumann in the 1940s (White and Engelen 1993).
The ‘game of life’ developed in 1970 by the mathematician Conway can also be
regarded as an explicit CA game (Gardner 1971, Portugali 2000). However, much
inﬂuence on later developments of CA techniques can be attributed to Wolfram’s
(1984) studies, which demonstrated that the origins of the complexity in natural
systems could be investigated through dynamic models called ‘cellular automata’.
CA have great potential for geographical applications because of their strong

modelling capabilities. Tobler (1979) was perhaps the ﬁrst
to recognize the
advantages of CA in solving geographical problems (White and Engelen 1993). In
his cellular space model, the state of a cell is determined by the states of a set of
‘neighbour’ cells according to some uniform location-independent rules. The basic
principle of such models is to use a cell-space representation to realize spatial
dynamics. The simulation of population dynamics is a good demonstration of CA’s
capabilities in modelling complex natural systems. Couclelis (1988) has successfully
generated a variety of different spatio-temporal structures of rodent population by
using a very simple one-dimensional cellular automaton. Her research indicated
that the whole range of complex and apparently bizarre population dynamics can
be easily reproduced by the simple cellular automaton.

Urban simulation may be the most successful example of the use of CA
techniques in solving geographic problems (White and Engelen 1993, Batty and Xie
1994, Clarke and Gaydos 1998, Wu and Webster 1998, Li and Yeh 2000). Couclelis
(1985, 1997) carried out some early research on urban simulation using cellular
automata. She showed that CA might be used as an analogue or metaphor to study
how a variety of urban dynamics might arise. Batty and colleagues (Batty and Xie
1994, 1997, Batty et al. 1999) also carried out some interesting research on urban
CA in the early 1990s. They used CA to model the growth of built-up areas using
diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) (Batty et al. 1989). However, they later
developed a general class of CA which emerged through insights in computation
and biology (Batty and Xie 1994). Their models are very similar to the Game of Life
in which each cell can only take on one of two states (dead or alive).

CA are ﬂexible and transparent when they are used to solve geographical
problems. It is relatively easy to deﬁne transition rules. CA can have a variety of
applications, such as testing hypotheses of urban theories (Webster and Wu 1999),
simulating urban forms and land-use dynamics (Clarke and Gaydos 1998), and
generating development alternatives for conserving land resources (Li and Yeh
2000). It is also possible to incorporate planning objectives in simulating alternative
urban forms and densities for urban planning (Yeh and Li 2001a, 2002).

The deﬁnition of transition rules in geographical CA is strongly dependent on
domain knowledge and individual preferences. In urban simulation, the transition
rules are usually given according to the intuitive understanding of the process of
urban growth. Transition rules can be deﬁned using a variety of mathematical
expressions, such as nested neighbourhood spaces and distance decay functions
(Batty and Xie 1994), predeﬁned parameter matrices (White and Engelen 1993),
linear equations of multicriteria evaluation (MCE) (Wu and Webster 1998), logistic
models (Wu 2002), grey-cell or fuzzy states (Li and Yeh 2000), and neural networks
(Li and Yeh 2002). However, most of these transition rules are not explicit because
they use mathematical equations instead of using explicit transition rules.

A critical

issue in CA modelling is how to obtain domain knowledge and
determine transition rules in an objective way. The number of ways of deﬁning
transition rules seems to be virtually unlimited. The calibration of geographical CA
becomes very difﬁcult because a large number of rules have been used. Usually,
transition rules consist of many variables and parameters, but there are many
uncertainties in determining parameter values. Urban CA are very sensitive to
transition rules and their parameter values (Wu and Webster 1998, Li and Yeh

725

2002, Wu 2002). The calibration of CA is very important for producing realistic
urban simulation.

There are very limited studies on the calibration of geographical CA. Most of
the existing CA are based on the so-called ‘trial and error’ approach. The visual test
is the main method for validating urban CA in early studies (Clarke et al. 1997,
White et al. 1997, Ward et al. 2000). There have been several attempts to develop
more elaborate methods to tackle the problems of uncertainties in deﬁning
transition rules and parameter values. Computer search algorithms have been
proposed to derive optimal parameter values according to the best ﬁt between the
observed data and various simulated results (Clarke and Gaydos 1998). This
method involves intensive computation by comparing numerous possible combina-
tions of parameter values. Artiﬁcial neural networks have been incorporated into
urban CA for deriving parameter values automatically (Li and Yeh 2002).
However, it is difﬁcult to comprehend the meanings of these parameter values
because of the back-box approach of neural networks. Wu (2002) provides a
method to estimate the global development probability by using a logistic
regression model. The initial global probability is calibrated according to historical
land-use data. It seems to be easy to understand the meanings of the coefﬁcients in
the logistic regression equation. However, logistic equations cannot provide explicit
rules. Moreover, mathematical equations are sometimes difﬁcult to capture the
complexity of relationships.

In this study, a new method based on knowledge discovery or machine learning
is proposed to reconstruct the transition rules of geographical CA. Existing CA
have adopted the heuristic approach in deﬁning transition rules. The approach is
associated with uncertainties because it is subject to the inﬂuence of individual
knowledge and preferences. Moreover, the simulation of complex geographical
phenomena often involves the processing of a large set of spatial data. Automatic
knowledge discovery from spatial data should provide signiﬁcant improvement on
the performance of geographical CA.

2. Knowledge discovery of transition rules for geographical cellular automata

The process for acquiring domain knowledge is tedious and time-consuming.
Although experts are capable of using their knowledge to solve problems, they
cannot guarantee that the knowledge is explicitly expressed in a systematic, correct
and complete form. A well-known problem when creating expert systems is often
called the ‘knowledge acquisition bottleneck’ (Huang and Jensen 1997).

We propose using data mining to solve the problems of the difﬁculties and
uncertainties in knowledge solicitation in deﬁning the transition rules of CA. Data
mining involves discovering and capturing knowledge embedded in a large data set
automatically. This is usually done through machine learning. There are a number
of machine-learning algorithms available for data mining, such as ID3 (Quinlan
1986), C4.5 (Quinlan 1993), CART (Breiman et al. 1984), IB1, IB2, MPIL1, and
MPIL2 (Romaniuk 1993).

Quinlan (1979, 1993) carried out pioneering studies on rule discovery by
induction and machine-learning procedures. The ﬁrst inductive learning program
was called C4.5 and has been widely used in many applications (Berry and Linoff
1997). See5 for Window and its Unix counterpart, C5.0, are the most updated
version of C4.5. The series of C4.5 and See5/C5.0 systems have been used to

X. Li and A. Gar-On Yeh

reconstruct the rules for classifying remote-sensing imagery (Defries and Chan
2000). Studies have demonstrated that machine learning can provide an accurate
and efﬁcient tool for land-cover classiﬁcation using remote-sensing data (Friedl et al.
1999). Recently, there have also been several attempts to apply these systems to soil
analysis by using GIS data (Eklund et al. 1998, Moran and Bui 2002).

The simulation of geographical phenomena usually involves a vast volume of
spatial data. Techniques for constructing the transition rules of CA need to be
automated as much as possible. A number of advantages can be identiﬁed by using
machine-learning systems (e.g. C4.5 and See5/C5.0) to reconstruct the transition
rules of geographical CA:

. Decision-tree learning is the most efﬁcient form of inductive learning (Huang

and Jensen 1997).

. These systems can automatically determine threshold values and create a

knowledge base from observation data.

. They can be conveniently integrated with GIS for using spatial data.
. CA are simultaneously calibrated during the rule-induction process from data

mining.

. The retrieved rules are explicit for easier understanding and implementation.

This study applies data-mining techniques to the automatic reconstruction of
transition rules for geographical CA using urban simulation as an example
(ﬁgure 1). A data-mining tool, the See5 system, is used for discovering transition
rules. It is based on the ‘information gain ratio’ to determine the splits at each
internal node of the decision tree (Quinlan 1993). The information gain measures

the reduction in entropy in the data produced by a split. At each node, the tree is
divided based on the subdivision that maximizes the reduction in entropy of the
descendant nodes. First, imagine selecting one case at random from a training data
set S and announcing that it belongs to some class Cj. This message has the
probability:

(cid:1)
freq Cj, S
Sj
j
where freq (Cj, S) is the number of cases in S belonging to class Cj, and |S| is the
total number of observations in S.

The ratio can avoid the bias with too many splits during the rule induction
procedure. S will be recursively split to ensure that the gain ratio is maximized at
each node of the tree. This procedure continues until each leaf node contains only
observations from a single class, or there is no gain in information by further
splitting. The tests for the continuous attributes are also simple by partitioning each
attribute into two outcomes at each node using a threshold. The optimal threshold
is also determined according to the gain ratio. The values of an attribute are ﬁrst
sorted, and the midpoint of each interval is used as the representative thresholds
(Quinlan 1993). A number of threshold values may be used for the partition. The
threshold value with the greatest gain ratio value is selected at each node (DeFries
and Chan 2000).

The above procedure automatically creates decision trees or rule sets based on
the criterion of ‘information gain ratio’ (Quinlan 1993). The same procedure can be

applied for reconstructing transition rules in simulating geographical phenomena.
Many existing urban CA do not provide concrete transition rules but use
mathematical equations to estimate conversion probability. In fact, decision-makers
are more familiar with explicit rules. For example, it is much easier for them to
comprehend the following explicit rules:

GIS and remote sensing can provide spatial data for discovering the transition
rules of geographical CA (ﬁgure 1). In this study, remote-sensing images of two
different years are treated as the observed data for extracting the transition rules.
The transition rules based on the two images reveal the relationship between spatial
variables and land-use conversion for the observation interval (DT) (ﬁgure 2). CA
use discrete time to update the state of each cell step by step. There are many
iterations before the ﬁnal results are obtained in urban simulation. The transition
rules from data mining can be applied to all
iterations for simulating urban
development based on the past development trend. The assumption is that the
relationship between spatial variables and land-use changes do not change.

The projection from these two images can be used to estimate future land
consumption. This assumes that the rate of urban growth is constant. However, the
rate of urban growth may not be the same because of changes in economic, social
and political factors. One way to capture the growth trend is to use more than two
years of satellite images (ﬁgure 3). These extra remote-sensing data can be used to
provide the aggregated information about
trajectory for
simulating future urban development. If extra remote-sensing data are not
available, the aggregated information about the growth trend can be estimated
by using other sources of data, such as statistical yearbooks.

the development

There is a discrepancy between the iteration interval, the observation interval,
and the simulation interval (ﬁgure 2). It may be ideal if the observation interval
(DT) is equal to or close to the iteration interval (Dt) so that the mined transition
rules can be directly used in urban simulation. The acquisition of such observation
data is subject to the availability of data. The observation interval of remote-
sensing data is usually yearly based, while the iteration interval of CA is much
smaller. It is impractical to collect data within the iteration interval of Dt.
Moreover, the observed data cannot comprehend the long-term trend if the
observation interval is too short. DT equal to 2–3 years may be practical in most
situations. Observed data with the interval of several years have been commonly

used in the calibration of CA. For example, Li and Yeh (2002) calibrate CA using
two satellite images with the interval of 5 years. The calibration in Wu’s study
(2002) is even based on the land-use maps with an interval of 20 years.

There is a need to discuss how the extracted rules from the observed data are
applied to each iteration of urban simulation. First, the relationship between the
number of iterations (K), the iteration interval (Dt) and the observation interval
(DT) is as follows (ﬁgure 2):

K~DT=Dt

ð7Þ

where DT is the observation interval for the two remote-sensing images, Dt is the
iteration interval between t and tz1, and K is the number of iterations.

Transition rules from data mining only determine whether land-use conversion
will take place for the larger interval of DT. However, it is possible to estimate the
proportion of land-use conversion between t and tz1. The estimation can be
obtained by using the following equation:

Dqt~DQt=K
where DQt is the amount of land-use conversion for the observation interval, and
Dqt is the amount of land-use conversion for the iteration interval.

ð8Þ

When DTwDt,

the land-use conversion in Dt only amounts to a small
proportion of that in DT. Moreover, there is no way to identify the exact locations
that will have land-use conversion in the smaller period. Dqt can decide the system
birth rate at each step of the iterations. A random variable (c) is then used to

following additional rule is used to obtain the smaller portion of

b0 can be considered a global birth rate or a development probability for the
smaller interval of Dt. The use of random variables is important for addressing the
stochastic perturbation or uncertainties in complex geographical phenomena. This
can help to achieve more realistic simulation results. The ﬁnal land-use conversion
is usually determined by the comparison of a development probability with a
random variable in many urban CA (Batty and Xie 1994, Wu and Webster 1998).
For example, a cell will be developed if the calculated development probability is
greater than a random value (Wu 2002).

Since the amount of land-use conversion is changing with time, it should be
calculated from various years of satellite images instead of just using two images.
The above additional transition rule should have the following generic form by
replacing b0 with bt:

development trajectory. There is an issue about the uncertainty in deciding land
development at the iteration interval. The random variable (c) may introduce the
‘noise’ in the simulation process because of the uncertainty in determining the
locations of development for the smaller iteration interval. Uncertainty may be
minimized by making the observation interval (DT) close to the iteration interval
(Dt). However, this can be a problem, because the long-term trend cannot be
captured. There is a need to balance the trade-off by choosing a suitable interval for
the observation data (e.g. 2–3 years). CA are based on discrete time, and a sufﬁcient
number of
time steps (iterations) are needed to ensure simulation accuracy.
However, there is no agreement on how many time steps should be used. Many CA
usually run from 100 to several hundred iterations.

3.1. Training data

The proposed model has been tested in Dongguan, a city in the Pearl River
Delta of Southern China. Dongguan has an area of 2465 km2 with a city proper and
29 towns. Rapid urban expansion has been witnessed in the Pearl River Delta
because of fast economic development (Li and Yeh 1998). A number of CA models

have been developed for simulating land development in the study area. The ﬁrst
model uses ‘grey’ states to simulate the continuous conversion process of urban
development (Li and Yeh 2000). The constraints retrieved from GIS are imported
to CA to explore various possible development scenarios. Little attention has been
paid to the calibration of the model. The second model is to simplify the procedure
of deﬁning transition rules and facilitate the calibration of CA by using neural
networks (Li and Yeh 2002). However, the transition rules of this model are not
transparent because of the back-box approach of neural networks.

This proposed model

is the successor of previous models, but it has made
signiﬁcant improvements with a strong capability of rule discovery. In this study,
the transition rules are automatically reconstructed from the GIS databases. A
series of spatial data are used for the data mining. The data include the layers of
urban development, proximity variables, neighbourhood conditions, and physical
attributes. Studies indicate that urban development probability is decided by these
spatial variables (Wu and Webster 1998, Li and Yeh 2000).

The proposed model is integrated with a GIS for the convenient access to its
spatial data and geoprocessing functions. Table 1 lists the spatial variables used for
the data mining. The target variable is the urban development in 1988–1993, which
was obtained from change detection using the 1988 and 1993 TM images.

Proximity variables were obtained by calculating the distances to roads,
expressways, railways, and urban centres. These variables play an important role in
determining land-use conversion. For example, a higher development probability is
often associated with a site with a closer distance to major transportation routes
and urban centres. Proximity variables can be conveniently derived by using the
distance functions of GIS.

Neighbourhood conditions are essential to the determination of state conversion
of each cell during the iterations of CA. There is a higher development probability
if a site has a larger number of surrounding developed cells. The surrounding
developed cells are counted at each iteration.

land-use types. For example,

The physical attributes of a site also inﬂuence the development probability in an
urban simulation. The ﬁrst variable is
the
development probability in wetland will be different from that in cropland, even
though other conditions are the same. Information about land-use types was
obtained from the classiﬁcation of the remote-sensing image. The second variable is
related to the agricultural suitability which represents the productivity of a site. It
was obtained through GIS land evaluation (Yeh and Li 1998). The third variable is
associated with terrain features which pose constraints to urban development. The
layer of the slope was generated from the DEM model of GIS.

All these spatial data were converted to raster format to facilitate the calculation
and simulation. The resolution was ﬁxed at a ground resolution of 30 m2 to match
the resolution of the satellite TM images. Data mining was used to reconstruct the
rules that reveal
the relationships between these spatial variable and urban
development. The simulation assumes that the spatial relationship will not change,
although the global constraint (the amount of land-use conversion) may be subject
to ﬂuctuations.

Our previous study used only two satellite images to train the neural-network-
CA model for simulating future urban development (Li and Yeh 2001). It assumes
that the rate of urban growth is constant for all periods. This assumption may not

it does on the cases used in its construction. It is more
reasonable to assess the performance of the classiﬁer on new cases. In this study,
the empirical data from GIS and remote sensing were divided into two separate
sets. One was the training data set for deriving the rules, and the other was the test
data set for conﬁrming the performance of the classiﬁer.

Sampling techniques were also used to serve two main purposes in this study.
First, sampling techniques can help to explore a huge set of spatial data. It is
inefﬁcient to process the entire set of spatial data for data mining. Even though
See5 is relatively fast, a much longer time is needed for building decision trees,
especially when options such as boosting are employed. Second, it is undesirable to
use a whole set of data for mining because of spatial autocorrelation. Bias will be
introduced to the analysis results if the training data have a severe correlation.

The use of a smaller set of training cases may reduce the classiﬁer’s predictive
accuracy. We ﬁrst construct a classiﬁer from the sample and then assess the
classiﬁer on a test data set. Figure 5 shows the relationships between the increase in
sampling points and prediction error. It is clear that the prediction error can be
signiﬁcantly improved by using more sampling points within the range of 0–8% of
the training data. The prediction error is 35.2% by using 1% of the data, and it is
reduced to 25.0% by using 10% of the data. The improvement rates are insigniﬁcant

after the ﬁrst 10% of the data. Therefore, this study only used 20% sampled data to
derive the transition rules.

A technique known as ‘boosting’ has been developed in the ﬁeld of machine
learning. See5/C5.0 has incorporated this technique, adaptive boosting, to generate
several classiﬁers rather than one. First, a tree is generated as usual, which may
make mistakes in some cases in the data. When the second classiﬁer is constructed,
more attention is paid to these cases in an attempt to get them right. This is
repeated for n trials. When a new case is to be classiﬁed, each classiﬁer votes for its
predicted class, and the votes are counted to determine the ﬁnal class. Boosting can
reduce bias and avoid over-ﬁtting of decision trees (Haruno et al. 1999)

Lower error rates are expected by using this technique. The effect of boosting is
assessed by comparing the predictive errors from the boosting method and non-
boosting method. The prediction error is 21.2% after boosting is applied to the 10%
sampled data set. The error rate for the test cases was reduced by about 12%
compared with that of the original classiﬁer.

A very large and complex decision tree is often produced, and the tree may
overﬁt the training data. If the training data contain errors, overﬁtting the tree to
the data can lead to poor performance (Friedl et al. 1999). The original tree must be
pruned to minimize such a problem. See5 provides the pruning option for
simplifying decision trees but maintaining sufﬁcient accuracy. A large tree is ﬁrst
grown to ﬁt the data closely and then pruned by removing the unnecessary parts
which are predicted to have a relatively high error rate. A pruning rate of 25% was
used to consider the trade-off between tree accuracy and size.

3.3. Simulation results

The proposed model was tested by simulating the urban development in the
study area in 1988–2005. The observation data mainly include the 1988 and 1993
satellite TM images. The 1997 and 2001 images are just used for capturing the
urban development trend. The initial urban areas were based on the classiﬁcation of
the 1988 TM image. Figure 6 shows the development trajectory of the study area in
1988, 1993, 1997 and 2001 according to the classiﬁcation of satellite images.

Urban expansion was astonishing in 1988–1993 as the urban areas were more
than double during this short period. The rate of urban expansion decreased in the
later periods because of government intervention. If the projection of urban
development is based only on the 1988 and 1993 observation data, the simulated
urban areas will be much larger than the actual areas for the later periods.
Therefore, the total amount of urban areas in each period can be used as the global
constraint for urban simulation. This can ensure that the amount of the simulated
urban areas is equal to the amount of the actual urban areas. Given n iterations,
interpolation was carried out to derive the amount of conversion for each step from
t to tz1 (ﬁgure 3).

There are many iterations of simulation before the outcome is obtained. A
shorter interval between t and tz1 means that a larger number of iterations are
required. Although there is no consensus on exactly how many iterations should be
used, 100–200 of iterations are quite normal for producing a realistic simulation.
The subtle patterns cannot be produced if there are too few iterations. This is
because local interactions only take place at each iteration of urban simulation.

Table 2 lists the parameter values that were used in the simulation. There are
200 iterations in the simulation of urban growth for each period. The amount of
urban growth (DQt) for each period was obtained from the change detection of
remote sensing. The global constraint factor (bt) was calculated according to
equation (10).

The rule sets were obtained from the data-mining procedure using the See5
system. The following is part of the rule sets discovered by applying the data mining

Each applicable rule votes for its predicted class with a voting weight equal to
its conﬁdence value. The conﬁdence value is also automatically obtained by See5
during the data-mining process. The votes are summed up, and the class with the
highest total vote is chosen as the ﬁnal prediction. It is straightforward to use these
rule sets obtained from data mining as the transition rules for urban simulation.
These rule sets are very similar to the practical rules used by planners and decision-
makers. It
is much easier to understand these rule sets than mathematical
equations.

The amount of land-use conversion changes with time. bt is used to reﬂect the
changes in urban growth. The following additional rule is jointly used to decide the

The model simulates the urban growth of the study area in the period of
1988–1993, 1993–1997, and 1997–2001. The initial stage is based on the 1988 actual
urban areas detected from remote sensing. Figure 7 compares the simulated and
actual urban development in 1988–1993, 1993–1997, and 1997–2001. Figure 8 is a
prediction of urban development
in 2001–2005 based on the development
trajectory. The rate of urban expansion is much lower in this period than in
previous years.

3.4. Examining the validity of the model

It is unrealistic to reproduce the exact patterns of a natural phenomenon
because of its complexity and modelling limitations. However, the assessment of
goodness of ﬁt is still required to give a general indication of roughly how good the
simulation is compared with the actual development. A simple method to assess the
goodness of ﬁt is based on the spatial overlay between the actual and simulated
urban development (Li and Yeh 2002). In this study, the actual urban areas in 1993,
1997 and 2001 were obtained from the classiﬁcation of satellite TM images. The
simulated urban areas were compared with the actual urban areas using an overlay
analysis. Table 3 lists the overall accuracy obtained from the cross-tabulation of the
overlay analysis. The overall accuracy is 82.0% for simulating the urban growth in
1988–1993. It becomes 74.8% and 72.4% for simulating the urban growth in
1993–1997 and 1997–2001, respectively. Although the transition rules were derived
from the 1988–1993 images, we are still able to obtain a high simulation accuracy in
the simulation of urban development in 1993–1997 and 1997–2001. This is because
the urban development process captured by the transition rules has not changed
much.

The assessment of the goodness of ﬁt from spatial overlay is just based on a cell-
by-cell approach. It cannot provide any information about the morphology of the
urban spatial structures, such as connectivity, fractals, and compactness. Many
urban applications are usually concerned about the characteristics of spatial
structures. A visual comparison may sometimes provide more meaningful results
for calibrating CA models (Clarke et al. 1997, Ward et al. 2000). The visual
comparison of the actual with simulated urban development indicates that the
model is able to generate plausible simulation results (ﬁgure 7).

entropy (Yeh and Li 2001b), compactness index (Li and Yeh 2000), fractal
dimensions (White and Engelen 1993, Batty and Longley 1994), and Moran’s I (Wu
2002).

In this study, the indicator of Moran’s I was chosen for the assessment of the
aggregated patterns because of its simplicity. It is quite easy to calculate the
Moran’s I values in the GIS package, ARC/INFO GRID. Moran’s I is a useful
spatial indicator that can reveal the degree of spatial autocorrelation (Goodchild
1986). The indicator is able to estimate how close the simulated land-use pattern is
to the actual urban development (Wu 2002). The maximum value is one which
indicates absolute concentration of land use. A smaller value, which can be below
zero, indicates a more even distribution of land use.

Table 4 shows Moran’s I for the actual and simulated urban development in

1993, 1997 and 2001, respectively. There is a good conformity between the actual
and simulated urban development because they have similar values of Moran’s I for
each period. The analysis is consistent with the visual comparison. Urban
development sites in the earlier stage (1993) are relatively isolated because of the
prevailing urban sprawls. Urban developments tend to be more compact in the later
years as they continue to grow. According to Moran’s I, the simulated patterns
appear to be slightly more dispersed compared with the actual patterns for all
periods. This is probably because the simulation is affected by some randomness.
Observation data always have a larger time interval than that of simulation.
Interpolation is carried out to yield training data on a ﬁner timescale. A random
variable is used to decide the location of land-use conversion at each iteration. The
problem may be alleviated by using a shorter interval for satellite images. However,
this is subject to the availability of data.

Compared with the neural-network-based CA (Li and Yeh 2002), this model
also has some improvements in terms of accuracy. The overall accuracy is 0.79, and
Moran’s I is 0.40 for the previous model. This is probably because the explicit
transition rules are more easily adapted to complex relationships than mathematical
equations. Simulation accuracy also depends on the degree of complexity of the
study area. It is easy to understand that CA can have a better performance in a
more uniform and smaller area, such as a monocentric city or a highly developed
city. The geographical settings of this study area are fairly complicated, with
various geomorphologic features (e.g. mountains, alluvial plains, and rivers) and
many suburban centres (29 towns). A perfect simulation is impossible because of
the complexity. There are several difﬁculties in applying the heuristic approach to
the deﬁnition of transition rules in the areas of complex environmental settings.
However, data mining seems to be a much better option for reconstructing
transition rules under complex situations. In particular,
it can provide explicit
transition rules which are more easily understood by planners and decision-makers
than the mathematical equations derived by other methods.

4. Conclusion

Data mining, which is a rapidly expanding ﬁeld, can be applied to the discovery
of transition rules of CA. Research on modelling geographical phenomena in
various disciplines using CA is growing. Effective reconstruction of transition rules
is important for simulating complex natural systems. Reliable simulation results
cannot be achieved if the transition rules are not deﬁned in a systematic and
consistent way. This study demonstrates the potential of using data-mining
techniques in automatically deriving the transition rules of CA. The beneﬁts of this
method include a faster
rule-base construction, convenient calibration, and
transparent rule structures.

We have attempted to use an innovative method for directly deducing explicit
transition rules of CA based on data-mining techniques. Various transition rules
have been proposed from different studies. These transition rules are not
straightforward because they are mainly represented in the form of mathematical
equations (e.g. conversion matrices, linear equations, and logistic equations). They
are difﬁcult to understand and comprehend by planners and decision-makers.
Sometimes, complex relationships cannot be modelled by rigid mathematical

equations. The calibration of CA is also difﬁcult when complex mathematical
equations are adopted to estimate the probability of land-use conversion.

The data-mining procedure is convenient and efﬁcient. The explicit transition
rules can be instantly derived from a vast volume of geographical data by using
data-mining techniques. Remote sensing and GIS provide basic information about
spatial variables for data mining. This procedure can minimize the uncertainties
and time consumed in deﬁning and testing transition rules because they are
automatically reconstructed by machine learning. Calibration is automatically
carried out during the rule-induction process. This has signiﬁcant improvements in
the process of model building.

The experiments were carried out in a region of complicated environmental
settings. There are a variety of terrain features and many suburban centres. The
heuristic approach adopted by traditional CA has difﬁculties in deﬁning transition
rules and calibrating CA. The transition rules automatically induced from data
mining have been successfully applied to the urban simulation in the region. The
validity of the model has been assessed based on the visual comparison and
the indicator of Moran’s I. The assessment indicates good conformity between the
actual and simulated urban development.

Further studies should examine the inﬂuences of discrete time steps on
simulation outcomes. Experiments may be carried out on the search for the optimal
intervals of iterations and observations. This is useful for generating more accurate
simulation results. Model uncertainties should also be assessed for a better
understanding of the implications of simulation.

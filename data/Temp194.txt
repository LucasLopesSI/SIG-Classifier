INTRODUCTION

FIRST AND SECOND LAND UTILIZATION SURVEYS

There are many uses for land use mapping including:
to record the range and distribution of current human
activity across the landscape, identify patterns and inter-
relationships, and to help show change over time, to aid
better planning in the future. It was a failure of the early
land use mapping of Britain in the 1930s and 1960s that
they ‘failed to provide a consistent long-term monitoring
system for land use change’ (Perkins and Parry, 1996).

The importance of such mapping has a very real appli-
cation today with the increasing pressure for new homes,
especially affordable homes in the South East, the changing
nature of the industrial infrastructure and the pressure on
the rural landscape.

In a recent Land Use Change Statistics release (LUCS-17,
May 2002) the Of(cid:142)ce of the Deputy Prime Minister
reported on behalf of UK government on the location of
new homes built in 2001. The key results of this report
were that:

.

In 2001, 61% of new dwellings were provided on
previously-developed land.

. The proportions continued to vary regionally, from
the highest proportion in London (90%), to less than
50% in the North East, South West and East Midlands.
. Over the four years up to 2000, some 3% of new
dwellings were built within Green Belts (or
land
around urban areas protected from over-development),
but three-(cid:142)fths of these were on previously developed
land (otherwise known as PDLs).

. Over the four years up to 2000, about 11% of new
dwellings were built within the Environment Agency
Flood Risk Areas.

This is just one example where the need for de(cid:142)nitive land
use information in statistical and map form was clear for
both central and local government as well as to support
commercial planning to support government policies.
These types of requirements led to a study in the 1990s
which established a national speci(cid:142)cation for Land Use
Mapping, called the National Land Use Database (NLUD)
speci(cid:142)cation, drawing on current requirements and previous
mapping programmes.

This paper has a brief overview of previous land use
mapping programmes and then considers how the current
NLUD speci(cid:142)cation is being used to create new land use
mapping in the UK.

Land use mapping in the UK has a rather fragmented
history. It was not until the 1930s that the (cid:142)rst com-
prehensive land use mapping was undertaken for the UK.
This was primarily the work of a group led by L. Dudley
Stamp who launched the First Land Utilisation Survey
in 1930, which attempted to record the current use
of every acre across England, Wales and Scotland. The
resulting maps were published from 1933 onwards at a
scale of 1:63 360 (1 inch to the mile) and were based on
the Ordnance Survey outline topographic map series at
that scale (Figure 1). A similar map series was published
for Northern Ireland by the Geographical Association of
Northern Ireland and the Department of Geography,
Queens University Belfast.

The First Land Utilisation Survey really focused on rural
areas, with urban areas characterized as ‘land agriculturally
unproductive’. The only urban area features that were
extracted were allotments and areas of commercial horti-
culture. The maps were supported by a series of reports —
The Land of Britain — which discussed the land cover at
the time of the survey. A series of smaller scale maps were
also published, such as the Land Utilisation Map (1944)
and the Land Classi(cid:142)cation Map (1944–45).

The Director General of the Ordnance Survey at the
time of First Land Utilisation Survey, Sir Charles Close,
expressed a view that such land use mapping might one
day replace the topographic map as the base information.
However, due to lack of governmental support and the
problems of maintaining the base, this type of survey was
used less than many anticipated (Perkins and Barry, 1996).
The over-riding achievement of the Stamp survey was
that it achieved virtually complete national survey of land
cover, a feat never attempted before (Stamp, 1962).

A Second Land Utilisation Survey was initiated in 1960
under the direction of Alice Coleman. The survey again
involved considerable (cid:142)eld collection with a (cid:142)nal classi-
(cid:142)cation consisting of 64 categories. The survey was based
on 1:25 000 series mapping and included a comparative
representation with the Stamp survey and a more detailed
second level. Due to the cost and lack of governmental
support only 120 sheets were published, the last in 1977
(Figure 2). However
remained the most complete
it
inventory of land cover for rural areas until 1993.

A number of other land cover and vegetation surveys
have been undertaken by various agencies, including English

Nature, for environmental and conservation applications.
These have resulted in a series of small scale or localized
maps or geographic databases.

Probably the most signi(cid:142)cant development was the Land
Cover database published by the Institute for Terrestrial
Ecology (ITE) in 1990. This was followed by an updated
version published by the now renamed Centre for Ecology
and Hydrology. This was referred to as the Land Cover
Map 2000 (LMC2000). The most signi(cid:142)cant feature of
this database was that it was primarily derived from classi(cid:142)ed
satellite imagery, veri(cid:142)ed by (cid:142)eld checking.

URBAN LAND USE MAPPING

Mapping land use and change in the urban environment
has remained an area of less focus. Despite the increased
public and governmental concern over loss of rural environ-
ments by urban growth since the 1960s there have has
been little emphasis on mapping urban land use.

In 1969 a survey was undertaken at the behest of the
Department of the Environment to map (cid:142)ve urban land
use types at a minimum resolution of 5 hectares. This
was principally undertaken from 1:60 000 black and white
RAF aerial photography. The survey was based on the now

redundant 15-category National Land Use Classi(cid:142)cation
(HMSO, 1975). The resulting 124 maps were published
at 1:63 360 scale as the Developed Areas Survey.

The National Land Use Classi(cid:142)cation form the basis
of the Land Use Change Statistics (LUCS) that all local
authorities were required to supply at a district
level
following a directive from the Department of the Environ-
ment (DoE) in 1974. These proved dif(cid:142)cult to use in
any meaningful way and in 1985, DoE commissioned
the Ordnance Survey to collect LUCS. The resulting 24-
category classi(cid:142)cation should have provided the basis for
urban land use maps but only county level maps have ever
been published (Bibby and Shepherd, 1991). The LUCS
classi(cid:142)cation however formed the basis of the NLUD
classi(cid:142)cation published in 2000.

NATIONAL LAND USE DATABASE (NLUD)

The National Land Use Database programme was established
by the then Department of the Environment
in early
1990s (Harrison and Garland, 2001). The initial research
looked at the paucity of current information then available
on land use in England and identi(cid:142)ed the need for an
integrated system of information on land use from which
to monitor change (Dunn and Harrison, 1994).

Section 1: A New Generation of Land Use Mapping

123

Figure 2. Extract from Second Land Utilisation Survey

The principal outcome of the programme to date has
been the creation of the National Land Use Database
(NLUD) speci(cid:142)cation. This has three levels although the
(cid:142)rst two are the most signi(cid:142)cant, with 13 classes at level 1
and 52 classes at level 2. This has been published and is
widely recognized as being the de facto national standard
for land future land use products. The class breakdown is
shown in Table 1.

There have subsequently been a series of government
funded studies to test different automatic and semi-automatic
methods of capturing land use information linked to the
Ordnance Survey large scale mapping base. These studies
highlighted several problems in any form of automatic
classi(cid:142)cation when using a combination of mapping and
supplementary sources,
in particular highlighting issues
of consistency and accuracy and the weaknesses in the
Ordnance Survey Landline product when used for this
purpose. However this latter is at least partly addressed
with the introduction of
the Ordnance Survey’s new
structured large scale database, initially known as DNF but
now branded MasterMap.

A series of studies are now focusing on the methodologies
for associating land use with MasterMap. The additional
sources being considered are address data in the form of
Address-Point and Code-Point from the Ordnance Survey
and business codes from the Valuation Of(cid:142)ce’s NNDR
database in urban areas, and the LMC2000 data together
with woodland information from the Forestry Commission
in rural areas. The results so far published for these auto-

matic processes even for Level 1 classi(cid:142)cations have not
been altogether encouraging, with accuracies of less than
90% for rural areas and less than 75% for urban areas
(Harrison and Garland, 2001).

The other initiative that emerged from this programme
was the classi(cid:142)cation of Previously Developed Land (PDL).
A project was started in 1998 following the government’s
policy initiative to develop signi(cid:142)cant amounts of new
housing on ‘brown(cid:142)eld’ sites. As a result of this it was
possible to publish estimates of the total area of previously
developed vacant and derelict land. Local governments
are now collecting this data for their own areas, although
progress to a standard speci(cid:142)cation is patchy (NLUD,
2000).

It should be made clear that the purpose of the NLUD
programme is not to undertake the Land Use classi(cid:142)cation,
but rather to prepare an overall framework and national
that other
speci(cid:142)cation together with methodologies
agencies, local government or commercial companies can
adopt.

CITIES REVEALED LAND USE PROGRAMME

With the publication of version 3.3 of the NLUD classi-
(cid:142)cation and the fragmented collection of brown(cid:142)eld site
and derelict land data as part of the government’s Planning
Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing (PPG3) (DETR, 2000)
it became clear that there was a need for a comprehensive
urban land use mapping programme.

In 2000, the GeoInformation Group launched an aerial
survey acquisition programme with the aim of collecting
photography suitable as the basis for an urban land use
survey. The survey was divided into two levels, the (cid:142)rst
being the NLUD 52 category classi(cid:142)cation (version 3.3).

While this classi(cid:142)cation provided more detail in urban areas
than previous surveys had done, it was still very limited in
its classi(cid:142)cation of residential properties. The second level
was therefore a building classi(cid:142)cation based on age and
type (Table 2).

The resulting databases were compiled to the Ordnance
Survey large scale mapping database Landline. The data
were published in blocks of 5 km by 2.5 km equating to
the northern or southern half of a standard Ordnance
Survey 1:10 000 map tile.

The land use was initially compiled by photo inter-
pretation with some supporting documentation. This was
undertaken using three-dimensional
interpretation from
the newly acquired high resolution surveys of the main
urban areas (cid:143)own over the period 2000–02 (with West
and South Yorkshire and Bristol due for completion in
2003). The surveys were (cid:143)own at 1:5000–1:7000 scale
and the resulting digital ortho databases were at 12.5 cm
resolution, an unprecedented level of detail for UK urban
areas. The imagery was also of a date to be compatible
with the UK census 2001 and could therefore be used for
comparative studies. The initial photo interpretation was
checked through a process of (cid:142)eld survey and corroboration
with selected third party datasets.

The (cid:142)rst database blocks were published for London,
Manchester and Birmingham in the second half of 2001.
The enormity of the task presented in trying to compile
a full land use survey using 52 categories can be shown
when looking at the number of polygons that had to be
classi(cid:142)ed. In London a single 12.5 sq km block would
average between 56 000 and 79 000 polygons, with some
exceeding 100 000 polygons. London alone consists of
1.2 million separate residential building polygons that
require a building type and age classi(cid:142)cation.

The resulting database can be used in map form for
small area studies or over view mapping. The examples in
Figure 3 are from Southwark and show the detail for a
small area, while Figure 4 is the Land Use map for the
London borough of Brent.

An extra layer added to the Cities Revealed Land Use
data has been building height. This creates the opportunity
of being able to enhance the land use classi(cid:142)cation further
with information on change of use through different levels
of a building. This would be particularly valuable in areas
such as traditional high streets where buildings can have
multiple functions including retail, of(cid:142)ce and residential.
This level of complexity is not accommodated within the
current NLUD speci(cid:142)cation.

PROBLEMS IN URBAN AREAS

It was clear from the outset that the NLUD classi(cid:142)cation
at the 52 class level presented some severe limitations,
particularly in the way it could be used to accurately
represent the complexities of the urban environment.

The fundamental issue centred around the question of
how accurately land use can be depicted in urban areas and
what limitations were introduced by using both Landline
and NLUD. This then had implications for how general
land use patterns were represented and what this might
mean for the end user.

The clearest example of this is that NLUD consists of
just one generic category for residential land use. As this
inevitably represents a large part of any urban area it is
likely to obscure important structural patterns. This was the

driver for creating a companion classi(cid:142)cation of residential
buildings by age and type.

Furthermore, within the adopted process, which initially
used a polygonized version of Landline, there was clearly
going to be a need to make dif(cid:142)cult interpretative decisions.
As an example a single building represented by a single
bounding polygon may have several land uses associated
with it. The ground (cid:143)oor may be retail with of(cid:142)ces above
and possibly residential accommodation above that. The
dominant use on any one level may vary as will the use on
different (cid:143)oors. In a typical Victorian shopping high street
the principal land use characteristic may be retail, but the
dominant land use in terms of (cid:143)oor space may be of(cid:142)ce or
residential (Figure 5). The question then relates to what is
the overall character of that area to be re(cid:143)ected in the
selected classi(cid:142)cation.

In consideration of this issue it was necessary to set
down an underlying principle for the land use data that the
resulting interpretations must re(cid:143)ect the overall character
of the urban environment under consideration.

One of the biggest problems in undertaking a land use
survey for urban areas is accounting for the complexity
in both plan and elevation. Unfortunately, the Landline
mapping is essentially a two dimensional representation of
a complex three-dimensional environment and the NLUD
classi(cid:142)cation does not accommodate mixed land uses.

Essentially therefore it was decided that the land use
would in the (cid:142)rst instance be that of a ‘Ground Floor’
classi(cid:142)cation. However, this had to be quali(cid:142)ed based on the
need to accommodate the principle of ‘overall character’.

The best example of this is when creating the land use
classi(cid:142)cation for the City of London. By any stretch of the
imagination the heart of the city can only be regarded as
predominantly of(cid:142)ce accommodation with retail elements
supporting this dominant usage, located primarily at ground
level along the main roads. However most of the big city
of(cid:142)ce blocks, which have shops on the ground (cid:143)oor, at
least in the front part of the building, if classi(cid:142)ed based
on ground (cid:143)oor use would become retail. This would
change the character of the city suggesting in percentage
land use terms that retail is more dominant than of(cid:142)ces
and the character would be similar to that of the West End
of London. An example of this problem is shown in
Figure 6.

This problem is compounded by Landline. In many cases
single large buildings many storeys high are represented by
a single bounding polygon. Small retail units are often not
differentiated and as a consequence a whole building can
have only a single land use.

MIXED USE CATEGORIES

The urban environment is dominated by mixed usage. Some
of this usage relates to different levels while other mixed
uses are integrated within a single area.

It is a signi(cid:142)cant weakness of the current NLUD classi-
(cid:142)cation that it does not accommodate mixed-use classes.
While it might not be prudent to have an endless range of
options, there are some key ones which in complex urban
environments go a long way to help represent the character
of the area. The following is an example.

A small inner city site, made up of several linked but
distinctive buildings can be seen to have several activities
going on at the same time. One building is given over to
storage, another to manufacturing or processing of some

sort and another to of(cid:142)ce. Such sites are often clearly
owned by a single company or organization, and the use is
effectively an integration of industry (11.1), of(cid:142)ce (11.2)
and storage (11.4). An example is shown in Figure 7.

In the UK Land Utilisation Surveys of the 1930s and
1960s–80s, the urban environment is classi(cid:142)ed using the
term commercial and residential. While this broad classi-
(cid:142)cation does nothing to address the problems described
here, the use of the term commercial as a mixed-use
category may provide a solution to some of the current
problems. The idea that a single site which is owned by

one company or organization and which is dedicated solely
to the business of the organization but might include a
building for manufacturing, a storage building and of(cid:142)ces.
It would be inappropriate on many smaller inner city sites,
and often dif(cid:142)cult, to differentiate the different uses, but
such sites could well be classi(cid:142)ed under the more generic
term of ‘commercial’.

SPECIFIC ISSUES WITHIN NLUD

In addition to these more generic issues there are a
range of very speci(cid:142)c problems encountered when applying
NLUD to the urban environment. For example banks
present a particular type of problem. Under the guidance
notes for NLUD banks should be classi(cid:142)ed as Institutional
Buildings (10.1). However it seems much more appropriate
to classify banks under a retail (11.3) classi(cid:142)cation.

time (a few hours

Temporary structures like markets exist for only a short
period of
in a day) but re-occur
regularly. As such they are an integral part of the urban
fabric, often being key focal points within the inner urban
neighbourhood structures. However under the current
NLUD classi(cid:142)cation it is impossible to represent these
temporary retail areas.

One of the most dif(cid:142)cult areas to show are extensive
high rise estates, particularly those developed in the 1960s
and later, where there are open areas, mainly laid to grass.
These are essentially public access spaces for walking dogs
or for children to play on. They are intended for the use
of local residents and could be construed as part of the
residential use of that area. However as they are accessible
to the public and there is a particular interest in designating
these areas because of maintenance issues, they were classi(cid:142)ed
as Outdoor Recreation (7.2) and not part of the residential
classi(cid:142)cation.

The category of institutional buildings includes many
public service buildings. Town Halls were considered to
be Institutional because of their public access role, whereas
other council of(cid:142)ces were merely classed as of(cid:142)ces (11.2)
as indicated by the NLUD guidance notes.

There are many other examples that could be given and
the compiler of the land use is drawn back to the principles
laid down at the start of the collection process, in this case
namely ‘general character’ and ‘ground (cid:143)oor use’. It also
depends on the perceived applications of the data and the
ability to collect the necessary information to make an
accurate interpretation.

QUALITY OF LAND USE DATABASES

There is an important issue for users in being able to
understand the overall quality of databases. This has to
take into consideration not just the issues associated with
the classi(cid:142)cation and base mapping but the ability of a
team of interpreters to create an accurate and consistent
dataset. Many users have asked for an accuracy statement
to help understand the quality of the resulting maps.

There are several important issue associated with making
statements about accuracy. It may be possible to classify
95% of all polygons accurately but the 5% error rate can be
many thousands of polygons. What is important is that
within any mapping dataset there are many small polygons
that are largely unimportant in the overall
land classi(cid:142)-
cation. However getting the ‘one’ major polygon incorrect
could have major implications — a wrongly classi(cid:142)ed
building.

Where the base information is extracted from aerial photo-
graphy achieving accuracy and consistency is founded on
the experience of the photo interpreters. They have to

have strong photo interpretation (PI) skills but associated
with this is a good background in related subjects such as
architecture, social history and planning, and wherever
possible enhance this with local background knowledge.

The building up of experience and the creation of an
individuals own reference database when undertaking the
PI is critical to this. Hence experienced teams with several
studies to their name will give much better results.

MOVING TOWARDS LAND USE AND LAND COVER

As a (cid:142)nal comment on the NLUD speci(cid:142)cation it is worth
noting that a basic criticism of the version 3.3 speci(cid:142)cation
is that it confuses land use and land cover. In a draft
version 4 published in 2002, an attempt has been made to
differentiate these two elements within the classi(cid:142)cation.
These changes do little however to solve the urban land
use classi(cid:142)cation problems identi(cid:142)ed above.

APPLICATIONS OF LAND USE MAPS

Having described the current development of
land use
maps based on NLUD it is perhaps pertinent to add a (cid:142)nal
comment on the application of such databases and the
derived maps. The early adopters of this type of data have
been local government particularly in the urban centres,
for a wide variety of uses. These focus on urban planning
and regeneration, both in terms of longer term strategic
plans based on structural reviews and shorter term action
plans for speci(cid:142)c urban regeneration schemes.

The data has also been used to support crime and
disorder studies, deprivation studies, open space and
environmental reviews in urban areas. Increasingly rural
local government is showing an interest in their land use,
especially in support of the current rural/urban balance
debates.

Central government has

identi(cid:142)ed a number of
applications for regional planning especially through the
Government Of(cid:142)ces and police forces are using the data to
support crime alleviation programmes.

Many of the applications simply use the data in the form
of maps for visual interpretation, just like the example of
the London borough of Brent shown here. However the
data can be used to do more detailed analysis in terms
numbers of buildings, area covered by speci(cid:142)c uses and
comparative studies between land use types.

Finally, and it a strange twist to the saga of land use
mapping in the UK, the growth in the use of land use data
coupled with the requirements on local government to
identify potentially contaminated land has led to a renewed
interest in the earlier land use studies. In particular there is
strong interest in the First Land Utilisation Survey which
has been converted into a digital map database and is now
available on CD-ROM!

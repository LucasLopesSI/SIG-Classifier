Abstract

Online  representations  of  places  are  becoming  pivotal  in 

informing our understanding of urban life. Content produc-

tion  on  online  platforms  is  grounded  in  the  geography  of 

their users and their digital infrastructure. These constraints 

shape place representation, that is, the amount, quality, and 

type of digital information available in a geographic area. In 

this article we study the place representation of user-gener-

ated content (UGC) in Los Angeles County, relating the spa-

tial distribution of the data to its geo-demographic context. 

Adopting  a  comparative  and  multi-platform  approach,  this 

quantitative  analysis  investigates  the  spatial  relationship 

between  four  diverse  UGC  datasets  and  their  context  at 

the census tract level  (about  685,000  geo-located  tweets, 

9,700  Wikipedia  pages,  4  million  OpenStreetMap  objects, 

and 180,000 Foursquare venues). The context includes the 

ethnicity,  age,  income,  education,  and  deprivation  of  resi-

dents, as well as public infrastructure. An exploratory spatial 

analysis and regression-based models indicate that the four 

UGC  platforms  possess  distinct  geographies  of  place  rep-

resentation. To a moderate extent, the presence of Twitter, 

OpenStreetMap, and Foursquare data is influenced by pop-

ulation density, ethnicity, education, and income. However, 

each platform responds to different socio-economic factors 

and  clusters  emerge  in  disparate  hotspots.  Unexpectedly, 

Twitter  data  tend  to  be  located  in  denser,  more  deprived 

areas, and the geography of Wikipedia appears peculiar and 

harder to explain. These trends are compared with previous 

findings for the area of Greater London.

Online platforms enable users to produce an unprecedented variety of geo-referenced information, describing 

places and their locales and activities. Projects and services like Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap (OSM), and Twitter 

produce valuable data that are deployed in the social sciences to investigate geographic phenomena (e.g., Wang, 

Phillips, Small, & Sampson, 2018; Zagheni, Garimella, & Weber, 2014). The rapid expansion in information produc-

tion of the last decade includes phenomena that have been described as spatial crowdsourcing, volunteered geo-

graphic information (VGI), spatial social media, as well as big data (See et al., 2016). In this article we use the term 

user-generated content (UGC) as it appropriately captures the diversity of spatial content produced by web users.

While such UGC sources are still popular, most research relies on isolated platforms, overlooking the geo-de-

mographic context in which the production process takes place. Understanding how local geographical settings 

influence UGC production is critical to support its appropriate usage in research. Studies in internet geography 

and data science have tended to focus at the global level, for example studying digital divides between countries 

(Graham, De Sabbata, & Zook, 2015). However, a higher proportion of UGC is produced within cities, rather than 

in rural areas (Hecht & Stephens, 2014), and analyses at a finer granularity are needed to account for the intrinsic 

heterogeneity of this kind of data.

Among the many facets of informational geographies that can be operationalized, we consider place represen-

tation as the overall information available in a target geographic area for a given data source (Ballatore and De 

Sabbata 2018). The representation of place is a central problem in GIScience (Purves, Winter, & Kuhn, 2019), and 

UGC represents an important source of information about places. Data sources vary dramatically with respect to 

thematic, spatial, and temporal coverage, including, for example, geo-tagged photographs and articles about local 

monuments. Quantifying place representation is also useful to note areas of unexpected data scarcity, which is 

important when studying spatial phenomena (Robinson, 2019). To study place with UGC, it is crucial to know its 

intrinsic spatial structure and the factors that shape it. For this reason, comparing results across geographical lo-

cations, as we do in this article between Los Angeles and London, is important to establish to what extent factors 

tend to be global or place-specific.

This  article  contributes  to  our  understanding  of  the  informational  dimension  of  place  by  comparing  spa-

tial  UGC  sources  to  their  socio-economic  context  that  constrains  the  production  process.  In  a  cross-platform 

comparison, we analyze four UGC sources, including geo-located tweets, Wikipedia articles, OSM objects, and 
Foursquare venues. These data sources are extremely popular among researchers,1  are easily accessible, and have 

specific geographies and biases that tend to be overlooked. As a study area, we consider 2,585 spatial units in Los 

Angeles County, each including about 3,700 people on average. This large, diverse, and complex area is home to 

about 10.1 million residents, and has been providing a rich context for the study of urban inequalities for gener-

ations of social scientists (Davis, 2006). The UGC sources are spatially related and quantitatively compared with 

authoritative sources of place information, such as the US census variables, deprivation index, and federal poverty 

statistics. The infrastructural context is included by considering the points of interest from the County's Location 

Management System (LMS). This study addresses the following research questions with quantitative methods:

RQ1 

What  are  the  similarities  and  differences  between  the  geographies  of  the  UGC  sources  (Twitter, 

RQ2 

What is the relationship between place representation in UGC and its socio-economic and infrastructural 

Wikipedia,  and  Foursquare,  and  OSM)?

context at the spatial level?

RQ3 

RQ4 

Is there a relationship between socio-economic deprivation and place representation in UGC?

What are the similarities and differences between the information geographies of this case study and 

other known areas (Los Angeles and London)?

Building on our prior research on Greater London (Ballatore & De Sabbata, 2018), this study contributes to the 

knowledge of the geographies of UGC, providing findings about what areas are over- and under-represented in 

these popular data sources. For the sake of replicability, in accordance with data source licenses, the data used in 

the study are made available online (https ://github.com/sdesa bbata/ Urban Infor matio nGeog raphies). This analysis 

of digital divides and “informational ghettos” (Shaw & Graham, 2017, p. 4) can identify data-poor areas that can 

persist even in global cities like Los Angeles. It is important to note that this study does not aim to study either 

social or natural phenomena using UGC as a data source, but analyzes the data production itself. In the context of 

research about places, UGC can provide signals of other phenomena (e.g., geo-located pictures as a signal of public 

interest in a location), but its production can also be seen as a distinct phenomenon that occurs in a constrained 

context. The stakeholders of this place representation study are researchers and users of UGC, who can benefit 

from new knowledge of UGC's geographical structure and representativeness, evaluating its fitness for purpose. 

Mapping place representation can also inform producers and platform owners, who can embed more equal place 

representation in the platforms, particularly in critical applications (Schnebele & Cervone, 2013).

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes related work in the areas of UGC 

and its socio-economic dimensions. The datasets used to characterize the informational geography of the study 

area  are  described  in  Section  3,  including  UGC  and  authoritative  sources.  Section  4  describes  the  analysis  of 

Twitter, Wikipedia, Foursquare, and OSM data located in Los Angeles County, starting with an exploratory analy-

sis, a spatial autocorrelation analysis, and then continuing with a set of regression models. Section 5 summarizes 

and discusses the study findings, while conclusions are drawn and future work directions suggested in Section 6.

Place is a central notion in human geography, and poses challenges to the traditional foundations of GIScience 

(Ballatore 2016). To most geographers, place is mainly an experiential and phenomenological concept, making it 

hard to represent in reference systems that were conceived to master Euclidean or geodesic space. According to 

Agnew  (2011),  “places  are  specific  time-space  configurations  made  up  of  the  intersection  of  many  encounters 

between ‘actants’ (people and things)” (p. 325). The notion of platial information has been coined to refer to more 

qualitative descriptions of places, contrasted with geometrical and topological representations (Ballatore & Jokar 

Arsanjani, 2019). In this sense, as recently expressed by Purves et al. (2019), the representation of place needs not 

novel models, but appropriate combinations of existing ones, such as objects, networks, and fields. Once a precise 

epistemic  cut  is  chosen,  configurations  of  people  and  things  can  be  represented  and  processed  appropriately, 

capturing these dynamics in data sources.

2.1 | Place and data

The aim of disciplines like urban planning, human geography, and sociology is to understand how places function in 

terms of human activities, from a variety of complementary perspectives. To study places, data can be collected by 

eliciting responses from people, for example in the case of traditional social scientific methods, or with automated, 

ambient approaches. The emergence of UGC in the mid-2000s has provided novel digital routes to reach place from 

space, ranging from photo sharing and micro-messaging to collaborative cartography (Kitchin & McArdle, 2016).

After a decade of research, much is known about UGC. Some of these sources aim at a homogeneous spatial 

coverage, while others embed some locational information, but without a spatial objective (Antoniou et al., 2010). 

Contributors to Wikipedia and OSM, for example, purposely aim to include all cities in the world in a systematic 

way, while geo-located tweets and Instagram photos are the by-product of a mediated communication process 

between users, which can then be used to study spatial collective behaviors and human dynamics.

BALLATORE And dE SABBATA4  |    

Although these sources of digital information enable ways to understand places in their changing character-

istics and interactions (Redi, Aiello, Schifanella, & Quercia, 2018), their intrinsic limitations should not be over-

looked. The geography of these datasets can be explored in terms of access (presence of digital infrastructure 

in a place), participation (who is contributing locally or non-locally), and representation (how much information is 

generated about a place) (Graham et al. 2015). Much research focuses on the participation and production geogra-

phy, studying contributor communities. Different UGC platforms attract different user groups in terms of gender, 

age, income, education, area of residence, and motivations, constraining the characteristics of the data (Acheson, 

De Sabbata, and Purves 2015). Detailed market research by the Pew Research Center traces the demographic 

composition of online platforms over time (Smith & Anderson, 2018). Exceptions can be found (Ballatore & Jokar 

Arsanjani, 2019), but contributor communities tend to be skewed toward wealthy, educated, white male users in 

the Global North (Crampton et al., 2013).

2.2 | UGC platforms

This study includes four UGC platforms, ranging from privately owned social media (Twitter and Foursquare) to 

commons-based collective editing projects (OSM and Wikipedia). Considering the heterogeneity and dynamic na-

ture of UGC, it is not possible to obtain a representative probability sample of all existing UGC sources. For this rea-

son, this selection is inevitably a non-probability sample, which combines convenience sampling (i.e., sources that 

are accessible) and purposive sampling (diverse sources that are of interest to broad communities of researchers).

These four platforms cover different ontological dimensions of place representation. OSM and Wikipedia aim 

to systematically map stable geographic objects. Foursquare venues also aim at completeness, although limited 

to a narrower set of objects (e.g., cafés and restaurants), while check-ins represent user presence at the venues 

(and are not included in the study). Finally, the geography of geo-located tweets differs radically from that of the 

other sources, as they capture the presence and activity of users in the target area. The content of tweets may or 

may not refer to objects in the area, and we consider this aspect outside of the scope of the study—for this facet 

of Twitter data, see Hahmann, Purves, and Burghardt (2014).

At the time of writing, these data sources are freely accessible through either data dumps or proprietary ap-

plication programming interfaces (APIs), with different constraints. Wikipedia and OSM data can be accessed in 

their entirety, while Twitter allows access to a sample from the stream of current data (access to historical data 

is possible, but not free). The Foursquare Places API has a free option with a limit on the number of queries per 

second. The terms of use of each source vary, and it is generally forbidden either to republish the data or derive 

new datasets from them. It is important to note that this constraint limits the replicability of the study, but not its 

reproducibility (Ostermann & Granell, 2017). Data from other popular platforms, such as Instagram and Facebook, 

were not included in the study as they are not currently accessible to researchers.

As of 2018, Twitter was used by 21% of US adults, particularly in the 18–29 age group (36% of online adults), 

and among college educated users (29% of online adults) (Greenwood, Perrin, & Duggan, 2018). As Blank and Lutz 

(2017) forcefully argued, Twitter users are actually not statistically representative of any particular population, 

but their large number (about 330 million users) and the low cost of access to data samples  attract researchers. 

From a spatial perspective, 0.85% of tweets are tagged with geo-coordinates, which amounts to roughly 4 million 

tweets a day, produced by a population only marginally different from the overall platform population (Sloan & 

Morgan, 2015). It must be noted that the use of geo-coordinates is in decline, replaced by a vaguer place field (e.g., 

“San Francisco” instead of a precise geo-location), mainly in relation to user privacy.

Geo-located  tweets  have  been  widely  used  in  spatial  research,  tracing  urban  functional  areas  (Lansley  & 

Longley, 2016), geo-demographic groups and connectedness (Longley & Adnan, 2016), local activities and inter-

actions (Steiger, Westerholt, Resch, & Zipf, 2015), urban mobility patterns (Wang et al., 2018), and potential areas 

of urban regeneration (Martí, García-Mayor, & Serrano-Estrada, 2019). Using an approach similar to our study, Li, 

BALLATORE And dE SABBATA    |  5

Goodchild, and Xu (2013) explored the spatio-temporal distribution of tweets and Flickr photos in California at the 

county level, showing that photos are denser near natural attractions and that tweets tend to originate from areas 

with residents who are more educated and more affluent than average. This study adopts a problematic method-

ology, modeling the relationships between variables at a very large scale in an unclear way. By contrast, our study 

adopts a much finer spatial resolution (census tracts), and includes more variables and platforms.

Wikipedia is the second UGC source in this study. Despite a prolonged decline in the number of contributors, 

it is one of the top ten most visited websites worldwide, and hosts 5.8 million articles in English, edited by about 

130,000 each month active editors, of whom 84% are male (https ://web.archi ve.org/web/20180 50516 3037/https 

://www.wired.com/2016/01/at-15-wikip edia-is-final ly-findi ng-its-way-to-the-truth ).  From  a  geographical  per-

spective, in 2013, about 730,000 articles in English were associated with a geo-location. As Graham, Straumann, 

and Hogan (2015) pointed out, most editing occurs in the Global North, including that of articles about places in 

the Global South, with a deep bias toward contributions from Western European and North American editors.

The  third  UGC  source  is  OpenStreetMap,  one  of  the  most  successful  collaborative  mapping  platforms. 

One million unique users contributed to its global vector dataset, which comprises 5.1 billion points and 570 

million  polygons  and  polylines  (https ://web.archi ve.org/web/20190 22111 3106/https ://blog.opens treet map.

org/2018/03/18/1-milli on-map-contr ibutors). OSM data found its way as a spatial data source for many non-

profit and commercial services, providing street networks and points of interest to countless research projects 

(e.g.,  Bright,  De  Sabbata,  Lee,  Ganesh,  &  Humphreys,  2018)  (https ://web.archi ve.org/web/20171 20613 0620/

http://wiki.opens treet map.org/wiki/Research).  Although  OSM  purports  to  map  the  world  systematically,  its 

coverage is highly uneven. In their study of Greater London, Mashhadi, Quattrone, and Capra (2013) observed 

contextual factors that correlate with coverage, finding a relationship with population density and distance from 

the center, with heteroscedasticity between Inner and Outer London. In a case study in Germany, the vitality of 

OSM mapping correlates positively with relatively high population density, high income, high rate of overnight 

stays, and high number of foreigners (Arsanjani & Bakillah, 2015).

Finally, we include Foursquare data. Launched in 2009 as a location-based service, Foursquare allows users to 

“check in” into venues, such as restaurants, cafés, and bars, enabling a novel mode of collective location-sharing. As 

of 2018, the platform claims a global reach of 3 billion visits per month, 105 million mapped venues, and 25 million 

active users (https ://web.archi ve.org/web/20180 22018 3737/https ://techc runch.com/2018/01/19/fours quare-is-

final ly-provi ng-its-dollar-value ). From 2014, the company transitioned from a consumer app to an enterprise plat-

form for location intelligence and analytics. Foursquare behavior has been studied as a source of human mobility 

patterns (Noulas, Scellato, Mascolo, & Pontil, 2011). A user study showed the diverse social and cultural motivations 

of users who share their location by checking into venues (Lindqvist, Cranshaw, Wiese, Hong, & Zimmerman, 2011).

Much of the aforementioned UGC research aims to understand the characteristics, motivation, and behavior of 

data producers, while place representation has been addressed only marginally. To the best of our knowledge, no 

study has comparatively explored the properties of diverse UGC datasets at this spatial resolution, and their relation-

ship with the socio-economic and infrastructural context in which the data is produced. In addition, the relationship 

between Twitter, Wikipedia, Foursquare, and OSM from a spatial perspective has not been directly studied before.

2.3 | Studying Los Angeles

This article focuses on Los Angeles County as a case study. The LA agglomeration provides a suitable context 

to explore the relationship between UGC and geographic context at the urban scale for several reasons. LA has 

fascinated generations of human geographers and urban planners, who explored it as a unique, global, complex, 

fragmented, and extraordinarily heterogeneous city, with some even selecting it as the “paradigmatic American 

metropolis” (Curry & Kenney, 1999). The Central City area is the historical core of LA, from which urbanization 

extends 100 km in all directions. Auto-driven urbanization has resulted in a compact inner city with a minority

areas (Soja, 2014).

population,  surrounded  by  a  low-density  suburban  sprawl  dominated  by  a  more  affluent  middle  class.  Central 

Los Angeles has the largest concentration of offices and jobs in southern California. In recent decades, LA has 

developed the unusual urban form of city region or regional city, in which it is hard to delineate urban and suburban 

Since the 1980s, Soja (2014) argues, the once marginal LA has become “the focal point for the development of 

new and widely recognized urban theories.” (p. 13). According to him, the development of LA anticipated trends seen 

globally,  including  suburbanization,  deindustrialization,  and  new  sprawling  peripheries  becoming  more  dominant 

than decaying inner cities. City of Quartz (Davis, 2006) proved to be one of the most influential texts in urban studies, 

discussing LA's persistent ethnic tensions, surveillance practices, and socio-economic inequalities. Our quantitative 

study of the digital geography of LA can be linked to this tradition of urban studies. Furthermore, LA provides a useful 

case study for comparison to our prior research on UGC in Greater London, similar in terms of population and area 

(Ballatore & De Sabbata, 2018). The next section summarizes the geographic area and datasets included in the study.

3.1 | Study area and spatial units

The study area is located in Los Angeles County. As of 2017, this area had a population of 10.16 million people dis-
tributed  over  10,510  km2

(https ://web.archi ve.org/web/20181 22911 3621/https ://www.census.gov/quick facts/ 

F I G U R E   1  The study area includes the southern part of Los Angeles County, excluding the islands, grouped 
into 2,585 spatial units. The white boundaries are the Service Planning Areas (SPA). The population density is

fact/table/ losan geles count ycali forni a,ca/PST04 5217).  Figure  1  shows  the  extension  and  population  density  of 
the study area.2  The population density is derived from 2016 estimates by the American Community Survey (ACS) 

(https ://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/ data-profi les/2016).  For  reference,  all  maps  in-

clude the county's 2012 Service Planning Areas (SPA) (https ://egis3.lacou nty.gov/datap ortal/ 2012/03/01/servi 

ce-plann ing-areas-spa-2012).

In 2016 estimates, the county population includes Hispanic (49%), non-Hispanic white (28%), African-American 

(8%), Asian (14%), and other (1%) residents. Most of the population is clustered in the southern part of the county, 

in Los Angeles (3.8 million people), followed by Long Beach, Santa Clarita, and Glendale (each of which has more 

than 200,000 people). The population density remains relatively high east of Los Angeles, while it is extremely low 

north of the city, with the exception of sparse urban areas. The population density is also low in the coastal area 

west of Los Angeles that includes Malibu. The county comprises two large islands: Santa Catalina Island (4,050 

people) and San Clemente Island (a naval base officially uninhabited).

As  this  study  focuses  on  the  relationship  between  UGC  and  the  geo-demographic  and  infrastructural  con-
text, we excluded areas in the northern part of the county (all tracts north of latitude 34.36◦N, including Santa 
Clarita, Lancaster, and Palmdale), as well as the two islands, which were predominantly low-density both in terms 

of population and data (see Figure 1). As spatial units, we adopted those from Population and Poverty Estimates 

dataset (2016), which contained core demographic variables. The units are 2010 Census tracts, split into subunits 

when they overlap multiple Countywide Statistical Areas (CSAs). For this reason, the study area includes 2,585 

tract/CSA units, corresponding to 2,199 tracts. For simplicity, we will henceforth refer to the study spatial units 

as “tracts,” even though some of them are smaller.

The study area can be partitioned into 6,111 census block groups, subunits of tracts. The tracts include a me-

dian of 3,796 residents (between 0 and 9,492 people), while census block groups include between 600 and 3,000 

people (https ://www.census.gov/geo/refer ence/gtc/gtc_bg.html). On average, each tract in the county contains 

2.3 block groups. The study area corresponds to 92% of the administrative units and 93% of the county popula-

tion (9.5 million people). As detailed below, several datasets were collected from authoritative sources and UGC. 

Table 1 provides summary statistics of all variables included in the study, using the tract as the unit of analysis. 

As can be seen, the distributions of variables vary considerably. Almost all variables are right-skewed, which is 

expected as these geographical phenomena tend to have large outliers in the right part of the distribution that 

boost the mean (Westerholt, Steiger, Resch, & Zipf, 2016). The excess kurtosis is positive for all variables except 

the resident count, indicating a predominance of leptokurtic distributions (i.e., clustered around the mean). The 

distinct distribution of the resident count can be explained by the fact that the spatial units (tracts) are designed 

to obtain a distribution as uniform as possible.

The four UGC sources are diverse in terms of their thematic scope (micro-messages, notable spatial ob-

jects, or all spatial objects) and have different spatial distributions. To compare these data sources, we start by 

observing their densities per tract. Figure 2 shows the distribution of density of objects for the four datasets 

on  a  logarithmic  scale.  Twitter,  Foursquare,  and  OSM  exhibit  some  convergence  at  different  spatial  scales. 

These three datasets have approximately log-normal distributions, with clear peaks around the median value. 

Twitter and Foursquare have some areas with zero values, while OSM has a tail of sparse areas. By contrast, 

most areas do not have Wikipedia pages, and this results in an extreme skew towards zero values. Excluding 

zero values, Wikipedia also exhibits an approximate log-normal distribution, with a median of 2.3 pages per 

square kilometer.

When calculating the object densities per per square kilometer, the data exhibit some tails of extreme val-

ues, observable in Figure 2. These values are the result of extremely low-density units, where there are fewer 

than 22 people per per square kilometer (corresponding to the 5th percentile). For the purpose of visualization 

in Figures 3 and 4, we deemed these areas to be outliers and we removed them.

3.2 | The demographic context

3.2.1 | Ethnicity, age, income, and education

To obtain a detailed picture of the population characteristics of LA County, we relied on the Population and Poverty 

Estimates dataset (2016) (https ://egis3.lacou nty.gov/datap ortal/ 2014/09/09/popul ation-and-pover ty-estim ates). 

Figure 3 shows the spatial distribution of population, including an autocorrelation analysis based on Getis–Ord 
local Gi*.3  This dataset includes socio-economic variables from the 2010 Census, compounded with more recent 

estimates from the ACS. For each tract, counts are broken down by gender, age, and ethnicity. Federal poverty 

levels (at 100, 130, 133, and 200%) and median household income are also available. As an indicator of education 
relevant to our study, we calculated the percentage of residents with higher education (any college degree).4  The 

population density exhibits hotspots in Downtown LA, Long Beach, Brentwood, Westwood, and Panorama City.

3.2.2 | Infrastructure

To describe the infrastructural context that supports UGC production, we retrieved the points of interest (POIs) 

from the county's LMS (https ://egis3.lacou nty.gov/datap ortal/ 2016/01/14/locat ionsp oints-of-inter est-lms-data). 

This dataset contains 64,982 POIs that are part of the infrastructure managed by the county as of 2016. The POIs 

are classified using 270 unique types in a category tree of three levels. For the purpose of this study, we consider 

all POIs using the highest level of the tree, which groups them in broad categories, such as communications, edu-

cation, environment, transportation, and emergency. The spatial distribution of these POIs is displayed in Figure 3.

3.2.3 | Deprivation index

Deprivation indices are aggregate indicators of social, economic, and cultural exclusion (Smith et al., 2015). To the 

best of our knowledge, no official deprivation index is available for the U.S., but public health researchers devised 

the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) that provides a comparable indicator for 2013 (Kind et al., 2014). The ADI is 

BALLATORE And dE SABBATAcalculated at the census block group level (6,425 units for the county), and it ranks small geographic areas from 1 

(least disadvantaged) to 10 (most disadvantaged). The index is calculated at the national and at the state level. As 

our area of study is located in a single state, we consider the ADI that ranks census block groups within California.

3.3 | Exploration of UGC datasets

3.3.1 | Geo-located tweets

To answer RQ1, we explored the geographies of the four UGC platforms in the study area. This study considers 

a  dataset  of  684,793  geo-located  tweets,  collected  through  the  public  API  from  October  2014  to  May  2015, 

produced by 85,200 unique users. Geo-located tweets are by-products of the communication process between 

users,  unlike  the  other  sources  whose  aim  is  to  build  coherent  representations  of  target  areas  (e.g.,  Wikipedia 

and OSM). It is worth noting that, overall, geo-located tweets are declining, having plunged from just over 3.5% 

in 2012 to 1.5% in 2019, as users increasingly prefer to share vaguer place names to geo-coordinates (https ://

web.archi ve.org/web/20190 30622 0513/https ://www.forbes.com/sites/ kalev leeta ru/2019/03/06/the-era-of-

preci sion-mappi ng-of-social-media-is-coming-to-an-end).  After  excluding  102  bots,  the  final  dataset  contained 

672,538 tweets by 85,098 unique users (98% of the initial dataset).

Figure 4 shows the distribution of tweets. In the study area, the density of tweets ranges from 0 to 3,852 per 

square kilometer (with a median of 179). Based on visual inspection, corroborated by hotspot analysis, the three 

largest  contiguous  blocks  of  high-density  areas  are  Downtown  Los  Angeles,  Long  Beach,  and  Hollywood.  The 

top  decile  by  density  (563  tweets  per  square  kilometer  or  more)  tend  to  be  located  downtown,  in  universities 

and shopping areas, including areas in Northridge, Downtown Burbank, Downtown Santa Monica, Playa del Rey, 

Loyola  Marymount  University,  West  Hollywood,  University  of  Southern  California,  and  Boyle  Heights.  When 

observing the number of tweets compared to the resident population, a small hotspot is evident in Downtown 

Los  Angeles.  Affluent areas of the city in the Rolling Hills gated community, Malibu, and around Pasadena are 

identified as coldspots when looking at tweet density per square kilometer. The two latter areas are also marked 

as coldspots when comparing tweets with the resident population.

3.3.2 | Wikipedia pages

The second UGC source in this study consists of geo-referenced Wikipedia articles. Currently, Wikipedia only 

allows for geo-tags in the form of points, and even large geographical entities are geo-tagged to a point. For 

example, Union Station in Los Angeles is associated with a point that represents its centroid (https ://en.wikip 

edia.org/wiki/Union_Stati on_(Los_Angel es)).  Using  the  resources  available  on  Wikimedia  Toolforge  (https ://

tools.wmfla bs.org),  we  retrieved  9,704  articles  in  November  2017,  including  notable  buildings,  parks,  monu-

ments, and organization headquarters (such as United Artists). The dataset contains pages in multiple languages, 

most of which are in English (41%), but including French (7%), Spanish (7%), and 75 other languages. The rela-

tively low prominence of content in Spanish is surprising, considering that, in 2013, 29% of Californians spoke 

Spanish at home (https ://web.archi ve.org/web/20190 40407 3709/https ://www.census.gov/data/table s/2013/

demo/2009-2013-lang-tables.html). As shown in Figure 4, the Wikipedia dataset is very sparse, with a median 

of 0 pages, a third quartile of 2.2 pages per square kilometer, and a maximum of 249 pages per square kilometer. 

Visual  inspection  and  hotspot  analysis  show  that  pages  are  clustered  in  Downtown  LA  and  Hollywood,  with 

other non-significant areas of high density.

BALLATORE And dE SABBATA12  |    

3.3.3 | OpenStreetMap objects

OpenStreetMap is the most popular source of open vector data at the global level. For this study, we retrieved 
the full history OSM dataset for southern California up to February 2019, describing 3,999,548 spatial objects.5  

Based on visual inspection of Figure 4, OSM data are denser and less clustered around fewer hubs than Twitter 

and Wikipedia, and exhibit an overall less skewed distribution, with a median of 1,552 objects per square kilom-

eter. This can be explained by the fact that OSM is a spatially explicit resource that aims to provide even coverage 

of the planet (Antoniou, Morley, & Haklay, 2010).

The top decile of the tracts in terms of OSM density (more than 2,200 objects per square kilometer) is located 

mostly in South Los Angeles, with hotspots also identified in Boyle Heights, East Compton, East Hollywood, Marina 

del Rey, and in Long Beach. Coldspots again include areas in Rolling Hills and Malibu. However, when the number 

of objects in OSM is weighted against the number of residents, a large coldspot is clearly visible spreading from 

Downtown Los Angeles to West Hollywood, along with smaller ones in Long Beach, North Hills East, and Glendale.

3.3.4 | Foursquare venues

As  our  study  does  not  include  an  explicit  temporal  dimension,  we  consider  178,814  Foursquare  venues  col-

lected in 2013. This dataset includes venues classified into nine top-level categories, which contain 422 sub-

categories. The categories are residence (23%), shop & service (21%), professional & other places (18%), food 

(17%), outdoors & recreation (7%), travel & transport (4%), arts & entertainment (4%), nightlife spot (3%), and 

college & university (3%). The top decile by density (areas with more than 79 Foursquare venues per square 

kilometer) includes areas in Downtown Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Pasadena. Unlike other UGC, the dataset 

shows high-density areas along major streets, such as Santa Monica Boulevard and Ventura Boulevard. As can 

be seen in Figure 4, a notable hotspot of venues stretches from Hollywood to Westwood, with a smaller hot-

spot in Downtown LA. However, when comparing the number of venues to the resident population, coldspots 

are visible in South Los Angeles, Long Beach, East Compton, the areas surrounding Koreatown, and North Hills 

East. The next section will study the relationships between these UGC datasets and their geo-demographic 

context.

4.1 | Correlation analysis

As a first step toward modeling the relationship between UGC and their geo-demographic context, we calculated 

correlation coefficients between all relevant variables at the tract level. Considering the nonparametric distribu-

tions of the data, we calculated the ties-adjusted rank correlation coefficient (Spearman's ρ).

4.1.1 | Correlations between ethnicity, age, education, and income

To interpret the distribution of UGC datasets, it is beneficial to observe the correlations between the core varia-

bles that structure LA's geo-demography, summarized in Figure 5. Population density shows a positive correlation 

with poverty (meaning the FPL 100%) (0.73, all correlations significant at p < .001) and Hispanic residents (0.48), 

and  negative  correlations  with  higher  education  (−0.40),  median  household  income  (−0.60),  and  percentage  of 

white residents (−0.28). Median household income is positively correlated with the percentage of white residents

Estimates (2016)

(0.6), and negatively correlated with the percentage of African-Americans (−0.21) and poverty (−0.78). White and 

Asian residents tend to live in the same tracts (0.39), while the presence of Black and Hispanic people is not mu-

tually correlated. Higher education exhibits strong correlations with white (0.79) and Hispanic (−0.79) residents, 

weaker with Asians (0.43), and no correlation with African-Americans.

These  correlations  are  rooted  in  patterns  of  socio-economic  inequality  common  in  the  U.S.,  particularly 

between  the  white  and  Asian  population,  who  tend  to  have  relatively  high  income  and  educational  attain-

ment, with the Hispanic and Black population having generally lower income and education (Fontenot, Semega, 

&  Kollar,  2018).  This  is  reflected  in  the  tendency  of  dense  inner-city  areas  to  be  more  black  and  Hispanic, 

while less dense suburban areas are more white and Asian—as a result, denser tracts are generally more de-

prived. From an infrastructural viewpoint, the density of LMS POIs per 1,000 residents is negatively correlated 

with population density (−0.4), confirming the intuition that more deprived areas tend to have relatively less 

infrastructure.

BALLATORE And dE SABBATA14  |    

4.1.2 | Correlations between UGC and geo-demographics

To  investigate  RQ2,  Figure  5  shows  the  main  UGC  variables,  including  the  number  of  tweets,  Wikipedia  pages, 

Foursquare venues, and OSM objects per 1,000 residents (“p.r.” henceforth) in each tract. Twitter p.r. has overall 

weak relationships with demographic variables, and a slightly higher correlation with LMS POIs (0.23). The lack of 

correlation with demographic variables indicates that the place representation is decoupled from the residence of 

participants. OSM p.r. exhibits a very strong correlation with population density (−0.82), which indicates a high level 

of more objects p.r. in low-density areas. OSM p.r. is also related to income (0.62), higher education (0.42), percentage 

of white residents (0.4), and poverty (−0.65). Wikipedia pages p.r. correlates positively with LMS POIs p.r. (0.42) and 

negatively with Hispanic residents (−0.24) and population density (−0.21). Finally, Foursquare venues p.r. is negatively 

correlated with population density (−0.71), with Hispanic residents (−0.44), and age group 18–34 (−0.43). Positive 

correlations are evident with LMS POIs (0.5), white residents (0.46), as well as income and education (both at 0.47).

4.1.3 | Cross-platform correlations

As shown in Figure 6, the UGC sources p.r. show positive correlations with one another, meaning that, despite their dif-

ferences, there is a general trend of the same areas tending to have more data across platforms (RQ1). The correlation 

between Foursquare and OSM is the highest (0.51), followed by Foursquare and Wikipedia (0.29), and Foursquare and 

Twitter (0.24). The other relationships are all positive but weaker, in the interval [0.08, 0.18]. Figure 6 also summarizes 

the inter-UGC correlations, comparing object densities across the four UGC sources and LMS POIs that indicate the 

presence of public infrastructure. Interestingly, the four datasets show variability in the correlation between their den-

sity with respect to area (objects per square kilometer) and to population (objects per 1,000 residents). Wikipedia has 

the strongest correlation (0.95), followed by Twitter (0.58) and Foursquare (0.54). By contrast, OSM shows a weak neg-

ative correlation (−0.13), because its objects are more evenly spread, and thus less influenced by population density.

4.1.4 | Correlations between UGC and deprivation

Subsequently, to investigate RQ3, we calculated correlations between the 2013 deprivation index (ADI) and UGC 

variables over the 6,111 census block groups (CBGs), which are subunits of census tracts. Because of the large 

number of ties, Kendall's τ was adopted as the correlation coefficient. The state deprivation rank (from 1, least dis-

advantaged, to 10, most disadvantaged) shows some positive correlation with the LMS POIs (0.22, p < .001). The 

tweet density also correlates with deprivation (0.28, p < .001), indicating that, to a moderate extent, more tweets 

tend to be generated in deprived areas. This is a counter-intuitive result that holds at the tract level too (ρ = 0.56 

between tweet density and poverty), and stems from the fact that the geography of participation to the platform 

is different than its place representation. While Twitter users are more educated and affluent than average, tweets 

can be generated in either work or leisure locations, for example at offices, bars, restaurants, and public spaces, 

which are denser in inner city areas, such as Downtown LA and the Fashion District. By contrast, no correlation 

was found with Wikipedia density (−0.06, p < .001), nor for Foursquare and OSM densities (τ ∈ [−0.05, 0.05]). For 
this reason, we did not pursue deprivation as an explanatory factor for the other UGC sources.

4.2 | Linear regression models

Based on the correlation analysis outlined above, we constructed several explanatory linear regression models. 

It is important to note that these models do not offer causal explanations, only correlations. Due to the skewed

distribution of most of the variables, we normalized them with the inverse hyperbolic sine, abbreviated as [ihs] 

(Burbidge, Magee, & Robb, 1988). Interestingly, none of these models could be defined as robust, even when using 

normalized variables and filtering extreme values. The skewness of the UGC variables and the effects of func-

tional segregation in the city are such that all models were affected by non-normally distributed and heteroske-

dastic residuals. Nevertheless, in this section we briefly report on the most promising models that we developed, 

which are summarized in Table 2, as some insight can be extrapolated from them.

As  suggested by  the correlation coefficients, the number of  residents, the area size, higher percentages of 

white  and  Asian  residents,  as  well  as  higher  levels  of  income  and  education  seem  to  explain  a  significant  pro-

portion of the variance in the amount of content available in the platforms. Among the demographic variables, 

we excluded poverty and deprivation, due to their strong correlation with the combined effect of area size and 

number of residents (i.e., population density). The remainder of the variables used in the models also display some 

significant levels of correlation, but not to the point of being of concern, as all the average variance inflation factor 

scores are in the range [1, 2.5].

The explanatory power is particularly strong for OSM (model 2), where much of the variance would be ex-

plained by those factors (Table 2). Similarly, the same factors can also explain about half of the variance in Twitter 

(model 1) and Foursquare (model 3). However, the same does not hold for Wikipedia (model 4), which obtained a 
much lower R2. This finding is also corroborated by the models exploring the relationship between the UGC vari-
ables. Twitter, OSM, and Foursquare could reciprocally explain about half of the variability of the other (models 5, 

6, 8), whereas their relationship with Wikipedia appears negligible (models 7, 9, 10).

It is particularly interesting to note how the beta coefficients presented in Table 3 suggest that income has 

a negative effect on the amount of UGC content in an area. This corroborates observations detailed above, as 

wealthy areas such as Rolling Hills and Malibu have been identified as coldspots for tweets, as well as for content 

in Wikipedia and, partially, for OSM. These findings contradict observations made by Li et al. (2013) at the county 

level.  The  number  of  residents  seems  to  be  the  strongest  factor  driving  both  the  number  of  tweets  and  OSM 

content, whereas the size of the area appears as the main factor driving content in Fourquare and Wikipedia, and 

it partially impacts on OSM too.

The  maps  and  quantile–quantile  plots  in  Figure  7  display  the  distribution  of  the  residuals  of  the  first  four 

models and again illustrate the clear similarities between Twitter, OSM and Foursquare, compared to Wikipedia. 

Further  analysis  of  the  distribution  of  the  residuals  revealed  that  all  models  exhibited  spatially  autocorrelated 

residuals.  This  clearly  indicates  that  these  linear  models,  although  providing  some  explanatory  power,  are  not

This analysis of UGC datasets provides insights into place representation at the urban scale across our four re-

search questions, considering U.S. census tract as spatial units. In the study area, a particularly important role 

is played by population density, which is a covariate of many other socio-demographic variables, such as pres-

ence of Hispanic, young, and deprived residents (see Figure 5). For this reason, we consider density per resident 

population more important than density per unit area. As the correlation and regression analyses revealed, UGC 

platforms show a remarkable diversity in their place representation, both in terms of density of objects in the geo-

graphic space and of factors correlating with their density. In other words, each UGC platform generates a unique 

geography, influenced by contextual factors in different ways (RQ1, RQ2).

Tweets tend to appear in high-density, urban, deprived areas, showing a substantial divergence between the 

geography of participation (i.e., where users live) and where they produce tweets, contradicting previous research 

(Li et al., 2013). OSM objects tend to be located in white and non-Hispanic areas, with older and educated resi-

dents. A similar pattern is followed by Foursquare venues and, with much weaker correlations, Wikipedia pages. 

This corroborates the view that these information geographies are unique and, statistically speaking, only repre-

sentative of themselves (Ballatore & De Sabbata, 2018). A core finding is that, while participation studies show 

that UGC producers are relatively white, young, urban, and affluent, the same generalization does not necessarily 

hold for place representation. When considering UGC per 1,000 residents, data generated in Los Angeles County 

exhibit  a  significant  bias  toward  areas  characterized  by  a  younger  and  higher-qualified  population  for  spatially 

explicit platforms (OSM, Wikipedia, and Foursquare), but much less for Twitter, which obtains substantially lower 

coefficients. Surprisingly, wealth does not have a noticeable impact (RQ3).

In a city as segregated as LA, ethnicity plays a role in shaping the geographies of place representation. With 

the exception of Twitter, areas dominated by white residents are associated with more content, while Hispanic are 

associated with less. Areas with black and Asian residents show weaker associations. Income, higher education, 

and poverty are strong covariates of the presence of white and Asian residents. The presence of infrastructure, 

estimated by LMS POIs per 1,000 residents, is a positive factor for all four platforms, in a weak form for Twitter 

and OSM, and more strongly for Wikipedia and Foursquare. This suggests that Wikipedia and Foursquare tend to 

be denser in areas with more public services per inhabitant.

When considering the regression models in Table 2, the variability of all UGC objects may be explainable by 
number of residents, area, level of higher education, and median income, ranging from a very high R2 for OSM 
(0.78) to a much lower value for Wikipedia (0.18). While this partially confirms some common assumptions (e.g., 

higher population density drives a higher amount of content), it also contradicts some received wisdom. Digital 

content, although probably produced by relatively affluent and educated users, does not concentrate in affluent 

areas, which in LA tend to be functionally residential. It also highlights the strong variability and differences be-

tween platforms. This also shows a clear relationship between density of population and density of UGC objects 

for three platforms (OSM, Twitter, and Foursquare), while Wikipedia, possibly on account of its extremely sparse 

distribution, appears harder to explain.

5.1 | Comparing UGC in LA and London

To answer RQ4, these findings can be contrasted with those we obtained for Twitter and Wikipedia in Greater 

London, where the level of education of residents, share of population aged group 30–44, and property prices 

BALLATORE And dE SABBATA    |  19

were independent variables (Ballatore & De Sabbata, 2018). This comparison is beneficial to probe to what extent 

our findings are idiographic (specific to a locale) or nomothetic (general). The two target areas share several char-

acteristics, being both multi-core cities in the Global North with high-income, ethnically diverse, similarly sized, 

and  largely  unequal  populations.  However,  they  diverge  in  their  human  geographies  along  several  dimensions, 

such as ethnic segregation (lower in London) and functional segregation (also lower in London) (Johnston, Poulsen, 

& Forrest, 2007).

In both case studies, population size, higher education, and affluence carry some explanatory power, adopting 

property prices in London and household income in LA as estimates, but the relationship has opposite effects 

(positive in London, negative in LA). In this context, a striking difference between Greater London and LA County 

is  also  visible  in  the  different  relationships  that  Twitter  and  Wikipedia  engender  in  the  two  cities.  In  Greater 

London, the variability in the number of Wikipedia articles explains 49% of the variation in the number of tweets, 

showing a convergence of the two geographies (Ballatore & De Sabbata, 2018). In LA, by contrast, it could at best 

be said that the variability in the former would account just for about 6% of variability in the latter.

Behind the complex patterns of a multi-core metropolis, in our prior study, the place representation of Greater 

London showed unequivocally a data-rich central core surrounded by sparse peripheries, with considerably less 

data. We expected this picture to be inverted in post-industrial LA, which famously exhibits a hollow core and 

affluent suburbs, but the spatial structure is more complex. Areas dominated by educated, affluent whites and 

Asians are over-represented, but large quantities of data are produced in deprived inner-city areas, where more 

economic activities are located. This strongly indicates that local geographies must be taken into account as much 

as possible when considering any UGC platform.

5.2 | Limitations

Data and method limitations should be borne in mind when considering these findings. The study focuses on LA 

County and, as discussed above, the specific human geography of the area constrains the UGC geographies in 

ways that are place-specific, as shown in the comparison to London. In general, spatially explicit studies over cen-

sus units can suffer from the ecological fallacy, also known as aggregation bias (Voss, 2007). However, our analysis 

of place representation does not aim to draw inferences about individuals who live and produce data in the target 

areas, but only about the areas themselves. Furthermore, this study is agnostic regarding the relationship between 

the geography of informational content (i.e., where digital content is located) and the residential geography of 

content producers (i.e., where users live). These two geographies are likely to have some degree of overlap, but 

we consider this research question outside the scope of this article. From a temporal perspective, the datasets 

were collected in slightly different time-frames, all in the period 2013–2018. We deem this to be an acceptable 

time gap for the study, but some rapid changes in the urban fabric might have been missed. The regressions, while 

informative, are not robust, exhibiting non-normal residuals, indicating that the relationships between UGC and its 

context are not trivial to model. Different approaches are needed to move from this kind of correlational analysis 

to causal explanations.

In this article we conducted a quantitative investigation of place representation for four UGC platforms (Twitter, 

Wikipedia, OSM, and Foursquare), using several geo-demographic variables to capture the platial context of the 

data. As a case study, we considered the southern part of Los Angeles County, adopting the methodology we de-

vised for Greater London (Ballatore & De Sabbata, 2018). To trace these information geographies, we harvested 

about  685,000  geo-located  tweets,  9,700  Wikipedia  pages,  4  million  OSM  objects,  and  180,000  Foursquare 

BALLATORE And dE SABBATA20  |    

venues, with 65,000 LMS POIs to represent public infrastructure. Guided by four research questions, an explora-

tory spatial analysis, followed by a correlation analysis and regression modeling, produced the following main find-

ings about the place representation of UGC:

Population  density.  In  LA  County,  higher  population  density  is  correlated  with  higher  poverty,  more  Hispanic 

residents,  a  younger  population,  fewer  white  residents,  lower  income,  and  lower  education.  Higher  density 

corresponds  to  more  tweets  and  more  OSM  objects.

Twitter.  Geo-located tweets tend to appear in denser areas. Almost 60% of the variability in number of tweets can 

be explained. When considering tweets per resident, no clear demographic factor emerges. Counter-intuitively, 

tweet density correlates with the deprivation index (more deprived areas generate more tweets), because LA 

business and leisure hotspots are often located in inner-city areas.

Wikipedia. 

Pages  are  very  sparsely  distributed.  Pages  per  resident  correlate  with  infrastructure  (LMS 

POIs), weakly with white residents, and negatively with Hispanic residents. Only 18% of variability can be ex-

plained through demographic factors.

OSM.  When considering OSM objects per resident, these objects tend to occur in white, educated, affluent, 

older, non-dense areas. The distribution of OSM objects is the most predictable, with 77% of variability related 

to demographic factors.

Foursquare. 

Venues per resident exhibit positive correlations with LMS POIs per resident, and with white, 

educated, affluent, older, non-dense areas. Demographic variables predict 47% of the variability in venues.

Cross-platform comparison. 

Each  of  the  four  UGC  sources  has  a  distinct  place  representation,  with  different 

spatial distributions. In the regression models, Twitter, OSM, and Foursquare show a broadly similar structure, 

while Wikipedia appears more unique. Even sources that show relatively similar correlations (e.g., Foursquare, 

Twitter, and OSM) have statistically different hotspots and coldspots.

Los Angeles and London. 

When  comparing  these  findings  with  an  analogous  study  of  Greater  London 

(Ballatore & De Sabbata, 2018), similarities and differences emerge. In both cities, population size and the share 

of residents with higher education have explanatory power. Indicators of affluence also have some explanatory 

power, but with seemingly opposite effects (positively for property prices in London, negatively for household 

income in LA). While the ethnic composition of areas has no explanatory power in London, the presence of 

white and, to a lesser extent, Asian residents is associated with more data in LA. The 30–44 age group makes 

a clear contribution to data variability in London, but it is not a factor in LA. Half of the variability of Wikipedia 

and Twitter appears explainable in London, while geo-demographic factors in LA explain almost 60% of Twitter 

and only 20% of Wikipedia. In London, the variability in Wikipedia is linked to up to 49% of that in Twitter, but 

only up to 6% in LA.

Future  directions  for  this  research  include  evaluating  other  modeling  techniques  to  quantify  these  spatial 

relationships  between  UGC  and  geo-demographic  variables.  Poisson  regressions  might  provide  a  suitable  tool 

for count data (e.g., number of tweets). As our linear regressions possess spatially autocorrelated residuals, geo-

graphically weighted regressions could provide a better fit. Moreover, this study focused on coarse variables, such 

as the total count of Foursquare venues or OSM objects in a census tract. These UGC datasets contain semantic 

details that could be fruitfully harnessed in further analysis, for example considering individual subcategories (e.g., 

bars, restaurants or schools). In addition, to account for the functional segregation of California, variables for land 

use and zoning categories should be included in our models.

The  study  in  this  article  is  single  scale,  with  all  the  data  considered  at  the  tract  level  (about  3,700  people 

per unit). In order to further investigate the relationships across scales, it will be critical to aggregate the data in 

coarser units and perform sensitivity analyses. While the details of this article are idiographic, being focused on 

a specific city at the census tract level, such case studies are necessary to build a corpus of empirical evidence to 

ground nomothetic thinking about place and information. Conversely, exploring small-area estimation techniques 

BALLATORE And dE SABBATAwould provide insights into the extent to which it is possible to model UGC variables in units smaller than tracts. 

Finally, a composite index of data availability (by analogy with deprivation indices) would provide a conceptually 

simple and yet powerful tool to quantify socio-spatial inequalities at the urban scale. As the use of unrepresen-

tative UGC is still widespread (Bowker, 2014), more research on place representation can help understand and 

reduce the biases embedded in these web-based geographies, taking into account the structural variations in the 

human geography in different locales.

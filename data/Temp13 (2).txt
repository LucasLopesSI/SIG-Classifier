Abstract Spatial computing has emerged a critical issue in emergency management of public
health. Due to the complexity of spatial data structure and disperse character of spatio-temporal
data, when emergency event of public health occurs, it is difficult to get the needed data and
analysis it then make quick decision in a short time. In this paper, OSCAR: an Open Spatial
Computing and data Resource platform were introduced including its components, framework,
elements and two implementations. OSCAR provides a data resource aggregation platform to
retrieve data from official statistic agencies through data service and database, scrawl related
data from BBS and social media and mirror the environment data from earth observation data
sites. All the dataset are arranged in data cubes according to their spatial and temporal
dimensions. This mechanism ensures the feasibility and timeliness of time-sequence analysis
of specific regions. The algorithms of spatial computing of public health are usually compli-
cated and depend on particular computing environment, which is usually not default config-
uration of computer of nowadays. OSCAR deploys a series of computation images in a cloud-
computing environment. The computation ability can be extended on-demand and thus the
time of the computation can be shortened and limited in several minutes when it is needed. The
two implementation of human rabies of China and H7N9 in China show the convenience of
our platform.

1 Introduction

Public health events are increasing in recent years and showing a trend to cause greater harm in
greater range with shorter duration. For instance, H5N1 caused hundreds of death among Asia
just in several months in 2003 [1, 2]; H7N9 spread across numerous provinces in China and
cause huge economic loss in 2013 [3]. The leading cause is the increasing intense of human
activities in both spatial span and temporal duration, which constantly change ecological
environments [4]. Many literature show the spreads of infection disease are highly related
with human migrations. The economic globalization brings more frequent and convenient
human interaction and brings more frequent and more severe outbreak and spread of global
public health events in last decades [5–7]. Emerging infections (EI), which is defined as newly
appeared in population or ever existed previously but are rapidly increasing in incidence or
geographic range, have caused incalculable misery and death in human history [8]. In recent
years, may re-emergences have catalyzed by occasional regional armed conflicts, Refugee
flows, loss of cohesion, and natural disaster like earth quakes and floods, indicating the
importance not only of microbial and viral factors, but also of social and environmental
determinants [9, 10].

It is known that the spreads of infectious disease are highly related to geographic and
environmental conditions. Therefore, the challenge to emerging infection disease researchers is
to explore the correlations between diseases and relevant social and geographic environments
then conduct comprehensive analyses involving geographic or environmental factors [8, 11].
Human activities as well as change of geographic conditions and ecological environments
play significant roles in the spread of diseases. Spatial analysis involving those factors can
directly contribute to prevention and control of diseases. Unfortunately, the human activity,
which is efficient to emerging infection disease analysis, can not be directly obtained from
statistical data due to lack of reliable data source or spatio-temporal accuracy. It is difficult to
detect the human behavior in physical space, but it is much easier to detect them in cyber
space. The internet behavior, which include internet search, e-Commerce, and social medial
etc., is verified as reflection of physical behavior and its importance is being realized by public
health researchers [12–15]. But for public health researchers, it remains a big challenge to
collect web data and transform these data to environment factor being used in spatial epidemic
analysis. It is needed daily run platforms to aggregate data from thousands of news of web site,
discussion from internet forum, transactions from e-commerce, post from social medial. These
huge volume data source should be processed such as cleaning, geo-coding and aggregating
before they are used in spatial epidemic analysis.

With the increase of data volume and consideration factors number of emergency response
of public health, parallel computing and clouding computing resources is urgently needed. Due
to the emergence of new viruses, which have not yet been well studied and the infection routes
are still not clear, simulation of the spread and the progression of diseases is increasingly
significant. When new viruses break out, there isn’t much time for researchers to find out the
exact pathogenic mechanism and infection route before decision-makings on disease control.
To minimize the effects of a disease, medical staffs and the government must have the ability
to quick respond to the disease. To support the quick response, simulation based on spatial
computing is utilized as a practical method to analyze factors, including biological, environ-
mental and socio-economic factors, that lead to the outbreak or promote the spread, and thus
provide reference for predicting the spread and finding optimal measures to prevent and
control the disease. With the help of spatial computing, epidemiologists and public health

Geoinformatica

researchers can exploit the rich spatial content of geographical data and find explicit or implicit
spatial relations and interactions among spatial objects, which contributes to the analysis of
diffusion of diseases, especially infectious diseases.

The primary objective of spatial analysis for public health issues is to unravel credible
causes of diseases, which conduce to better understanding of characteristics of the diseases as
well as support forecasting possible outbreaks of the diseases. Therefore, the spatial analysis is
supposed to provide valuable inferences for emergency management of public health affairs. In
this paper, we focus on how to systematically raise both the effect and the efficiency of the
spatial analysis process, hence optimize the predication of outbreaks of diseases and better
support the emergency management.

In this paper, we aim to discuss a decision support system based on GIS for emergency
management on public health issues with respect to the above challenges. For this purpose, we
develop a comprehensive an Open Spatial Computing and dAta Resource (OSCAR) platform
for spatio-temporal analysis to provide one-step services for relevant researcher and decision
makers. The main contributions of the framework are as follows:

1. Data aggregation. The system gains abilities to automatically search from open data
sources and collect relevant information, extract corresponding geographical locations
as well as organize collected data in a specific form, called as spatio-temporal cube, which
facilitates the storage and retrieval of the data and well conveys the information in the
temporal dimension and and the spatial dimension.

2. Model integration. The system incorporates different models, each of which is built with a
specific data assumption. The system provides a solution to integrate models at the code
level and offer unified service interfaces for users of the system. To ensure high efficiency
of the analysis processing involving different models, the system is designed to exploit
cloud computing resource adaptively and compress the time of calculating.
Integrated visualization portal. The system provides a web-based integrated visualization
portal to provide data aggregation, data processing, model select and computation
resource.

The following of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related works that
concentrate in emergency management, GIS and researches of public health issues. Section 3
describes in detail the proposed framework along with its specifications to handle public health
issues. Section 4 demonstrates two case studies to verify the performance of the proposed
system using data of human rabies and H7N9 in China. The final section concludes the whole
paper and provides discussions on future development.

2 Related works

FEMA publishes and updates detailed criteria for considering the dispatching and management
during emergencies, which is aimed at protecting property, public health, and safety and
lessens or averting the threat of an incident becoming a catastrophic event [16]. System for
emergency management has been studied for many years and numerous sophisticated systems
have been already developed to deal with natural and technological hazards, including
hurricane, flood, and other threats to communities. [17–19] Spatial analysis based on GIS is
a critical tool for emergency management. GIS is well embedded into the system of emergency

Geoinformatica

management and has a number of successful applications on management for disasters like
earthquake, chemical disasters, [20–24]. GIS expands dimensions for the analysis supporting
decision-making during emergency management tasks. Geospatial information is exploited
and integrated with expert experience, web data. Based on the integration of information, a
number of GIS-based information systems that contributes to emergency management have
been developed [25–27]. GIS also shows its ability to help resolve public health issues.
Geoinformatics technology can aid in epidemiological investigation and outbreak response
and thus reducing the health hazards in the communities before, during and after epidemic
episodes. Integration of GIS and GPS improves the quality of spatial and non-spatial data for
analysis and contributes to decision-making through providing integrated approach to disease
control and surveillance. Moreover, GIS mapping and modeling enable spatial and temporal
analyses to enhance understanding of the population’s access to health services and the
emergency referral system, which leads to better management during emergencies [28]. To
support emergency management on public health issues, ArcGIS server, a typical GIS tool, is
widely used in the shortest path algorithm and displaying of maps. Researchers build web
based public health emergency systems to simplify operations for the dispatch of multi-
resource [29]. Typical GIS tools like ArcGIS and GeoData provide reliable assistance for
the spatial analysis on public health issues. However, a comprehensive analysis involving
understanding of epidemiology calls for functions exceeding what a single GIS tool can
provide. Although GIS has been applied in research works on diseases, there are few mature
GIS-based frameworks or systems proposed for emergency management on public health
issues. A precaution management system based on GIS for public health issues has been
designed but the functions were rather limited. [30] Integration of data and models can
contribute to the comprehensive analysis. Open source platforms like LabKey [31] help
researchers to retrieve, organize and share heterogeneous disease data, and then conduct
cooperative analysis. Several frameworks have been proposed to integrate models in spatial
decision support systems. The model integration is implemented using reusable toolkits with
specific management aimed at avoiding conflicts. Problem-oriented methods have been
incorporated in those integrated systems to support the deployment and management of
different models as well as enable a declarative description of models and the conceptual
relationships. [Taylor, 1999] The experience on the integration of multi-source data and
models can provide reference for designing a comprehensive integrated system for spatial
analysis on public health issues.

To make a deep spatial analysis for public health issues, more specifications based on
professional knowledge of diseases or other health issues are necessary. Numerous studies
have been conducted to investigate the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of public
health issues, especially zoonotic infectious diseases, across different temporal and geograph-
ical scales [32–40]. Studies investigating the spatial patterns of some infectious diseases have
shown obvious variations due to the differences in geographical, climatic and environmental
attributes: distance from major roads, presence of river or lake, land cover such as deciduous
forest, average temperature and neighborhood to enzootic zones [41–43]. In order to prevent
and control public health issues, those factors are worthy of consideration. A number of
international studies have investigated the contribution of risk factors using in the spatial
distribution of diseases using various types of data [44–48]. To take more factors into
consideration, it is advisable to integrate data of different types into a comprehensive model
for the analysis. Among numerous factors, unsuccessful control of pathogenic animal and
inadequate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of patients are thought to be critical and intuitive

Geoinformatica

signals leading to the high incidence of diseases [37, 38]. Some studies have tried to find the
correlation between disease exposure risk and socioeconomic status as well as ecological
variables using the records of receiving PEP measurements [49–51]. Surveillance data have
been recently exploited in spatial models to forecast raccoon rabies emergence [46]. To take
more factors into consideration, it is indispensable to integrate data of different types into
models for the analysis. However, these studies did not consider the spatiotemporal variation in
environment factors. The heterogeneity of local regions was also ignored. In addition, variation
derived from spatially lagged geographical variables was inadequately accounted for. The only
spatial epidemiological study of canine rabies has shown that the spatial and temporal
distribution of canine rabies was not evenly distributed across China [52]. With more factors
allowed for, spatial effects can no longer be ignored. Spatial principles, which exist among
physical phenomenon and reflect solid patterns in spatio-temporal dimensions, shed light on
specifications for optimization of spatial analysis. To investigate subjects with spatial structure,
approaches customized according to spatial principles are more appropriate while analyses
through a single model or simple algorithm that fails to consider spatial effects become less
worthy. Besides application of spatial principles, another solution is to integrate different
models or algorithm, each one may be built on a specific assumption, to analyze the issues
from different perspectives. On the other hand, an aggregation of different models can output
comparable results, which are expected to contribute to the design of better interventions in the
context of governmental and medical decision making, which is aimed at reducing cases of
diseases.

The data aggregation idea and platform are often found in gene related research and
applications [53]. These platforms collect and aggregate sequence gene data for organization
and analysis. Its worth increases with the data volume it aggregate. Some crowd-sourcing
platforms provide data resource services through share among users. But these data service
remain in data resource download level as most of data not being processed or organized for a
general purpose. Big data quality problem remain in these systems.

3 Framework of OSCAR

3.1 The D-M-V three tiers architecture

There are three designed goals of OSACAR. Firstly, OSCAR is a reliable public health related
data aggregation platform and provide data services of data gathering, data organizing,
geocoding and data sharing. Secondly, it is a emerging high performance spatial computation
platform of public health issue by integrating different spatial analysis model, providing on-
demand spatial computing cloud service combining data resource. Finally, OSCAR is designed
and implemented as a decision support system portal by providing data-driven analysis and
simulation services. Researchers on public health issues, medical staff, and policy makers are
target users of the system. Although the system is designed to provide user-friendly interface
and visualization for users to obtain intuitive results, basic knowledge of spatial analysis and
statistics are required for users who exploit the system. The system is designed as both
application-driven and user-centric, providing user-friendly interfaces to implement spatial
analysis.

Traditionally, the data analysis system usually is designed as a stand-alone system, in which
the function of data processing, computation and visualization are implemented in a single

Geoinformatica

computer or computation node with same or similar configuration. This architecture works
well when the data size is small, the computing complexity is low, and there is no need to
integrated with multi data source to implement complex comparative analysis. With the growth
of data size and increasing demand of complex analytics algorithm and distribution of data and
user, it is more and more difficult to implement a complex visualization task in a stand-alone
architecture. To meet the three designed goals, a D-M-V architecture [54, 55], which has been
proven efficiently in collaborative visualization system, was adopted in OSCAR. Therefore,
harnessing parallel and distributed resources turns to become an advisable solution. In
addition, user-centric approach, which presents uniform interfaces instead of detailed manage-
ment or processing of distributed resources for users, is exploited to facilitate the analysis
through reducing cumbersome works.

3.2 Service-oriented architecture design

The system also utilizes Service-oriented architecture (SOA) to integrate GIS and spatial
analysis models into the workflows. SOA, which is based on loosely coupled software
services, allows for flexible and scalable aggregation of sophisticated applications from
individual services and manages applications with common interfaces and standards. SOA is
widely used during the phase of systems development and integration. In this paper, we design
a three-tiers services-oriented architecture, which is shown in Fig. 1, to provide a scalable
platform for spatial analysis supporting emergency management on public health issues.
Workflows can interact with individual services to make the most of the capabilities of high-
performance computing, distributed resources, data management, and visualization.
Owing to the supports by SOA, the system gains benefits at least three aspects:

1. Loose coupling of services makes it available to distribute different components of the
system, like data storing, data modeling and data visualization, into different computers.
Based on the characteristics of distributing and loose coupling, SOA provides the
possibility to employ parallel computing resource for analysis tasks.

2. Unified service access portal add to the feasibility to provide uniformed data access and
services access for users, regardless of the sources and formats of the original data, variant
analytic algorithms and different operating system.
Integration in web-based environment platforms conduces to the deployment of different
Web-based applications and map services, which may be offered by other system or
applications. The system illustrates comparative analyses for users to find hidden rules
from spatio-temporal data.

3.

Data integration and model integration serve as the most important roles in the whole
system. Spatial principles [56], which reveal spatial and temporal constraints and interactions
among spatial objects, are considered to optimize the integration of data and model. To support
the analysis tasks, a complete mechanism covers data collection, data organization, spatial
analysis models, job scheduling, visualization and several detailed procedures is necessary. As
is shown in Fig. 2, the whole framework is comprised of 5 general levels: automatic data
collection, data organization and integration, model integration, job scheduling and integrated
visualization.

The most pressing works here are to reasonably process and organize the data with the
spatial structure well preserved, to incorporate models revealing the implicit patterns among

Geoinformatica

Fig. 2 Five levels of the framework of OSCAR

Geoinformatica

the data and to synthesis a set of methods for decision makings, which are tailored to GIS and
spatial analysis. The system is developed to capture essential spatial characteristics of prob-
lems. Besides, to fulfill requirements of emergency management, the system must be devel-
oped to be fast in response to any sudden emergencies. Therefore, the system has to perform
efficiently in data modeling and analysis as well as ensure the correctness of its indicators. A
balance between the efficiency and the effect is critical to the framework. Technical aspects of
each level are introduced in detail in following subsections.

3.3 On-demand data aggregation

Automatic data collection is the foundation of the whole system. Specifically, it contains the
detection for emergent events, automatic data acquisition and the storage of raw data.

The data needed for analysis can be classified into two types: static data and dynamic data.
Static data is the data that mainly released on official websites of the government or
institutions, where the data is updated relatively unfrequently or regularly. Static data provides
basic information including digital maps and other geographic data, climatic data, remote
sensing data that records environmental characteristics and socio-economic statistic data.
Dynamic data is the data that collected from dynamically updated web media and social
networks. News websites, blogs, web forums and twitter messages are set as the targets of
automatic crawlers.

There are two concerned challenges to our data discovery process: to properly deploy
automatic crawlers for different data sources with totally different data structures, and to keep
the latest information detected and stored timely, which means the automatic process cannot be
too time consuming.

The deployment of crawlers varies for the static data sources and the dynamic data sources.
The static data sources provide well structured data with explicit geographical coordinates or
locations. Official websites often release data at regular intervals. To receive those static data
with a controllable overhead, crawlers collecting static data are assigned with timed tasks to
check for updates of websites and request the latest released data. Owing to the constant
structure and explicit geographic labels, the collected data does not need much complex
processing before storage. For the dynamic data, the automatic collection is more sophisticat-
ed. To obtain the real time information, crawlers have to continuously monitor web pages of
news and social media and search for special keywords, including descriptions on emergen-
cies, names and acronyms of diseases, which can be seen as signs of occurring emergencies.
Text data with themes relevant to emergencies on public health issues are extracted to detect
cases. The contents of web texts are usually informal and random, thus make it confusing to
detect cases and find sufficient information. In order to obtain enough information to describe
a disease case, the context is also collected. Within the context, an ontology network, which
consists of a set of ontologies that denote diseases and other threatens to the public health and
semantic relations among ontologies, is exploited to help determine the topic described, and
then rapidly identify cases of emergencies. The ontology network can be generated from
professional understandings and experiences of experts in emergency management. The
crawlers for dynamic data are deployed on demands of users and can be specified according
to manual settings.

When it comes to the data for analysis, the records of disease cases are of the most
importance. In our system, users can initialize the search targets by selecting research topics
such as rabies, H7N9, Ebola, etc. The cases data come from both records in static tables on the

Geoinformatica

official websites and texts from web. A serious problem is that a substantial part of texts from
web are represented without geographical coordinates and thus bring obstacles to further
spatial analysis. To address it, we conduct reasoning based on the additional information
extracted from the texts. When there are no explicit coordinates, the system seeks phrases that
mention locations or provide some intimations, for example, names of places, restaurants,
buildings or tourist spots. With such phrases recognized, it is readily to match them with
corresponding geographical regions and then label the cases with coordinates.

In light of the further spatial analysis, the raw data from official websites and web texts need
to be formatted using unified geocoding, which is conducted using scripts calling Google or
Baidu map APIs. Once we have mapped the locations into a consist coordinate system, the
data of other variables, including ecological and socio-economic explanatory variables, can be
indexed according to their corresponding positions in the system.

The collection is implemented using a distributed search engine automatically. Distributed
databases such as Hbase, which enable the system to handle massive data in limited time, are
embedded in the system with traditional relational databases like MySQL. Kafka, a widely
used distributed streaming platform, is incorporated to publish streams of newly collected data.
With distributed components, the system gains the ability to store large amounts of data and
well process real-time data streams. Besides, the flexibility of distributed components makes it
practically facile to extend the scale of clusters of computers used. Users can adjust the scale of
the system to fit the task of data collection while keep a high efficiency. The framework of the
collection system is illustrated in Fig. 3.

3.4 Spatio-temporal based data organization and integration

Data organization, in broad terms, refers to the method of classifying and organizing data sets
to make them more useful [12]. In the field of spatial analysis for public health, different types
of data such as raster data, vector data need to be restructured for further analysis and
integration. Raster data, vector data and other spatial data collected are transformed using
the GDAL library, a translator library for geospatial raster and vector data formats, released
under an X/MIT style open source license by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. Data
with spatial structure in different types are mapped into a unified coordinate system. Feature
information of the cases are extracted from the geo-data using GDAL and related with

Fig. 3 The flow of data processing and organization in OSCAR

Geoinformatica

corresponding positions. In our system, all the geo-data can be processed automatically by
executing program scripts developed based on the GDAL library.

The processed data are stored in a spatial data warehouse using a spatial data cube model
[57], or called a spatial multidimensional database model. To combine spatial data with non-
spatial features, a star schema model is adopted, which consists of spatial dimensions and non-
spatial dimensions. As a data warehouse, the storage components are organized as cuboids,
which are composed of numerous cells. Each cell describes a spatial object obtained from
merging of spatial objects that share same non-spatial properties. The merging can be
implemented through spatial clustering while explores materialization at finer granularity.
Closely connected small areas, which have same or similar characteristics and environments,
are treated as an individual entity. The cell serves as the primary unit for any operations on the
warehouse. The merging, which can be seen as a pre-computation, can not only contribute to
fast response for OLAP operations on the database, but also provide a better format of data for
spatial analysis. Moreover, with those frequently used and shared spatial objects clustered, we
can save a huge amount of storage space.

The data warehouse adopts a star schema model, which has been widely applied in data
warehouse. As is shown in Fig. 4, the star schema model consists of a large fact table, which
stores basic information of spatial objects, and a set of dimension tables, which are linked to
the spatial objects and store corresponding features or explanatory variables. The dimension
tables can be further split to finer granularity and thus present data at different hierarchies. With
the star schema model incorporated, the data warehouse is available for typical OLAP
operations like drill-down, roll-up, dicing, slicing, pivoting, etc.

In consideration of OLAP operations on the data warehouse with a spatial structure, the
dimensions and measures, which may involve spatial components, should be specified. The
dimensions are classified to three types:

1. non-spatial dimension: a dimension that contains data without spatial structure, such as
temperature. The generalizations of non-spatial dimensions do not depend on spatial
distributions.

2. Spatial-to-nonspatial dimension: a dimension that is spatial at fine granularity or low
hierarchies while presents to be non-spatial at high hierarchies. For instance, administra-
tive division is a spatial dimension at levels of villages, cities and provinces with respect to

Fig. 4 The star schema model for spatial objects

Geoinformatica

neighboring correlations between regions. However the dimension comes to be non-
spatial when we roll-up to a high level such as Western Provinces, where spatial
correlations are contained inside but have no influences on measurements or operations
on the whole generalized objects.

3. Spatial-to-spatial dimension: a dimension that remains spatial at any granularities, such as
region in the same isotherm, which always lies on the geographical structure regardless of
the change of temperature.

The measures in the cube are also classified according to whether spatial structure is

involved:

1. Numerical measure: a measure that works with only numerical computations, involving
little spatial information. It can be conducted by cube partition and distributed aggregation
or algebraic manipulations and well fit the non-spatial dimensions.

2. Spatial measure: a measure involves spatial objects. When handling objects under a spatial
structure, measurements and operations, like roll-up, are based on the geographical
structure, where we can obtain corresponding geographical locations and the adjacency
between the spatial objects. It may require several additional processes like spatial
clustering.

In the process of the data organization, the raster data and vector data are usually very big,
such as the temperature, NDVI and DEM, each of which generates a large TIF file every day.
The total amount of such a feature can be more than 50GB within a year. Fortunately, in the era
of big data, the computing resource becomes more powerful and cheaper nowadays, and
therefore the distributed computing is used in order to reduce the computing time and satisfy
the need of quick response in our system.

3.5 Hybrid model integration

Due to the diversity of algorithms for spatial analysis and different perspectives they focus on,
it is often expedient to make comparative analyses through different algorithms with the same
datasets and obtain comprehensive inferences. However, it is difficult to implement all relevant
algorithms in a stand-alone computer, even if the source codes can be downloaded freely.
Specifications, configurations and requirements for environments of different algorithms or
models will bring endless obstacles to the integration. For a system consists of numerous
computers, keeping the consistency of configurations of models within the system is also
troublesome and has a high overhead. Moreover, as a result of various structures of GPU and
CPU, the same algorithm may perform sharply different under two specific computation
structures. From the perspective of users, usually, the case is that users only hope to use a
finite number of algorithms for a certain problem. Therefore, calling numbers of models may
be redundant for users to handle an analysis task and lead to a waste of computing resources.
To address it, it is recommended to deploy models on distributed nodes within the system
using a service-oriented cloud architecture. In our framework, different models are integrated
in a unified model library. Within the model library, models are separately installed on different
virtual machines according to their specific requirements for coding languages or environ-
ments. Although different virtual machines may be physically bound together at a physical
machine, they are supposed to have few impacts on each other during most of their work. The

Geoinformatica

decentralized deployment of the model library contributes to conflict avoidance and access
control of the system. Each model is properly set and work steadily as in a stand-alone
computer. Commonly used algorithms or models, such as logistic regression, decision tree,
neutral networks and SVM, can be readily incorporated into the library and function correctly.
R software environment, a free and open collection of tools for statistical analysis, is also
embedded in the model library. Based on the R environment, packages for linear modeling,
time series, multivariate methods are incorporated for users as alternatives. For the spatial
analysis, major commercial GIS software such as ArcGIS® Server, ArcIMS®, Envinsa®,
GeoPublisher®, GeoMedia® and Oracle MaperViewer® are also accessible.

To optimize the space allocation and improve the efficiency of the aggregation of models, a
service-oriented cloud architecture is adopted, which is conductive to the management of
distributed models and corresponding resources. As is shown in Fig. 5, the cloud computing
architecture integrates Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS):

The infrastructure Layer covers the hardware facilities that support the whole system,
including computers, storage and network devices. The infrastructure layer serves as the
physical basis of the system. To manage numerous devices with different capabilities and
different settings, devices incorporated must follow uniform standards. Moreover, request
dispatchers using Virtual Machine Monitor and Service Governance Service are recommended
to optimize the allocation of requests to available recourses. In order to ensure the coherence
between working processes on the storage, the reading function is implemented using several
accessors. In light of the fact that the multi-source data integrates data with different and
complex structure, each of the accessors is specified to fit certain format or structure. When the

Fig. 5 Model integration of OSCAR in cloud architecture

Geoinformatica

data is to be accessed, the system calls proper accessor that matches the structure of the data to
make retrieval and sampling. Therefore, users are not required to have knowledge about the
internal data structure. Moreover, operations on data are uniformly arranged by the system and
thus keep the feasibility and consistency of the storage.

In the IaaS layer, virtualization technologies, including computing virtualization, storage
virtualization, network virtualization, etc., are exploited to shield the differences and complex-
ities of the hardware and models. Through virtualization layer, resources are presented as a
standardized, flexible, extensible virtual resource pools.

The cloudware layer serves as a management platform for the dispatching and combination
of resource pools. The pools are linked with virtualized resources through ontology mappings.
In the cloudware layer, unified interfaces are generated to automatically allocate resources
according to the demands of analyses tasks or applications. The arrangement of the computing
resources and storage resources is invisible for users. Users only need to call well encapsulated
interfaces to initialize, start up, pause or suspend models regardless of what operations are
implemented on machines.

In the SaaS layer, applications, applications, analytic tools and models are presented to end
users as services. Users can utilize available services on demand. The interactive interface can
be implemented in a browser, though which users can get rid of troubles of deployment and
management of numerous models. SaaS can be further integrated with more applications and
thus make the system more extensible.

Compared with traditional architectures, the cloud architecture achieves high utilization,
high availability with low cost through allowing applications to share resource pools. The
architecture contributes to rapid deployment of different algorithms, easy expansion, intelligent
management of resources.

3.6 Job scheduling of parallel computation

In the section of the integration of models, a service-oriented cloud architecture is described
and the cloud layer is introduced as an intermediate layer for dispatching resources for analysis
tasks. To keep the whole system work smoothly and achieve high efficiency of the spatial
analysis, reasonable job scheduling is critical.

All computing resources, including multi-computers that have tens to thousands of proces-
sors, which can support large diverse workloads of parallel jobs of spatial analysis, are divided
into partitions, each of which consists of different numbers of processors. Partitions are
devoted to service tasks or set aside to support interactive work through time-slicing. The
pool of computing resource, which is mentioned above, is comprised of the partitions.

When analysis tasks are given to the system, the corresponding spatial domain is abstracted
for estimating the computational intensity. The computational intensity serves as an indicator
that approximately suggests how many computing resources are required, namely how many
partitions are supposed to assigned to. Basically, the definition of computational intensity
concerns the ratio of the number of computing operations executed or the number of memory
accesses. However, due to the uneven distribution of spatial objects, the computational
intensity is sensitive to spatial distributions and varies in different sub-areas in the spatial
domain. Following the spatial principle of heterogeneous phenomena, it is necessary to
decompose the original analysis to small jobs on different sub-areas and thus improve the
overall efficiency. The original spatial domain is mapped to grids and the spatial distribution of
computational intensity is obtained using region quadtrees and space filling curves. The spatial

Geoinformatica

distribution of computational intensity reflects sufficient information to support task-
scheduling algorithms. According to values of intensity assigned to the grids, it is available
to make optimal deployment of computing resources and scheduling of parallel operations.
Task scheduling heuristics are exploited to balance the loads of computing among subdomains.

To illustrate the geo-data and the outputs of the spatial analysis models to users, especially
nontechnical users, in comprehensive analytical tasks, an intuitive visualization is necessary.
The system is supposed to highly integrate multi-source data and different analysis algorithms
and offer unified interfaces. OSCAR implements its visualization using interfaces and com-
ponents provided by HTML5. Based on the HTML5-based interfaces, we can present the
indicated information, which may derive from numerous data source and be generated
asynchronously, in a uniform visualization system. A visual analytic tool based on Canvas, a
practical HTML5 component for illustrating 2D content, is embedded in the system to
dynamically draw a set of digital maps and label the maps, showing explicit or implicit spatial
patterns with the outputs or predictor variables. Various information, including geographical
structures, original data of infection cases and results of spatial analysis models, are integrated
in the canvas and thus assist users such as policy makers to deepen their understanding of the
results of the analysis and generate hypotheses and ideas about what may be going on in both
the macro level and the micro level. Besides HTML5, our proposed framework mainly uses
the web based technique such as Openlayers, which is a completely free Open Source
JavaScript tool, to provide heat maps visualizing the spatial distribution of disease, relevant
variables and the risk of the disease. The heat maps of a specific disease can be created
according to requests of users in real time.

As further support to the visualization, a number of web based visualization technologies,
such as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), a language for building rich graphical content, d3.js,
a JavaScript library for manipulating SVG objects, and Bootstrap, a front-end Web develop-
ment framework, are exploited. All of the intermediate data used for painting graphs are stored
in Java-Script Object Notation (JSON), a lightweight web-friendly data-store and data-
interchange format. With the standardized format, different analysis results are well assembled
in the same visualization system. The unified interfaced and unified format of intermediate
data greatly facilitate the processing for drawing heat maps.

4 Experimental implementation

Since the first version was issued in 2015, OSCAR has showed its advantage in data
aggregation and comparative analysis for various public health emergency management
issues, especially spreads of infectious diseases. Cases of infectious diseases have been
systematically analyzed through OSCAR with different algorithms and models, thus
resulted in more comprehensive understanding of the variation tendency of the diseases.
Typical statistical models, GIS analytical tools and specified models with spatio-temporal
structures were contained in the model library. Allowing for spatial principles, the system
provided less biased estimations intuitive visualizations for users. Herein two cases of
public health issues, human rabies and H7N9 in China, are presented to demonstrate the
applicability of OSCAR. The two cases illustrate the workflow of the framework, showing

Geoinformatica

how data integration and model integration synergistically optimize the spatial analysis of
public health issues.

4.1 Human rabies analysis in case view

Human rabies, a widely distributed zoonotic infectious disease which is estimated to cause
hundreds of thousands of fatalities each year worldwide [40, 58, 59], was investigated using
spatial analysis under our framework. Phylogenic analysis of Chinese rabies viruses from 1969
to 2009 has demonstrated that infection had been transmitted intra-provincially and extra-
provincially due to human-related activities. Based on statistical data, many existing works
suggested that numerous factors present explicit or implicit correlations with the incidence of
the disease. However, due to the lack of access to sufficient data of cases, especially variables
of social environmental factors, existing works have seldom conducted analysis from the view
of cases. As many as dozens of factors may affect the distribution and the spread of human
rabies while most of them only have limited access. Table 1 lists major factors that are
considered to have direct or indirect effects on the incidence of human rabies, including
environmental variables, socio-economic variables and transportation variables. As is shown
in the table, data of the factors have been stored and managed in specific databases and
researchers often have to request them through specific data sources. The sources of data for
spatial analysis are so multiple and decentralized that it was far from readily for researchers to
incorporate different factors into their analyses or make quick response with comprehensive
considerations. Moreover, processing on data of some factors requires expert knowledge and
specific tools or software. For instance, data of NDVI, which reflects local environment status
and food supply for animals that may carry viruses, can hardly be directly measured through
statistical methods. NDVI data has high requirements on the accuracy of spatial dimension and
temporal dimension and therefore need specific processing such as Kriging interpolation.
Instead of statistical measure, NDVI is often obtained through spatial computation on remote
sensing images. The specific processing calls for expert experience and adds to the obstacles
for general researchers to conduct comprehensive analyses involving NDVI data. Furthermore,
the amount of required remote sensing data and that of NDVI data are often extremely large.
Data of NDVI and land cover in China obtained via spatial computing on raw data from
MODIS, a common data source, can be more than 1 T bytes. Retrieval operation on so large a
data set is of significant difficulty. When researchers request data with the location and the date
specified, how to find the data efficiently is a great challenge. To improve the efficiency,
proper data organization is necessary.

4.1.1 Data aggregation on-demand

OSCAR was motivated by demands for multi-source data, which could support comprehen-
sive analyses, and further data integration. OSCAR automatically collected and integrated data
to cover most of above factors. Then the massive data were well organized through spatio-
temporal data cube, which greatly optimized operations on data with spatio-temporal struc-
tures. OSCAR provided sufficient data of cases, environmental variables, socio-economic
variables and other relevant data to perform spatial analytical approaches.

Moreover, OSCAR provided HTML5-based visualization tools for users to present data
and interact with the system. Owing to advantages of HTML5, the visualization was highly
interactive and flexible. Different from traditional visualizations, which illustrated data through

static images, OSCAR provided access for users to dynamically adjust resolution and other
parameters to conduct visualization analyses at different granularities and different hierarchies.
Fig. 6 shows the visualization page of OSCAR. Users of OSCAR could select those variables
as input data and exploit services like data retrieval and geocoding to efficiently process the
data. The integration of multi-source data, which cover different kinds of variables, could
contribute to deeper understanding of traits of the disease and reduce bias derive from the
insufficiency of considered factors. In Fig. 6, the visualization page displays numbers of rabies
notifications from 2005 to 2013. A downtrend of the count of cases, which first occurred in
2008, is represented in the figure. However, the annual number of cases remains in a high level
and the corresponding damage cannot be simply ignored. The page represents the spatial
distribution of dog rabies cases in China. According to the scatterplots, cases appear more in
eastern and southern part of China.

Data integration harvested available information for the spatial analysis. However, expan-
sion of features for regression brought challenges to the regression models while boosting the
analysis. The expansion itself often fluctuates the performance of regression models, i.e.
raising typical evaluations such as R2 regardless of whether the added features actually
contribute to the regression. More importantly, a cumbersome model with a number of features
would make it elusive to distinguish definitive factors from those have slight effects. To catch
more critical factors, feature selection was necessary. Multiple backward stepwise logistic
regression was carried out to select the significant explanatory variables. The stepwise process
was repeated 1000 times using different training subsets. The top 20 regression models are
picked out and the corresponding variables were ranked by AIC and mean P-value. Variables
yielding non-significant effects (mean P-value >0.05) were discarded.

The remained features mainly included: the longitude, the average temperature, the distance to
county center, the distance to road network and the minimum spatial distance to the nearest case.

4.1.2 Model integration

Existing spatial analyses of epidemics had two limitations. The first limitation was that those
analyses generally focused on one or two algorithms or models and spared most of their efforts

Fig. 6 The interactive analysis interface of OSCAR

Geoinformatica

to optimize the application of the models instead of bagging different models to perform a
comprehensive analysis. Integration of different models was rare in existing spatial analyses on
public health issues. The integration indeed could boost the spatial analysis through compar-
ison between effects of different models. Based on the comparison, researchers could explore
public health issues from various perspectives and find models that were relatively more ideal
for their issues. Another limitation was that existing works could hardly trace the provenance
of their processing of analyses. Retrospective analysis was of required to make the selection of
models and adjustments of parameters more open and transparent, thus reveal the effects of the
adjustments and lead to deeper understandings of the processing. OSCAR was designed to
handle the problems discussed above. In order to support comprehensive spatial analyses and
trace the processing of analyses, OSCAR integrated multi-source data with different models
and incorporated cloud computing architecture to control data flows.

For the case study on human rabies, numerous tools and models were utilized to implement
all phases of the spatial analysis. In the first phase, researchers had to verify the spatial
autocorrelation, which served as the precondition of models such as SEM. In order to verify
the spatial autocorrelation, Moran’s I, which is widely used in evaluation of spatial autocorre-
lation, is adopted. The Moran’s I from 2005 to 2013 is illustrated in Fig. 7. The global index is
statistically significant and provides evidence of spatial autocorrelation in China. With the spatial
autocorrelation demonstrated, effectiveness of conventional regression models like ordinary
least squares (OLS) might be suspected for bias brought by spatial interactions. Therefore, a
comprehensive analysis integrates outputs from different models, especially models with spatial
specifications, would be more reliable. The graph also represents the downtrend of Moran’s I,
which may be a consequence of the continuous drop of rabies cases in China from 2008.

With the spatial autocorrelation verified, regression models were exploited to explore
correlations between the incidence of human rabies with relevant factors and then predict
possible outbreaks. Individual models, algorithms, analytic software and more services were
integrated in the model library and organized as task-oriented. Components of the model
library were separately deployed and each component implemented not only the spatial model

Geoinformatica

but also associated functions such as specified processing on the input data and deployments of
available computational resources. To forecast possible outbreaks of dog rabies, regression
models were extracted from the model library to predict counts of rabies cases in different
regions of China. The predicted count of possible cases in an individual region reflected the
corresponding risk of the disease, which is supposed to be taken into account for disease
preventions. Different regression estimators were adopted and integrated in the analysis. Each
estimator was based on a specific assumption and focus on some characteristics of the
distribution of the data. In the case of dog rabies in China, we specially allowed for individual
heterogeneity and spatial effects, which were verified by Moran’s I and had significant
influence on the estimation. Estimators included but were not limited to:

(1). A fundamental OLS estimator, which derived from pooled OLS equations. The basic
OLS model concentrated on measuring the associations between dependent variable and
explanatory variables with the heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation ignored.
(2). A random effects-generalized least squares (RE-GLS) estimator. The RE-GLS estimator
incorporated individual heterogeneity with respect to spatial variation among different regions.
(3). Estimator of spatial lag model (SLM). SLM, namely spatial autoregressive model,
assumed that the dependent variable followed a spatial autoregressive process and
concerned spatial substantive dependence.

(4). Estimator of spatial error model (SEM). SEM, also called spatial autocorrelation model,
simulated the spatial dissemination of random effects from factors that were not covered
by the set of explanatory variables. Like SLM, SEM also assumed a spatial autoregressive
process while it suggested spatial error dependence among spatial objects.

(5). A feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimator proposed by Baltagi and Pirotte,
which allowed for both individual heterogeneity and spatial effects. The BP-FGLS
estimator was built on panel data and considered interactions among spatial objects like
spatial spillover effect.

To support models with residuals or error terms that depicted spatial effects, general method
of moments (GMM), an approach that can provide unbiased estimations for those models, was
imported from the model library. Due to the cloud architecture, different estimators worked on
different nodes of the system at the same time. Each model was assigned with exclusive
control of computational resources and services. The exclusive deployment of resources was
managed by the job scheduling system. Accordingly, the outputs had no interference to each
other and performed a comprehensive result together.

Due to the integration of multi-source data, which provide information from different
perspectives, the system gained ability to simultaneously apply different models to conduct
an overall analysis. The input of the regression models was a balanced panel that contains 271
cross sections with 9 time periods. Then 2439 samples were generated, each of which
consisted of the normalized incidence and explanatory variables of an individual section in a
specified year. The result was illustrated in the visualization pages. Figure 8 shows the
scatterplots of observed counts against predicted counts. Users could select the model with
best performance on temporal data or comprehensively take all result as references.

Figure 9 shows the prediction of integrated model for dog rabies cases in 2014. The color
depth denotes the possible extent of the disease and darker colors suggest more possible cases
in the corresponding regions. Compared with the scatterplot of observed cases in 2014, it can
be found that the prediction well fit the observation in most of regions in China.

Geoinformatica

Fig. 8 Scatterplots of observed counts (vertical axis) and predicted counts (horizontal axis) of different models

Although models control for the individual heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation
perform better than rough models like OLS, they may require more computing resources
and become more time-consuming. To ensure the fast response of the system, predictive results
of all models, including models that can output predictions in a very short time but may lose
some information from the original data, are given in succession to support the users.
Decision-makers are available to begin analysis with results from fast models and continuously
make accurate adjustments based on results from complex models, which fully utilize the
inputted data but may take more time.

4.2 Distribution and spread of H7N9 in China

In 2013, H7N9 has stricken eastern provinces of China and cause twenty cases in less than one
month. Most human cases of infection have occurred in four major Chinese cities: Shanghai,
Hangzhou, Huzhou, and Nanjing. Soon after the initial outbreak, the government began to

Geoinformatica

close LPMs in April, 2013, as a precautionary measure. However, decision-making of
measures to control and prevent the disease, including closure of LPMs, was facing challenges
then. On the one hand, the spread of H7N9 was so fast that the government and medical staffs
had to make response as quick as possible to avoid more human infections. An effect but rough
solution was to temporarily close all LPMs. However, on the other hand, closure of LPMs and
culling of poultries would cause great financial damages to traders and farmers. The social
influence of the measure was complex and could not be ignored. Therefore, the object of the
case study was to verify and estimate the direct correlation between H7N9 and LPMs. If the
direct correlation was verified and well quantified, accurate decision-makings would be
available.

To support the study on LPMs, data of LPMs, especially locations of LPMs, were
necessary. However, none of official authorities could provide those data at 2013. To collect
data of LPMs, OSCAR timely launched distributed crawlers to search relevant data from web
map services like Openstreet map, Baidu Map and AutoNavi Map. Then OSCAR added
unified geographical coordinates to detected LPMs using geo-coding. As the data were
collected from multiple sources, OSCAR merged same LPMs based on the similarity between
information of LPMs from different map services. The similarity was measured by the name,
the longitude and the latitude of LPMs and LPMs that were highly similar to each other were
identified as one LPM. Such specific processing, including geo-coding and unified mapping of
ontologies, was beyond functions GIS could provide. OSCAR well satisfied the demands for
dynamic acquisition of specified data and data consolidation.

4.2.1 Influenza a H7N9 data

Every confirmed human case of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection reported in the four
cities by June 7, 2013 were extracted from the database of China CDC. Information of LPMs
was obtained from official websites using automatic crawlers. All data were mapped into a
uniform geographic coordinate system and well organized in spatio-temporal cubes.

Within the 130 individuals with avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection reported by June 7,
2013, 123 (95%) had serious disease with pneumonia and 44 (34%) had died. 85 (65%) were
identified in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Huzhou, and Nanjing. As 88 of the 95 cases with illness
onset confirmed by April 12 were identified in or near these areas, the four cities were marked
as the epicenter. Of the 85 confirmed cases in the four cities, 67 were urban residents and 18
were residents of suburban townships neighboring but outside these cities, who were none-
theless treated in tertiary referral centers in the cities. It was obvious that urban areas suffered
most in the influenza. For poultry species, the urban environments were not suitable for living
or propagation. LPMs, where poultries were artificially clustered, were considered as the major
channel through which poultries, including virus carriers, had been brought to the urban areas.

4.2.2 Deduction of LPM closure

To quantify the direct correlation between H7N9 and LPMs and further balance effects of
closure of LPMs, including both the effect on the control and prevention of H7N9 and the
financial influence on farmers and traders, simulation of the spread H7N9 and closure of LPMs
was needed. The simulation concerned the range and the intensity of the spread of H7N9 as
well as concrete arrangement of the closure of LPMs. The closure of LPMs might follow
different principles and thus perform different effects. However, GIS alone failed to provide

Geoinformatica

the function of simulation. Researchers of public health issues also found it difficult to build a
specific platform to conduct the simulation and efficiently manage such platform. To achieve a
efficient and comprehensive simulation, OSCAR integrated 16 CPUs and implemented a
parallel computing environment to support public health researchers. The system provided
Python interfaces to call models for spatial analyses and GUI for real-time visualization. In less
than one week, OSCAR performed more than 1000 times simulations for researchers to
estimate impacts from the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of LPMs. Based on the
simulation, closure of LPMs and relevant effects were deducted. For policy makers or medical
staff, the spatial deduction on LPMs was of considerable significance as it could help refine
controlling measures, suggesting where to control or close certain LPMs.

The deduction was conducted to directly generate instructions for the control of the
influenza. The orientation was to assess the effect of LPM closure using existing records
and make deductions about the precautionary measure. To assess the effect of LPM closure on
the number of human cases of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection, a Bayesian statistical
model was adopted to perform a population-based before-and-after analysis. The Bayesian
model was extracted from the model library and assigned with sufficient computing resources.
Reported cases in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Huzhou, and Nanjing were used for the analysis.
Based on the report data, time series of onset of illness were generated for visual analysis.
Through synthesizing the time series with records of LPM closure, researchers readily caught
the correlation between the measure and the spread of H7N9.

In the deduction, the posterior probabilities of infection with LPM open and the posterior
probabilities of infection with LPM closed were calculated using the records. The probability
that denoted the estimated incidence was described by the number of possible infectious cases.
Figure 10A shows the daily records while Fig. 11B illustrates the posterior estimations of the
number of daily infectious cases outputted by the Bayesian statistical model. Based on the
indication from the model, general pattern was found that the closure of LPM presented
significant relationship with the influenza incidence. Within the model, when LPM closures
were simulated at certain dates, the estimations in the four cities rapidly declined. The

markets in Nanjing, Huzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai [3]

estimations well matched the observed trend in Fig. 11A as the reported cases reduced after the
closures of LPMs. The deduction suggested that LPMs played a critical role in the spread of
the influenza in urban areas. The deduction was supported by more than 60 confirmed cases.
One to three cases were confirmed almost every day in Shanghai and Hangzhou in the week
before LPMs were closed (Fig. 10A). In Nanjing, one to two cases were reported every few
days before LPM closures, and in Huzhou, only two cases were reported before closures
(Fig. 10A). However, few new cases with onset dates after closures were officially announced
by June 7 (Fig. 10A). In a sensitivity analysis, the model suggested that LPM closure reduced
incidence by 81% in Nanjing, 93% in Shanghai, 92% in Hangzhou, and 91% in Huzhou.

Furthermore, locations of LPMs to be closed were pivotal for the specification of decision-
makings. To support concrete decision-makings, visualization analysis, which presented
intuitive interfaces for researchers, was conducted. As is shown in Fig. 11, the interface
illustrated the geospatial information of the four cities. As an important additional factor,
population density was incorporated in the analysis and depicted on the map. When the disease
broke out, population density could never be neglected. A high population density often added
to the risk of proliferation of the disease and made it more difficult to control the spread.
Therefore, a basic principle was to pay more attention to areas with high population densities
and accordingly close more LPMs. This was also consistent with the spatial principle that
concerns individual heterogeneity.

Another principle was that appropriate prevention was needed. As a measure of prevention,
the areas where LPMs were to be closed could be expended to cover adjacent regions.
According to the spatial principle, closer things have more correlations between each other
than farther away and dynamic processes often happen among neighbor objects, which lead to
exchanges and interactions between the objects. Therefore, areas adjacent to where cases had
been confirmed were of considerable risk. The detailed interactions were hard to track while
they might result in further spread of the influenza. An advisable solution was to isolate infected
areas from uninfected areas. The range of the closure was expanded and LPMs in areas adjacent
to infected areas were also closed. Concerted with the deduction, Fig. 11 shows the spatial
distribution of closed LPMs and confirmed cases. Local authorities closed the 460 live poultry

markets (LPM) in Shanghai on April 6, and the 92 in Nanjing on April 8. Most of the 171 LPMs
in Hangzhou were closed on April 15, and the remainder on April 24. The 57 LPMs in the five
districts of Huzhou were sequentially closed between April 11 and 21. Overall, 780 LPMs were
closed, depopulated, and disinfected in the four cities. Pet bird trade was also suspended.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we proposed a comprehensive framework for spatial analysis on public health issues.
The framework exploit open source data to help find newly occurred cases of diseases, which serve
as timely additions to official data released by governments and relevant institutions. The system
automatically crawls web data and organizes data effectively using a data warehouse with spatio-
temporal cubes. The organization of data well retains the time series information and geographical
structure among the collected data. Based on the specific processing on the data, we can conduct
analyses for public health issues through temporal spatio-temporal dimensions with respect to
complex interactions between neighboring spatial objects. To give analyses through different
perspectives, various algorithms and models are embedded and integrated in model library, where
individual models can be separately called and work without conflicts. Due to the integration of
data and integration of models, the system lessons the limitation for data or resources and makes it
available for researchers to implement different types of models as needed. As a decision-support
system, OSCAR predicts possible spread of diseases as references for further analysis and
incorporate spatial principles to enhance the performance. A balance between efficiency and effect
is also considered. The system is designed to provide fast results as well as one-step services for
relevant decision makers. Then a case study of dog rabies, which verified the validity of our
system, is illustrated. The case study demonstrates that data from different sources, in different
types can be converged using our framework and organized with spatio-temporal structure well
kept. Based on the integration of data, numerous algorithms and models are supported. Different
models are stored in model library and deployed separately. Herein different models can work
together and provide comparable results. In the spatial analysis for dog rabies, the specification of
models lies on the expansion of collected data and the spatio-temporal organization of data, where
spatial and temporal dimensions are sufficiently kept to enable us to integrate spatial autoregressive
process into the analysis. Finally, the distributions of observations and predictions for possible
infection cases are illustrated on maps as an intuitive visualization. Another case study, which is
conducted using data of H7N9 cases in China, shows how to make inductions and deductions
through spatial analysis using the system. The case focus on LPM closure, which is used as a
concrete measure to control and prevent the influenza. Through integration of case data and
statistical models, the system contributes to indicating effects of LPM closure on the spread of the
disease. Furthermore, following spatial principles, the deduction can be used to support specific
implementation of the measure. The framework well organizes spatial data and provides re-
searchers and decision makers analytic tools and intuitive graphs for comprehensive decision-
making. Our framework is built on distributed database, distributed computing and a service-
oriented cloud architecture, therefore it gains better flexibility, extendibility, and ability to respond
fast with large amounts of spatial data during emergency management for public health issues, and
highly integrate different data and algorithms for spatial analysis.

However, more verifications and further improvements are also found necessary. Although our
approach obtained promising results on the dataset of dog rabies cases in China, it still needs to be
verified on more different dataset. Moreover, the system is expected to use machine learning

meta-algorithms for further enhancements on the aggregation model. In the future, we would
continually improve the framework and test it on various datasets.

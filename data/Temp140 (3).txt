Abstract

Along with rapid global urbanization, cities are challenged by 

environmental  risks  and  resource  scarcity.  Sustainable  urban 

planning is central to address the dilemma of economic growth 

and  ecosystem  protection,  where  the  use  of  land  is  critical. 

Sustainable  land  use  patterns  are  spatially  explicit  in  nature, 

and can be structured and addressed using spatial optimiza‐

tion  integrating  GIS  and  mathematical  models. This  research 

discusses prominent sustainability concerns in land use plan‐

ning and suggests a generalized multi‐objective spatial optimi‐

zation model to facilitate conventional planning. The model is 

structured to meet land use demand while satisfying the re‐

quirements of the physical environment, society and economy. 

Unlike existing work relying on raster data, due to its simple 

data structure and ease of spatial relationship evaluation, this 

research develops an approach for identifying land use solu‐

tions based on vector data that better reflects the actual shape 

and spatial layout of land parcels as well as the ways land use 

information is managed in practice. An evolutionary algorithm 

is developed to find the set of efficient (Pareto) solutions given 

the complexity of vector‐based representations of space. The 

proposed approach is applied in an empirical study of Dafeng, 

China  in  order  to  support  local  urban  growth  and  develop‐

ment. The results demonstrate that spatial optimization can be 

a  powerful  tool  for  deriving  effective  and  efficient  land  use 

planning strategies. A comparison to results using a raster data 

approach  supports  the  superiority  of  land  use  optimization 

using vector data as part of planning practice.

The urban landscape worldwide has undergone remarkable changes during the massive global urbanization over 
the  last  few  decades.  The  urban  area  has  increased  by  58,000 km2  between  1970  and  2000  (Seto,  Fragkias, 
Güneralp, & Reilly, 2011), with a projected expansion of 1.2 million km2 by 2030 given current trends in population 

and urban growth (Seto, Güneralp, & Hutyra, 2012). The conversion to urban land from other land uses (e.g. farm‐

land, woodland, and pasture) has resulted in serious consequences like land degradation, reduced biodiversity, 

intensified soil erosion, and fragmented habitat (Elmqvist et al., 2013). Also, rapid growth in urban populations has 

greatly increased the demand for services like housing and transport, leading to conflicting land uses. Sustainable 

urban planning is central to address the dilemma of urban growth and ecosystem protection, where the use of 

land is critical. Further, sustainable land use planning has significant implications for quality of life, necessitating 

assessment and regulation of land uses in the context of society, economy, environment, and ecosystem in order 

to mitigate land use conflicts and promote long‐term balanced development (Healey, 2006).

From an operational perspective, sustainable land use planning involves the arrangement of various land uses 

over geographic space in order to meet the demands of diverse activities, often constrained by economic, social, 

and  environmental  conditions  (Aerts,  Van  Herwijnen,  Janssen,  &  Stewart,  2005;  Ligmann‐Zielinska,  Church,  & 

Jankowski, 2008; Stewart & Janssen, 2014). Land use planning problems are therefore spatial in nature and can 

be structured and addressed using spatial optimization integrating GIS and mathematical models (Church, 2002; 

Murray, 2010, 2017). GIS not only facilitates the management, manipulation, and analysis of land use data, but 

also  provides  an  environment  for  visualizing,  exploring,  and  evaluating  alternative  land  use  scenarios.  Further, 

various goals of planning practices, such as minimizing development costs and maximizing ecological benefits, as 

well as constraining conditions with respect to economy, society, and the physical environment, can be expressed 

through optimization models based on linear, integer, or mixed integer programming.

With the advances in GIS and computing technologies, numerous spatial optimization approaches have been pro‐

posed for land use planning over the last few decades (Yao, Zhang, & Murray, 2018). Spatial decision support systems 

(SDSS) have been developed for assisting interactive processes (Porta et al., 2013; Dai & Ratick, 2014; Santé, Pacurucu, 

Boullón, García, & Miranda, 2016a). Such methods and tools have been applied in a variety of contexts, ranging from 

reserve design (Önal, Wang, Dissanayake, & Westervelt, 2016) and forest management (Church, Murray, Figueroa, & 

Barber, 2000) to general urban and regional planning (Caparros‐Midwood, Barr, & Dawson, 2015). Various sustainable 

land use concerns have been considered for different applications, including compactness of selected regions, conti‐

guity of equal land use, compatibility of different land uses, and environmental and ecological impacts, among others 

(Aerts, Eisinger, Heuvelink, & Stewart, 2003; Ligmann‐Zielinska et al., 2008; Stewart & Janssen, 2014; Önal et al., 2016).

Most approaches and applications, however, have relied upon raster data structured using regular grid cells, 

largely due to its simplicity and ease of assessing spatial relationships among land parcels, such as proximity and 

adjacency. With the exception of Chandramouli, Huang, and Xue (2009), Cao and Ye (2013), Masoomi, Mesgari, 

and Hamrah (2013), and Stewart and Janssen (2014), little has been done utilizing vector data in land use model‐

ing processes, yet this reflects actual decision‐making units. That means land use information is generally vector 

based  and  managed  using  this  data.  Structuring  and  solving  land  use  optimization  problems  using  vector  data, 

however, can be more challenging. For instance, evaluation of the spatial relationships (e.g. adjacency) between 

parcels is often required for calculating measures of land use patterns (e.g. compactness and contiguity), but this 

requires geometric assessment and derivation. In a raster structure, through row–column referencing, this is trivial 

as it is essentially part of the data structure. Similarly, attribute assessment in a raster representation—such as 

area, length of common boundary, or perimeter of a parcel cluster—is generally a simple summation of cells. For 

vector data, however, this is complicated by spatial query and topological relationship evaluation. While the use 

of vector data in land use optimization can better reflect planning practice, it also requires more computational 

processing and evaluation involving polygon object geometries.

Heuristics, such as greedy approaches, genetic algorithms (GA) (or more generally evolutionary algorithms, 

EA), simulated annealing and particle swarm algorithms, are often adopted in land use optimization (Yao et al., 

2018). One reason for this is that spatial optimization usually involves spatial query and evaluation of spatial re‐

lationships that adds to computational complexity (Murray, 2010). Exact solution approaches are often limited in 

practice (Porta et al., 2013; Santé et al., 2016b). Further, land use planning generally involves multiple, often con‐

flicting, objectives, so one best solution likely does not exist. This means compromise outcomes are a reality, and 

Pareto‐optimal solutions are necessary for multi‐objective land use optimization problems. Many heuristics have 

been specifically designed for raster data structures and are not necessarily amenable to vector data. Therefore, 

modified or new heuristics are needed for implementing land use optimization using vector data given the chal‐

lenges mentioned above.

The  aim  of  this  research  is  to  develop  an  EA‐based  heuristic  for  generalized  land  use  optimization  models 

that account for sustainability concerns, applicable for vector land use data, and identify efficient solutions for 

multi‐objective problems. The next section reviews related work on sustainable land use optimization, focusing 

on approaches that account for patterns. Then, a generalized model and solution method are presented. These 

approaches are then applied in an empirical study of Dafeng, China, where a comparison to results based on raster 

data is detailed. The article concludes with a discussion of the properties and wider applicability of the proposed 

modeling approach, the superiority of land use optimization using vector data over raster in practice, and areas 

for future research.

Urban land use planning is important for governments to reconcile diverse and often competing interests, regulate 

activities, and promote development. This usually involves assessing land potential and allocating various socio‐

economic activities to land parcels (Berke & Godschalk, 2006). Given the challenges brought about by worldwide 

urbanization—such as traffic congestion, air pollution, loss of farm land, food security, and urban poverty—sustain‐

able development has become the goal of urban land use planning. A variety of strategies have been proposed to 

account for sustainability in practice, such as mixed land uses, compact communities, infill development, and de‐

centralization (Leccese & McCormick, 2000). Godschalk (2004) developed a sustainability/livability prism to cope 

with conflicts in land use planning. Berke and Godschalk (2006) discussed how to incorporate economy, environ‐

ment, and equity (also known as the three Es of sustainability) into urban land use planning. United Nations (2015) 

explicitly specified 17 global sustainable development goals to be achieved by 2030, including addressing poverty, 

social equity, economy, and sustainable cities. In this regard, land use planning can be considered as a way to ef‐

fectively utilize land resources to achieve social, economic, and environmental objectives in a sustainable manner.

In the field of spatial optimization, the primary concerns in sustainable land use planning are often the form 

and spatial arrangement of land parcels, as well as the spatial relationships between them. Thus, in addition to 

socioeconomic and environmental dimensions, spatial optimization approaches explicitly consider the geographic 

configuration of land uses, often using compactness, contiguity, and compatibility.

Compactness is related to the configuration of a land use type, where land parcels that cluster to form a cir‐

cular shape are desired. Compact land uses can be more energy efficient and compact urban forms can promote 

social equality in access to public services (Watson, 2016). Many shape indices have been proposed and utilized 

as the  indicators of compactness in land use planning, such as those  of perimeter, area, and perimeter‐to‐area 

ratio (Janssen, van Herwijnen, Stewart, & Aerts, 2008; Porta et al., 2013). Other methods encourage parcels to 

be assigned the same land use as their neighbors, thereby forming spatial clusters. Common strategies include 

maximizing the number of adjacent parcels of the same land use, maximizing the largest cluster, and minimizing the 

number of total clusters for each land use (Aerts et al., 2003; Stewart, Janssen, & van Herwijnen, 2004; Stewart 

& Janssen 2014).

YAO et Al.4  |    

Contiguity refers to the connectiveness of land parcels. A land unit is considered contiguous if one can move 

from one point to another point without leaving the same land use. Compact and contiguous land is considered 

more sustainable for habitats (Önal et al., 2016). Many scholars have formulated contiguity through network flow 

approaches that abstract parcels as nodes on a network (Shirabe, 2009; Duque, Church, & Middleton, 2011). Also, 

it has been found that encouraging compactness will implicitly promote contiguity, thus the former is usually em‐

ployed as a surrogate for the latter (Aerts et al., 2003).

Compatibility reflects the coexistence of different land uses in an area without negative effects on each other. 

For example, residential and certain public infrastructure land uses are considered highly compatible as facilities 

like schools and parks can serve nearby neighborhoods. Compatibility is usually obtained through Delphi or ana‐

lytic hierarchy process (AHP) techniques that are subsequently optimized (Ligmann‐Zielinska et al., 2008; Cao et 

al., 2011; Masoomi et al., 2013).

Given the inherent complexity of identifying sustainable land use patterns as discussed above, a number of 

heuristics have been developed to solve land use optimization problems, such as GA (Chandramouli et al., 2009; 

Cao  et  al.,  2011;  Cao,  Huang,  Wang,  &  Lin,  2012;  Cao  &  Ye,  2013;  Schwaab  et  al.,  2018),  simulated  annealing 

(Caparros‐Midwood et al., 2015; Santé et al., 2016b), particle swarm (Masoomi et al., 2013), and ant colony al‐

gorithms (Mi, Hou, Mi, & Song, 2015). For example, Aerts et al. (2005) applied both GA and simulated annealing 

to solve a goal programming model for land use allocation and found that the former had better performance in 

terms of both computational efficiency and quality of solutions. Porta et al. (2013) and Santé et al. (2016b) sought 

to improve the efficiency of GA and simulated annealing using parallel computing, respectively.

Among various heuristics, GA has proven effective and efficient for land use planning (Stewart et al., 2004; 

Aerts et al., 2005; Janssen et al., 2008; Chandramouli et al., 2009; Cao et al., 2011, 2012; Cao & Ye, 2013; Stewart 

& Janssen, 2014; Li & Parrott, 2016; Schwaab et al., 2018). It is a type of search method built on the theories of 

natural selection and genetics, seeking solutions of high quality (“fitness”) through an evolutionary process where 

child solutions are generated from parent solutions through an iterative process including sequential operations—

selection, crossover, and mutation (Sastry, Goldberg, & Kendall, 2014). The applications of GA in land use optimi‐

zation have thus focused on how to design specialized operators for spatial data and sustainable land use patterns. 

For example, in terms of crossover, Stewart et al. (2004) assigned two land uses each to 50% of the chosen cells 

within the two parent solutions. Porta et al. (2013) employed a two‐point crossover operator that exchanges par‐

ent land uses. Regarding mutation, Stewart and Janssen (2014) swapped the land uses of two random subsets of 

proximate units from two parents. Schwaab et al. (2018) compared several crossover and mutation operators for 

land use allocation problems and found that combining diverse mutation operators is helpful to identify represen‐

tative Pareto‐optimal solutions.

Most applications using GA for solving land use optimization problems combine several objectives into one. 

Common  strategies  include  weighted  sum  (Demetriou,  See,  &  Stillwell,  2013;  Porta  et  al.,  2013)  and  goal  pro‐

gramming (or reference point) (Stewart et al., 2004; Janssen et al., 2008; Chandramouli et al., 2009; Cao et al., 

2012; Cao & Ye, 2013; Stewart & Janssen, 2014) approaches. However, the former cannot find all Pareto‐optimal 

solutions in a non‐convex solution space. The latter has the potential to find the full Pareto frontier, if properly 

designed  and  implemented,  but  there  is  no  guarantee.  In  practice,  a  group  of  diverse  Pareto‐optimal  solutions 

is often preferred, and there has been increasing interest in EA like the non‐dominated sorting GA (NSGA) and 

the elitist NSGA (NSGA‐II) designed for multi‐objective decision‐making (Deb, 2014). These have been applied in 

various land use planning contexts (Cao et al., 2011; Schwaab et al., 2018). Further, previous work utilizing GA 

for  vector‐based  land  use  optimization  has  either  employed  non‐spatial  operators  (Chandramouli  et  al.,  2009; 

Cao & Ye, 2013) or adopted certain model simplifications so that procedures designed for raster data could be 

used (Stewart & Janssen, 2014). Therefore, this research attempts to develop an EA for land use optimization by 

extending NSGA‐II (Deb, Pratap, Agarwal, & Meyarivan, 2002) to explicitly account for spatial characteristics of 

vector data, incorporate sustainable land use patterns, and explore the impacts of various parameter settings.

Without loss of generality, a spatial optimization model for sustainable land use planning would include two types 

of objectives, spatial and non‐spatial, subject to basic limits for each land use. Consider the following notation:

i  = index of land parcels
k, k′ = index of land use types
N, N′ = total number of spatial and non‐spatial objectives
Uk, Lk = upper and lower bounds on total area for land use type k
ai = area of parcel i

Objectives (1) and (2) include a set of functions to achieve spatial (e.g. compactness and contiguity) and non‐

spatial (e.g. various costs, economic benefits, and ecological impacts) goals, respectively. Thus, a typical spatial 
land use optimization problem includes at least one objective in each set F and F′. Although minimization is ad‐
opted in (1) and (2), multiplication by −1 for any function f  or f′ indicates maximization. Constraint (3) requires only 

one type of land use allocated to each parcel. Constraints (4a) and (4b) set the range of the desired acreage for 

each land use. Constraint (5) indicates that the values of the decision variables are binary (0 or 1).

Figure 1 details the terminology for the heuristic solution approach employed based on GA. The GA usually 

start with a generation of population (a set of solutions or land use plans), representing the parents. A child in the 

offspring generation is obtained from two parents by means of selection, crossover, and mutation operations. The 

procedure usually stops when a certain number of generations are obtained, or other evaluation criteria are met.

The proposed solution procedure for this model, (1)–(5), is based on the NSGA‐II of Deb et al. (2002) and is 

presented in Figure 2. Associated parameters are summarized in Table 1. The two distinct strategies adopted by 

NSGA‐II are non‐dominated sorting (Step 2b) and crowding sorting (Step 3), where the former encourages con‐

vergence to the Pareto frontier and the latter promotes diversity of solutions. The solution procedure starts with 
an initial population that includes NP individuals (solutions), from which non‐dominated solutions are copied into 
A—the  archive  set  containing  all  non‐dominated  solutions  throughout  the  entire  solution  process.  For  the  first 
iteration, a random set of NP individuals from the combination of P and A is selected to create the next generation 
Q through crossover (Step 5) and mutation (Step 6). The feasibility of the individuals in Q is checked and modified

to be feasible if necessary. Then, A is updated by comparing the individuals in Q and existing solutions in A with 
respect to their non‐domination levels and crowding distances. For the second and subsequent iterations, P is up‐

dated by non‐dominated sorting (Step 2b) and crowding sorting (Step 3), before being used to create the offspring 

generation through selection, crossover, mutation, and feasibility amendment (Steps 4–7). The procedure termi‐
nates when it is run N_iter times, or the same archive set A is obtained in N_sameA consecutive iterations. Unique 

to the implementation reported here, Steps 1, 5, 6, and 7 are explained as follows.

Step 1: Population initialization

1.  For  the  first  individual,  a  set  (G)  of 

Npar ∗ r0|
  (the  largest  integer  smaller  than  Npar*r0)  parcels  is  randomly 
|
|
|
selected  (including  the  parcels  with  fixed  land  use),  for  which  the  current  land  uses  are  to  be  retained. 
|
|

Thus,  each  member  in  the  complementary  set 

̄
G  is  to  be  assigned  a  land  use.

2.  For each member g in G, use it as a seed to build a region by including the neighboring unallocated parcels and 
assign the same land use gk to them until the desired area range [Lgk,Ugk] is achieved. The neighbors are defined 
by adjacency, so that the first‐order neighbors of g (directly adjacent tog) are checked first, then the second‐

order neighbors (adjacent to the first‐order neighbors), etc.

3.  Repeat Step 2 until all the land uses involved in G achieve their allowance.

4.  If every parcel in 

̄
G is allocated a land use type, go to Step 8. Otherwise, continue with Step 5.

5.  If there are unassigned land uses, randomly select an unallocated parcel as a seed and give it an unassigned land 

use. Again, similar to Step 2, use that seed to build a region by assigning the same land use to the adjacent/proxi‐

mate unallocated parcels until the desired allowance is achieved.

6.  If there are still unallocated parcels, for each of them, randomly assign a land use of their neighboring parcels.

7.  Repeat Steps 4–6 until every parcel in 
8.  Repeat Steps 1–7 (Np – 1) times to create the remainder of the individuals.

̄
G is assigned a land use.

exchange the land uses among them. In addition, in order to promote the diversity of the solutions, we use pc instead 
of pm to increase the probability of mutation for the individuals which have multiple copies in the population.

Step 7: Feasibility amendment. The purpose of this step is to modify infeasible solutions in Q to promote their 

feasibility according to constraints (4a) and (4b) through the following procedure:

1.  For  every  infeasible  individual  in  Q,  all  land  use  types  are  grouped  into  two  categories:  K = {k1,k2, … ,ki}  and 

K� = {k�
1

,k�
2

, … ,k�

j},  so  that  the  land  uses  in  K  and  K′  have  a  shortage  and  an  excess  of  area,  respectively.

2.  Randomly choose a land use type ki from K and a parcel with type ki.

3.  Check the neighbors of that parcel (again, first check the first‐order neighbors and then the second‐order neigh‐
j belonging to K′, change the land use of that neighbor to ki. Update 

bors, etc.). If a neighboring parcel has type k′
the overall area of ki and k′

j accordingly.

4.  Repeat Step 3 until the area of ki meets the allowance. Remove ki from K.
5.  Repeat Steps 2–4 until K is empty.

The fixed use parcels are kept unchanged during Steps 5–7. In addition, feasibility is also considered in Step 2b 

when determining the non‐domination level for each solution. That is, infeasible solutions are always dominated by 
feasible solutions. Two infeasible solutions, s1 and s2, are compared using the violation values defined as in  Equation (6):

Vs = ∑k

diffs,k

with diffs,k =

Lk − Areas,k if Lk > Areas,k
Areas,k − Uk if Areas,k > Uk

where Areas,k is the total area of land use k for solution s. Therefore, s1 is dominated by s2 if V1

Steps  2b,  3,  4,  and  8  are  rather  standard  for  NSGA‐II  implementation.  Details  regarding  such  steps  can  be 

found in Deb et al. (2002), among many others.

4.1 | Study area and the planning context

The study area is along the urban fringe of Dafeng, Jiangsu Province, China, covering part of Chuandong Farm and 
Caodianmiao Town (see Figure 3). The area consists of 680 parcels with a total area 6.52 km2, grouped into six land

use categories according to national regulations: arable land, green land, construction land, water, transportation, 

and other (undeveloped) land. During the last three decades, like many Chinese cities, Dafeng has experienced 

extensive changes in the physical forms and functions of land use caused by rapid urbanization, and there has 

been  increasing  demand  for  land  for  urban  construction  and  transportation,  due  to  population  and  economic 

growth. The primary planning goal is to increase urban construction and transportation land by 3–12 and 4–6%, 

respectively, mainly through transforming undeveloped land, which can be reduced by 50–90%. The area of all the 

other land uses can vary by ±10%. In total, 160 parcels were selected to retain current land uses, most of which are 

roads, rivers, and key constructions. Sustainable urban development goals require certain patterns of spatial lay‐

out for different land uses, such as compactness and compatibility. In this context, spatial optimization approaches 

are developed and applied to assist decision‐making for local urban land use planning.

To support application and analysis, the following additional notation is used:

Considering the generalized model in Section 3, the first two objectives, (7) and (8), belong to the spatial objec‐
tive set F in (1), and objective (9) belongs to the non‐spatial objective set F′ in (2). Objective (7) is to maximize 

the compactness by encouraging the same land use to be assigned to adjacent parcels, which would implicitly 

promote  contiguity  of  the  same  land  use  (see  Aerts  et  al.,  2003).  Objective  (8)  aims  to  maximize  the  overall 

compatibility  of  different  land  uses.  Objective  (9)  attempts  to  minimize  total  costs.  Two  models  are  solved: 

Scenario I includes objectives (7) and (9); Scenario II includes all three objectives (7)–(9), both subject to con‐

straints (3)–(5).

The compatibility indicators are shown in Table 2. Four levels of compatibility were determined using the AHP 

method by consulting practitioners in the local land use planning bureau, with higher values indicating better com‐

patibility. The parameter values for the solution procedure are presented in Table 1, obtained by trial and error. 

It is well known that GA involve many parameters, among which are the probabilities of crossover and mutation. 
Deb (2014) indicated that a rule of thumb was to start with pc = 0.6 and pm = 0.05. Since crossover usually occurs 
with a high probability and mutation happens with a low probability, we systematically tested a set of pc and pm 
values for Scenario I while keeping other parameters fixed. The former was varied from 0.55 to 1.0 and the latter 

was varied from 0.01 to 0.10. As it becomes difficult to visually compare the results from different tests when the 

model includes more than two objectives, we present one instance for Scenario II using the same parameters as 

those in Scenario I.

The  models  defined  above  were  solved  using  our  detailed  method,  implemented  using  Python  with  spatial 

data/relationships processed and evaluated using PySAL, an open‐source Python library for spatial analysis (see 

Anselin & Rey, 2014). The commercial GIS software ArcGIS (version 10.6, by Esri, Redlands, CA, USA) was em‐

ployed for spatial data management, processing, and visualization.

Both models for Scenarios I and II were run on a Mac computer with 16 GB memory and 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7 

processor. The tests for a range of parameter values in Scenario I took 20–40 s and the running time for Scenario 

II is about 60 s. The final Pareto‐optimal solutions for Scenario I are summarized in Figure 4, with opposite values 

shown for objectives (7) and (8) for the corresponding minimization problems. Figures 4a and b depict the varia‐

tions in the solution set for different crossover and mutation probabilities, respectively.

It can be observed that the solutions are generally well spread in Figures 4a and b, although the diversity of 

solutions varies across different crossover or mutation probabilities. Both graphs in Figure 4 suggest that there 
is no obvious association between the values of pc or pm and the quality of obtained solutions. In other words, 
an increase of pc or pm, when keeping all other parameters constant, does not necessarily guarantee a set of bet‐
ter Pareto‐optimal solutions. For example, in Figure 4b, most solutions are dominated by those with pm = 0.07. 
Interestingly, Figure 4a indicates that the Pareto‐optimal solutions derived with the highest pm value 1.0 dominate 
most of those obtained with other pm values.

Further, Figure 5 describes the set of non‐dominated solutions across generations for Scenarios I and II, both 
with pc = 0.60 and pm = 0.05. It can be observed that the quality of non‐dominated solutions increases with the 
progress of generation evolution, but the speed of improvement varies. Figure 5a suggests that the convergence 

of non‐dominated solutions for Scenario I became much quicker than before, after 80 generations. For Scenario 

II, the improvement in solutions was relatively slow until the 120th generation, and the speed of convergence 

increased greatly after the 180th generation.

Figure 6 shows the corresponding land use plans and the parcels involved in the conversion for two solutions 
in Figure 4a: one with the best compactness (pc = 0.55) (Figure 6a) and the other with the least cost (pc = 1.0) 
(Figure 6b). As can be seen, the compactness of arable and construction land in Figure 6 is improved compared to 

the original land use layout in Figure 3. However, compared to Figure 6b, the newly added arable land (top right) 

and construction land (top) makes the plan in Figure 6a have better compactness. Regarding the land conversion, 

the increase in construction and transportation land is mainly achieved by transforming arable and undeveloped 

land. For example, the construction land is expanded mainly through transforming the surrounding arable land. 

There are also conversions between other types of land use, such as arable land and water, and arable and green 

land.

Figure 7 presents the land use plan with the best compatibility objective value in Figure 5b. Again, the in‐

crease in construction and transportation land is primarily achieved by reducing the undeveloped and arable land. 

Compared to the plans in Figure 6, the land use layout is very different from the original one in the sense that it 

involves a lot of changes to water and arable land. For example, lots of water area on the top right is converted to 

arable land. The variety of land uses on the bottom left make that region more fragmented than the original plan, 

where the same region mainly contains arable land and water.

Finally, the area of different land uses for the plans in Figures 6 and 7 is summarized in Figure 8. Compared 

to the original area, arable, construction, and transportation land are increased in all three plans. In contrast, the 

amount of undeveloped land is decreased as expected. For green land, it is decreased in both plans in Figure 6 by 

9.3 and 4.0% for Figures 6a and b, respectively, while it is increased by 8.7% in the plan in Figure 7. Regarding the 

land for water resources, there is only a slight growth in the plan in Figure 6a.

4.4 | Comparison with results using raster data

To provide a comparative assessment, the proposed approach was also applied for the study area represented 
using raster data. As about 0.9% of the land parcels have an area less than 100 m2 and 10% have an area less 
than 400 m2, a spatial resolution of 10 × 10 m was selected in order to generate a raster surface represent‐

ing the current land use layout with sufficient accuracy and detail. In total, the study area consists of 65,211 

raster grid cells, with the land use in each cell determined by the type having the largest area within that cell, 
as shown in Figure 9. Accordingly, the land use quantity, Uk and Lk in (4a) and (4b), was rounded to the nearest 
integer.

Using the same parameters as those adopted by the instances summarized in Figures 6 and 7, the land use 

plans  generated  from  the  raster  representation  (Figure  9)  are  presented  in  Figure  10.  Figures  10a  and  b  show 

two  plans  for  Scenario  I,  most  compact  and  least  cost,  respectively.  Figure  10c  depicts  the  plan  with  the  best

Figures 6 and 7. Obviously, the land use layouts in the former are more fragmented. Also, most of the area in the 

southeast of the study area is converted into construction and green space, with a mixture of scattered arable

land and water. The three plans in Figure 10 are very similar visually, but there are some important differences. For 

instance, a road in the northwest is converted into arable land in Figure 10a, but part of it remains in Figures 10b 

and c. The plan for Scenario II (Figure 10c) has more green and construction land in the southeast than the other 

two plans for Scenario I (Figures 10a and b).

Figure 11 further describes the allocation of each land use in the three plans in Figure 10, compared to 

the original plan in Figure 9. Similar to the results in Figure 8, arable, construction, and transportation land 

is increased, largely by reducing the other (undeveloped) land. However, the amount of converted land is 
different. For example, the three plans generated with raster data all have less arable land (< 3.5 km2) and 

more  undeveloped  land  (over  45%  retained)  compared  to  the  corresponding  plans  using  vector  data.  In 

addition, some land has a loss in a vector‐generated plan but a gain in the corresponding raster‐generated 

plan. For instance, green space in both plans in Figure 6 is reduced but is increased in Figures 10a and b. 

Compared  to  the  decrease  of  4.0%  in  Figure  6b,  water  in  the  plan  represented  in  Figure  10b  increased 

6.4%.

Spatial optimization has been widely applied to support land use planning. Most studies, however, have utilized 

raster data due to the simple data structure and the ease of spatial relationship assessment. This research pro‐

posed an evolutionary algorithm for a generalized spatial land use optimization problem using vector data that 

better reflects how data are stored and organized in cadastral management and land use planning. The empirical 

study  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  approach  in  finding  good  quality  and  diverse  land  use 

plans,  with  a  focus  on  sustainability  concerns.  The  comparison  with  the  results  from  raster  data  also  suggests 

that vector‐based land use optimization is more feasible and more desirable in the practice of land use planning.

Although  the  generalized  model  defined  by  (1)–(5)  can  be  applied  to  both  raster  and  vector  land  use  data, 

implementation procedures can be very different. One challenge in using vector data for spatial land use opti‐

mization is constraints on each land use. It is straightforward for raster data, since it consists of same‐size grid 

cells, making the area calculation equivalent to counting the number of total cells of the same land use. Stewart 

and Janssen (2014) adopted this approach for vector data by transforming constraints (4a) and (4b) to a parcel 

quantity constraint (i.e. the number of parcels to be allocated for each land use type), but this is only applicable 

for cases where all parcels have similar sizes. Further, for raster data, Steps 5 and 6 might bring no area changes 

to each land use if the number of parcels of each type remains the same, even though their spatial layout might be 

altered. However, in the case of vector representation, Steps 5 and 6 might lead to very different area allocations 

for each land use due to the diverse size of parcels, as shown in the empirical study in this research. Thus, it is more 

complex to assess and meet the land use quantity constraints if using vector data, so the feasibility amendment 

in Step 7 is crucial.

F I G U R E   9  Raster representation of the study area

In addition to simplification in implementation, several disadvantages of using raster data in land use optimiza‐

tion were observed when comparing results using vector data. First, compared to the original dataset, the amount 

of raster cells is almost 96 times that of land parcels, which can greatly increase the demand for data storage and 

computing. Also, a trade‐off between the dataset size and the details of the represented land use layout is often 

necessary when selecting the spatial resolution for raster data. For example, the proportion of transportation land 

will decrease from 1.9 to 0.6% if the cell size is increased from 10 × 10 to 30 × 30 m, which will inevitably intro‐

duce errors or uncertainty in the obtained land use plans. Again, as partitioning a land parcel into a set of raster 

cells provides more flexibility of land use conversion, the obtained land use plans tend to be more fragmented, as 

shown in Figure 10, which is often undesirable in practice. Therefore, land use optimization using vector data can 

provide higher quality land use plans that better reflect the reality and needs of land use planning.

The  proposed  approach  has  wide  applicability,  as  the  major  steps  in  Figure  2  are  not  problem  specific  or 

subject to any particular objectives or constraints. The only requirement for crossover and mutation operations 

is to select a contiguous block of parcels, which attempts to avoid fragmented land use layouts. For substantive 

applications, the generalized model in (1)–(5) can be modified by incorporating other objectives and constraints. 

Accordingly, the violation value in (6) needs to be adjusted by considering other constraints.

Evolutionary algorithms like GA do have some limitations. One shortcoming is that they usually involve many 

parameters (e.g. population size, crossover, and mutation probability), where numerical tests are often required 

to find a good set of parameter values that can generate solutions of desired quality for specific problems. In 

this research, a set of common options for crossover and mutation probabilities was examined, indicating that 

increasing those probabilities did not necessarily result in an improvement or degradation of the solution quality 

(see Figure 4). Another limitation is that evolutionary multi‐objective optimization approaches like NSGA‐II are 

often difficult to apply to large‐dimensional problems containing more than three objectives. This is mainly due 

to the high computational costs required to preserve solution diversity, difficulty in visualization of large‐dimen‐

sional solutions, and the limited search capacity for new solutions because a solution would more easily become 

non‐dominated  (Deb,  2014).  It  should  also  be  noted  that  multi‐objective  land  use  optimization  is  only  part  of 

YAO et Al.    |  19

F I G U R E   1 1  Area of different land uses for the plans in Figure 10

the  overall  decision‐making  process,  requiring  other  quantitative/qualitative  considerations  to  select  the  final 

preferred plan.

There are several areas worth further investigation. First, the impact of the parameter values other than 

crossover  and  mutation  probabilities,  such  as  the  population  size  and  the  proportion  of  parcels  retaining 

original land uses, on the quality of solutions needs further exploration. Second, the crossover and mutation 

operators  can  be  adapted  to  account  for  particular  spatial  objectives/constraints.  For  example,  in  Step  5 

(mutation, instead of random exchange), the land uses within the selected block can be reallocated based on 

their compatibility with adjacent land uses, or the dominant land use can be assigned to the whole block to 

promote compactness/contiguity. Third, when amending infeasible solutions, rather than choosing a single 

parcel, multiple parcels with a land use having insufficient area can be selected and then their neighbors are 

checked and modified in a region‐growing manner. Fourth, the measure of compactness/contiguity adopted 

in  objective  (7)  was  originally  designed  for  raster  data,  which  might  not  work  in  some  cases  when  using 

vector‐based data, as two adjacent parcels may only share a small proportion of boundary or may be very 

different in size. Therefore, other compactness and contiguity measures may be useful. Finally, land parcels 

might be divided into two or more smaller parcels in practice, which is a challenge for vector‐based land use 

optimization.

Land use planning has long been an active application area of spatial optimization. Given the ongoing global 

urbanization and consequent transformations in urban spatial and social structures, sustainable urban land use 

plans  are  essential  to  achieve  long‐term  balanced  urban  development.  Spatial  land  use  optimization  explicitly 

YAO et Al.considering sustainability concerns can be a valuable tool to generate a variety of land use plans to be further 

evaluated by decision‐makers with other ancillary information.

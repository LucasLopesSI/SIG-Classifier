Abstract

For some spatiotemporal applications, it can be assumed that the modeled world is precise and bounded, and
that also our record of it is precise. While these simplifying assumptions are sufﬁcient in applications like a
land information system, they are unnecessarily crude for many other applications that manage data with
spatial and/or temporal extents, such as navigational applications. This work explores fuzziness and
uncertainty, subsumed under the term indeterminacy, in the spatiotemporal context. To better illustrate the
basic spatiotemporal concepts of change or evolution, it is shown how the fundamental modeling concepts of
spatial objects, attributes, and relationships and time points and periods are inﬂuenced by indeterminacy and
how they can be combined. In particular, the focus is on the change of spatial objects and their geometries
across time. Four change scenarios are outlined, which concern discrete versus continuous change and
asynchronous versus synchronous measurement, and it is shown how to model indeterminacy for each. A case
study illustrates the applicability of the paper’s general proposal by describing the uncertainty related to the
management of the movements of point objects, such as the management of vehicle positions in a ﬂeet
management system.

Spatiotemporal applications have received substantial attention over the last years in
both the research- and the application-oriented communities. Requirements analysis [27],
[36], models [11], [38], data types [17], and data structures [23], [24], [29], [31], [32],
[37] are important topics in this area. Although considerable research effort and valuable
results do exist, many studies and proposed approaches are based on the assumption that,

in the spatiotemporal mini-world, objects have crisp boundaries, relationships among
them are precisely deﬁned; and accurate measurements of positions are assumed that
lead to error-free representations.

However, reality differs; very often boundaries do not strictly separate objects but,
rather, show a transition between them. Consider the example from an environmental
system in which different climate zones, such as desert and prairie, are not precisely
bounded. We encounter a transition, or fuzziness, between them. As another example, in
a navigational system, the position of a moving vehicle, although considered as precise
in nature, might not be known exactly, e.g., the GPS position of car A as of two minutes
ago is known, but the precise, current position is not. This example is characterized by
uncertainty (i.e., lack of knowledge or error) about its actual (current) position.

In this paper, we deal with fuzziness and uncertainty as related to spatiotemporal
objects. More speciﬁcally, we start by pointing out the semantic differences between the
two cases that constitute spatiotemporal indeterminacy: fuzziness, concerning Bblurry^
situations, and uncertainty, expressing the Bnot-exactly-known^ reality. Our goal is to
clarify these terms, observe their occurrence, study their impact on the spatial and
temporal domains (i.e., spatial versus temporal fuzziness and uncertainty), as well as the
combined effect, i.e., spatiotemporal fuzziness and uncertainty. We discuss how the
basic spatiotemporal modeling concepts, such as spatial objects, attributes, relationships,
time points, and time periods are inﬂuenced by indeterminacy. The approach of Dyreson
et al. [13], [14] on indeterminacy in the temporal domain is used as a vehicle to explore
fuzziness and uncertainty in spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal applications, as well as
to point out their differences and similarities.

The contribution of this work is as follows. First, we integrate spatial and temporal
indeterminacy in the spatiotemporal context, and, second, we show how both can be
expressed by using any of the two mathematical
theory and
probability theory. Third, we discuss the nature of spatiotemporal indeterminacy and
offer a mathematical description of it. Fourth, the applicability of the indeterminacy
proposal is illustrated by examining the moving point object example scenario. Here, we
examine the contributing factors, the measurement error, and the sampling error more
closely. This work is based on previous work on the capture of the fuzziness and
uncertainty of spatiotemporal objects, and on the representation of moving point objects
and the related uncertainty [28], [30].

theories: fuzzy set

There are only few works on spatiotemporal indeterminacy. Work by Shibasaki
[35] focuses on simple spatial and temporal uncertainty concepts and integrates them to
describe spatial updates in a GIS database. However, the presented concepts are rather
abstract and cannot immediately be applied. Moreira et al. [26] presents a data model
for moving-point objects that is based on the decomposition of the trajectories of the
objects into sections. In addition, so-called superset and subset semantics are proposed
that aim to address uncertainty issues. A maximum error occurs when linearly ap-
proximating the position of an object in-between samples of its position, and this
error is used in the process of query processing. However, this work is not connected
to any speciﬁc application or technological context and thus does not cover the
ranges of errors and the relationships between different error measures. Cheng and

Molenaar [8] present an approach that aims at describing the change of fuzzy features
over time using a raster representation. Hornsby and Egenhofer [20] consider the
reasoning about the uncertainty of spatiotemporal positions at varying level of detail.
They adjust the level of detail, or granularity, of the data according to a speciﬁc task or
application context.

More work exists that concerns indeterminate temporal and spatial information indi-
vidually. Dyreson and Snodgrass [13] take a probabilistic approach in handling
indeterminacy of temporal information. On the other hand, research in the geography
and surveying domain provides ways to describe and handle spatial indeterminacy. The
concept of epsilon distances is introduced by Chrisman [9], to quantify the cartographic
error related to map production. Burrough et al. [6], [7] study spatial uncertainty as
related to soil boundaries. This work uses fuzzy set
theory for soil classiﬁcation.
Worboys [40], [41] has considered spatial indeterminacy as it relates to resolution,
Further, Vazirgiannis [39] uses fuzzy measures to better describe spatial relationships
among determinate spatial objects. Schneider [33], [34] takes a more pragmatic approach
in that he models the spatial world in terms of spatial data types and expresses fuzziness
as related to the data types and the operations on them. Bloch, e.g., [3], focuses on fuzzy
distance measures and functions in the image processing context. Finally, Goodchild and
Gopal [16] offers further readings on works on spatial
indeterminacy beyond the
exemplary ones presented here.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 covers a motivating example.
Section 3 proceeds to brieﬂy present the spatial and temporal concepts involved in the
spatiotemporal application domain, explores the semantics, and offers mathematical
formulations of indeterminate temporal and spatial concepts. Next, Section 4 discusses
the spatiotemporal indeterminacy concepts, and Section 5 elaborates on the motivating
example, the moving point objects case, to better illustrate and also to assess the
feasibility of the indeterminacy concepts. Finally, Section 6 concludes with the future
research plans.

2. Motivating exampleVmoving object tracking

We can identify real-world entities whose extents and shapes are not relevant in a given
application context, and, thus, can be modeled as point objects. As an application, con-
sider the tracking of the continuous movements of cars, planes, people, etc. An applica-
tion scenario is the optimization of transportation, especially in densely populated areas.
An example ﬂeet management project [4], conducted by Emphasis Telematics and the
Research and Academic Computer Technology Institute, Greece, aims at designing
what is termed an BIntelligent Fleet Management System.^ In this application, vehicles
equipped with GPS devices transmit their positions to a central computer using either
radio communication links or cellular phones. At the central site, the data is processed
and utilized using data mining techniques.

To precisely capture the movement of such an object, we have to know its position at
all times, i.e., on a continuous basis. However, GPS and telecommunications technol-

214

PFOSER, TRYFONA AND JENSEN

ogies only allow us to sample an object’s position, i.e., to obtain the position at discrete
instances of time, such as every few seconds. A ﬁrst approach to representing the
movements of objects would be to store the position samples. This would imply that we
could not answer queries about the objects’ movements at times in-between sampled
positions. Rather, to obtain the entire movement, we have to interpolate the positions.
The simplest approach is to use linear interpolation, as opposed to other methods such as
polynomial splines [2]. In case we are dealing with point objects, the sampled positions
then become the end points of line segments, which in turn constitute polylines. The
movement of an object can be represented by a polyline in three-dimensional space (two
spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension). In geometrical terms, the movement of
an object is termed a trajectory (we will use Bmovement^ and Btrajectory^ interchange-
ably) (cf. Figure 1(a)). Figure 1(b) shows the spatiotemporal space (the cube in solid
lines) and several trajectories (the solid lines). The top of the cube represents the time of
the most recent position sample. The wavy-dotted lines at the top symbolize the growth
of the cube with time.

The trajectory data is affected by two sources of indeterminacy, (i) the measurement
error and (ii) the sampling error. The accuracy and thus the quality of a measurement
depends largely on the technique usedVwe will generally assume that GPS is used for
position measurement. The movement is captured by position sampling at regular time
periods. This introduces uncertainty about the position of the object in-between the
measurements. So the accuracy of the representation of an object’s movement is affected
by the frequency with which position samples are taken, the sampling rate. This, in turn,
may be set by considering the speed of the object and the desired maximum distance
between consecutive samples.

Figure 2 illustrates how the movement is sampled at discrete time points (t1 through
t9), approximated by using linear interpolation and how the measurement and the
sampling error affect the representation.

In the following, we will develop a general framework for spatiotemporal indeter-
minacy that allows us to quantify and handle the above uncertainties. We ﬁrst discuss the

temporal and spatial uncertainty, to derive spatiotemporal uncertainty concepts, and then
we ﬁnally relate them to the above example.

3. Temporal and spatial concepts and indeterminacy

Several basic spatial and temporal concepts exist that are important in geo-referenced
time-varying application environments. In the following, we brieﬂy introduce these
concepts and discuss how they are affected by indeterminacy and how this can be
expressed mathematically. An introduction to the mathematical concepts used in the
following can be found in Appendix A.

Categorizing spatiotemporal applications based on the type of data they manage
reveals an interplay of temporal and spatial concepts. It is helpful to consider the
following three categories.

(a) Applications dealing with moving objects, such as navigational applications; in
these, objects are capable of continuously changing their positions across time. An
example is a moving Bcar^ on a road network.

(b) Applications involving objects located in space whose characteristics, as well as
their location, may change across time. For example, in a land information system,
Blandparcels^ change their locations by changing their shapes, but they do not Bmove.^
(c) Applications dealing with objects that integrate the above two behaviors; for ex-
ample, in enviromnental applications, Bpollution^ is measured as a moving phenom-
enon with properties and shape that change across time.

Based on these three types of applications, the following sections identify the relevant
temporal and spatial modeling concepts and show how they are affected by inde-
terminacy. Based on these temporal and spatial concepts, spatiotemporal indeterminacy
will be deﬁned in Section 4.

3.1. Temporal concepts

The literature reports on many different models of time. Some authors even propose
taxonomies of time. In our work, we assume a linear ordered time line, isomorphic to a

216

ﬁnite subset of the natural numbers. The elements of this set are termed chronons. Based
on this fundamental deﬁnition, two basic time constructs are used to record facts and
information of a database, namely time points and time periods. A time point t is located
during a chronon, while a time period ½tk, tm(cid:1), with tk, tm being time points and tk e tm has
duration and is deﬁned as the chronons from the chronon during which tk is located to the
chronon during which tm is located.

3.1.1.
Indeterminate time points. A time point is determinate if it is known during
which chronon it is located. Figure 3(a) shows a determinate point I1 located during
chronon 2.1 A time point is indeterminate if we do not know exactly during which
chronon among a sequence of chronons it is located. An indeterminate time point is
described by a lower support, an upper support, and a probability function [13]. The
supports are chronons that delimit the location of the time point, e.g., for time point I2 in
Figure 3(b), the lower support is chronon 2 and the upper support is chronon 5, whereas
the probability function tells us about where the time point is located within the range,
e.g., a uniform distribution tells us that it is equally likely for the time point to be located
during each of chronons 2 to 5.

The probability mass function, pt, for the indeterminate time point t is deﬁned for all

chronons i:

pt ið Þ ¼ P t ¼ i

½

(cid:1) : i 2 N (cid:2) N

ð1Þ

Here, P½t = i(cid:1) is the probability that time point t is located during chronon i. In our
example that assumes a uniform distribution, e.g., P ½I2 = 3(cid:1) = 0.25, the probabilities for

chronons outside the lower support-upper support range are 0. Also, all indeterminate
time points are considered to be independent, i.e.,

P t1 ¼ i ^ t2 ¼ j

½

(cid:1) ¼ P t1 ¼ i
½

(cid:1) (cid:2) P t2 ¼ j

(cid:1)

Given that all probability distributions are fuzzy sets (cf. Appendix A), in using the
probability mass function as basis, we obtain the following membership function:

(cid:1)t ið Þ ¼ (cid:2)pt ið Þ

In this formula, (cid:2) is an arbitrary scale factor that relates the membership grade to the
probability of a point.

Indeterminate time periods. A time period is a subset of the time line bounded
3.1.2.
by two time points. Depending on whether the bounding points are determinate or
indeterminate, we term the time period accordingly. In Figure 4(a), I1 and I2 are time
periods that denote the indeterminate start and end point of an indeterminate time period.
Possible periods can range from chronon 1 to chronon 8 (max), but have to range from at
least 3 to at least 6 (min).

The indeterminate time period in Figure 4(a) can also be perceived as having a fuzzy
boundary. In the following, we thus derive a membership function, (cid:1)T (x), returning the
degree to which an arbitrary chronon x is part of an indeterminate time period T. In
Figure 4(a), it is obvious that at least chronons 3 through 6 are deﬁnitely part of time
period T. Considering the time periods I1 and I2, if chronon 2 is within period I1, so is
chronon 3; and if chronon 1 is within, so are chronons 2 and 3. The same holds for
chronons 6, 7, and 8 of I2. Figure 4(b) gives the probability mass functions of I1 and
I2, i.e., the probability for a chronon to be in T. Summing up the probability from Bthe
outside to the inside^ produces the probability density functions.

To derive the membership function (cid:1)T (t), the time period T has to be split into
three parts; (1) the Bcore^ (chronons 4 and 5), (2) the periods I1 and I2, and (3)
the outside world. A membership grade of 1 and 0 indicate deﬁnite and no member-
ship in the time period, respectively. All chronons in the core have a grade of 1. The

grade of the chronons in the periods is equal to the value of the probability density

Spatial concepts

Physical objects have spatial locations. In speciﬁc application environments, the objects’
position in space matter and then, these objects are called spatial objects, e.g., a moving
Bcar^ in a navigational system is a spatial object. The position is represented in terms of
a geometry, which can be (of type) point, line, region, or any combination thereof [19].
The geometry of the position of a spatial object varies not only with the different type of
physical object, but also with the application context, e.g., a city can be represented as
region but also as a point.

Spatial objects can be related to one another based on their positions in space. A
spatial relationship is a relationship among spatial objects, or more precisely, a rela-
tionship among the position of the objects involved. For example, two landparcels are
neighbors, i.e., they have common borders.

Objects have attributes that characterize them. A spatial object may have, apart from
descriptive attributes and its position, also spatial attributes, e.g., the Bvegetation^ of a
Blandparcel.^ Values of spatial attributes are determined by the object’s position and the
underlying physical space, not on the object itself. If the spatial object Blandparcel^
changes position, then the value of Bvegetation^ will change. Spatial attributes are also
related to geometries in space, as they split space into parts within which the values of
the spatial attributes remain the same; each part of space has (like, the objects’ positions)
geometry (of type) point, line, region, or a combination thereof. Figure 5 shows a spatial
object, two spatial attributes, and related geometries. Note that not all spatial objects
have spatial attributes. This depends on the application requirements. For example,
typically no spatial attribute is assigned to a moving car, while many (e.g., Bvegetation,^
Bsoil type^) are assigned to a landparcel. In geographic information systems, spatial
attributes are also commonly referred to as layers.

3.2.1.
Indeterminacy and space. The nature of spatial indeterminacy, i.e., spatial
fuzziness and uncertainty, is an important issue in geography and spatial information
science. Fuzziness is a property of a geographic entity [18]. Furthermore, fuzziness con-
cerns objects that cannot be precisely deﬁned otherwise [15]. On the other hand, uncer-
tainty results from limitations in the observation, i.e., the measurement process [18].

To illustrate the concept of indeterminacy as related to the above concepts, consider
the example of different climate zones, e.g., desert and prairie. Zones do not have precise

INDETERMINACY AND SPATIOTEMPORAL DATA

219

bounds, but, rather, blurry situations exist around the boundaries between zones. We can
identify a location for which there is no precise knowledge whether it is in the desert or
on the prairie, and we can ﬁnd a location that is in-between. Consequently, the boundary
between the two climate zones is fuzzy. However, for a forest partitioned into land
parcels, we can clearly state which tree belongs to which land parcel. The boundaries
between the land parcels are crisp and, thus, certain.

In contrast, let us consider the position of a moving vehicle whose position is not
exactly known. This example is characterized by a lack of knowledge about the car’s
position. The car has a precise positionVit is our lack of knowledge about the position
that introduces uncertainty. Without further knowledge, we can only give the probable
location of the car.

The above-mentioned examples indicate that the characteristic that distinguishes fuzzy
and non-fuzzy locations is whether or not there is a crisp boundary. The concept of
boundary introduces the interior/exterior notion, i.e., what is within the boundary and
what is outside. Spatial fuzziness occurs (a) in the relationships among spatial objects
and (b) in spatial attributes.

On the other hand, the characteristic that distinguishes uncertain and certain facts is
whether or not there is a lack of, or errors in our knowledge, i.e., we do not have
accurate knowledge about an otherwise precise location. As a result, spatial uncertainty
can refer to the degree of knowledge we have about an object’s position. Uncertainty
about an object’s position leads to uncertainty about the spatial relationship between this
object and its neighbors, e.g., if the exact boundary of a land parcel is not known then the
exact spatial relationships with its neighboring land parcels are not known either.
Furthermore, uncertainty can exist for spatial attributes when knowledge about them is
limited. Table 1 summarizes these results.

3.2.2.
Indeterminate geometries. Geometry is essential in deﬁning the concepts of
spatial object and spatial attribute. Further, spatial relationships are deﬁned in terms of
the positions and thus the geometries of spatial objects.

Points, lines, and regions are the most commonly used simple geometries in spatial
applications. For the rest of the paper, we only consider points and regions with no holes
and no disconnected parts, and we regard lines as a special case of regions.

Fuzziness is not applicable to points, since the concept of boundary and consequently

of interior/exterior does not exist here. However, a point can be crisp or uncertain.

Because a region is established by its boundaries (something is inside/outside, or
left/right), a region can be fuzzy, e.g., consider climate zones, whose boundaries are not

crisp, but transitional. Regions can be uncertain. Consider the example of a land parcel
with Bnot-exactly-known^ (missing data) boundaries.

The following two sections focus on the mathematical treatment of the above concepts.

Indeterminate points. We perceive Space as a set of points, homeomorphic to N2: The
position of a point object (i.e., an object with geometry point) is determinate, if it can be
given as a single point p 2 N2: The position is indeterminate if it can only be expressed
as a set of points, i.e., the exact position is unknown. A probability function describes the
likelihood for each point to be the true position, e.g., a uniform distribution tells us that
there is an equal chance for each point. The probability mass function, px, for an
indeterminate point object x is:

px ið Þ ¼ P x ¼ i

½

(cid:1) : i 2 N (cid:2) N
g
f

ð5Þ

Here, P½x = i(cid:1) is the probability that position x is mapped to point i, with i being a
Cartesian coordinate.

As in the case of the time period, the probability that the position is outside the point
set is 0. Further, all indeterminate positions are considered to be independent (cf. Section
3.1.1).

What applies to time points as shown in Section 3.1.1 can be applied to indeterminate
points in the spatial context as well; probability distributions describing positional
indeterminacy can be interpreted as fuzziness.

Indeterminate regions. A region is a part of space bounded by a connected set of
points, the boundary. A region can be determinate if the boundary points are determinate.
Consequently, indeterminate points bound an indeterminate area. This deﬁnition is
analogous to Section 3.1.2, which presented the concept of an indeterminate time period.
The following example illustrates this.

Consider a map made up of two discrete regions, A and B, which share a common
boundary. Repeated digitization of the map introduces errors such that we obtain a set of
boundary points that lie more or less close to the actual boundary line. The distribution
of the boundary points might take the form of a normal distribution. In Figure 6(a), we

Figure 6. Boundary point probability.

INDETERMINACY AND SPATIOTEMPORAL DATA

221

show the normal distribution of a particular boundary point. In the continuous case, the
probability function will look as shown in Figure 6(b).

Analogously, an uncertain region can be described using a membership function. The
membership function can be determined using an approach similar to the one for
the temporal case (cf. Section 3.1.2). We split the underlying space into three parts, (i)
the core of the area, (ii) the boundary region, and (iii) the outside. Consequently, a
membership function for area A can be speciﬁed as follows.

(cid:1)A ið Þ ¼

8
<

:

1
P p xð Þ
0

i 2 A ^ i =2 C
i 2 A \ C
otherwise

In the above formula, area C stands for the outside of area A and p(x) is the probability
mass function for a point being in area A. The argument of the membership function is a
point and it returns a grade for the membership of this point in area A. The grade is 1 if
the point is a deﬁnite member of the area and 0 if it is deﬁnitely not a member of the
area. Otherwise the grade ranges between 1 and 0 (cf. Figure 7(a)).

Often a positional probability function is unknown or complex, e.g., there does not
exist a unique probability function that describes the distribution of all points in the
boundary, or we do not have Bany information at all^ about the boundary of a region.
Consider here the transition between soil zones as described in Section 3.2.1. The
boundary reﬂects the very nature of a phenomenon not being crisp and, thus, to give a
probability function describing it is not possible. This illustrates the critical case for
which fuzziness relieves uncertainty. We can still derive a valid membership function in
assuming a smooth and steady transition from one zone to the other. A membership
function for soil zones, as shown in Figure 7(b), could be characterized by the following
formula [33],

The underlying assumption above is that the transition between the climate zones
is linear. The effects of other transitions on the membership function can be handled
by changing the formula describing the membership grade for positions outside the
core.

Other examples in this case are the boundary problem as experienced in the context of

soil proﬁles, soil maps, and land evaluation classiﬁcation [5], [6].

4. Spatiotemporal indeterminacy

Having covered spatial and temporal
indeterminacy, we consider the combination,
spatiotemporal indeterminacy. First we use examples and to then focus on the concept
that is fundamental to spatiotemporal scenarios, namely change. Again, probability and
fuzzy set theory are used to model indeterminate change.

To illustrate spatiotemporal indeterminacy, consider the application context of track-
ing the movement of vehicles, e.g., ﬂeet management. The movement of such objects
can be assessed using a sampling approach, i.e., we measure positions as discrete points
in time. A representation that interpolates in-between the position samples is uncertain.
For objects with extent, the change of location includes changes of their shapes, which
have to be interpolated as well. Consider here the example of a coastline that bounds
an island. Two processes inﬂuencing the coastline make an island an indeterminate
region. The tides have (i) short-term effects, whereas (ii) over a longer period of time,
a general drift affects the shoreline as well. If one is only interested in the general drift,
the tidal effect can be modeled as a fuzzy boundary that changes with time (general
drift).

Spatiotemporal indeterminacy can have more than one source, i.e., it can be the result
of the combined effects of temporal and spatial indeterminacy. We proceed to consider
possible scenarios for the context of spatiotemporal data.

In spatiotemporal applications, we are interested in spatial objects, relationships,
and attributes over time; we are interested in recording their evolution, or change,
in time. Thus, change is the most important concept in the spatiotemporal context, and
will, in the following, serve as the basis for evaluating spatiotemporal indeterminacy.
As stated in the literature [10], [17], [30], change (i) can either occur on a discrete
or a continuous basis, and (ii) can be recorded in time points or in time periods.
Table 2 illustrates the various change scenarios we can encounter in the spatiotemporal
context.

4.1. Change scenarios

The four scenarios in Table 2 are illustrated by using a 3-dimensional representation of
the temporal change of geometry. Space (x- and y-coordinates in the horizontal plane)
and time (time-coordinate in the vertical direction) are combined to form a three dimen-
sional coordinate system. We use point geometry to keep the illustrations simple. How-
ever, the same four change scenarios apply to other geometries. To distinguish discrete
from continuous changes, a continuous change of geometry from Gi to Gi + 1 is indicated
by using an arrow in the spatial plane as opposed to a line in case of a discrete change.
In the change scenarios, the elements that can be indeterminate are geometry, time
point, and time period. We consider each of the four change scenarios in Table 2 in turn.

Scenario 1Vdiscrete change of a geometry recorded in time points.
Here, geometry stays constant for some time and then changes instantly. The geometry
is sampled at constant time periods dt. The geometry and/or the time point can be
indeterminate.
Scenario 2Vcontinuous change of a geometry recorded in time points.
Here, we sample a constantly changing geometry at time periods dt. Knowing a geometry
only at discrete time points has two implications, (i) recording geometries at time points
means assessing a momentary situation without inferring anything about the geometry
prior to or after the time point. Consequently, (ii) time and space are independent; not
knowing the exact extent of the geometry does not affect the time period and vice versa.
In contrast, Scenarios 3 and 4 in Table 2 suggest that a change function of the form
C: tx Y Gx exists that determines a geometry Gx for a time point tx for a given time
period Ti = ½ti, ti + 1(cid:1) with the respective, known geometries Gi and Gi + 1. The change
function C may be different for every time period.
Scenario 3Vdiscrete change of a geometry recorded in time periods.
The objective is to Bbegin^ a new time period when a spatial change occurs, i.e., a new
time periods start at the time points t0 through t4 in Scenario 3. The geometry is constant
within a time period. In this case, spatial and temporal indeterminacy affect each other.
Dealing with indeterminate spatial extents, e.g., measurement errors, implies that the
time point at which a change occurs cannot be detected precisely. On the other hand,
having an indeterminate temporal aspect, e.g., clock errors,
introduces spatial
indeterminacy.
Scenario 4Vcontinuous change of a geometry recorded in time periods.
This case is based on the fact that for a given time period Ti = ½ti, ti + 1(cid:1), there exists a
change function that models the transformation from geometry Gi to geometry Gi + 1.
Each of these factors, i.e., (i) the time period, (ii) the geometry, and (iii) the change
function, can be subject to indeterminacy.

In the simplest case, the geometries Gi and Gi + 1 and the time period Ti are deter-
minate, and the change function returns a determine geometry Gx for a given time point
tx 2 Ti. Here, we assume that the change function returns the geometry coinciding with
the actual movement. Is this not the case, the change function interpolates in-between

the geometries Gi and Gi + 1 and returns an indeterminate geometry. An example is to use
linear interpolation, i.e., the two geometries Gi and Gi + 1 are considered to be the
endpoints of a line.

If we further allow Gi and Gi + 1 to be indeterminate, our change function would in
any case return an indeterminate Gx. In the following, we use the Bõ^ symbol on
top of the parameter to denote indeterminacy. This means that if geometry is described
by a probability or membership function, this very function is subject to change in the
time period Ti. Following the idea from before, we would have a change function that
returns a probability or membership function for a given tx (cf. Table 3(a)). However, by
integrating the temporal component, we obtain a spatiotemporal probability or member-
ship function, i.e., a function that changes with time. Table 3 summarizes this approach.
So far we always considered time to be determinate. We use time points to determine
the start and the end of the current time period Ti, and to denote the time point tx in
question. In case ti and ti + 1 are indeterminate, we cannot state the precise beginning and
end of the time period. Thus, the association of a geometry (indeterminate or not) to a
time point becomes indeterminate. However, this affects mainly the change function and
can be considered in adapting its form. The indeterminate time contributes some
additional indeterminacy as to the determination of Gx for a given tx. Table 4 adapts the
approach shown in Table 3 to accommodate this aspect.

4.2.

Summary

The following observations apply to the four spatiotemporal change scenarios of Table 2.
Change recorded in time points versus time periods differs in that in case of the
former, we do not make any assumptions about the position of the geometry in-between

recordings. For the latter case, additional knowledge is available that allows for an in-
terpolation of the position samples in between measurements.

Recording change in time periods versus time points can be also referred to as
synchronous versus asynchronous positional sampling. Considering the moving object
context, in the synchronous case, the object transmits a new position only in case the old
position and the respective change function do not allow us to derive the current position
of the object, i.e., the moving object changed its speed, it turned, etc. Asynchronous
sampling translates to measuring the object’s position at ﬁxed time intervals, e.g., every
30 seconds. Synchronous sampling, in contrast to asynchronous sampling, requires some
object intelligence to determine when to measure the position.

The central element of spatiotemporal indeterminacy is the change function that
manipulates geometries. Since the geometry of a location can be of type point, line, or
region, the change function can be seen as a morphing algorithm that maps between
different instances of geometries. The following section illustrates this approach for a
particular case. We describe how to represent the movements of vehicles and how to
quantify the errors associated with the chosen representation.

5. A spatiotemporal indeterminacy scenarioVthe moving point
object case continued

Continuing the moving object case from Section 2, the following sections give details on
how to quantify and describe the measurement and the sampling errors.

5.1. Measurement error

An error can be introduced by inaccurate measurements. The accuracy and thus the
quality of the measurement depends largely on the technique used. This work assumes
that GPS is used for the measurement of positions.

Two assumptions are generally made when talking about GPS measurement accuracy.
First, the error distribution, i.e., the error in each of the three dimensions and the error in
time, is assumed to be Gaussian. Second, we can assume that the horizontal error dis-
tribution, i.e., the distribution in the x-y plane, is circular [25].

The error in a positional GPS measurement can be described by the probability
function of Equation (9). The probability function is composed of two normal distri-
butions in the two respective spatial dimensions. The mean of the distribution is the
origin of the coordinate system. Figure 8 visualizes the error distribution. In addition to
the mean, the standard deviation, s, is a characteristic parameter of a normal distribution.
Within the range of Ts of the mean, in a bivariate normal distribution (2-dimensional),
39.35% of the probability is concentrated.

A typical GPS receiver used in vehicle navigation systems has an error of 2 m (equal to
1s). This measure refers to the standard deviation of a bivariate normal distribution
centered at the receiver’s true antenna position.

5.1.1. Which case?
In the schema of Section 4, the sampling approach to capture the
movement of an object is characterized by Scenario 4. Tables 3 and 4 establish a
foundation for obtaining a change function in-between measured positions. Table 4 gives
function templates in case the times of sampling are not known precisely. However, GPS
allows for highly precise timing and, thus, we neglect the effect of time. In Table 3, Case
1 gives a function template that applies when the sampled positions are known precisely.
As we just saw, GPS measurements are accurate, but not precise. Thus, Case 2 of this
table matches our problem. The following section shows how to establish a change
function to determine the position of the moving object in-between sampling. We
initially assume precise position samples.

5.2.

Sampling error

The movement is captured by measuring the object’s position using a GPS receiver at
regular time periods. Interpolating the movement in-between samples introduces an
additional error in the representation of the movement. This section gives a model for the
uncertainty introduced by this sampling error based on the sampling rate and the
maximum speed of the object.

The uncertainty of the representation of an object’s movement is affected by the
frequency with which position measurements are made, the sampling rate. This, in turn,
may be set by considering the speed of the object and the desired maximum distance
between consecutive measurements. Let us consider an example that records the move-
ments of school buses.2

5.2.1. Example 1. As a requirement to the application, the distance between two
consecutive samples should be maximally 10 m. If the maximum speed of a bus is
120 km/h, this means that the position needs to be sampled at least 3.3 times per second.

Figure 8. Positional error in the GPS.

228

PFOSER, TRYFONA AND JENSEN

If a bus moves slower than its maximum speed, the distance between samples is less
than 10 m. How do the position samples resemble the true movement of the object?
Consider the three trajectories shown in Figure 9(a). Each is possible given the three
measured positions P1 through P3. However, by just Blooking^ at the three positions, one
would assume that the straight line best resembles the actual trajectory of the object.
Since we did not have measurements in-between position samples, the best we can
do is to limit the possibilities of where the moving object could have been. We constrain
the trajectory of the object by what we know about the object’s actual movement. Con-
sidering the trajectory in a time period ½t1, t2(cid:1), delimited by consecutive samples, we know
two positions, P1 and P2, as well as the object’s maximum speed, vm (cf. Figure 9(b)). If
the object moves at maximum speed vm from P1 and its trajectory is a straight line,
its position at time tx will be on a circle of radius r1 = vm (tx j t1) around P1 (the
smaller dotted circle in Figure 9(b)). Thus, the points on the circle represent the furthest
away from P1 the object can get at time tx. If the object’s speed is lower than vm, or its
trajectory is not a straight line, the object’s position at time tx will be somewhere within
the area bounded by the circle of radius r1. Similar assumptions can be made on the position
of the moving object with respect to P2 and t2 to obtain a second circle of radius r2.

These constraints on the position of the moving object mean that the object can be
anywhere within the intersection of the two circular areas at time tx. This intersection
is shown by the shaded area in Figure 9(b). We use the term lens for this area of
intersection. Since we do not have any further information, we assume a uniform dis-
tribution for the position within the lens, i.e., the object is equally likely anywhere within
this lens shape.

Thus, the sampling error at time tx for a particular position can be described by the
probability function shown in Equation (10), where r1 and r2 are the two radii described
above, s is the distance between the measured positions P1 and P2, and A denotes the
area of the intersection of the two circles.

5.2.2. Which case? Equations (10) and (11) describe the position of the moving
object in-between position samples. Thus, this function is an instance of the function
template as described in Case 1 of Table 3.

5.3. Combination of error sourcesVa global change function

incorporates indeterminate
Table 3 gives a framework for change functions that
positions. In the context of this example, this translates to adapting Equation (10) such
that the values for x and y are not precise, but are affected by the measurement error as
described in Section 5.1. Although it seems trivial at ﬁrst, this requires some heavy
mathematical manipulation that is beyond the scope of this work.

A general mathematical framework suitable for this problem is Kalman ﬁltering [21],
which is a method for combining various error-prone measurements about the same fact
into a single measurement with a smaller error. This mathematical framework stipulates
a method of how to combine uncertainties to reduce the overall error. Assuming the
measurements refer to position samples of a continuous movement in time, we can use
Kalman smoothing to determine the positions at times that are in between the measured
ones [1].

Examples of applying Kalman ﬁltering to the domain of vehicle navigation include the
integration of three independent positioning systems such as dead reckoning, map
matching, and GPS, to determine the precise positions of moving vehicles [22].

6. Conclusions and future work

The work presented in this paper concerns spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal inde-
terminacy. The term indeterminacy subsumes fuzziness that captures inherent impreci-

sion and uncertainty that captures the lack of precise information. Fuzziness and un-
certainty are ﬁrst explored in the temporal context, where examples and deﬁnitions are
given for indeterminate time points and time periods. The relationship between fuzzy set
theory and probability theory is described in the temporal context, while both concepts
are used to describe temporal indeterminacy. Next, spatial objects, relationships, and
attributes are considered. In particular, this work explores indeterminacy in relation
to geometric types, namely point and region, that are inherent to spatial objects and
attributes. Again, the mathematical concepts of fuzzy set theory and probability theory
are used to describe these phenomena; their differences and similarities are explored in
the spatial context. Furthermore, the concept of change is introduced as the key spatio-
temporal concept. Change can occur in discrete steps and on a continuous basis, and it can
be recorded using regular sampling or in a change-driven fashion. Combining these
concepts leads to four different change scenarios, which are affected by indeterminacy
differently. The indeterminacy of change is formalized and combines the spatial and
temporal concepts.

Finally, the rather general concepts are applied to an existing application area. We
discuss uncertainty in the context of applications that involve moving-point objects. We
give a change function that describes the positions of moving objects over time based on
position samples. The change function is inﬂuenced by measurement and sampling errors.
The framework put forward in this paper is currently being applied in an extension to
an existing ﬂeet management system that will support spatiotemporal data analysis,
including the study of certain operations on indeterminate data.

Future research plans include indeterminacy with respect to relationships among spa-
tial, temporal, or spatiotemporal objects. Next, while the mathematical models presented
are concrete enough to express the indeterminacy related to the temporal, spatial, and
spatiotemporal domain, more detailed mathematical formulas are needed for speciﬁc
applications. Finally, this work may be seen as a step towards the development of a more
general framework of spatiotemporal data types and data structures that incorporate
indeterminacy.

Appendix A: An introduction to inderterminacy measures

This section introduces the mathematical background to be able to express fuzziness and
uncertainty in spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal concepts. More speciﬁcally, fuzzy set
theory and probability theory are covered.

A.1 Fuzzy set theory

Fuzzy set theory [42] is an extension and generalization to Boolean set theory. Let X be a
classical (crisp) set of objects, called the universe. Membership in a classical subset A of
X can be described by the characteristic function (cid:5)A: X Y {0, 1} such that for all x 2 X
the following holds.

~AA ¼ x; (cid:1) ~AA xð Þ

(cid:2) x 2 X

(cid:5)

This function discriminates sharply between the members and non-members of set A.
We can generalize this function by mapping the elements of set X not to the set {0, 1},
but rather to the real interval ½0, 1(cid:1). Now, elements have no strict membership, but rather
have a degree of membership in the set in question. Larger values indicate higher grades
of membership. With X as the universe, the membership function

returns for a given element of X the degree to which it belongs to the fuzzy set. ~AA

All elements of X are evaluated towards a membership in ~AA: Those elements that do
Bnot at all^ belong to the set have as degree of membership (cid:1) ~AA xð Þ ¼ 0; whereas the
elements that Btotally^ belong to the set have as degree of membership (cid:1) ~AA xð Þ ¼ 1:
Although fuzzy set theory seems sound and simple, it is difﬁcult to actually apply it. A
key problem is how to choose an appropriate membership function.

A.2 Probability theory

With X again being the universe, the probability measure P is a mapping 2X Y [0, 1] that
assigns a number P(A) to each subset A of X, and satisﬁes the Kolmogorov axioms [12]:

P Xð
P A [ B

ð

Þ ¼ 1; P ;ð
Þ ¼ P Að Þ þ P Bð Þ; iff A \ B ¼ ;;

Þ ¼ 0

Here, P(A) is the probability that an ill-known single-valued variable y ranging on X hits
the ﬁxed well-known set A. Given the case where the underlying domain of the universe
X is discrete, the probability mass function p(x) = P({x}) returns the probability for the
single element x 2 X. The probability density function returns the probability

p xð Þdx for a given subset A 2 X.

A.3 Differences between fuzzy set and probability theory

Very often, fuzzy values are misunderstood to be probabilities, or fuzzy set theory is
misunderstood as a new way to handle probabilities. These are misconceptions, since
additivity is a minimum requirement of probabilities,
i.e., all probabilities for al-
ternative events have to sum up to one. This is not the case for membership grades.
In mathematical terms, the membership function (cid:1) ~AA xð Þ is similar to P({x}) = p(x),
except for the above condition, P
x 2 X p xð Þ ¼ 1 must hold, while this is not true for
(cid:1) ~AA:

Further, a membership grade is deﬁned only for the individual elements of a set, not
for subsets. Probabilities can be given for any subset, i.e., also one element. However, all
probability distributions are fuzzy sets. As fuzzy sets and logic generalize Boolean sets
and logic, they also generalize probabilities.

In revisiting the indeterminate time point (cf. Figure 3), we can see that to describe the
membership grade of a chronon with respect to a particular point, with 1 representing a
certain membership, each of the chronons would have a membership grade of 1/4, which
is equal to the probability that each of the chronons is the actual time point. Since the
membership grade is equal to the probability, they add up to 1. However, in the case of
a time period bound by indeterminate time points, we have regions that have a mem-
bership grade of 1 as well, i.e., they do not add up to 1. In this case, the membership
function is not the Bsame^ as the probability function, but the latter is used to derive
the former.

Probability functions are used to describe uncertain positions. Consider here an
unknown position, whose positional probability is scattered over a region, i.e., a set of
points. If we state that the position is at one of the points of the region, then this
statement is true, since all the probabilities scattered over the region add up to one. In
other words, probability can also be deﬁned for a set of points as opposed to only one
point. On the other hand, if we, instead of giving a probability for a point, devise a
membership grade, the sum of all membership grades over all the points in the region
has no clear meaning. It is merely an arbitrary number. The membership grade of a
point tells us about Bthe belief ’’ that a point belongs to a particular set, e.g., the soil
type desert.

Probabilistic concepts are related to what is the most likely position, i.e., where is
the border for what is in and what is out. Fuzzy concepts are related to what belongs
to what extent to a given set, i.e., what is Bin^ and what is Bout.^ Fuzzy concepts refer
to relative aspects whereas probabilistic concepts refer to absolute aspects of a spatial
scenario.

Notes

1. Dyreson and Snodgrass [14] state that we could either assume that chronons are the same size as time points,
or that chronons are much bigger than time points, i.e., every chronon contains a large (possibly inﬁnite)
number of points. Assuming that chronons and time points are the same, we have to adopt the discrete model

INDETERMINACY AND SPATIOTEMPORAL DATA

233

of time. If the model of time were then continuous or dense, we would be left with an inﬁnite number of
chronons. Since the model of time can possibly be continuous, we have to assume that chronons are much
bigger than time points.

2. This scenario is currently under investigation in collaboration with a company providing ﬂeet management

solutions.

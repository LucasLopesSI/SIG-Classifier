Abstract. Studies about geographical information systems (GIS) use contribute
to geographic information science through critical evaluation of the concepts
embedded in GIS tools. Social-behavioural studies about group use of GIS help
us to understand the social implications of GIS because groups are fundamental
units underlying intra-organizational, organization-wide, and inter-organizational
activity in society. When group communication technology is integrated with
basic GIS capabilities an enhanced version of GIS called ‘participatory GIS’
(PGIS) is created. Group use of PGIS technology can be studied by sampling
social-behavioural events during human–computer–human interaction. Social-
behavioural research about PGIS use requires an informed balance among three
research domains— substantive, theoretical, and methodological—if we are to
make balanced progress in participatory geographical information science associ-
ated with the critical evaluation of GIS use. In this paper, we draw from our
research on GIS-supported collaborative decision making about land use and
resource planning and a conceptual
framework called Enhanced Adaptive
Structuration Theory. We develop a new framework for understanding choices
among data-gathering strategies for social-behavioural studies about PGIS use.
The framework for data-gathering strategies is composed of two dimensions. One
dimension is the level of induced control in social-behavioural relations during
GIS use in a research setting. The other is the amount of pre- or post-structuring
of variables embedded in data-collection techniques. Several common data-
gathering strategies, e.g. laboratory experiment, (cid:142) eld experiment, case study, and
(cid:142) eld survey, are diŒerentiated in terms of those dimensions. Objectives for empir-
ical research are used to compare and contrast the data-gathering strategies. This
framework helps researchers understand the trade-oŒs among various data-
gathering strategies as the core of research designs for critical evaluations of
PGIS use.

Introduction
Groups are said to stimulate and direct change both within organization s
(McGrath 1984, Poole 1985) as well as among organizations (Gray and Wood 1991,
Wood and Gray 1991, DuŒy et al. 1996). Many changes, for example, those involving

implementation of public-private policies about land planning, become mired in con-
troversy (Popper 1981, 1992, Lake 1987, Healey 1995). Dealing with locational con(cid:143) ict
in an open manner is becoming more important as citizen (stakeholder) participation
increases in land use, natural resource, and environmental decision making (Crowfoot
and Wondolleck 1990, Gregory 1999, Wondolleck and YaŒee 2000). The primary
rationale for enhanced stakeholder participation in land planning is based on the
democratic maxim that those aŒected by a decision should participate directly in the
decision-makin g process (Smith 1982, Parenteau 1988, Moote et al. 1997).

Over the years geographical information systems (GIS) have been used to support
land decision making in a rudimentary (indirect) way, usually as a tool in the hands
of analysts passing the information to decision makers. There is a growing trend
that indicates that GIS technology is likely to get used in a more direct and strategic
way by groups in various parts of the public-private decision-making process. More
and more GIS information is proving to be useful to both decision makers and
stakeholders (Armstrong 1993, Faber et al. 1994, 1995, Nyerges and Jankowski 1997,
Obermeyer 1998 ).

Basic GIS capabilities (i.e. data management, spatial analysis, and map display)
have been used to generate various types of geospatial information structures for
group interaction, since maps are commonly conversation generators. Recently, GIS
have been enhanced with group-based communication capabilities, e.g. group-based
map review and editing (Jones 1997, ShiŒer 1998) and voting tools for consensus
building (Jankowski et al. 1997). These types of capabilities encourage researchers
to qualify the naming of GIS as ‘participatory GIS’ (PGIS). PGIS refers to systems
that address the needs of people concerned with group participation (Harris et. al.
1995, Nyerges et al. 1997, Obermeyer 1998, Sheppard et al. 1999). In the future, we
expect that PGIS will include capabilities such as those proposed for spatial under-
standing and decision support systems (Jankowski and Stasik 1997a, 1997b, Moore
1997 ), and map-based argumentation and mediation (Rinner 1999). Such technology
is being developed to assist participants with issue management and group-oriented
decision analysis carried out during analytic-deliberativ e investigations of complex,
unstructure d problems such as those dealing with community, risk-oriented land
problems (Stern and Fineberg 1996 ). Whether such analytic-deliberation s support
‘data wars’ (Kraemer and King 1987 ), where one side might be disadvantage d or
look bad if they do not have technology (Obermeyer and Pinto 1994); or whether
such analytic-deliberation s are in fact technically, economically, and morally useful
remains to be seen. The issue of group use of GIS is very much a part of the concern
about the implications the use of GIS has for society. Such concerns are part of the
need for critical evaluations of GIS use, particularly in group settings. For the
remainder of this paper, reference to GIS is assumed to include PGIS technology.

As we strive to understand the social-behavioural

implications of advanced
information technologies, studying the use of GIS is as important as developing the
technology itself. Furthermore, we (cid:142) nd it important to clarify that research ‘about
GIS use’ is diŒerent from ‘research using GIS’. The former assumes that GIS capabilit-
ies are part of the substantive issues to be studied; whereas in the latter, GIS
capabilities are taken to be part of the methods employed. Although the two views
are related, there is a signi(cid:142) cant diŒerence. Studies about GIS use are intended as
critical evaluations of GIS concepts as much as they are evaluations of tools. Such
studies contribute to the advancement of GIScience (Fisher 1998). Using GIS without
critical evaluation does not advance GIScience. Anecdotal evidence about the uses

of GIS, although good for sharing experiences and telling stories, has not been
su(cid:141) cient to understand the complexity of how GIS technology is intertwined with
social, economic, and political power structures. Without critical evaluations of
group use of GIS based on systematic social-behavioural research, poor technology
designs are likely to be reproduced again and again having (sometimes unintended)
social implications for e(cid:141) ciency, eŒectiveness and equity in group settings (Pickles
1995, 1997, Fisher 1998). Without a systematic approach to researching GIS use,
stories and experiences are di(cid:141) cult to integrate. Consequently, such stories and
experiences are less likely to support accrual of ‘knowledge about use’ as part of
geographical information science.

The purpose of this paper is to articulate a social-behavioural-base d ‘method-
ological turn’ in GIScience that promotes systematic, critical evaluations of how
people use GISystems in group settings. To do this we develop a framework that
enables us to compare and contrast data-gatherin g strategies. A data-gatherin g
strategy establishes an approach to data-collection within social-behavioural studies
about PGIS use. In our approach, these studies are about human–computer –human
interaction (HCHI). In this paper, data-gatherin g strategies establish an opportunity
for data analysis of the social-behavioural aspects about HCHI. Furthermore, we
focus on data-gatherin g strategies as the prerequisite to data analysis. Consequently,
we do not discuss the results of empirical research or corroboration of research
(cid:142) ndings, as they appear elsewhere (Jankowski and Nyerges 2001a, 2001b) . Instead,
we focus on the trade-oŒs and choices among data-gatherin g strategies. We suggest
why one strategy is better than another given the objectives a researcher has for
diŒerent types of social-behavioural evidence to be used in the interpretation of
(cid:142) ndings. As we contribute to this ‘methodological turn’, in the same sense as a
‘theoretical turn’ referred to by Pickles (1997), we elucidate the connection between
GIS viewed as a technology (tool) and GIS viewed as geographical information
science, a connection suggested by Fisher (1998) in response to the views of separation
(Pickles 1997, Wright et al. 1997a, 1997b, Goodchild et al. 1999 ). Making such turns
in the context of PGIS use helps us take a step toward developing a ‘participatory
geographical information science’ as part of geographical information science.

The relationship between GIScience and GISystems has been described as a
cyclic process composed of concept development,
implementation, testing, and
re(cid:142) nement wherein concepts that are embodied in systems are tested using critical
evaluation of GISystem use (Fisher 1998). In this paper we further elucidate the
critical evaluation relationship between GIScience and GISystems based on a corres-
pondence among three research domains—substance, theory, and methodology.
Brinberg and McGrath (1985) explain how a correspondence among those domains
is what motivates, directs, and eventually provides opportunity for verifying validity
claims made with regard to a social-behavioural research endeavour. Recognizing
an emphasis in the correspondence among those domains helps one to understand
the character of alternative research strategies for social-behavioural research in
general, and studies about PGIS use in particular. Understanding the correspondence
among domains and the implications for research strategies can help link research
about GIS tool development (Densham et al. 1995) with research about social-
behavioural implications of tool use (Pickles 1995, Sheppard 1995).

A deepened understanding of this issue fosters a way to implement the synthesis
between the seemingly polar perspectives of tool development (i.e. constructionist )
and critical social theory (i.e. deconstructionist ) research (Miller 1995). Such a

synthesis fosters a reconstructivist perspective, accommodating both tool develop-
ment and tool critique simultaneously (Orlikowski 1992 ). In promoting a recon-
structivist perspective, we move beyond a substance versus
theory versus
methodology debate to show how each research domain is in some way dependent
on the other, permitting us to come away with a new sense of research possibilities.
Although we discuss all three research domains in this paper, our contribution is
intended to be methodological in character as we consider choosing data-gatherin g
strategies given a particular set of research questions. However, we treat theoretical
and substantive concerns to complete the discussion.

To articulate a framework through which we elucidate choices and data-gatherin g
strategies for studying group use of PGIS, this paper proceeds as follows. In section 2
we adopt Brinberg and McGrath’s (1985) perspective on a social-behavioural
research process. It consists of three stages of research, with each stage being a
balance among three research domains. We use that perspective to explain challenges
in social-behavioural research as they apply to group use of PGIS, and then present
a framework for choosing among data-gatherin g strategies. In section 3,
the
framework allows us to examine the trade-oŒs among data-gatherin g strategies for
addressing premises (hence research questions) about group use of PGIS. The (cid:142) nal
section concludes the paper with a re(cid:143) ection about using mixed-method research
strategies.

2. Frameworks for social-behavioura l research as critical evaluation of PGIS use

Research is a process during which there are many pitfalls and traps that direct
and constrain the character of empirical (cid:142) ndings. In this paper we adopt a perspective
presented by Brinberg and McGrath (1985) that a research process, particularly an
empirical one, consists generally of: (1 ) planning the research , (2) doing the research,
and (3) making a case to verify the results. These three stages describe research as
a process of having an idea of what you want to do, following through on that idea,
and then assessing whether the evidence makes sense within a body of literature by
comparing (cid:142) ndings.

Planning a research study is a matter of making choices to compose a research
strategy. Important choices include research problem articulation, data-gatherin g
strategy, data analysis strategy, and reporting strategy. Clearly, research problem
articulation sets a stage for what research is pursued, and we will treat this issue in
a general way below as a matter of ‘research orientation’. This paper focuses on
choices for data-gatherin g strategy. Choices can constrain an analysis strategy to
develop evidence, and subsequently in(cid:143) uence a reporting strategy about (cid:142) ndings.

To help unravel some of the seeming complexity of choosing a suitable data-
gathering strategy, we further borrow from Brinberg and McGrath (1985) who
emphasize the need for balance among three research domains: substantive, concep-
tual (theoretical) and methodological. The diŒerent domains are positioned in lead,
supporting, and focusing roles. When the conceptual domain leads we say the
research has a basic research orientation. When substance leads it is an applied
orientation. When method leads, the research has a methodology-drive n orientation.
Thus, theoretical, substantive, or methodological research problems are elucidated
as a matter of which domain leads to set orientation. Nonetheless, although a lead
domain sets the emphasis, and hence the orientation of the research (problem), we
should remember that all three domains are important in the balance. Without a
contribution from each of the three domains to some su(cid:141) cient level in that balance,

a study (or research proposal) could be considered incomplete, or at best only a
partial study (proposal ), left open to criticism.

In detailing the three research domains, like Brinberg and McGrath (1985), we
recognize three levels (here we call them abstraction levels) for treating what is at
issue in each of the domains. The levels of abstraction are elements, relations, and
embedding context (the latter referred to by Brinberg and McGrath as ‘embedding
systems’). Table 1 provides an example about land redevelopment for discussion. A
key concern in research is how to compose a correspondence between relations
from domain to domain in a pairwise manner, hence, conceptual –substance,
substance –method, and conceptual–method. If we are to ‘plan on’ attaining valid
(cid:142) ndings in a study, we posit that a good research design should specify what relations
(and embedded phenomenon) in the substantive domain must correspond with what
relations (and embedded constructs) in the conceptual domain, and those both must
correspond to methodological relations (and embedded variables) that we use to
motivate data collection.

In the subsections to follow, based on the need for a balanced emphasis among
domains, we treat each of the levels of abstraction for each of the substantive,
conceptual and methodological domains. This helps us set up a framework for
choosing among data-gatherin g strategies. We note that the sequence of domain
presentation emulates how we have been conducting research related to the use of
PGIS over the past few years.

2.1. Substantive domain—peculiar to place and time

A substantive context is needed to ground theory and methodology for studies
about group use of GIS. So, we review the substance of our own research to provide
context for what comes later in the paper. In our research we have been concerned
with public-private problems related to land use, environmental clean-up, salmon
habitat redevelopment, transportatio n planning, and health planning in the Paci(cid:142) c
Northwest, USA.

Three of the most signi(cid:142) cant substantive elements are problem-topic, people, and
information technology. In all studies we have adopted realistic problem-topics as
the focus of our substantive domain. In land-use planning we dealt with land-use
scenarios for Latah County in Idaho, whereby students as interested and aŒected
parties con(cid:142) gured a land-use plan (Jankowski and Stasik 1997a, 1997b, Stasik 1999 ).
For environmental clean-up we have been examining decisions about remediation
eŒorts at the Hanford, Washington Reservation and how decision makers, technical
specialists and interested and aŒected parties take part in the process (Drew et al.
2002 ). We have examined decision making about habitat redevelopment in the
Duwamish Waterway in Seattle, Washington in the context of multiple stakeholder
concerns (Jankowski et al. 1997, Nyerges et al. 1998a, Jankowski and Nyerges 2001a,
2001b) . In transportatio n planning we have been dealing with transportatio n
improvement decision making for the central Puget Sound area as concerns local,
regional, and state decision analysts (Nyerges et al. 1998b, Jankowski and Nyerges
2001b) . For health planning we have examined how decision makers allocate funds
for primary health care at the county level in the State of Idaho (Jankowski and
Nyerges 2001b). To address the above problems, the participants have used geo-
graphic information technology as the third element that underpins our substantive
interest. Since we are using social-behavioural methods to critically examine GIS
use, the GIS technology and methods become part of the substantive domain. All

Relations among the people and the technology can be understood as the human–
computer–human interaction that occurs in decision situations on a project-by-
project basis. Interaction, viewed as increasing participation commitment, takes the
form of communication, cooperation, coordination, and collaboration. We are inter-
ested in the dynamics of those participatory processes, and how GIS technology
plays a role in those processes relative to the types of problems we are studying.

The embedding context for the public-private problems in the Paci(cid:142) c Northwest,
USA is the place and time situation for participatory activities of an inter-
organizationa l character. The local culture of place is very much a part of the
embedded contextual relations in the substantive domain. Organizations and their
bureaucracies together with social norms help structure the planning situations in
the Paci(cid:142) c Northwest. Given the nature of the problems of our interest, we are very
much aware that inter-organizationa l decision making cuts across a variety of scales.
It is important to recognize that a multitude of socio-political relationships exist
among people in groups, groups in organizations, organizations in communities, and
communities in society, whereby actors at any level can act as agents of change.

2.2. T heoretical domain—enhanced adaptive structuration theory

In the theoretical domain, choice of a theory (or building a theory) for articulating
human–computer–human interaction provides a way of systematically interpreting
how people make use of GIS in a problem context. The conceptual elements and
relations of a theory are systematic abstractions of the elements and relations of the
decision situations in the substantive domain—the pairwise correspondence to which
we referred earlier. In our work we started with Adaptive Structuration Theory
(AST) to provide a framework for studying group decision making in an organiza-
tional context (DeSanctis and Poole 1994). AST consists of a set of eight constructs
(the elements of the theory) that outline signi(cid:142) cant issues for characterizing group
decision making, and a set of seven premises that describe the relations among the
eight constructs. Starting with AST as a conceptual foundation for our experimental
research, we found it necessary to develop Enhanced AST (EAST) to frame systematic
examinations of complex, inter-organizationa l collaborative processes that make use
of GIS technology (Nyerges and Jankowski 1997 ). EAST further explicates the
character of inter-organizationa l processes of AST for public-private contexts by
treating 21 aspects of group decision making—the 14 of AST plus seven others
incorporated from collaboration theory (Gray and Wood 1991, Wood and Gray
1991 ), participatory negotiation theory (Susskind and Field 1996), political negoti-
ation theory (Kunreuther et al. 1983 ), and communicative action theory (Habermas
1984, Healey 1995 ). We have since added four more aspects from institutional
rational choice theory (Ostrom et al. 1994). The result is what we now call EAST2
((cid:142) gure 1). The dualistic ‘structural’ and ‘agent of change’ basis of EAST/EAST2 is
the embedding context for the theory. Neither technological nor social character of
an organization predominates in change—they work together to structure each other.
The eight constructs in EAST2, which are a mid-level grouping of the 25 aspects,
are further organized for simplicity according to the major convening, process, and
outcome categories. The reader should think of this framework as a ‘task level’
description, whereby each of the eight constructs might change with (or is relevant
to) each task a group might address in a decision situation. As in AST, the seven
premises in EAST2 represent fundamental relationships between pairs of constructs,
and subsequently each one motivates one or more research questions (as for example

for understanding a group decision support situation.

in table 2). The example research questions in table 2 have been articulated with
reference to public-private land development as documented in the substantive
domain of table 1. Such questions address the topics related to ‘geographical worlds
constructed by society’ and/or the ‘use of geographical concepts to think about
geographical phenomena and make decisions about places’ as suggested by
Goodchild et al. (1999 p. 738). However, the premises of table 2 are of a general
form such that the reader could develop research questions to suit their own topical
situation related to use of PGIS. Whatever questions are used to motivate the
research, nouns that detail constructs in the questions inevitably translate into
variables for which data are collected (or not) using a choice of data gathering
strategies as described in the following subsection.

The seven premises in EAST2, together with the respective example questions,
indicate that a wide-variety of interesting, empirical research opportunities exist.
Certainly, other theories could be used in the theoretical domain to motivate ques-
tions about PGIS use for land development. The point here is that this particular
theory accepts technology, a problem, and participation as part of the substantive
domain to be investigated. As such, EAST, and now its successor EAST2, is a
contribution to ‘taking the theoretical turn’ in geographical information science that
emphasizes the social-behavioural implications of GIS use. Addressing any one or
more questions in table 2 calls for a systematic approach to critical evaluation of
GIS use as pointed out by Fisher (1998) so that we can better understand how
empirical (cid:142) ndings relate to each other in our attempts to build knowledge about the
implications of PGIS use. In a social-behavioural research study involving primary
data collection about PGIS use, choice of a data-gatherin g strategy follows research
question articulation, hence we consider it next.

2.3. Methodological domain—a social-behavioura l perspective

In the methodological domain, social-behavioural (research) settings and data-
collection techniques combine to form a data-gatherin g strategy. The elements of the
methodological domain are variables that make operational the pairwise correspond-
ence to the elements in the substantive domain as well as the theoretical domain.
Researchers select variables based on research questions relevant to the substantive
and/or theoretical domain depending on which one has lead emphasis. The data
observations that populate variables come about by implementing data-collection
techniques associated with particular treatment modes within the context of a social-
behavioural setting. Hence, setting provides an opportunity (as well as constraint )
for use of treatment mode(s).

Variables can be assigned one of six treatment modes —(cid:142) xed, partition-controlled ,
matched-controlled , measured, randomized, or ignored (Runkel and McGrath
1972 )—as the basis of a data-gatherin g strategy. A ‘(cid:142) xed’ variable establishes data
for a speci(cid:142) c unit of observation that will not change relative to the other variables.
‘Partitioned-controlled’ means that two or more variables have been established for
diŒerent units of observation, and the variables are mutually exclusive. ‘Matched-
controlled’ variables are those for which two or more units of observation have been
established and the units overlap to ‘match observations’ among the variables. The
variables are not surrogates of each other, but they are related to each other for the
purpose of data analysis. ‘Measured’ variables are those whereby data are sampled
from a freely changing set of potential observations—free at least in regards to an
absence of researcher in(cid:143) uence as much as possible. ‘Randomized variables’ are those
for which data being sampled are equally at chance to be observed according to
that unit of observation, as in any similar situation. ‘Ignored variables’ are those for
which a researcher knows that a variable exists, but chooses intentionally not to do
anything with the units of observations. Whenever a variable is not (cid:142) xed, partition-
controlled, matched-controlled , measured, or randomized, then it is ignored by
implication. Unintentionally ignored variables sets up a greater chance of introducing
confounding variables into an analysis and subsequent interpretation.

Assigning modes to all variables in a study, as encouraged (or constrained ) by
social-behavioural setting, is a foundation for research design. For our research,
EAST2 helps us understand what mode to assign to a particular variable depending
on the research question being posed (as in table 2). Practically speaking, the treat-
ment modes are assigned for data collection in order to promote opportunities for
data analysis. Consequently, each mode is applied according to the data units for
the variables to be collected and subsequently analysed. As an example, the following
treatment modes were used in a laboratory experiment about collaborative spatial
decision making (Nyerges et al. 1998a, Jankowski and Nyerges 2001a). We ‘(cid:142) xed’ a
setting to be a Department of Geography decision laboratory wherein 109 particip-
ants made use of a prototype PGIS called Spatial Group Choice (Jankowski et al.
1997 ). The participants were involved in face-to-face interaction whose purpose was
to choose which of 20 habitat sites to redevelop in an urban estuary. Group participa-
tion was ‘partitioned-controlled ’ to be (cid:142) ve-person groups (one group had four
participants) with the same membership throughout the experiment. We applied
‘match-control ’ to the (cid:142) ve decision tasks to diŒerentiate habitat decision situations
for each group. This match-control established the exposure of participants to the
number of sites (8 or 20) and the number of criteria (3 or 11); the four combinations
thus de(cid:142) ned tasks 1–4. In each of those four tasks, participants had individual access

11

to Spatial Group Choice software. In task 5, participants were exposed to a task
with 20 sites and 11 criteria, hence matching task 4. However, participants had
group-as-a-whol e access to Spatial Group Choice software, thus diŒerentiating task 4
from task 5 in terms of technology, but providing for matched-controlled comparison.
For our dependent variables we ‘observed’ ( measured through use of videotape
coding) three types of data: coding the appropriation of decision aids to represent
information use, coding decision functions to be used in determining decision phases,
and coding group working relations to represent social con(cid:143) ict among participants.
We ‘randomized’ assignment of participants to a group (hence expertise with habitat/
geographical information that might have in(cid:143) uenced outcomes). Finally, we ignored
other factors such as gender bias/participation in groups and time of day on in(cid:143) uence
of interaction. A major advantage of laboratory experiments is that they are the
most highly controlled of research designs when it comes to treatment modes.

In another example, we used (cid:142) xed, matched-controlled , and measured treatments
to compile data for examining process and technology within a ((cid:142) eld) case study
about regional transportatio n decision making (Jankowski and Nyerges 2001b) . We
(cid:142) xed the treatment mode for the decision process as the 1999 transportatio n improve-
ment programme. The match-controlled treatment mode was used to contrast various
decision task steps throughout the decision process. We then measured (sampled)
the mandates and groups in relation to the geographical information technology
adopted for each of the match-controlled decision tasks. We were then able to
perform a proposition analysis of information technology use within a regional
transportatio n decision process—whereby each proposition was a speci(cid:142) c construct-
to-construct relationship to be tested.

As implied above, assignments of treatment modes have signi(cid:142) cant implications
for the ‘units of observation’ that later become ‘units of analysis’. From a substantive
and theoretical perspective, when working in a social
interaction setting it is
important to diŒerentiate the units of observation in terms of ‘units of interaction’
versus ‘units of organization’. A unit of interaction is the sampling unit of (social-
behavioural ) interaction in terms of the activity of groups, whereas the unit of
organization is the grouping of decision actors. Sanderson and Fisher (1994), working
in the context of human–computer interaction, clearly point out that units of inter-
action range from cognitive acts of individual computer users, speech acts of indi-
viduals, speech acts directing group attention in meetings, meeting phases of groups,
entire meeting sequences of a group project, through to studying a set of group
projects over several years. Pasquero (1991 ) describes how diŒerent an inter-
organizationa l level of interaction is from an organizationa l level of interaction. To
a large degree the interaction diŒers in regards to ‘information (cid:143) ow bureaucracy’, a
key factor in facilitating ( hindering) information (cid:143) ow among participants.

Analysis is about establishing relations between elements (variables)

in the
methodological domain. Relations between variables in the methodological domain
take their lead from either relations in the substantive domain or the relations in
the theoretical domain depending on the research study orientation. In the context
of our research, we (cid:142) rst look to the substantive domain for interesting events that
deal with geographic information, and then ask how the theoretical domain informs
us about potential causality among the substantive elements. For example, we address
human–computer–human interaction by examining how stakeholders might behave
with each other as they consider map information structures as per premise 2 (in
(cid:142) gure 1 and table 2). The relations in the methodological domain are implemented

Downloaded by [North Carolina State University] at 12:32 05 December 2012 12

T . Nyerges et al.

in the form of social-behavioural data-analysi s techniques that take advantage of
the treatment modes assigned to variables as described earlier. We used diŒerence
in means and analysis of variance for the techniques that allowed us to compare the
counts of map use and decision model use, plus the number of minutes in various
decision phases and in group work con(cid:143) ict as detailed by Jankowski and Nyerges
(2001a). The units of observations were gathered based on substantive and conceptual
concerns. They were constrained by the structured and simpli(cid:142) ed nature of laboratory
experiment as the principal type of data-gatherin g strategy we employed in the study.
As in the above example, opportunities for social-behavioural data sampling are
part of the embedding context of a study. Such opportunities are what Brinberg and
McGrath (1985) call research strategies, but we prefer to call such opportunities
‘data-gatherin g strategies’ because of the broader connotation for research strategy
mentioned earlier. The important point, however, is that data-gatherin g strategy
plays a major role in the embedding context of a research project because such a
strategy establishes the plan for collecting social-behavioural data observations about
PGIS use.

2.4. An embedding context framework for critical evaluation of data-gatherin g
strategies

Comprehensive frameworks that compare and contrast data-gatherin g strategies
for empirical social-behavioural research about advanced information technology
use are few in number and lacking in providing a systematic approach (Runkel and
McGrath 1972, Williams et al. 1988, Yin 1993, 1994, Zigurs 1993, McGrath 1995).
McGrath (1995), based on his previous work in Runkel and McGrath (1972), uses
a circumplex (pie-shaped framework of eight pieces) for comparing eight strategies
one to another that can be applied in human–computer interaction research. The
circumplex demonstrate s the need to trade oŒ research objectives; however,
its
dimensions are inconsistently labelled across publications (Runkel and McGrath
1972, McGrath 1982, 1995), and are therefore somewhat confusing. From a diŒerent
perspective, Yin (1993, 1994) describes the use of a case study method, comparing
it against three other approaches for evaluative research and oŒering ideas about
trade-oŒs to be made that have implications for creation of research evidence.
However, the discussion about the four strategies does not deal with the trade-oŒs
in a systematic manner. Williams et al. (1988) get close to a systematic treatment,
laying out a number of issues that must be considered, but fail to create a conceptual
framework for understanding trade-oŒs. Zigurs (1993) presents a list of 18 strategies
in the context of group support systems use, but provides little discussion of how
they diŒer one from another so as to provide suggestions of when and why some
are more suitable than others. Clearly, there is a need for a framework describing
data-gatherin g strategies that is both comprehensive and systematic.

A data-gatherin g strategy (as an opportunity for data collection) is a choice
within two dimensions (see (cid:142) gure 2). In one dimension, a range of social-behavioural
settings is based on the amount of induced control a researcher has over social-
behavioural relations. In a second dimension, a range of techniques for data collection
is based on pre- or post-structurin g variables in relation to the data-collection
process. Together, settings and techniques act as opportunities as well as constraints
on what data can be collected. McGrath’s dimensions were: (1) universal versus
particular behaviour systems (i.e. setting independent versus setting dependent
behaviours); and (2) obtrusive versus unobtrusive recordings of behaviour. The

13

dimensions herein are thought to be better descriptions of researcher concerns,
although universal/particular and obtrusive/unobtrusive still apply. We make use of
settings, whereby behaviour may or may not be in(cid:143) uenced by a researcher. We also
make use of pre-/post-structurin g of data collection, whereby researchers structure
data concepts previous to data collection as in a survey instrument, or after data
collection as in coding a videotape. In (cid:142) gure 2, the ‘least pre-structuring’ is meant
to imply ‘post-structuring ’; since a researcher has a rich stream of observations that
can be ‘coded’ in several ways. Surely, there is some pre-structuring in every data-
collection technique, but the diŒerent amounts among the techniques are signi(cid:142) cant
along the continuum depicted in (cid:142) gure 2.

Our data-gatherin g strategy framework describes a variation in research setting
in terms of three fundamental types based on induced (or lack thereof ) social-
behavioural control. They are (1) laboratory setting, e.g. a decision support room
used for controlled experiments, (2) (cid:142) eld setting, e.g. an interagency meeting room
used for decision-making meetings with researchers in the role of passive observers,
and (3) a (cid:142) eld laboratory as a cross between the previous two, e.g. an interagency
meeting room equipped with experimental information structures (i.e. information
tools) but this time with researchers playing the role of active observers. We would
be remiss if we did not recognize that there are important micro variations on each,
e.g. an engineering laboratory and a social-behavioural laboratory are meant to
structure social-behavioural relations among participants in diŒerent ways with the
former more controlled for software usability testing than the latter for social-
behavioural studies. Field settings are as varied as the number of places of work—
hence some settings are more structured than others. However, our main point here
is that three settings can characterize su(cid:141) ciently the variation in ‘researcher-induced
control over social-behavioral relations’ in the setting—the underlying dimension of
‘research setting’ as shown in (cid:142) gure 2. What this means is that researchers structure
laboratory settings. Participants at work, rather than researchers, socially structure
(cid:142) eld settings. Researchers and participants together structure the social behavioural
relations that take place in (cid:142) eld laboratories. A researcher must choose among these
settings, or choose all three given enough resources,
for any particular study
depending on the resources available.

The second dimension of the framework makes use of Sackmann’s (1991) method-
ological work on organizationa l culture that characterizes several data-collection
techniques as a researcher’s interest in ‘data category pre-structuring’. Pre-structuring
occurs based on a researcher’s pre-existing conceptual framework about a topic, i.e.
a structuring of variables (data concepts) for which to collect data that a researcher
is ‘locked into’ when collecting the observations. The continuum she sets up ranges
from most pre-structuring to least pre-structuring at time of observation.
‘Least
pre-structuring’ can be thought of as an opportunity for post-structuring of the data
observations through ‘recoding’, since su(cid:141) ciently ‘discursive or narrative’ detail is
available from a ‘relatively’ un(cid:142) ltered repository of observations. Obviously, all
observations have limits that are speci(cid:142) c to place and time, so the diŒerence is really
a relative diŒerence among the techniques. Using the underlying dimension of pre-
structuring based on the work of Sackmann (1991 ) we array techniques from ‘most
to least pre-structuring’ resulting in the following relative order—survey instrument,
document coding, structured interview, group discussion, in-depth interview, and
direct observation with un(cid:142) ltered coding. We describe examples of the techniques to
provide the reader with more insight about the reason for our ordering. As examples

T . Nyerges et al.

of pre-structuring, both closed-ended and open-ended survey instruments pose
directed questions devised from a researcher’s pre-existing conceptual framework. A
document code is usually assigned from a protocol of codes that develops (or at
least is re(cid:142) ned) while working with the document materials. Structured interviews
have a direction in mind, but the interviewee has a chance to direct the conversation.
The direction of group discussions is at the whim of the group. An interviewer in
an in-depth interview usually lets a subject talk at will—although of course subtopic
questions are prepared in advance. In direct observation, for example, using a video
camera, little or no pre-structuring is involved as one observes whatever the camera
captures. Of course, all of the data-collection techniques have some amount of pre-
structure, but the amount is relatively diŒerent along the continuum. A researcher
must choose among these techniques, or choose all of them given enough resources,
for any particular study in order to collect the most appropriate data representing
GIS use.

The bi-dimensionality of the framework sets up a choice among 18 diŒerent data-
gathering strategies represented as the cells in (cid:142) gure 2. Rather than invent new labels
for data-gatherin g strategies, we make use of the more popular ones that exist. Thus,
not all of the cells are uniquely named, and not all of the cells are named with
popular labels although the underlying opportunity for data gathering still exists.
The two dimensions of
the framework help us understand trade-oŒs among
approaches to data observations. At the same time however, the dimensions establish
a set of constraints on those trade-oŒs. For details of how each data-gatherin g
strategy could be used in a research design we refer the reader to Runkel and
McGrath (1972) who describe (cid:142) eld survey, judgement task, computer simulation,
lab experiment, experimental simulations, and (cid:142) eld study; to Zmud et al. (1989 ) who
describe (cid:142) eld experiment; to Onsrud et al. (1992) and Yin (1994) who describe case
study; and to Avison et al. (1999) who describe participant action design. Our
purpose here is to examine the trade-oŒs in strategies, and not to lay out the details
of each strategy in relation to research design (Jankowski and Nyerges 2001b).

3. Comparing data-gatherin g strategies for studying group use of PGIS

It is important to understand that no single strategy is better in general than any
other strategy; as there are trade-oŒs to be made among various objectives for data
collection in any particular study. Therefore, in this section we compare and contrast
the strategies as a basis of the trade-oŒs, while keeping in mind that multiple
strategies are needed in order to study comprehensively any particular human–
computer–human interaction, particularly in the context of EAST2 as we dis-
cussed earlier.

Figure 2 suggests that strategies inherently diŒer based on a researcher’s induced
control of social-behavioural relations among participants and a researcher’s pre-
structuring of the data-collection constructs. Although those dimensions are the
fundamentals, informing us that trade-oŒs concerning empirical results are likely,
those dimensions potentially induce other implications for empirical (cid:142) ndings that
can be signi(cid:142) cant to a study. Those implications are (a) generalizability among actors,
places, and times, (b) realism of a situation, and (c) precision in the measurements
and controls of the constructs (see (cid:142) gure 2).

The implications are really ‘objectives’ for the potential evidence of a study. The
objectives motivate a choice for one or more data-gatherin g strategies that lead to
such evidence and subsequently, the (cid:142) ndings that might be interpreted from such

evidence. Generalizability of evidence is something to be sought such that research
(cid:142) ndings potentially apply across multiple actors (groups), multiple behaviours, and
multiple situations (multiple places and/or multiple times). In fact, the pursuit of the
notion of
‘multiple’ extends to all of the constructs in EAST2, not just actors,
behaviours, and situations. Realism of evidence is something to be sought in order
to claim that research (cid:142) ndings potentially apply to ‘real-world’ circumstances. Having
an in(cid:143) uence on actual situations in the world (or at least transferability) is something
sought by most funding agencies to show that research can make a diŒerence to
society. Precision and control of measurements (both quantitative and qualitative
coding) for evidence are something to be sought such that research (cid:142) ndings represent
a potential detail that matters for speci(cid:142) c situations. Having appropriate level of
precision and control in data collection and social-behavioural relations provides
some level of con(cid:142) dence that the research is addressing the research questions at an
appropriate level of speci(cid:142) city to the situation under study.

The three objectives are inherently in con(cid:143) ict when taken together. A researcher
cannot maximize all three objectives simultaneously when choosing a data-gatherin g
strategy. When a researcher strives to maximize one objective, a researcher must
forego maximizing at least one of the others, and thus make an important choice in
relation to a trade-oŒin objectives for the evidence to be gathered. If a researcher
intends a study to apply to many places and times, a researcher must forego some
amount of realism and precision, assuming that we have available a certain level of
resources for a study. For example, a (cid:142) eld survey can ‘potentially’ provide data that
are the most generalizable along each of the fundamental dimensions—induced
control of relations and pre-structuring of data concepts. However, (cid:142) eld surveys do
not provide situation speci(cid:142) c realism because participant responses are usually
constrained by researchers to certain prede(cid:142) ned categories, and because surveys are
usually completed in settings where respondents are removed from the situations
being studied.

A further di(cid:141) culty is that trade-oŒs work diŒerently in each of the two dimen-
sions. Note that any given strategy in a cell position along both the social-behavioural
relations and the pre-structuring of concept dimensions in(cid:143) uences each objective in
converse ways. For example, a (cid:142) eld survey, associated with the most pre-structuring
of concepts results in less realism because the instrument can be applied easily and
systematically across populations. However, when a survey is implemented in a (cid:142) eld
setting,
it can be generalized more because a researcher in(cid:143) uences the social-
behavioural relations the least. Such is the nature of the inherent trade-oŒs associated
with objectives for research (cid:142) ndings.

Thus, the power in the framework is that it helps researchers understand advant-
ages and disadvantage s of data-gatherin g strategies in terms of the objectives for
data as evidence and the potential (cid:142) ndings being sought. A major implication is that
each data-gatherin g strategy results in a particular type of data to be collected, which
is then made available for analysis. We would then expect the (cid:142) ndings to be of a
diŒerent character because of the inherent diŒerences in the evidence with regard to
the two principal dimensions of the framework. What this means is that researchers
should vary their approaches to social-behavioural studies as a way to implement
critical evaluation of PGIS use. No single strategy will be useful to gather data to
inform us fully about all eight EAST2 constructs regarding PGIS use. The framework
tells us which strategies are likely to be useful for what reasons as robust knowledge
is likely to develop from multiple perspectives.

Based on our own research, we have identi(cid:142) ed the strategies that are most likely
to help us pursue empirical research about the use of PGIS. We have assigned the
premises of EAST2 (thus research questions of table 2) to the framework (see (cid:142) gure 2).
The assignment of particular premises (research questions) to cells is based on
whether a particular social-behavioural relation is important with regard to the way
the setting induces control, and whether a particular data-collection technique can
sample the interaction of ‘group attention’ in that type of setting. Group attention
in this case is meant to represent a shared understanding of the situation. Notice
that the assignment is not one premise to one strategy. When used in this way, the
framework is useful for organizing discussions about the pros and cons of data-
gathering strategies in terms of speci(cid:142) c research premises/questions. Inspection of
(cid:142) gure 2 shows that the number of the premises addressed by data-gatherin g strategies
in the lower portion of the (cid:142) gure is greater than the number of premises in the upper
potion of the (cid:142) gure. The diŒerence is due to the in(cid:143) uence of real settings addressed
by (cid:142) eld survey, case study, focus group, participant action, and ethnographic (cid:142) eld
strategies. In the top portion of the framework, representative of laboratory experi-
ments and simulations, fewer premises appear because lab experiments make use of
contrived settings, constraining the opportunity to collect a variety of data, but
allowing (cid:142) ne-grained data collection. Between laboratory settings and (cid:142) eld settings
are (cid:142) eld laboratory settings. McGrath (1995 ) argues that (cid:142) eld experiments (as the
research design based on a (cid:142) eld laboratory setting) are not very useful because of
the compromise in social-behavioural control. Zmud et al. (1989 ) argue that such
settings are among the most valuable because one garners the best of both laboratory
and (cid:142) eld settings. Perhaps the answer is in the opportunity that presents itself,
because of the di(cid:141) culty of setting up such experiments together with the wealth of
evidence that is gained (Zmud et al. 1989 ).

Further inspection of (cid:142) gure 2 suggests that some premises can be addressed by
only a few strategies, whereas other premises can be addressed by many. Summarizing
the information about premises to be addressed by strategies in (cid:142) gure 2 provides us
with the information in table 3. When ranking the strategies from the most to least
number of premises addressed by a strategy we see that case studies and (cid:142) eld
experiments can address all seven premises. This is true only because multiple data-
collection techniques are required to collect all appropriate data. Along the bottom

of table 3, the fewest number of strategies to address any particular premise is (cid:142) ve,
and no premise is addressed by all 11 strategies. This provides further indication
that choices abound and these choices are likely to make a diŒerence to research
(cid:142) ndings.

A detailed examination of what strategies are appropriate for what premises
would consider the trade-oŒs in objectives for generality, realism, and precision in
the context of a speci(cid:142) c research project at hand. The placement of the premises is
based on the projects we have undertaken. Position in the framework along the two
dimensions shows what type of data we have been able to collect. In our own studies
to date, we have conducted lab experiments and case studies. In a study about
collaborative spatial decision making about habitat site selection we made use of a
laboratory experiment strategy that provided data about group interaction with
maps and decision models collected at a 1-minute resolution as coded from video
tape (Nyerges et al. 1998a, Jankowski and Nyerges 2001a) . The contrived, experi-
mental setting was useful for examining process interaction in the group decision
situation. The decision outcomes were less interesting because the task goal was
contrived, even though we used a task that emulated an actual habitat restoration
decision situation. In a case study about public health resource allocation across
counties of Idaho, we examined the types of GIS capabilities that public health
decision makers put to use; however, we did not have data about how such capabili-
ties were used in the decision process to produce certain outcomes (Jankowski and
Nyerges 2001b). In two case studies about transportatio n improvement decision
making we used document coding to examine the potential for use of advanced
group-based GIS capabilities, but again (cid:142) ne-grained interaction data about the
process was not available (Nyerges et al. 1998b, Jankowski and Nyerges 2001b). In
a case study examining risk factors in clean-up decisions about hazardous waste at
Hanford, document coding provided data at a level of coarse granularity that was
useful for describing the cyclic nature of decision chains, i.e. a sequence of decision
point to decision point activity (Drew et al. 2001 ).

The above-mentione d studies encourage us to believe that certain types of
research questions (generalized here as premises) are more fruitfully investigated
using diŒerent data-gatherin g strategies, hence the purpose for systematically explor-
ing that connection in this paper. We believe our framework oŒers a systematic
progression from problem articulation to data-gatherin g strategy. However, the
framework is not meant to ‘optimize’ for a particular strategy or a particular premise.
That would be asking for more ‘rigor’ in the framework than it oŒers at this time.

4. Conclusion and prospects for research directions

The research reported in this paper is motivated by a challenge to connect
substantive and theoretical research questions to data-gatherin g strategies in a more
eŒective way. That connection contributes to a broad research agenda about PGIS
use and the social implications such use has for society. To make that connection
more systematic, we have sorted through the complex and sometimes confusing
terminology related to social-behavioural research methods in order to tease apart
the nuances of research strategies. Even some of the most complete treatments of
social-behavioural research methods in literature (McGrath 1982, 1995, Brinberg
and McGrath 1985) still leave room for a better articulation. It is better to develop
a clearer sense of the connections between research questions and data-gatherin g

strategies in the planning stage rather than waiting until the research is underway,
particularly when addressing problems that are complex and multidisciplinary.

It is clearer for us how social-behavioural data-gatherin g strategies provide a
wealth of opportunities for pursuing empirical studies about use of GIS in general,
and PGIS use in particular. Because all strategies have shortcomings, sorting through
the choices of when to select a speci(cid:142) c strategy is important. In this paper we
developed a new view that has helped us compare and contrast data-gatherin g
strategies as the basis for critical evaluations of GIS use. The framework can help
researchers systematically employ nuances in mixed-method research strategies,
whether the mix takes place in a single study or across multiple studies (McGrath
1982 ). Consequently, what we are advocating in this paper is the use of complement-
ary data-gatherin g strategies to advance knowledge accrual about PGIS use through
mixed-method research. We hope this view can help other researchers in formulating
research strategies as well as in critiquing research strategies, even if PGIS use is
not the chosen topic in the substantive domain. However, only time and research
reporting will show which data-gatherin g strategies alone or in combination
with various analysis strategies are the better ones for researching PGIS use as
contributions to participatory geographical information science.

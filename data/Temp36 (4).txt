Abstract
The following research aims to enhance and spread the capacity of assessing risk due
to landslide-generated tsunamis by fostering the use of a GIS (Geographic Informa-
tion System), and in this particular instance, an Open Source GIS (where “Open
Source” can be loosely deﬁned as freely available source code). For this purpose, we
tested a procedure to be spatially implemented in the Open Source GRASS GIS
through developing a module named r.impact.tsunami that simulates landslide-
generated tsunami. In this article we present its application in a case study performed
on Como Lake (Lago di Como) in northern Italy. The review of the results identiﬁed
sources of uncertainties while the model sensitivity outlined the inﬂuence of the
parameters governing the model. Moreover, in order to verify the model validity, we
implemented a new module (r.swe), that simulates the tsunami propagation and
run-up with the shallow water equations, and compared the results. Notwithstand-
ing non-negligible differences, the two models produced results of the same magni-
tude; this conﬁrmed the validity of both models, although a rigorous validation of
the models could not be performed due to the lack of observed data.

1 Introduction

Intense earthquakes, like those registered in Japan and New Zealand in 2011, may
trigger landslide phenomena. In these cases, terrain instabilities can suddenly fail and,
if water bodies are in proximity, generate impulse wave tsunamis that may pose a
threat to the population and its infrastructures. Although the energy in this kind of
tsunami is often rapidly dissipated, in conﬁned water bodies like reservoirs, natural
lakes or fjords, the effects can still be destructive. This complex phenomenon is the
result of the combination of three different processes: the wave generation due to
impact, the wave propagation towards the basin, and ﬁnally the wave run-up along the
coastline generating ﬂooding.

Simulation approaches of landslide-generated tsunami found in the literature
include: equations derived by generic model tests where a rigid or granular body slides
into a wave channel (Heller 2008, Panizzo et al. 2005), observations of speciﬁc prototype
test results that reproduce a speciﬁc location in scale (WCHL 1970), numerical simula-
tions that use general equations or methods like the Navier-Stokes or the Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (Zweifel et al. 2007, Quacedo et al. 2004, Fritz 2002), empirical
equations derived from the assessment of sliding and effects data from ﬁeld surveys
(Ataie-Ashtiani and Malek Mohammadi 2007), and analytical equations as derived by Di
Risio and Sammarco (2008).

Interested readers can ﬁnd a comprehensive literature review of methods for the
simulation of impact wave generation in Di Risio et al. (2011). It worth noting that,
because of the complexity of the processes involved, all the abovementioned approaches
introduce assumptions (channel shape, landslide type, equation hypotheses, etc.) that
produce a level of uncertainty in the results, and therefore each approach needs to be
critically reviewed with respect to the application case.

Peggion et al. (2008) recommend that natural hazard risk assessment should be
conducted in a GIS environment. In fact, natural hazard models can take advantage of
detailed and updated geographical information directly available in GIS formats (e.g.
digital terrain models, lake boundaries, etc.) or derived by GIS analyses (e.g. terrain
slopes from map-algebra calculation, roughness coefﬁcient from landuse reclassiﬁcation,
etc.). Moreover, the use of GIS allow hazards with vulnerable elements to be spatially
contextualized and related, and thus facilitates the understanding of the risks that are
inherently dynamic in space and time. This is the base for moving from a perspective of
defense against hazards to a more desirable culture of integrated risk management
(PLANALP 2010).

Considering the abovementioned advantages, the authors decided to study the
possible integration of landslide-generated tsunamis modeling within a GIS. From the
many available GIS software, the authors selected the GRASS GIS (2011) because it
combines the advantages of having Open Source code (thus the ability to read, modify
and redistribute the source code) with a large number of modules of high scientiﬁc level
(see for example Mitasova et al. 1995, Arge et al. 2003, Suri and Hoﬁerka 2004, Brovelli
and Cannata 2004). Moreover, the free availability of GRASS helps avoid economic
barriers for accessing risk assessment tools. This reduced economic barrier permits the
fostering of capacity building and sustainable programs in the ﬁeld of risk management,
which is particularly important in poor regions and developing countries. It is important
to note that currently no GIS embedded implementation of impact-generated tsunamis
models are described in literature.

The presented research aims to: (1) investigate the capability of a procedure derived
by model tests proposed by Heller et al. (2009) and hereinafter referred to as “H2009”,
to be spatially implemented into GRASS GIS (2011); (2) to evaluate the uncertainty and
sensitivity of the developed model; (3) test the modules in a case study; and (4) infer the
model validity based on the analysis of the results and their comparison with those
obtained with a different approach. The latter is a numerical simulation of the propa-
gation and run-up of the generated wave that applies the solution of the non-linear
shallow water equations, as implemented by Cannata and Marzocchi (2012) in a GRASS
dam break simulation module (hereinafter referred to as “SWE”).

In the following sections, this article presents the mathematical formulas that are the
base of the applied methods (H2009 and SWE) and the respective newly implemented
GRASS modules. Afterwards, it illustrates a case study and reports the conducted
simulations and analyses. Finally a discussion of the ﬁndings is presented.

2 Tsunami Models Formulas

This chapter illustrates the main equations that have been applied.

2.1 Impact Wave Generation Assessment

When a sub-aerial mass (solid or granular body) impacts the water, an impulsive
perturbation of the water-free surface is caused and, due to a depression generated when
the body is submerged, the water ﬂows collide and rebound, generating a series of waves.
It has been observed that these waves largely change their shapes within a distance of up
to several wave lengths from the impact location; this area is named the near ﬁeld, as
opposed to the far ﬁeld where the predominant phenomenon is the wave propagation only.
The H2009 procedure is based on the identiﬁcation of the maximum wave in the
slide impact zone that is often like a water wall rather than a coherent wave. The
identiﬁcation of its characterization allows us to deﬁne the limits of the near ﬁeld and the
far ﬁeld zones.

The characteristic of the maximum wave is expressed as a function of the impulse
product parameter (P) (Heller 2007) that depends on the Slide Froude number (F),
relative slide thickness (S), relative slide mass (M) and slide impact angle (a) as expressed

2.2 Wave Propagation and Run-up

Once the impact waves have been generated in the near ﬁeld, a solitary wave propagates
towards the far ﬁeld with a generally regular behavior (translation in time and space)
characterized by non-dissipative motion. Approaching the shoreline, due to the water
depth reduction, the wave loses its regularity (Stokes-like behavior) and breaks. High
energy dissipation occurs, causing turbulent motion and, on the coast, a wave up-rush
whose maximum vertical extent is called run-up.

Figure 2 Illustration of the run-up (R) and wave parameters (H, L, T)

For the estimation of the propagation and run-up along the shoreline, we applied
both the H2009 and the SWE methods for comparison purpose. The H2009 method
applies equations derived from laboratory tests, while SWE applies equations derived
from hydrodynamics theory.

2.2.1 H2009 approach

According to H2009, the radial propagation of the impact-generated wave in a constant
bathymetric reservoir, for distances from the impact r larger than that of the maximum
wave rM, can be estimated with:

In Equations (9), (10) and (11), g is the wave direction with respect to the impact
velocity planar direction [deg], H is the wave height [m], T is the wave period [s] and L
is the wave length [m] (see Figures 1 and 2).

The non-constant depth of bathymetry causes wave energy dispersion that results in
wave height variation. This behavior, known as shoaling effect, can be taken into account
by correcting the wave height with the following multiplicative factor:

where hw(0) indicates the water depth at the impact location.

The wave breaking zone can be estimated by using empirical criteria as suggested in
USACE (2008); one of the simplest and most used criterion is given by the condition
H = 0.8 hw.

The SWE method applies the shallow water equations (Kinnmark 1985) to simulate the
wave propagation and the resulting run-up. With this approach the two phenomena can

be simulated with a single model even though, since the SWE treats the wave breaking
only as a propagation wave, the details of the wave breaking process cannot be obtained
(Li and Raichlen 2002).

in orthometric height [m.a.s.l.], and n is the Manning’s roughness coefﬁcient [s/mP1/3].
The proposed numerical scheme solves Equations (14) using a Finite Volume
Method (FVM). The inter-cell ﬂux is computed with a one-side Upwind Conservative
Scheme, also named UCS (Ying et al. 2004), extended in two-dimensions.

3 Development of GRASS Routines

GRASS is one of the most popular among free and Open Source GIS software. Its
powerful libraries allow for programming new modules either by means of scripting
(Python, Perl, PHP, etc.) or coding in C-ANSI language. For the objectives of this study
two original GRASS modules have been created: r.impact.tsunami
implements the
H2009 method through Python scripting, and r.swe implements the SWE method
through C-ANSI code.

ﬂuxes)

3.1 r.impact.tsunami (H2009 Implementation)

This module requires an elevation raster accounting for the bathymetry and a lake water
depth raster. Moreover it requires information on the sliding mass: bulk slide density
[Kg/m3], bulk slide porosity [%], bulk slide volume [m3], slide width [m] and slide
thickness [m]. Other mandatory inputs are the coordinates of the impact point on the
lake, the still water depth in the area of impact [m], the impact velocity [m/s], the impact
inclination angle [deg] and the impact azimuth angle [deg]. In addition, it requires the
output raster map names.

Optionally the user can provide a shadow raster map, for masking the results (i.e. a
line of sight map from the impact location can identify locations directly impacted by the
wave) and a numerical value for setting the wave break condition. Moreover, a number
of optional ﬂags are available for: (1) applying an angle limitation mask (-90 deg to 90
deg); formatting reports in GUI layout; (2) printing limitations check report; (3) printing
a maximum wave characteristics report; (4) saving temporary ﬁles; and (5) applying a
solid mass type correction factor. While elevation and water depth maps are commonly
available data, slide mass information should be assessed by geological studies of the area
(geo-morphological site characterization) and slide impact information could be esti-
mated by numerical modeling of rock fall or mass movement. The outputs of the model
are a wave height raster map and a ﬂood height raster map.

3.2 r.swe (SWE Implementation)

This module requires a series of input raster maps. They are an elevation raster map
accounting for bathymetry, a Manning’s roughness coefﬁcient raster map, an initial
water depth raster map including wave height, and two initial wave velocity raster maps
(east and north components). Other mandatory parameters are the simulation time
duration and the time-lag for map generation. Finally the module asks for water depth,
water velocity, maximum water depth, maximum water velocity, maximum intensity,
wave front arrival time, and an output raster maps name preﬁx. Optionally the user can
set a ﬂag to extract ﬂow direction maps and an initial value for the computational time
step. Initial wave conditions (height and velocities) can be derived by one of the impact

198 M Cannata, R Marzocchi and M E Molinari

wave generation methods as proposed in Di Risio et al. (2011) that requires geological
studies and rock fall/ mass movement estimation.

The main outputs of the model are two time series rasters showing water depth and
ﬂow velocities. Each series describes the evolution of the variable of interest in time and
is composed by a number of named raster maps concatenating the speciﬁed output preﬁx
and the seconds elapsed from the beginning of the simulation. Optionally a time series
raster showing ﬂow direction can be produced. Moreover, with the aim to provide an
instrument for risk assessment fully within a GIS environment (Cannata 2007, Cannata
and Marzocchi 2012), maximum intensity and wave arrival time can be generated.

The stability of the numerical solution expressed by Equation (16) is imposed by the

following condition (Courant et al. 1967):

(17)

The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy number NCFL depends on grid resolution, wave veloc-
ity and computational time step. r.swe uses this condition to guarantee numerical
stability and to optimize computation time by automatically varying the time step.

4 Case Study

The developed methodology has been tested in a real case, located on Lago di Como: a
glacial lake located in Lombardy, northern Italy. The study area is characterized by the
presence of a conglomeratic column 110 m high and delimited by a tension crack. In a
worst case scenario, a possible toppling of the column may cause a 50,000 m3 rock fall,
part of which may reach the lake surface and generate an impact wave tsunami.

4.1 Geological Context and Rock-fall Simulation

From a geological perspective, this site is characterized by a series of carbonate horizons,
slightly inclined toward the bottom of the valley and inter-layered with thin sedimentary
strata. Even though several discontinuities have been observed, the principal cracks are
given by four pseudo-vertical fractures that isolate four consecutive columns: most likely
the fractures were originally generated due to structural reasons (orogenesis) and then
enlarged and deepened up to the current apertures, ranging from 1 to 5 m. The mor-
phology of the site is dominated by gravitational phenomena with rock-falls caused by
intense fractures and with isolated dihedral masses caused by high slopes of the rock
mass.

The worst scenario is given by the toppling of the external column that falls into the
lake. This has been justiﬁed by the observation of rock masses lying on the bottom of the
lake (see Figure 4). A special diving inspection conﬁrmed that their material is conglom-
erate; the rock masses at the bottom of the lake are exactly the same type as the
upstanding rock masses. This is clear evidence that a similar scenario already happened
in the past.

The estimation of impact location, velocity and inclination are needed in order to
assess the possible effects of a solitary wave generated by the impact of large rock falls.
With this aim the SASS (Pamini and Bozzolo 1982, Pamini 2002) rock fall model has

been run with a scenario hypothesis, as illustrated in Figure 5, of toppling of the exterior
conglomeratic column which breaks in three main blocks (respectively 13,000 m3,
20,000 m3 and 23,000 m3) that slide and bounce toward the lake following two optional
predeﬁned paths intersecting the submerged rock masses.

The model results (Ambrosi et al. 2011) show that the ﬁrst block (13,000 m3) has a
probability of 21% to reach the lake; the relative maximum velocity is estimated at
35 m/s and the maximum energy at 29,500 MJ. The model identiﬁed the stop position

close to the observed submerged rock masses. The impact inclination has been estimated
at 35 degrees. The probability that the rocks reach the lake dropped down to a 9% for
the second block and 1% for the third block.

5 Simulation with r.impact.tsunami

The simulation was based on the rock-fall modeling results: the impact of the ﬁrst block
only was taken into account (V1 of Figure 5) and the values reported in Table 1 were
used.

It is important to point out that all of the empirical formulations found in the
literature for maximum wave impact estimation rely on the identiﬁcation of the still
water height in the impact zone. Nevertheless, the exact location where this value has to
be observed is not clear; in fact water depth can vary greatly in the impact area. Heller
et al. (2009) in their examples used water depth values corresponding to the location
where the bank slope met the sub-horizontal lake bottom, where most likely the sliding
mass was going to stop. For this reason, the authors decided to use the value that was
observed in the position of the submerged rock masses, where most likely ancient rock
falls stopped, as the still water depth in the impact zone in the simulation.

The r.impact.tsunami module was tested with the input values of Table 1 and the
angle limitation mask option (ﬂag a) activated. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the resulting
wave height and the ﬂood maps respectively, while Table 2 report some maps statistics.
The wave propagation map (Figure 6) shows a clear discontinuity at the interface
between the near and far ﬁeld areas (see the green circle), which is due to the application
of two different sets of equations that do not guarantee continuity. Nevertheless, away
from the near ﬁeld non-conservative phenomena occur; radially propagating the wave
dissipates energy and the water height decreases. The run-up process, identiﬁed in
Figure 6 by the green areas located near to the coasts, appears well represented; a clear
dependence on the near-shore bathymetry is observed. The ﬂooding (Figure 7) is the
result of the propagation of the wave elevation at the shore over the terrain. It has been
obtained by means of a nearest point approach (Voronoi tessellation), successively

5.1 Analysis of the Results

As stated in the introduction, an analysis of the results with respect to application cases
has to be carefully carried out in order to understand correctly the model outputs that are
based on several assumptions and simpliﬁcations. In particular the basin shape and
sliding mass type should be considered.

The basin shape inﬂuences the wave height due to:

(cid:129) A shoaling effect, in shallow-water the wave energy is considered constant and thus
a reduction in water height is translated into an increase of wave height according to:

(18)

where H is the wave height [m], hw is the water depth [m] and bw is the section width [m];
subscripts 1 and 2 refer to two different sections.
(cid:129) Diffraction, when a wave passes an obstacle it transmits some of its energy in the
shadow zone, which leads to a wave that also reaches shores not in the line of sight
with the impact.

(cid:129) Constriction, when a wave is constricted laterally an increase of its height is observed;

Equation (18) can be used to model this effect.

(cid:129) Reﬂection, when a wave reaches the basin boundary it is reﬂected back with reduced
height due to the loss of energy that occurred during the run-up process; in case of a
vertical shore (like a dam) the reﬂected amplitude is similar to that of the impacting
wave.

(cid:129) Refraction, when a wave approaches the shore it changes its direction so that the

impact is perpendicular.

The sliding mass type inﬂuences the generation of impact waves. In fact, according
to Zweifel (2004) higher maximum waves are expected when, instead of a granular mass
type, the sliding body is solid. After conducting 11 laboratory experiments Zweifel et al.
(2007) formulated a relationship (see Equation 19) between the maximum wave ampli-
tude produced by a solid mass aMs [m] and the maximum wave amplitude produced by
a granular body aM [m] as a function of the slide Froude number F and the still water

matically corrected by accounting for the changing bathymetry using Equation (18).
On the contrary, diffraction, constriction, reﬂection, and refraction were not consid-
ered by the model, therefore some considerations for the case study are needed. North-
ern and southern bank areas that are located on the same side of the slide, but not in
line of sight with the impact point, are reached by the wave due to diffraction and/or
reﬂection; as these phenomena dissipate energy here the wave height, relative run-up,
and inundation, are expected to be overestimated. Constriction effects could be
neglected, in fact no area with abrupt constriction can be detected within the basin
zone. Refraction effect is likely to lower the wave height since it is a dissipative
phenomenon.

In the case study, the mass is solid, but the model has been developed through
laboratory tests with a granular mass; thus the correction given by Equation (15) has to
be evaluated. For this case study, using a Froude number F = 1.58 and a maximum
amplitude aM = 19.58 m with Equation (19), we obtain a maximum wave amplitude of
solid mass aMs = 47.66 m. This means an increase of maximum wave height of a factor
of 2.43. The same ratio is in general expected at every wave location.

Water level increases due to volume displacement given by the submersion of the
sliding mass but, in this case, it is negligible being estimated as 0.0004 m (result of the
division of the 13,000 m3 of the bulk slide volume and the 32,220,812 m2 of the water
surface area). Limiting conditions that are not respected are relative slide density, granu-
late density, and bulk slide porosity; all these conditions are connected to the sliding mass
type and therefore already considered.

5.2 Sensitivity Analysis

In the previous sections, it has been shown that the level of uncertainty can be measured;
for this reason, an investigation of the module sensitivity is desirable to better understand
the level of uncertainty that can be introduced by the selection of input values. Using the
input values of the case study as the base for the sensitivity analysis, each parameter has
been varied according to Table 4.

Each varied value x of the parameter i to its standardized value Z can be calculated

by:

where xb is the base value of the i-th parameter, xmin is the lower range limit value and xmax
is the upper range limit value. It is possible to compare and evaluate the effect of each
parameter variation on the maximum wave height (HM) and the ﬂooded area (Af) as
represented in Figures 8 and 9, where the codes reported in Table 4 are used. Variation
ranges have been selected considering their physical meaningfulness and their expected
uncertainty.

By observing these two plots it is clear that the main parameters affecting the
simulation results are related to the impact, namely the still water depth (depth) and the
impact velocity (vel ). Results are less sensible for mass properties. It is interesting to note
that in the case study, when the water depth increases, the maximum wave height
decreases while the ﬂooded area increases; this seems contradictory. In fact, generally,
with higher waves larger inundations are expected. In this case it does not occur due to
the discontinuity observed in the transition between the near and far ﬁelds; as shown in
Figure 10, the proﬁles of the maximum wave heights H across the basin reveal that lower
H in the near zone (constant values) corresponds to higher H in the far ﬁeld.

5.3 Comments on the Simulation

The results obtained by the module, after their evaluation and the sensitivity analysis, can
be considered to have a high level of uncertainty. If the worst case scenario is of interest,
the module should be run with upper bound values of impact velocity and still water
depth, and the wave height should be increased by a factor of 2 due to the sliding mass
not being of granular type. This can be accounted by the module activating the ﬂag s that
applies the solid mass type correction (see Equation 19).

The results of the module run with worst case scenario conditions are illustrated in
Figures 11 and 12. With these parameters a maximum wave height HM of 62 m and a
maximum inundation height IH of 38.5 m are observed. Maximum inundation area is
estimated to be 268,384 m2, that is 121,988 m2 more than the inundation area estimated
with base values.

The value of HM = 62 m has to be considered representative of very extreme
conditions associated with residual probability of occurrence in case of column failure
(that itself has a residual probability). Nevertheless, the inundation height of 38.5 m
should be considered a plausible value. In fact Heller et al. (2009) found similar values
in a comparable case where the mass were wider, but with slower impact velocity; the
worst case scenario used an impact velocity of 50 m/s, that is about the 60% of the
velocity that the mass would reach if falling down in free ﬂight mode.

However, the uncertainty introduced by applying the solid mass type corrections
could be important. In fact, the small number of laboratory tests conducted by Zweifel
et al. (2007) in his study do not guarantee a high level of conﬁdence in the application of
these results. Unfortunately, though, no other indications on quantiﬁcation of the error
given by considering solid mass type instead of granular type are available.

6 Comparison with r.swe

In this study the r.swe GRASS module was tested in order to simulate the wave propa-
gation and run-up; its results were compared with that of H2009 method.

6.1 Simulation with r.swe

The simulation was run starting from the maximum wave conditions identiﬁed by
r.impact.tsunami (see Table 3); in particular the input water depth was modiﬁed with the
estimated wave height (HM) located at the beginning of the far ﬁeld and the input initial
wave velocities were set according to the estimated celerity.

Two different boundary conditions were assumed: (1) a no-ﬂux boundary condition
– imposed by a vertical wall at the computational region limits; this condition produces
overestimations that do not permit the natural ﬂux out of the boundary; (2) a free-ﬂux
boundary condition – imposing the water depth at the computational region limits to be
steady stable in time; this condition produces underestimations not accounting for
eventual external morphology barriers.

Even though neither the ﬁrst nor the second assumption exactly describes the
physical phenomenon, in our opinion the free-ﬂux boundary condition is more repre-
sentative of the by reality by not introducing artiﬁcial wave rebounds.

Figures 13 and 14 illustrate the inundation maps resulting from the r.swe module run
with the above discussed initial conditions, namely the no-ﬂux and free-ﬂux boundary
conditions. The statistics of the ﬂooding raster are reported in Table 5.

6.2 Analysis of the r.swe Results

It is worth noting that the results of the r.swe module are valid outside the near ﬁeld area
only, in fact in this region the propagation process is non-conservative and the SWE
assumptions are not met. Moreover, this process has already been considered by the
impact wave generation procedure after H2009. Even though other equations for the
estimation of maximum impact wave generation are available in the literature (Di Risio
et al. 2011), the authors applied the H2009 method in order to compare the wave
propagation using the two modules. The investigations of different methods are left for
future research.

Figure 15 Wave propagation after 50 (a) and 100 (b) seconds from the wave generation

Regarding the sources of error or uncertainty considered for the H2009 results, the
mass type effect on the impact wave generation (see Section 3.2.1) has a great inﬂuence
also on the results of r.swe module application. In fact all of the numerical models are
strongly controlled by the initial conditions that, in this case, are obtained by the impact
wave estimation of the r.impact.tsunami module. On the other hand, as can be noted in
Figure 15, basin shape effects do not have any important negative inﬂuence on the
results, because topography is already considered within the SWE numerical solution.

Finally, as already stated, the SWE methods do not account for non-uniform hori-

zontal velocity proﬁles, a condition that often occurs during the run-up process.

6.3 Models Comparison

In this section a comparison between the results of the r.impact.tsunami and the r.swe
modules is conducted. For this analysis we compared the results of the H2009 with those
obtained by SWE with the free-ﬂux condition.

Figure 16 shows a map of the inundation height differences estimated by the two
methods (H2009 minus SWE). Figure 17 illustrates the location of differences classiﬁed
as: (1) type 1 when the inundation area is estimated by the H2009 method and not by the
SWE; (2) type 2 when the inundation area is estimated by the SWE method and not by
the H2009; and (3) type 3 when the inundation area is considered by both methods.

The two methods lead to differences in the estimation of inundations that cannot be
considered negligible, even though the magnitude of the phenomenon is in agreement. In
general it can be observed that the SWE method produces lower wave heights, and thus

inundation, with respect to the H2009 method. Differences of type 2 are present only in the
vicinity of the near ﬁeld shores located backward with respect to the mass direction. Here
the H2009 method does not provide any run-up values; while SWE produces a run-up
because of the wave reﬂections (Figure 15a). Due to these considerations, a comparison in
this area is not meaningful. Considering only the ﬂooding areas outside of the near ﬁeld
region, a correspondence of about 39% was obtained between the two models. Table 6
reports some basic statistics to compare the two methods.

7 Conclusions

With this research the authors have shown how the method proposed by Heller et al.
(2009) can be implemented in a GIS by the generation of a new GRASS module named
r.impact.tsunami. A case study has been used to verify the validity of the implemented
code and to assess model sensitivity and uncertainty. With this analysis the authors have
shown that the predominant model driving parameters are the still water height depth in
the impact zone and the mass impact velocity. Because it is not clear about the exact
location where the water depth should be evaluated, the model uncertainty depends
greatly on the user’s choice for this parameter value.

Since no observations of occurred events were available for a model validation, in
order to infer the validity of the proposed methodology, the authors compared the results
of this empirical and laboratory test-based methodology with a more general numerical
solution that applied the shallow water equations. A new module named r.swe was
developed for this comparison. This module implements the solution found in Cannata
and Marzocchi (2012) to obtain ﬂood maps in the case of a dam break.

The comparison has shown that the two modules are in a general agreement in terms
of magnitude of wave height, even though the r.impact.tsunami module produces higher
and consequently larger inundations. Nevertheless this has proven the general applica-
bility and validity of the H2009 method, but has also underlined the high level of
uncertainty that exists in the simulation of this type of event.

It is opinion of the authors that for the hazard assessment of landslide-generated
tsunami both the H2009 and the SWE methods can be applied under the condition that the
level of uncertainty given by the hypotheses and simpliﬁcations undertaken and the case
study characteristics are acknowledged and consciously considered by the modeler.

While r.impact.tsunami has the advantage to be fast and requires low computational
resources, it should be used to simulate the wave propagation within basins with
complex shape geometries (shadows zones) where reﬂections, constrictions, diffractions,
and refractions may play an important role in inundation. On the contrary, r.swe requires
intensive computational resources and time, but it accounts for shape dependent effects
in the wave propagation. Moreover it produces maps of velocities that together with
ﬂood depths are important for intensity assessment.

A limit of this research is that alternative methods to calculate the maximum wave
height in the near zone were not accounted for. This factor is of great importance for both
methodologies. In fact, it is the initial condition for the wave propagation estimated with
both the r.swe and the r.impact.tsunami models. Future research will be conducted in
order to compare different literature approaches and try to derive a methodology for the
generation of an ensemble simulation (Cane and Milelli 2010), such that multiple
simulations under plausible initial conditions can be conducted with different models to
account for the sources of uncertainty.

Finally, the presented results indicate that modeling of natural hazards in a GIS
environment can improve our knowledge of the dynamics and spatial pattern of existing
risks, particularly when they depend on complex terrain. The freely available Open
Source code should facilitate future model modiﬁcation and improvements, taking
advantage of research developments in the landslide-induced tsunami ﬁeld, and should
help to minimize economic access barriers for risk assessment studies.

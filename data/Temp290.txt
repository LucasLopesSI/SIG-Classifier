Diversity assessments are widely used in various ﬁelds of knowledge and rely on good
estimates of species distribution. There are several methods available to estimate species
distribution and the effect of using them is not clearly understood. In this research,
we assess the effect of species distributions derived from four geographical distribu-
tion estimation methods on derived species richness and phylogenetic diversity (PD).
We used the following four most common approaches to determine species geograph-
ical distributions: (1) range-wide occurrences are records of presence from databases
and museum collections; (2) marginal occurrences are generally expert drawn distri-
butional maps; (3) species distribution modeling (SDM) combines geographic records
and environmental data to predict species occurrence; and (4) a combined approach that
constrains the statistical modeling predictions by the marginal occurrence distributions.
Using these approaches, we estimated richness and PD and their correspondent geo-
graphic hotspots for three different analysis resolutions using non-overlapping square
windows of 2◦, 4◦, and 6◦ across Australia. We also assessed the differences of the
resultant geographical distributions for three different spatial resolutions. We found
markedly different hotspots when using range-wide occurrences and statistical model-
ing approaches. Range-wide occurrences resulted in low values of species richness and
PD and statistical modeling resulted in high values. The combined and marginal occur-
rences approaches both had intermediate values, with the combined approach showing
a ﬁner level of detail than the marginal occurrences. There is a tendency for species
range sizes between methods to converge with decreasing spatial resolution. Even for a
relatively well-sampled group such as the Australian marsupials, the range-wide occur-
rences approach is likely to underestimate the presence of species. Conversely, because
SDMs usually do not account for dispersal abilities or biotic interactions, it is likely that
species geographical distributions using this approach are overestimated. Depending
on the method used, the resultant estimates of diversity may be completely different.
Caution is needed when choosing the method to estimate species distribution.

Introduction
Spatial biodiversity assessments rely on species geographical distributions. The ever-
increasing availability of species distribution data, for some taxonomic groups, means that
they can be applied over increasingly large extents such as continents and the globe. There

are many applications for spatial biodiversity assessments. For conservation planning, these
data allow a greater coverage of species threats and vulnerability assessments (e.g., Grenyer
et al. 2006, Schipper et al. 2008). From the macroecological perspective, the geographical
data can be used to understand the changes in species composition (Ferrier et al. 2007).
Biogeographically, the combination of spatial data with genetic and phylogenetic data can
lead to important evolutionary insights (e.g., Ladiges et al. 2005, Rosauer et al. 2009).
However, the quality of these assessments depends on the quality of the species distribu-
tion data set used, both in terms of the geographical data and the method used to determine
the species distributions.

Species geographical distribution
All diversity metrics are fundamentally a function of the species found in a location, or a
comparison of species found in two or more locations. They are, therefore, also fundamen-
tally a function of the overlapping species geographical distributions and depend on good
estimates of species distributions.

The ﬁve most common methods to estimate species geographical distributions are
‘marginal occurrences’, ‘habitat distributions’, ‘range-wide occurrences’, ‘species dis-
tribution modeling’ (SDM), and ‘process-based modeling’ (Gaston and Fuller 2009).
Of these, we consider three in this research (range-wide occurrences, marginal occur-
rences, and SDM), as well as a fourth ‘combined’ method (Figure 1). We do not consider
habitat distributions and process-based modeling approaches because it is uncommon to
have information on either habitat preferences or ecophysiological traits for all species in
analyzes of large assemblages.

The range-wide occurrences approach uses geolocated records as presence points, with
these records typically being derived from museum data. This method is the most com-
monly used in species distribution atlases (e.g., Brown 2004, Gibbons et al. 2007). Species
distributions estimated using this method have many discontinuities and the number of
false absences is high due to insufﬁcient sampling effort. Its use is usually appropriate
when there is an evenly and extensively sampled area (Gaston and Fuller 2009). When
these occurrences are obtained through museum collections, it is important to review and

meticulously clean the data. Taxonomic, spatial and temporal errors are common, as is
environmental bias due to different sampling effort in different habitats (Newbold 2010).

The marginal occurrences approach is often based on expert drawn distributions
obtained through specialists’ consensus and guided by georeferenced records. This is the
method used for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) species dis-
tribution database (IUCN 2001). There is usually more commission error (false presence)
associated with this method, and therefore the species distribution tends to be overestimated
(Hurlbert and Jetz 2007). However, despite its low precision, it can be obtained compara-
tively easily and sometimes is the only data available. When the objective of the study is
to assess a large number of species, modeling all of them could be difﬁcult and subjective.
This method is therefore useful when evaluating global scale patterns (e.g., Grenyer et al.
2006, Schipper et al. 2008).

Species distribution modeling using computer algorithms can help reduce the omission
errors (false absence) of the range-wide occurrences approach by combining geographic
records and environmental data such as climate, land cover, and topography, to pre-
dict species occurrence. These models provide an efﬁcient way of ﬁlling the gaps of
species knowledge. However, if SDMs do not consider dispersal abilities and interactions
between species, it is likely that predicted distributions will be overestimated (Pulliam
2000, Soberon and Peterson 2005), incurring high commission errors.

An approach to minimize the commission errors from SDMs is to combine the pre-
dicted presence of species with the marginal occurrences approach by constraining the
modeled distributions to occur within the bounds of the marginal occurrence distributions
(e.g., Kremen et al. 2008). Generally, SDM estimates the fundamental niche, so constrain-
ing the SDM estimates using expert drawn range maps allows a closer estimate of the
realized niche. The combined approach goes toward accounting for dispersal limitation,
without addressing biotic interactions. We refer to this as the combined approach.

Diversity metrics

Of the many available diversity metrics, species richness is the simplest to determine.
However, while informative, the richness concept is based on the assumption that all
species are equal. Species will share more features with closely related species than with
those that are more distantly related. In this sense, Vane-Wright et al. (1991) proposed
a diversity metric based on cladistic classiﬁcation for measuring taxonomic distinctness
between species. Since then, several other metrics that consider the evolutionary rela-
tionship between species have been introduced, most notably Faith’s (1992) phylogenetic
diversity (PD) metric. PD is a feature-based method that is calculated by summing the
branch lengths in a tree that are spanned by the set of terminal taxa at a location. The PD
is expected to be less sensitive to different geographical distribution estimation methods
because it measures shared features on the tree rather than the absolute number of species.
Related species are more likely to share similar environmental limitations (Freckleton and
Jetz 2009), because they share a more recent common ancestor, and they are more likely to
overlap their geographical distributions. Mapping phylogenies allows us to identify areas
where clades are restricted (Ladiges et al. 2005) and to identify regions of recently evolved
species (Davies et al. 2008). This plays a fundamental role in conservation strategies,
because it can protect not only the species itself but also the evolutionary processes that
maintain it (Moritz 2002).

Patterns of diversity can differ in spatial extent and resolution. Extent refers to the
area under investigation (related to local, landscape, and macro scales) and resolution is

the base unit used for analysis. Patterns that are not evident at one resolution can become
evident at another, making it critical to investigate and measure diversity at different spatial
resolutions (Whittaker et al. 2001).

Aims

The effects of using different geographical distribution estimation methods to assess
biodiversity have been previously documented (Graham and Hijmans 2006, Hurlbert and
Jetz 2007, McPherson and Jetz 2007, Hawkins et al. 2008, Raedig and Kreft 2011).
However, there is not a clear understanding of the effects of using different approaches
to estimate species distributions on different diversity metrics yet. In order to understand
these effects, we compare richness and PD metrics obtained using the four geographical
distribution estimation approaches described above. We also analyze the effect of varying
spatial resolutions on the estimated geographical distributions. We used the Australian mar-
supials as our study group. This is a well-studied group with available phylogenetic data
and also a good number of geographic records to enable the four distribution estimation
methods considered.

Materials and methods

Range-wide occurrences approach
We compiled a database of specimen locations from online databases (NatureMap; DEC
2007), Global Biodiversity Information Facility Data Portal (GBIF, http://www.gbif.org/)
and Online Zoological Collections of Australian Museums (Ozcam, http://www.ozcam.
org.au) and from Australian Museums (South Australian Museum, Australian National
Wildlife Collection, Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO), and Queensland Museum). All records were carefully checked and the identi-
ﬁcation and taxonomy corrected following Dyck and Strahan (2008). The spatial accuracy
of points was of 0.1◦ and they were converted to a raster data structure at a 0.05◦ resolution.
The collection dates for all records were checked for temporal speciﬁcity (Reside et al.
2011). More than half (54%) did not have such information, 45% were collected after 1950,
and 1% were collected before 1950. We chose not to exclude this 1% because they were
mostly located inside the IUCN species geographical distributions, so their effect on the
analysis is small.

Marginal occurrences approach

The IUCN data set (IUCN 2010) comprises of generalized polygons determined by expert
consensus. Usually the polygons are determined in workshops where specialists assess
species distribution using georeferenced records. Some species are represented by more
than one polygon, representing discontinuities in habitat suitability (Schipper et al. 2008).

Species distribution modeling approach
We used maximum entropy distribution modeling (Maxent; Phillips et al. 2006) to pre-
dict species distributions using the sample records used in the range-wide occurrences
approach. Maxent has been shown to have a good performance in presence only data stud-
ies (Elith et al. 2006). Models were calibrated using the default settings. For validation

purposes, we selected a random subset of 25% of the records for each species as a test
data set.

We used three different categories of environmental variables: bioclimatic, topographic,
and vegetation (Table 1). The bioclimatic data are nine of the 35 variables available from
WorldClim (Hijmans et al. 2005). Topographic data were derived from the GEODATA
9 Second Digital Elevation Model of Australia (Version 3) (Hutchinson et al. 2009). For
vegetation, we used three different types of data. Land cover is a categorical variable
classiﬁed by University of Maryland from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR) satellite images. Images were analyzed by Hansen et al. (2003) to obtain 14 dif-
ferent classes of land cover. Vegetation Continuous Field (Vcf) is a Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product and contains estimates for vegetative cover
types: woody vegetation, herbaceous vegetation, and bare ground (Hansen et al. 2003).
The fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR) data is AVHRR-derived,
monthly fPAR absorbed by vegetation (Donohue et al. 2008). The total fPAR is a sum of
persistent (non-deciduous perennial) and recurrent (deciduous, annual, and ephemeral)
vegetation. The environmental variables to predict species distributions were the average
and standard deviation of total fPAR for each cell across the period of February 1995 to
December 2006.

We selected 16 from the total of 49 available environmental variables for the anal-
yses (Table 1). These 16 variables have low correlations between one another (with the
mean ± SD of pairwise Pearson’s r values being 0.300 ± 0.204) and are also expected
to have important effects on the marsupial distributions (Mackey and Lindenmayer 2001).
We ran the distribution models at a 0.05◦ resolution.

The Maxent output is a raster surface for each species giving the predicted probability
of habitat suitability, ranging from 1 to 0. Obtaining a binary map (presence or absence)
needed for the PD analyzes requires the selection of a decision threshold. We used the

sensitivity–speciﬁcity sum maximization approach, balancing the fraction of test samples
correctly predicted as suitable against the fraction of the study region predicted as suitable
(Liu et al. 2005).

Combined approach

In the fourth approach, we used a combination of both IUCN and museum data sets.
For each species, we eliminated all museum records that were more than 100 km outside
the boundary of the respective IUCN polygon. We then modeled the species distribution
using the same parameters used for the statistical modeling approach. In order to minimize
commission error, we also used the buffered IUCN distributions to exclude the predicted
presences that were outside the IUCN species distribution. The 100 km buffer distance was
selected to be small enough to eliminate false presence in cases where other factors may
limit species distribution (e.g., dispersal limits, interaction with other species), but also
large enough to account for areas where a species might occur but where it has not yet
been recorded (e.g., due to insufﬁcient sampling effort or sampling bias). It is important to
acknowledge that this 100 km buffer zone is an assumed value and that species boundaries
might change through time (Fortin et al. 2005). The effect of different distances needs to
be explored in further research.

Species richness and phylogenetic diversity measures

We used the software Biodiverse, version 0.16 (Laffan et al. 2010, http://purl.org/
biodiverse) to calculate species richness and PD. Data were imported and aggregated to
a 0.1◦ resolution, with the IUCN polygons being ﬁrst converted into presence points on
a 0.05◦ grid. We analyzed the data using non-overlapping moving windows (blocks) to
assess the effect of resolution changes on the results. Three resolutions were used, 0.2◦,
0.4◦ and 0.6◦. This approach allows an analysis of the effects of coarser resolutions while
maintaining the underlying level of detail in the plotted maps, as species considered for
each metric are those found in the respective non-overlapping window. For the PD metric,
we extracted the Australasian marsupials segment from the Bininda-Emonds et al. (2007)
mammals supertree. Species not in the tree were considered to be at the same position as
their sister species, and thus distances between them and other species were the same.

The degree of relationship between each of the geographical distribution estimation
methods was assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient, calculated for the richness
and PD scores for each of the three different spatial resolutions. We also assessed the effect
on estimates of hotspots of diversity by treating the top 5% of cells for each metric and
each method as hotspots.

Further, we assessed the effect of spatial resolution on the overall distribution estimates
across species. This was done by counting the number of windows in which each species
was found, a process analogous to aggregating the records to cells of the speciﬁed resolu-
tion. We then plotted the log of these counts for each distribution estimation method for
each spatial resolution.

Results
A total of 21,337 records of occurrences were available for 135 species analyzed (records
occurring within the same 0.05◦ cell were aggregated into single occurrences if they
were from the same species). The 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles were 9.4, 66, and
427.2 occurrences, respectively. Of the unique occurrences across species, 1077 (∼0.05%)

were more than 100 km outside from their respective IUCN species distributions and there-
fore excluded from the analysis for the combined approach. For the combined approach,
the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles were 7, 58, and 419 occurrences, respectively. For ref-
erence, the area under the curve (AUC) from the combined approach had a mean score of
0.970 ± 0.04 and the statistical modeling approach had a mean score of 0.957 ± 0.05.

Both richness and PD had similar spatial patterns across Australia. Generally, there
were higher scores along the coast, especially along the east coast, and lower scores within
the arid and semi-arid zones. However, there are key differences between the distribution
estimation methods.

Not surprisingly, the approaches that resulted in broader species geographical distribu-
tions (Figure 2) also resulted in higher estimates for richness and PD (Figures 3 and 4).
Species geographical distributions were larger for the SDM approach, the combined and
marginal occurrences approaches had intermediate geographical distribution sizes, and
the range-wide occurrences approach had the lowest. These differences are reﬂected in
higher estimates for the SDM approach and lower for range-wide occurrences. Of the two
approaches with intermediate estimates, the combined approach shows more spatial detail
than the marginal occurrences approach.

The hotspots of the top 5% of cells clearly illustrate how the use of different geo-
graphical distribution estimation methods can result in different outcomes (Figures 3
and 4). The hotspots consist of small patches along the east coast for the range-wide
occurrences method. In comparison, the statistical modeling approach resulted in an
almost contiguous hotspot region. The marginal occurrences and combined approaches
had similar patches overall, with some small differences in their sizes and shapes
(see Supplemental Table S1 available online at http://informahealthcare.com/doi/suppl/
10.1080/13658816.2012.717627).

The correlation was higher between the statistical modeling and combined approaches.
This was to be expected given that the combined method is a reﬁnement of the SDM
approach. The range-wide occurrences approach was least correlated with the others
(Table 2).

correlations were signiﬁcant at the 0.01 level (two-tailed).

There is a general pattern for all methods and for both metrics (richness and PD)
when assessed across different resolutions, with estimates increasing from a ﬁne (0.2◦) to
coarse (0.6◦) resolution (Figures 3 and 4). Geographical distribution sizes from the differ-
ent approaches tend to converge with increasing spatial scale (Figure 2). However, spatial
resolution does not have a large effect on range-wide occurrence distributions (Figure 2).

Discussion
Our results show that, depending on the method used to estimate species distribution, the
outcome can be dramatically different. Of note, the SDM approach results in completely
different hotspots from the range-wide occurrences approach.

Range-wide occurrences had the lowest estimates, and it is likely that species distri-
bution is severely underestimated using this method. With advances in online databases
and sharing protocols, it is expected that museum records will eventually replace the dis-
tribution maps of the marginal occurrences approach. However, there is still a substantial
lack of data for many species. Our results show that, even for a reasonably well-studied
group such as the Australian marsupials, there are still some important areas missing from
sampling effort.

The statistical modeling approach attempts to compensate for the lack of sampling
by predicting the species geographical distributions. However, if an SDM does not
account for biotic or evolutionary factors that might limit species distributions then it is
likely to predict the fundamental niche instead of the realized niche (Hutchinson 1957;
Figure S1), leading to an overprediction of species richness. Some researchers have
shown that incorporating interspeciﬁc interactions can provide a more accurate model
(e.g., Ritchie et al. 2009). Even at macroecological scales, for which it was believed
that biotic factors would be diluted (Pearson and Dawson 2003), it has been shown to
improve the model (Araújo and Luoto 2007). However, incorporating this parameter into
the model requires knowledge that is usually not available. It is therefore important to
acknowledge that different statistical modeling inputs (Levine et al. 2009), different algo-
rithms (MacLeod et al. 2008, Echarri et al. 2009), or different thresholds (Liu et al.
2005) could possibly produce very different results. This is a topic that needs further
study.

Species geographical distributions estimated from statistical modeling tend to be
broader than those from the combined method, because we did not include biotic or evolu-
tionary factors in our analysis. However, the environmental relationships tend to be similar
between these two approaches with only slight changes in the relationships for wide-ranged
species (Figure S2).

Similar hotspots were obtained using the marginal occurrences and combined
approaches. These two methods show a correspondence in the estimates; however, some
caution is needed when using the marginal occurrences approach. Hurlbert and Jetz (2007)
argue that marginal occurrences need a minimum resolution of 1◦ for good quality mapping
and lower resolution distribution maps may result in overprediction. The great majority
of global extent studies use marginal occurrences (e.g., Schipper et al. 2008, Buckley
et al. 2010), usually at a 1◦ resolution. With the increase of computational power, the
unit of analysis could become ﬁner for broader extents; however, a certain amount of cau-
tion should be exercised when using hand-drawn distribution maps. Methods for reﬁning
marginal occurrence distributions exist but they are limited to data-rich areas (Araújo et al.
2005), well-known species (Niamir et al. 2011), or for small assemblages (Sangermano
and Eastman 2012), which is often not the case.

Our combined approach can be applied at ﬁner scales and broader extents. The resolu-
tion in this case is dependent on the quality of the sampled data. Using online databases for
statistical modeling is good because museums also provide historical and paleontological
distribution information. Conversely, however, these databases usually have considerable
variability of location precision (Graham et al. 2004).

With decreasing spatial resolution, species distributions estimated by the different
methods tend to become more similar (Figure 2). This results in more similar diversity met-
rics, with higher richness and PD estimates at lower spatial resolutions (Figures 3 and 4).
However, this comes at the cost of a reduction in the precision of the estimates due to a loss
of detail. When studies are undertaken at regional scales, for example, for conservation
purposes, the coarseness of such maps can result in higher costs for species conservation

(Franklin 2009). Even the most detailed, hand-drawn distribution maps do not capture the
patchiness of species distributions (Hurlbert and Jetz 2007) and using such data could lead
to spurious biological conclusions.

All approaches have associated limitations and errors (Table 3). We confront some chal-
lenging issues in each of these methods. Not least of these is the difﬁculty of validating the
results when true species richness is unknown. Our results show that completely differ-
ent outcomes can be obtained with different distribution estimation methods. The method
for estimating diversity metric should depend on the aim, the scale, and extent. In addi-
tion, despite the fact that richness and PD performed similarly for Australian marsupials,
this may not be true when considering other groups or when estimating different diver-
sity metrics. Metrics that incorporate species distributions into their measurement, such
as endemism (Laffan and Crisp 2003, Rosauer et al. 2009, González-Orozco et al. 2011),
should be further investigated.

Abstract

Spatio-temporal prediction and forecasting of land surface 

temperature  (LST)  are  relevant.  However,  several  factors 

limit their usage, such as missing pixels, line drops, and cloud 

cover in satellite images. Being measured close to the Earth's 

surface, LST is mainly influenced by the land use/land cover 

(LULC) distribution of the terrain. This article presents a spa-

tio-temporal interpolation method which semantically mod-

els LULC information for the analysis of LST. The proposed 

spatio-temporal  semantic  kriging  (ST-SemK)  approach  is 

presented  in  two  variants:  non-separable  ST-SemK  (ST-

SemKNSep)  and  separable  ST-SemK  (ST-SemKSep).  Empirical 
studies have been carried out with derived Landsat 7 ETM+ 

satellite images of LST for two spatial regions: Kolkata, India 

and Dallas, Texas, U.S. It has been observed that semanti-

cally enhanced spatio-temporal modeling by ST-SemK yields 

more  accurate  prediction  results    than  spatio-temporal   

ordinary kriging and other existing methods.

The increasing availability of spatio-temporal land surface temperature (LST) satellite data has invoked the need 

to analyze historical information to achieve better accuracy for LST prediction and forecasting (Deng et al., 2018; 

Lussana, Tveito, & Uboldi, 2018; Romaguera et al., 2018). LST is an influential factor for climate change, global 

warming,  urban  heat  islands,  drought,  and  other  environmental  threats  (Trigo  et  al.,  2011).  One  of  the  major 

challenges reported in the LST literature is the problem of handling missing pixels, line gaps, cloud cover, etc. in

satellite raster images (Chen, Huang, Chen, & Xu, 2017; Gerber, de Jong, Schaepman, Schaepman-Strub, & Furrer, 

2018; Weiss  et  al.,  2014).  This  work  uses  Landsat 7  ETM+  satellite  images;  Figure  1a  shows  a  raw  band  image 

(http://landsat.usgs.gov/) with line gaps. A magnified view is shown in Figure 1b, where small white patches of 

cloud cover are also visible.

To  generate  a  comprehensive  image  of  LST  for  further  analysis,  there  is  a  need  to  analyze  its  past  trends. 

Geo-statistical  spatial  interpolation  (Dixon  &  Uddameri,  2016)  is  a  popular  technique  in  the  remote  sensing  of 

LST which predicts missing pixels from the surrounding measured locations. The first law of geography (Tobler, 

1970) is the building block to model the dependency among the sampled locations in the interpolation process for 

assigning optimal weights. In traditional spatio-temporal interpolation, the weights assigned to the sample points 

depend  on  the  Euclidean  distances  and  the  temporal  measurement  lag  with  respect  to  the  prediction  point.  A 

trade-off analysis is needed between spatial and temporal scales to model optimal weights by the interpolation 

process. Variety exists among different techniques based on how pragmatically this spatio-temporal autocorrela-

tion is modeled.

Several  studies  have  been  reported  in  the  field  of  spatio-temporal  interpolation  of  LST.  The  performance 

of  the  methods  is  mainly  data-specific  and  application-dependent  (Foster  &  Evans,  2008).  The  following  para-

graph has identified some recent works on the existing spatial interpolation methods (such as inverse distance 

weighting  (IDW),  nearest  neighbors  (NN),  splines  (SP)  and  different  variants  of  kriging)  for  LST-based  applica-

tions. Spadavecchia and Williams (2009) compared three kriging methods: simple kriging, ordinary kriging (OK) 

and  kriging  with  an  external  drift  (KED),  with  a  baseline  inverse  distance  weighting  (IDW)  algorithm  (Shiode  & 

Shiode, 2011). They found KED to perform better in the estimation of maximum and minimum temperatures and 

precipitation  in  terms  of  mean  absolute  error  (MAE)  and  root  mean  square  error  (RMSE).  Chen,  Li,  Chen,  Rao, 

and  Yamaguchi  (2014)  applied  thin-plate  splines  (TPS)  to  sharpen  thermal  images,  which  is  useful  for  any  LST 

application, such as urban heat island assessment and drought monitoring. Carrera-Hernández and Gaskin (2007) 

analyzed  the  spatio-temporal  variations  of  temperature  and  rainfall  in  the  Mexico  Basin  and  their  correlation 

with elevation. They considered five kriging methods: OK, KED, block kriging with external drift, OK in a local 

neighborhood,  and  KED  in  a  local  neighborhood.  Estimation  accuracy  was  observed  to  be  improved  by  taking 

elevation as the auxiliary variable. Colombi, De Michele, Pepe, Rampini, and Michele (2007) proposed a numerical 

method  for  calculating  spatially  distributed  daily  mean  temperature  and  compared  it  with  the  IDW  interpola-

tion method. They obtained a satisfactory result, reporting an RMSE of approximately 2°C. Metz, Andreo, and 

Neteler (2017) combined temporal and spatial interpolation methods to reconstruct the MODIS LST images for 

central Europe and reported an RMSE of 0.5 K. They considered emissivity and elevation as the covariates for

the spatial interpolation. Yang, Wang, and August (2004) presented a method to estimate LST by calibrating four 

spatial interpolation methods using satellite-derived surface emissivity: IDW, spline, kriging and cokriging. They 

recommended kriging for LST interpolation if surface emissivity data are not available. Interpolation uncertainty 

was reduced here from 10 to 1.56°C after calibration. Xu, Wang, Hu, and Li (2013) introduced a novel technique 

called the point estimation model of Biased Sentinel Hospitals-based Area Disease Estimation (P-BSHADE) to in-

terpolate missing data in temperature data sets and compared it against three estimators: kriging, IDW and spatial 

regression test (SRT). They applied and validated the new method with an annual Chinese temperature data set 

and found better results than others. Hengl, Heuvelink, Tadić, and Pebesma (2012) presented an interesting idea 

of predicting LST in Croatia from MODIS LST images. They found that LST is a function of coordinate location, 

LULC, orography, precipitation, and industrial activities.

As identified in previous work (Bhattacharjee, Mitra, & Ghosh, 2014; Hengl et al., 2012), LST is highly influ-

enced by the LULC distribution on the Earth's surface (Hulley, Veraverbeke, & Hook, 2014; Tsendbazar, De Bruin, 

Fritz, & Herold, 2015). Similarly, the temporal change in LULC is also correlated with the temporal dynamics of LST. 

Hence, this auxiliary knowledge of LULC can be incorporated into the spatio-temporal LST interpolation process 

to achieve better accuracy. Here we have assumed that the amount of residual change in LST at a given location 

is introduced due to the temporal change in LULC. We present a new spatio-temporal interpolation method by 

extending  the  spatial  semantic  kriging  (SemK)  method  (Bhattacharjee  &  Chen,  2019b;  Bhattacharjee  &  Ghosh, 

2017), which is intended for LST mapping (Bhattacharjee & Ghosh, 2015b). The SemK-based interpolation method 

has been applied for the incorporation of LULC information into the prediction process of LST. LULC is considered 

as the semantic knowledge of the terrain, modeled by the processing of its ontology hierarchy (Bhattacharjee & 

Ghosh, 2014; Bhattacharjee, Prasad, Dwivedi, Dasgupta, & Ghosh, 2012). However, this method can be applied 

for any meteorological variable that is influenced by LULC dynamics. The temporal behavioral change of LULC is 

modeled as the change in “semantics” of the sample points and is incorporated into the prediction process. The 

proposed method belongs to the kriging family (Hui, Hu, Yevenyo, & Yu, 2016) and is referred to as spatio-tempo-

ral semantic kriging (ST-SemK). The major advantage of ST-SemK over spatial SemK is that the ST-SemK is capable 

of modeling time-series LST data; hence, it can facilitate forecasting. It is also better than SemK when sample den-

sity is low in the prediction time instance, but higher in the past. However, the performance of ST-SemK is highly 

dependent on the study region, and spatial autocorrelation, LULC–LST correlation, and the diversity of the LULC 

distribution (entropy) are the major contributing factors. Thus, while choosing the region of interest (RoI) for the 

empirical study, the LULC-based entropy analysis (Bhattacharjee et al., 2014), LULC–LST correlation study, and 

the performance evaluation lemmas (Bhattacharjee & Ghosh, 2015a) can be performed beforehand to check the 

suitability of ST-SemK for that particular RoI. The objectives of the proposed work are as follows:

•  to analyze the behavior of temporal semantic change of the LULC distribution and incorporate this behavior to 

model the residual LST change for each sample point;

•  to extend the traditional spatio-temporal autocorrelation model with the semantic LULC information and carry 

out the spatio-temporal prediction and forecasting of LST; and

•  to  compare  the  proposed  method  in  terms  of  accuracy  with  some  popular  spatio-temporal  interpolation 

methods.

This section presents a detailed description of the proposed ST-SemK approach. The spatio-temporal interpolation 

methods estimate the variable value Z at the location x0 in the prediction time instance t0 from the known sample 
points (xi, tai), where ith year ai ∈ {0, ⋯ , − ∞}. In this study, Z is LST, but can be any other variables, such as carbon 
dioxide or solar-induced fluorescence. However, the difference in spatio-temporal prediction and forecasting lies 

BHATTACHARJEE ET Al.4  |    

in the choice of the sampled data from different time instances. For prediction, the samples from the previous, 

present and following years can be chosen to gap-fill the raster images with missing pixels, line drops, cloud cover, 

etc. For forecasting, the sampled data should be chosen from the previous years only. Here  we choose present 
and past data for prediction in 2015. Hence, ai ∈ {0, ⋯ ,−10}. The theoretical interpolation estimator is modeled 
as follows:

̂Z(x0, t0) =

wiZ(xi, tai

), such that ai ∈ {0, ⋯ ,−∞}

(1)

N

i=1
∑

where  ̂Z(x0, t0) is the predicted LST value at the prediction point x0 at t0, Z(xi, tai
) is the measured LST value at the ith 
sampled location xi at tai, ai is either a present or past time instance. wi is the weight assigned to the sample point (xi, tai
) 
which forms the weight vector W for N interpolation points. Therefore, the weight vector is the function of spatial lag 

h and temporal lag t. The existing approaches of spatio-temporal interpolation are broadly classified into two catego-

ries: (a) separable (purely spatial and purely temporal models); and (b) non-separable (inseparable space-time trade-off 

model) (Yang et al., 2013). The components of spatio-temporal analysis are depicted in Figure 2.

For  the  separable  approach,  the  spatial  and  the  temporal  component  are  shown  separately  in  the  figure. 

However, for the latter approach, a non-separable component is shown as the “hypotenuse” of the spatio-tem-

poral  lag  triangle.  The  proposed  ST-SemK  is  implemented  for  both  the  approaches  as  separable  ST-SemK  (ST-

SemKSep) and non-separable ST-SemK (ST-SemKNSep). It follows the concept of time-forward kriging (Yang et al., 
2013) along the temporal and spatial axes and extends the first law of geography (Tobler, 1970) in spatial, tempo-

ral, and semantic dimensions. It assumes that the change in LST is the function of coordinate location, time, and its 

semantics (LULC). The process flow diagram of ST-SemK is depicted in Figure 3. The input to this framework is the 

spatio-temporal LST data, classified (supervised) LULC data, and the ontology hierarchy of LULC classes depicted 

in Figure 4 (Bhattacharjee et al., 2014).

First, for each of the interpolation points in t0, N sample points are collected from the present and past time 
instances. The traditional temporal, spatial semivariogram models (for the separable approach), or the spatio-tem-

poral semivariogram model (for the non-separable approach) are built by following the concepts of the traditional 

OK  method  (Snepvangers,  Heuvelink,  &  Huisman,  2003).  In  these  traditional  semivariogram  models,  the  spa-

tial semivariance (γ(h)), temporal semivariance (γ(t)), and spatio-temporal semivariance (γ(h,t)) of LST are plotted 

against the spatial lag (h), temporal lag (t), and the anisotropy ratio (α), respectively (Arslan, 2012). The first two 

models are implemented in the separable ST-SemK approach and the third in the non-separable approach. α is 

defined as (h/t), that is, spatial lag divided by temporal lag (for example, kilometers per year). This whole process of 

traditional semivariogram modeling is referred to as “Euclidean-distance-based spatio-temporal proximity” mod-

eling in Figure 3.

To model the “spatio-temporal change in semantic proximity” in Figure 3, the semantic metrics of spatial SemK 

(Bhattacharjee  et  al.,  2014)  are  extended  into  temporal  or  spatio-temporal  dimensions  (for  the  separable  and

non-separable approaches, respectively). Then the traditional semivariance and covariance scores are extended 

with these semantic metrics, which are used in the ST-SemKNSep and ST-SemKSep approaches. These approaches 
are further elaborated in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, respectively.

2.1 | Non-separable ST-SemK

In ST-SemKNSep, the space and time dimensions are made comparable to each other by defining an anisotropy ratio 
(α) to deal with different units and weighted distances along spatial and temporal dimensions. As reported in dif-

ferent literature, the separable model may suffer from some impractical hypotheses, which can be overcome by 

proper empirical estimation of the α value. Heuvelink & Griffith (2010) have  explained the notion of traditional 
“sum metric” model for the spatio-temporal semivariogram modeling, which is adopted by ST-SemKNSep. The semi-
variance (γ) of two sample points (xi,tai) and (xj,taj), h distance and t temporal lag apart, consists of three components 
as follows:

𝛾(h,t) = 𝛾(xi,xj)(h) + 𝛾(tai

,taj

)(t) + 𝛾[(xi,xj),(tai

,taj

)](h,t)

(2)

where 𝛾(xi,xj)(h) is a purely spatial semivariance, 𝛾(tai

)(t) is a purely temporal semivariance, and 𝛾[(xi,xj),(tai

,taj

,taj

)](h,t) is a spa-

tio-temporal semivariance where the two dimensions are made comparable with respect to α (see Figure 2). Evaluation 

of α between two dimensions is complex. This ratio can be empirically evaluated from the available sampled locations 
of the RoI. To make the proposed ST-SemKNSep process more pragmatic, the local anisotropy ratios can be calculated. 
This is because the α may vary (different semivariogram sills in different directions) with the group of sampled loca-

tions considered (Hengl et al., 2012; Snepvangers et al., 2003).

If CovST(Zi,Zj) is the spatio-temporal covariance between the sample points (xi,tai) and (xj,taj) with distance lag h 

and temporal lag t, and the space-time anisotropy ratio α, then CovST(Zi,Zj) is modeled as follows:

CovST(Zi,Zj) = Cov(h,t)

= Cov(h) + Cov(t) + Cov

h2 + (𝛼t2)

= ≤(𝛾(xi,xj)(h) + 𝛾(tai

Equation (3) indicates that the covariance is a function of semivariance which can be evaluated with the experimental 
semivariogram  models.  For  ST-SemKNSep,  the  traditional  spatio-temporal  covariance  matrix  (ℂST

2.1.1 | Evaluation of spatio-temporal semantic dependence

To evaluate semantic dependence in the non-separable ST-SemK approach, the two spatial semantic metrics of 

SemK (Bhattacharjee et al., 2014), semantic similarity and spatial importance, are extended in the spatio-temporal 

domain  (Bhattacharjee  &  Ghosh,  2017).  As  the  semantic  relations  between  the  LULC  classes  in  the  ontology 

hierarchy remain unchanged over time, the structure of the ontology remind constant over time. The ontology 

hierarchy consists of all possible LULC classes of every time instance and is exhaustive. The semantic similarity 

metric is dependent on the structure of the ontology. As the temporal lags among the sampled locations do not 

affect this structure, this metric does not need modifications for its spatio-temporal change analysis. Therefore, 

BHATTACHARJEE ET Al.    |  7

the process of evaluating the spatio-temporal semantic similarity will be the same as that of the spatial semantic 

similarity evaluation process in Bhattacharjee et al. (2014).

However, as the spatio-temporal importance evaluation process deals with correlation analysis with sampled 

LST data, the temporal lag is significant here. This is because the same locations on the Earth's surface may have 

different LST measures at two distinct time instances. To evaluate the spatio-temporal importance, the whole RoI 
is divided into k random zones. Given two sample points (xi,tai) and (xj,taj) with their representative LULCs fi and 
fj, k pairs of sample points are chosen for both fi and fj, but from different time instances, tai and taj, respectively. 
Therefore, the extended spatial importance metric is termed spatio-temporal importance (SIST), and for (xi,tai) and 
(xj,taj) it is modeled as follows:

where Ztap (fpq

Ztap (fp) is the average of the LST values of the LULC class fp over the k sample points at the time instance tap. Being a 
correlation coefficient score, it lies in [−1,1]. It is further normalized to a positive range to avoid the negative mapping 
of the covariances. Now, the total spatio-temporal semantic score for the pair (fi and fj) is given as SISST

larity metrics. The semantic covariance matrix ℂSemK

2.2 | Separable ST-SemK

ST-SemKSep facilitates spatio-temporal prediction and forecasting of LST. It attempts to estimate the trend compo-
nent and the residual component over the temporal axis. These two components approximate each past LST inter-
polating point (xi,tai
) to the prediction time instance t0 as (xi,t0). This is a purely temporal prediction process. Then 
the spatial semantic kriging is carried out with all the approximated (xi,t0)s to estimate the LST value at the predic-
tion point (x0,t0), which is a purely spatial process. Thus, the properties of ST-SemKSep can be summarized as follows.

•  The trend component captures the average behavioral change in LST over the temporal dimension.

•  The residual component deals with the change in LST that is due to the temporal changes of the semantics or 

LULC distribution of the terrain. This change is captured by building a three-dimensional (3D) temporal seman-

tic semivariogram model of LST.

•  With these two components, once all the interpolating points are approximated to the prediction time instance 
t0, the spatial semantic kriging is carried out by building a 3D spatio-semantic semivariogram of LST at t0 using 
all the approximated (xi,t0)s.

The general spatio-temporal estimation equation of ST-SemKSep is given by:

̂Z(x,t) = m(x,t) + 𝜖(x,t)

(8)

where  ̂Z(x,t) is the predicted LST value at each distinct (x,t), m(x,t) is the trend component (i.e., the deterministic part 
of the random variable), and ε(x,t) is the corresponding residual part. These two components are described further.

2.2.1 | Trend component analysis

Many variants of the kriging method have been reported in the literature, depending on how m(x,t) is modeled. 

The default approach is to assume that the trend is an unknown constant mean over space and time. As both OK 

and spatial SemK adopt this notion in the purely spatial domain, the proposed ST-SemK can be extended further 

in the temporal domain by adopting the same notion to model m(x,t). However, the assumption of constant mean 

over the temporal axis is not a very realistic approach as it assumes that the same LST trend is followed at every 

BHATTACHARJEE ET Al.    |  9

(9)

time instance. Furthermore, the temporal uncertainties associated with the de-trending process are not taken into 

account in some approaches, such as ST-SK (Snepvangers et al., 2003). The existing methods do not consider the 

temporal change in semantics, which indirectly affects the change in LST beyond its average trend. The proposed 

ST-SemK  method  models  the  trend  component,  which  is  a  function  of  location  and  time  (x,t).  In  addition,  the  

residual ε(x,t) models the additional change in LST due to the semantic change in the terrain.

In this study the m(x,t) analysis is carried out for the individual LST sample points. A predefined radius is con-
sidered against each past sample point (xi,tai). The Ntrend additional sample points are considered within that radius 
and their LST value is measured at every time instance, starting from tai to t−1 in the forward direction. A trend line 
then approximates this temporal behavior in the prediction year or beyond, which may also facilitate forecasting 
(see Figure 6). Thus, the trend component m(xi,t0) of the interpolating point (xi,tai
), approximated in the prediction 
time instance t0 is given by:

approximated average LST in the year 2015 by following the trend line of the past data, estimated by Equation (9).

where M is the pair of sampled locations within spatial lag h and temporal lag t.

Since ST-SemK first attempts to approximate each interpolating point (xi,tai

) in the prediction time instance t0 
as (xi,t0), the residual ε(x,t) is modeled by a purely temporal semivariogram with spatial lag h=0. Considering 0 and 
t lags in the spatial and the temporal axes respectively in Equation (10), the purely temporal semivariogram model 

of ST-SemK is given by:

As identified by ST-SemK, the representative LULC of a particular location may change over time. The residual 

ε(x,t) of LST should also capture this change in semantics of the terrain through temporal semivariance modeling. 
Therefore, the temporal semantic semivariance, γ(0,t,Δsemij), is given by:

𝛾(0,t) =

[𝜖(xi,tai

) − 𝜖(xi,tai

+ t)]2

where Δsemij is the semantic change of a sample point xi, due to its representative LULC change from fi to fj over the 
temporal lag t, and M is the pair of sampled locations that experienced this LULC change.

This temporal change Δsemij is evaluated by analyzing the ontology in Figure 4 with two metrics: temporal 
semantic similarity and temporal importance. The evaluation processes of both the metrics are different in ST-

SemKSep, compared to the ST-SemKNSep approach. As the structure of the ontology remains static over time, the 
change with respect to the temporal semantic similarity metric can be evaluated from the ontology itself. For this 
metric, the temporal change in semantics (ΔSSt
and fj at two different time instances tai and taj, is modeled by:

 are the total number of concepts in the paths of fi and fj in the ontology, staring from the root LULC. 

The mi and mj represent the number of matching concepts in the paths of fi and fj in the ontology (mi = mj).

However, the temporal importance between any pair of LULC classes evolves over time. Thus, the change with 

tai
respect to this metric is the change in correlation of a particular point xi, or its representative LULC classes (f
i  and 
tai
f
j ) over the time interval t. If the representative LULC class of the point xi changes from fi to fj over the temporal 
lag t, the temporal correlation score, SIt
ij  is defined in Equation (5). The semantic 
correlation score of the location xi is maximal when it is represented by the same LULC class over time interval 
t. This score is referred to as SIt
ii and is modeled by Equation (5). Hence, the change in the temporal importance 

ij, is modeled as SIt

ij , where SIST

The  total  semantic  change  (Δsem)  is  then  evaluated  over  time  interval  t  if  both  the  scores  are  non-zero 
(Bhattacharjee & Ghosh, 2015a). Once the temporal change in semantics is evaluated through the temporal se-

mantic similarity and the temporal importance metrics, a 3D temporal semantic semivariogram is modeled fur-

ther. The temporal semantic semivariogram captures the residual change in LST (ΔZ) over time and the change 
in  semantics.  An  example  temporal  semantic  semivariogram  for  the  Kolkata  study  region  is  shown  in  Figure  7, 

which is simulated using a few selected locations. The X-axis shows the inter-annual temporal lag (t) and the Y-axis 

shows the semantic change (Δsem). The Z-axis shows the corresponding temporal semantic semivariance scores

The semivariance score increases with the increment of temporal lag and the decrement of semantic score

(γ(0,t,Δsemij)), varying with respect to both time and semantics of the terrain. The details of experimental specifi-
cations are discussed in Section 3.3.

Following the characteristic of the temporal semantic semivariogram, the residual ε(x,t) of LST can be approx-

imated over the temporal axis for future time instances to facilitate forecasting. Finally, the LST value of each inter-

The covariance scores can also be modified directly by the semantic scores as both are similarity metrics. This model is 

further used to determine the experimental spatio-semantic semivariogram, the weights vector, and the LST value at 

the prediction process. The detailed mathematical modeling of spatial SemK is discussed in Bhattacharjee et al. (2014).

the spatial lag (h) between sample points at the prediction time instance t0 and the Y-axis is the same as that of 
the temporal semivariogram model (see Figure 7), representing the semantic change (Δsem). The semantic change

et al., 2014). The Z-axis shows the spatial semivariance score (γ(h)), varying with respect to both space and seman-

3.1 | Data specifications

An empirical experiment was carried out with the derived satellite images of LST to check the performance of the 

proposed method and compare it with existing popular interpolation methods. Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images 

(http://landsat.usgs.gov/) are considered for two RoIs, Kolkata and Dallas. The satellite images consist of seven 

spectral bands with spatial resolutions 30 m (for bands 1–5, 7) and 60 m (for band 6). The LST is derived from this 

band information in degrees Celsius (°C). We considered data for the years of 2005–2015, with prediction for the 

year 2015 being carried out by considering the time series input to the interpolation framework.

3.2 | Study regions

The Kolkata study region is located in the eastern part of India (central coordinate 22°34′N 88°22′E) (see Figure 9). 

The annual mean temperature of Kolkata is 26.8°C and the monthly mean temperature varies in the range 19–30°C. 

The Dallas study region is the largest urban center and the fourth most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. 

(central coordinate 32°46′N 96°47′W). This metropolitan area is shown in Figure 10. Dallas has a humid and hot 

subtropical climate with a mean temperature of about 39°C during summer and heat-humidity indexes soaring as 

high as 47°C. Both of the RoIs have very rich and diverse types of LULC distributions. Some common LULC classes 

for both the RoIs are: residential areas, commercial areas, waterbodies, vegetation, croplands, and industrial areas.

3.3 | Experimental specifications

To model the semantic properties of the terrain, the raw satellite images underwent classification separately. As 

the properties of every LULC class may change over time, different signature sets should be considered for dif-

ferent time instances. Domain expert knowledge was considered in order to identify the optimal classification 

properties. For each of the RoIs, five different zones were identified for further analysis. These zones are shown 

in Figures 9 and 10. The empirical study has the following specifications.

•  The total number of pixels in each zone of Kolkata is approximately 205 × 241. A minimum of 26 × 27 sampled 

LST pixels are randomly (uniformly random) chosen from each zone from 10 years of time series data, which is 

approximately one seventieth of the total number of pixels.

•  A predefined radius is considered against each prediction point for the selection of interpolation points.
•  For ST-SemKNSep, the space-time anisotropy ratio α is modeled for each of the zones separately. An example 
spatio-temporal semivariogram model for the spatial region Kolkata was shown in Figure 5. Here, the semantic 

scores are chosen in the same interval of 0.25 within the range (0,1]. Unique behavior is observed for every 

semantic  score,  which  also  supports  the  fact  that  different  change  in  LULC  results  in  diverse  temporal  LST 

changes.  All  the  semantic  semivariograms  are  normalized  to  the  original  range  of  corresponding  traditional 

BHATTACHARJEE ET Al.14  |    

semivariograms.  Another  example  experimental  semivariogram  plot  is  also  reported  for  the  ST-OK  method 

(violet dotted line) in the same figure. This method does not differentiate between the sample points in terms 

of their representative LULC classes, hence the semantic score between any pair of sample points is always 1, 

which is the same as no semantics or “None.”

•  The trend component of ST-SemKSep chooses Ntrend LST sample points against each prediction point within a 
predefined radius. Figure 6 shows the average LST behavioral change at a particular location in the Kolkata 
region over the years 2005–2014. It is modeled by taking Ntrend = 30 within a predefined radius.

•  An example temporal semantic semivariogram for the Kolkata study region is presented in Figure 7, taking a few 

random sample points of this region . In this model, 11 years of data (2005–2015, inter-annual) are considered, 

taking the period from mid-October to mid-November to avoid seasonal effects. Hence, the inter-annual tem-

poral lag (Δt) varies from 0 to 10 (on the X-axis). The semantic scores with respect to the change in semantic sim-
ilarity and temporal importance metrics (Δsem) vary in (0,1] (on the Y-axis). The temporal semantic semivariance 
scores are plotted on the Z-axis. The characteristic of this semivariogram in Figure 7 is that the model varies 

with respect to both time and semantic scores. With more temporal lag, the semivariance score increases up to 

a certain point and then becomes stable. A similar trend is observed for the discrete semantic scores. However, 

the changing pattern is different for different scores.

•  Example experimental spatio-semantic semivariograms of spatial SemK for both the study regions in 2015 are 

presented in Figure 8 together. This considers the satellite LST data from 2015. In this figure, both the RoIs 

can also be compared through their semivariograms. For example, at 8 km spatial lag and 0.5 semantic score, 

the  semivariance  scores  for  Kolkata  and  Dallas  are  3.66  and  2.42,  respectively.  Similarly,  for  identical  LULC 

classes (semantic score = 1) at 16 km lag, the semivariance scores are 3.36 and 2.30 for Kolkata and Dallas, 

respectively. These semivariograms are exponential and linear in nature for Kolkata and Dallas, respectively. 

It is observed for both the models that the semivariance score increases with the increase in spatial lag. These 

scores also vary with respect to the semantic scores. A similar trend is observed for every semantic score, but 

the change is different for different scores. The curve becomes stable beyond the range of spatial autocorrela-

tion (Bhattacharjee et al., 2014).

This section compares the ST-SemK method with some existing interpolation methods. The error measurement 

metrics, their significance, and a discussion on the comparison study are presented.

4.1 | Comparison study

For the comparison study, the ST-SemK (both ST-SemKNSep and ST-SemKSep) method is compared with some popu-
lar spatio-temporal interpolation methods (as reported by Li & Heap, 2011), such as splines with spatio-temporal 

data (ST-SP), nearest neighbors with spatio-temporal data (ST-NN), IDW with spatio-temporal data (ST-IDW) and 

OK with with spatio-temporal data (ST-OK) (Li, 2008). These four methods do not include the contextual LULC 

information in the spatio-temporal interpolation process. Four  metrics are calculated by comparing the predicted 

and measured  LST: MAE, RMSE (Bhattacharjee et al., 2014; Li, 2008), mean bias (MB) which represents the mean 

of the difference between the predicted and measured LST, and standard deviation of error (SDE)  where "error" 

represents the difference between the predicted and measured LST. For these metrics, the measured pixel values 
(Z(xi)) are compared with the corresponding predicted pixels ( ̂Z(xi)) of the validation samples, and the average error 
is calculated (for MAE and MB). However, the RMSE and SDE both represent the deviation of the LST predictor 

and error. The evaluation criteria and the significance of each metric are discussed in Li (2008). The basic idea of 

BHATTACHARJEE ET Al.the error metrics is to check whether the predicted values are similar to the measured values, hence the difference 

is less. Therefore, the lower the MAE and RMSE values, the better the model (Li, 2008). For a better prediction 

model, the MB should be closer to zero and the SDE should be low. For pictorial comparison of the predicted LST 

images with respect to the measured LST images, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR; Bhattacharjee & Ghosh, 

2017) is reported for each prediction method. The PSNR (in decibels) is a standard metric for predicted image 

analysis, which is a ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise. A 

higher PSNR indicates a better prediction model. The mathematical formulations of MAE, RMSE, MB, SDE and 
PSNR are defined as follows: in the Equations (16)–(20) respectively, where Z(xi) is the measured pixel value,  ̂Z(xi) 
is the predicted pixel value by the respective model, N is the number of sampled locations, μu is the mean of the 
error surface and MAXI is the maximum pixel value of the measured image:

Tables  1  and  2  present  the  comparison  of  different  spatio-temporal  interpolation  approaches  with  the  ST-

SemK for Kolkata and Dallas respectively, in terms of MAE, RMSE, MB, and SDE. The mapping images (measured 

and predicted) of LST for five zones of each of the RoIs are depicted in Tables 3 and 4. Each predicted image is 

compared with the measured image of the respective zone.

4.2 | Discussion

From  Tables  1  and  2,  it  is  evident  that  the  proposed  ST-SemK  performs  better  than  other  methods  for  both 

the RoIs. Though ST-SP, ST-NN, ST-IDW, and ST-OK are popular interpolation methods in the existing literature 

(Li, 2008; Li & Heap, 2011), they do not consider the LULC information of the terrain explicitly for LST change 

modeling. It is also evident from the results that in most cases, these existing interpolation methods give similar 

and comparable results for LST prediction in terms of MAE and RMSE. The differences exist in these methods 

based  on  how  they  model  the  spatial  autocorrelation/dependency  among  the  sample  points  for  LST  analysis. 

Their performance also depends on the spatial region of interest and the diversity of the terrestrial distribution 

(Bhattacharjee & Ghosh, 2015a).

It is also observed that for every zone, the most accurate interpolation method (excluding ST-SemK) is dif-

ferent. This is the reason for modeling the ST-SemK method as a generic framework to extend any interpolation 

method with semantic analysis. Again, both ST-SemKNSep and ST-SemKSep yield comparable results in most cases

in terms of MAE and RMSE. The corresponding PSNR values are also reported in Tables 3 and 4 for each of the 

predicted images by comparing them with the corresponding measured surface. To understand better, the PSNR 

values are compared graphically in Figure 11. The proposed ST-SemK reports the highest PSNR, ≈3–7 dB higher 

than other methods for both Kolkata and Dallas. The separable and non-separable approaches of ST-SemK yield 

comparable results. with ≈1 dB PSNR difference for both the RoIs.

For any spatial analysis with auxiliary information, it must be noted that the improvement of the estimation 

depends  on  the  covariates  and  their  correlation  with  the  primary  variable.  If  the  auxiliary  variable  is  strongly 

correlated with the primary variable, then only it can improve the analysis and would be useful to consider. Many 

works in the literature have already identified the correlation between LST and LULC and used one variable for 

the analysis of the other (Liu & Weng, 2009); Jiang & Tian, 2010); Tran et al., 2017); Fan, Rey, & Myint, 2017). The 

distinctive LST patterns are associated with the thermal characteristics of the LULC types (Xiong et al., 2012). 

Also, for the Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery, the land surface emissivity is often derived by the normalized difference 

vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds method, where the NDVI is an indirect representation of the LULC distribution

(Oguz et al., 2013). Therefore, the LULC distribution of the terrain is generally correlated with the LST distribu-

tion if the considered LULC classes are more generic, for example, assuming all plantations, cropland, fallow land 

together as their generic class agriculture (refer to the ontology in Figure 4). Here, we show an empirical study in 

Table 5 to support it.

The LULC and LST distributions for Kolkata are analyzed to check whether the urban area is associated with 

high-LST zones and vice versa. The November 2015 data are chosen as this time instance belongs to the early 

winter season of the study region and does not exhibit any stress conditions. The same five zones as chosen in 

Figure 9 are investigated in terms of the mean LST within and across different LULC types. The five LULC classes 

that  we  have  considered  for  this  analysis  are:  (1)  waterbodies,  (2)  agriculture,  (3)  grassland,  (4)  wetlands,  and 

(5) built-up. The mean LSTs for each of these LULC types are evaluated and compared in Table 5. The second 

and third columns of Table 5 show the distribution of LULC and LST for the five zones in Kolkata. Pictorially, it 

is evident that, for every zone, the urban (built-up) area is associated with the high-LST pixels compared to the 

non-urban areas (such as waterbodies, agricultural land, vegetation or grassland). In the fourth column of the

on the X-axis. A higher PSNR represents a better model, and vice versa

table, the correlation study has been carried out for every zone separately and the difference in mean LST across 

different LULC types is studied. It is observed that the relationship among the LULC classes in terms of LST is in-

creasing from waterbodies to built-up areas. An exception is evident between the wetlands and built-up classes, 

mainly for zone 2, because most of the wetlands pixels are surrounded by the built-up pixels in this zone, such 

that it is difficult to distinguish these two classes. However, the increasing nature of the yellow linear trend line 

shows the general relationships among the LULC classes for every zone. Though the range of LST varies across 

the zones, the waterbodies are generally cooler than the plantation (agriculture and grassland) areas, followed 

by built-up areas.

The  performance  of  the  spatial  interpolation  method  is  highly  dependent  on  the  autocorrelation  of  the 

sampled location with respect to the prediction variable. Additionally, the performance of ST-SemK varies with 

the amount of entropy in the LULC distribution of the terrain. For example, if there is a single LULC class which 

covers the entire region (such as snow cover, desert), the performance of ST-SemK will be exactly equal to that 

of ST-OK. In contrast, if the LULC distribution is highly diverse, ST-SemK generally yields more accurate results 

than ST-OK and others (Bhattacharjee & Ghosh, 2015a). Therefore, an analysis of the terrain entropy can be 

carried out before the actual interpolation, by following the lemmas in Bhattacharjee and Ghosh (2015a), to 

check whether ST-SemK is suitable for the given study regions and the application. Further, it is also evident 

from  the  spatio-temporal  analysis  literature  that  experimental  spatio-temporal  semivariograms  are  difficult 

to construct. However, for remote sensing satellite data, most of the Earth's surface is measured, producing 

plenty of observations. Therefore, for the application of LST interpolation using Landsat ETM+ satellite im-

ages, the use of ST-SemKNSep is appropriate. The non-separable approach may not always be a suitable choice 
where the number of sampled locations is limited and may lead to over- or under-estimation of the prediction 

variable.

Finally,  the  basic  SemK  framework  has  been  developed  as  a  generic  framework,  which  can  be  adopted  for 

other  variables  and  semantic  knowledge.  We  have  recently  applied  the  semantic  modeling  of  the  SemK-based 

interpolation method for the mapping of XCO2 (column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of atmospheric CO2) mea-
surements (Crisp et al., 2016) from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite (Bhattacharjee & Chen, 

2019a). The basic spatial SemK framework has been extended in a multivariate scenario to model these data sets 

together for predicting XCO2. Incorporation of LULC and other CO2 emission information into the interpolation 
process of XCO2 enhanced the prediction accuracy. We are now improving the method by modeling atmospheric 
dynamics  and  its  effect  on  CO2  emission.  This  supports  the  wide  application  of  the  SemK  framework  and  its 
variants.

The  ST-SemK method is motivated by the fact that the spatio-temporal LULC dynamics have significant impacts 

in deciding the patterns of land surface temperature. Both separable and non-separable variants of ST-SemK se-

mantically analyze the space-time trade-off for assigning priority/weight to the LST sampled locations. From the 

empirical study, it is observed that ST-SemK yields more accurate LST prediction results than most of the popular 

BHATTACHARJEE ET Al.22  |    

spatio-temporal interpolation techniques in terms of four error metrics: MAE, RMSE, MB and SDE. ST-SemK also 

reports ≈3–7 dB higher PSNR for both the RoIs when compared with the mapping images of LST.

The prediction accuracy reported by the ST-SemKSep method is a little higher than ST-SemKNSep in some cases. 
However, the latter approach is less complex than the former. Therefore, depending on the required accuracy and 

the complexity specifications, either of the approaches can be chosen for the given spatio-temporal application. 

The  ST-SemK is a generic approach that can be applied to any meteorological variables influenced by seman-

tic  knowledge  of  the  terrain.  Moreover,  the  same  semantic  modeling  framework  can  be  applied  to  extend  any 

traditional interpolation method to its semantic extension. Though the method introduces additional overhead 

for incorporating auxiliary information into the interpolation process, the accuracy–complexity trade-off analysis 

proves the efficacy and the applicability of the ST-SemK method.

For  future  development  of  the  ST-SemK  framework,  we  want  to  combine  OCO-2  data  and  ground-based 

remote sensing CO2 data (Chen et al., 2016; Heinle & Chen, 2017)  with the LULC to  predict the missing pixels/
footprints of OCO-2 data (Bhattacharjee & Chen, 2019) . ST-SemK can be utilized to predict other variables’ miss-

ing footprints—for example, NDVI or solar-induced fluorescence (Bhattacharjee, Chen, & Rammig, 2019)—using 

relevant semantic knowledge, such as urban/population density.

ABSTRACT
Land cover mapping plays an important role for a wide spectrum of
applications that are ranging from climate modeling to food security.
However, it is a common case that several and partially conﬂicting land
cover products are available at the same time over a same area, where
each product suﬀers from speciﬁc limitations and lack of accuracy. In
order to take advantage of the best features of each product while at
the same time attenuating their respective weaknesses, this paper is
proposing a methodology that allows the user to combine these
products together based on a general framework involving maximum
entropy/minimum divergence principles, Bayesian data fusion and
Bayesian updating. First,
information brought by each land cover
product is coded in terms of inequality constraints so that a ﬁrst
estimation of their quality can be computed based on a maximum
entropy/minimum divergence principle. Information from these var-
ious land cover products can then be fused afterwards in a Bayesian
framework, leading to a single map with an associated measure of
uncertainty. Finally,
information
brought by control data can help improving this fused map through
a Bayesian updating procedure. The ﬁrst part of the paper is brieﬂy
presenting the most important theoretical results, while the second
part is illustrating the use of this suggested approach for a speciﬁc area
in Belgium, where ﬁve diﬀerent land cover products are at hand. The
beneﬁts and limitations of this approach are ﬁnally discussed by the
light of the results for this case study.

1. Introduction

Land cover products are commonly used in environmental sciences, where they are
employed as a central input for many applications. Among others, this includes carbon
exchange modeling (Hansen et al. 2000, Jung et al. 2006), ecosystem and biochemistry
modeling (Hurtt et al. 2001), climate modeling (Pielke et al. 2011), or forest growth and
productivity (Hansen et al. 2013). They are also of prime interest for vegetation phenol-
ogy monitoring (Zhang et al. 2003), ﬁelds production monitoring, and food security
(Atzberger 2013, Waldner et al. 2015). Despite of their inherent beneﬁts for those ﬁelds,
land cover maps often disagree with each other to various extents, and inconsistencies
are not exceptional when they are compared to national oﬃcial statistics (Fritz et al.
2011). These discrepancies are linked to the various ways in which they are build, along

with the various conditions prevailing during the acquisition stage. For remotely sensed
data, typical errors are linked to adverse atmospheric conditions (haze, clouds, etc.),
while classiﬁcation procedures are subject to confusions between various land covers
that share close spectral signatures (Fritz et al. 2010, See et al. 2015). These errors and
the lack of accuracy for the corresponding land cover maps may become an issue in
applications that rely heavily on the correct identiﬁcation of the various land cover types
(See and Fritz 2006, Fritz et al. 2009, Thenkabail 2015).

Among other possibilities,

like the integration of census data (Hurtt et al. 2001,
Cardille 2002), it has been advocated by various authors that this reliability issue could
be overcome by integrating expert opinions, and crowdsourced information has been
suggested as a way of improving the quality of land cover products (Gengler and
Bogaert 2016b). Generally, crowdsourcing information consists of collecting data by
volunteer citizens, who are usually not experts in the research ﬁeld they are investigat-
ing during the crowdsourced campaign. Due to this lack of expertise, using crowdsour-
cing information raises concerns about uncertainties attached to the collected data
(Haklay 2010, Goodchild and Li 2012, Comber et al. 2013, Hunter et al. 2013, Ali et al.
2014, Foody et al. 2014) and the observed inconsistencies between volunteers’ contribu-
tions (Comber et al. 2016). However, interest in crowdsourced data is growing, and such
data have already been used in a wide variety of spatial applications, ranging from
mapping ridership (Jestico et al. 2016) or winter road maintenance (Chapman et al. 2014)
to monitoring atmospheric conditions (Muller et al. 2015) or mapping the distribution,
abundance and presence of organisms in ecological studies (Dickinson et al. 2012).
Crowdsourcing information is currently seen as a way of improving land cover mapping
(Fritz et al. 2009, See et al. 2013), and studies are even focusing on how crowdsourced
data can be used as validation data sets (Fonte et al. 2015).

Beyond the use of crowdsourcing as an additional and alternative source of informa-
tion, another possibility is oﬀered by the combination of various existing land cover
products, with the aim of producing a fused improved land cover map (Jung et al. 2006,
Cardille and Clayton 2007, Fritz et al. 2011, Pérez-Hoyos et al. 2012, Vancutsem et al.
2013, Xu et al. 2014). Indeed, some land cover products focus on speciﬁc land cover
types, or they are designed to work ideally at a certain spatial resolution. As a conse-
quence, the quality of each product may vary depending on the land cover type and
spatial resolution one is considering, and it is not expected that a single one of these
products will outperform all others. Thus, depending on the speciﬁc land cover type one
is targeting, the choice of what is to be considered as the best product may diﬀer.
Moreover,
it is worth noting that products with a coarser resolution may be more
accurate than ﬁner resolution products are (Hansen et al. 2013, See et al. 2015); thus, a
land cover map should not always be discarded because of its coarse spatial resolution.
This makes the selection of a single product quite contentious and diﬃcult in general. A
way to overcome this is to fuse the various land cover products in such a way that the
beneﬁt of each product is preserved in the ﬁnal map, while at the same time, the
products’ respective limitations are mediated.

In this paper, we suggest a methodology that allows the user to integrate land cover
products even if no quality assessment is available. The added value of this study
consists in the way in information content oﬀered by each product is coded and the
how this information is accounted for in the integration, without including spurious

information. We show how the use of crowdsourced information and fusion of various
land cover products can be combined into a single uniﬁed framework thanks to a
minimum divergence and Bayesian data fusion approach. In the ﬁrst step, information
provided by each land cover map is coded in terms of inequality constraints concerning
the probabilities of the various classes, leading to a subsequent estimation of each land
cover product’s performance based on the maximum entropy/minimum divergence
principle (Wahyudi et al. 2013, Bogaert and Gengler 2014, 2017). Land cover products
are then fused to yield a single, ﬁnal land cover map that accounts for the information
provided by each product. This approach has already been successfully applied in
environmental sciences (see, e.g., Bogaert and Gengler 2014; Kolovos et al. 2016;
Gengler and Bogaert 2016b). By focusing on the case of land cover mapping in
Belgium, we show how this methodology allows the user to combine diﬀerent land
cover products, manage inconsistencies between maps and update the reliability of
each product using control data.

2. Theory and methods

This section brieﬂy describes a framework that can be used to process and combine
information provided by various land cover products. We ﬁrst show how the information
given by a single land cover product can be recoded in a reasonable and eﬃcient way to
provide a measure of uncertainty about this product, even when no quality assessment
is at hand. Should some quality assessment become available based on, for example,
control data, it will be shown how this can be used to obtain an updated estimation of
the product reliability with a classical Bayesian updating procedure. Finally, when several
land cover products are present simultaneously, we show how these land cover pro-
ducts can be combined through a Bayesian data fusion method for categorical variables,
leading to a ﬁnal land cover product with an associated uncertainty measurement. Only
the most fundamental results are provided here, as the technical details have already
been described in Gengler and Bogaert (2016b), where the goal was to code and fuse
crowdsourced volunteers’ opinions. The interested reader is thus referred to this paper
for an extensive presentation of the mathematical details.

2.1. Coding information provided by a land cover product

Let us consider the true (correct) land cover type Z observed at an arbitrary location as a
multinomial random variable with outcome z 2 1; . . . ; i; . . . m
g belonging to the set of
the various m possible land cover labels. Similarly, let us deﬁne L as the land cover type
the same location, with outcome
provided by a given land cover map at
, 2 1; . . . ; j; . . . m
g. Let us assume that this map is assigning the jth label at that
location. We will then consider that

f

f

P Z ¼ j L ¼ j
ð

j

Þ > PðZ ¼ ijL ¼ jÞ "i(cid:1)j:

(1)

Stated in other words, given that the map is assigning the jth label at that location, the
probability that the correct label is also equal to this label is higher than the probability
of any other label being equal to it. This is thought as a reasonable condition that we
expect to be fulﬁlled for any meaningful land cover map. We can generalize this result

S. GENGLER AND P. BOGAERT

further by considering the case of land cover maps that are targeting a single land cover
type corresponding to this jth label (e.g. forest vs. non forest, water vs. non water, etc.).
Thus, these maps are binary products, with only two possible categories, namely L ¼ j
and L(cid:1)j. In this case, we will then consider that

PðZ ¼ jjL ¼ jÞ >

PðZ ¼ ijL ¼ jÞ

Pm

i(cid:1)j

PðZ ¼ ijL(cid:1)jÞ > PðZ ¼ jjL(cid:1)jÞ

Pm

i(cid:1)j

(2)

(3)

or stated in other words, L ¼ j conveys the information that Z ¼ j is more likely than
Z(cid:1)j, while L(cid:1)j conveys the information that Z(cid:1)j is more likely than Z ¼ j. Any inter-
mediate situations where some labels are grouped together while others remain distinct
can be dealt with by working along the same lines, so this coding technique covers all
potential groupings of the m initial categories into a new set of n<m non-overlapping
categories.

2.2. Estimating probabilities from the maximum entropy principle

j

The coding method above only provides inequality constraints concerning the possible
values for the probabilities PðZ ¼ 1 L ¼ jÞ; . . . ; PðZ ¼ m
jL ¼ jÞ. Thus, denoting pijj ¼
PðZ ¼ ijL ¼ jÞ and grouping these probabilities in a vector p ¼ ðp1jj; . . . ; pmjjÞ0, we aim
to best estimate this p vector while simultaneously ensuring that all the inequality
constraints are fulﬁlled. This can be done by relying on a maximum entropy/minimum
divergence principle, as described in Bogaert and Gengler (2017). Without going into the
mathematical details here, it can be shown that this is equivalent to looking for p such
that the expected divergence E½DðpjjQÞ(cid:2) is minimized, where Q is the set of valid
probability vectors q (i.e. with probabilities in ½0; 1(cid:2) and summing up to 1) that fulﬁll
these inequality constraints, with

where DðpjjqÞ is the Kullback–Leibler divergence between p and q and where f ðqÞ is the
joint distribution of Q.The Kullback–Leibler divergence is a standard way of measuring
the distance between two distributions in information theory (Cover and Thomas 1991).
In other words, minimizing the expected divergence allows us to ﬁnd p such that we
minimize the loss of information when p is used to approximate the set of valid
probability vectors q fulﬁlling the inequality constraints. The use of the Kullback–
Leibler divergence is consistent with the maximum entropy principle. In our context,
the beneﬁt of this maximum entropy/minimum divergence principle is its ability to
estimate probability distributions based on the frugal information that these inequalities
constraints represent, without relying on extra modeling assumptions, that is by limiting
the need for information that is not directly sustained by the data at hand. Following

additional inequality constraints deﬁne a domain C of possible values for Q that restricts
this space S, so that S \C corresponds to the space of possible values for Q that fulﬁll the
conditions in both S and in C at the same time.

It is worth noting that this principle has already been successfully applied in other
environmental contexts, for example, to rebuild a probability table for predicting the
extent of a benzene groundwater contamination plume (Wahyudi et al. 2013), integrate
lithology information for predicting drainage classes in the Belgian Lorraine (Bogaert
and Gengler 2014), recode expert opinions when assigning a land cover type label
(Kolovos et al. 2016), combine crowdsourced data for predicting cropland occurrences
in Ethiopia (Bogaert and Gengler 2017) and integrate crowdsourced information with a
land cover product (Gengler and Bogaert 2016b). The interested reader is also referred

2.3. Fusing information from several land cover products

Several
land cover products, say r of them, may be available for a given location.
Applying the aforedescribed procedure will lead to r distinct conditional probability
; . . . ; qr. The information provided by each product can be accounted for
vectors q1
simultaneously rather than separately through a Bayesian data fusion procedure suitable
for categorical data (BDF/CAT). Theoretical aspects of this data fusion methodology have
been described in Gengler and Bogaert (2016a) and various applications in environ-
mental sciences can be found in previous studies (Kolovos et al. 2016, Gengler and
Bogaert 2016a, 2016b).

Assuming that there are r distinct land cover products L1; . . . ; Lk; . . . ; Lr, and
focusing on the speciﬁc ith label, this means that the conditional probabilities
PðZ ¼ i L1 ¼ j1Þ; . . . ; PðZ ¼ i
jLr ¼ jrÞ have been estimated separately. However, we
are interested in the single conditional probability PðZ ¼ ijL1 ¼ j1; . . . ; Lr ¼ jrÞ,
denoted hereafter as PðZ ¼ ijL ¼ jÞ, which combines all
information coming from
these various products. Basic probability calculus gives

to combine as many land cover products into a single ﬁnal product, for which the whole
distribution PðZ ¼ ijL ¼ jÞ "i ¼ 1; . . . ; m can now be computed. It is worth noting that
each probability ratio PðZ ¼ ijLk ¼ jkÞ=PðZ ¼ iÞ amounts to comparing the conditional
and non-conditional probabilities of observing a given label Z ¼ i when the assigned
label for the land cover product Lk is known or unknown, respectively. The more this Lk
product provides information about Z, the more these conditional probabilities will

diﬀer from the non-conditional ones. In contrast, when Lk does not convey information
about Z, the ratios will be equal to 1, and the eﬀect of Lk will be ﬁltered out from eq. (4).

3. An application for land cover mapping in Belgium

Based on the proposed methodology, this section will illustrate the method by which ﬁve land
cover maps available for a speciﬁc area in Belgium can be processed and fused. The aim of the
fusion is to produce an improved land cover map that preserves the best features of each
product, while at the same time, attenuating their respective weaknesses. These land cover
maps are as follows: (i) the Corine Land Cover (CLC) product, (ii) the Global Forest Change
(GFC) product, (iii) the Climate Change Initiative Water Mask (CCI-WM) product, (iv) the CCI
Land Cover (CCI-LC) product and (v) the Open Street Map (OSM) land cover product. CLC is a
European product that was last updated in 2012. It includes 44 land cover classes at a 100 m
spatial resolution (EEA 2007, CLC 2012). GFC describes globally forest losses and gains for the
period of 2000–2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 m (Hansen et al. 2013). It uses a mixed pixel
approach to estimate the fraction of the pixels in the forest. CCI-WM is a global mask produced
in the framework of the European Space Agency and the CCI. It describes inland and ocean
water for the period of 2000–2012 at a spatial resolution of 150 m (Lamarche et al. 2017). CCI-
LC is a product of the CCI led by the European Space Agency. It provides global information
about 36 land cover labels at a spatial resolution of 300 m. The product used in this study is a
map from the 2010 epoch (Defourny et al. 2016). Finally, OSM land cover product is a map
built from crowdsourcing information (Arsanjani et al. 2015). The map used in this study was
downloaded from the Geofabrik website (Geofabrik 2016). The initial nomenclature for the
CLC, CCI-LC and OSM products have been simpliﬁed for the purpose of our application; thus,
only four land cover labels are used here, namely: ‘Water’, ‘Urban’, ‘Forest’ and ‘Crop’. The GFC
product originally assigned an estimated probability of observing the ‘Forest’ label, but it will
be processed here as a binary product (i.e. ‘Forest’ vs. ‘non-forest’), where the ‘Forest’ label is
assigned to every pixel with more than 80% forest cover. The CCI-WM is also a binary product
(i.e. ‘Water’ vs. ‘No Water’) a nd is used‘as is’. The legend diﬀerences issue is not addressed in
this paper since we merged initial detailed legends (which, indeed, may diﬀer from one
product to another) into four main classes, namely crop, forest, urban and water. Once this
harmonization has been made, every land cover label refers to the same deﬁnition, including
the forest class. Figure 1 shows these ﬁve land cover products for our speciﬁc region of
interest, which is about 350 km2, is located around the city of Namur and includes part of the
Meuse river, 56 km southeast of Brussels, Belgium. It can be seen that while all these land
cover products aim at identifying the correct land cover over the same area, they do it at
diﬀerent spatial resolutions (from 30 to 300 m) and with diﬀerent levels of detail (two- or four-
label products). Moreover, they can also disagree with each other at a given location.

The methodology is ﬁrst illustrated by considering a situation in which no control
data are available over the region, so that there is no information at hand for assessing
the respective quality of these land cover products a priori. Following this, we sketch
how additional information provided by ground control data can be incorporated into
the process, allowing an improved version of the map to be drawn. As more control data
becomes available, this allows the user to account for them, with the beneﬁt of
continuously improving the quality of the ﬁnal land cover map. Only 100 control data
will be used here for the sake of illustration.

Open Street Map (OSM). The initial labels have been harmonized and simpliﬁed to four diﬀerent labels,
namely ‘Water’, ‘Urban’, ‘Forest’ and ‘Crop’. As CCI-WM and GFC are binary products, the composite labels
‘No water’ and ‘No forest’ have also been deﬁned. The white areas in (e) correspond to the absence of
labeling at the corresponding locations.

3.1. Coding information and estimating probabilities

The performance of a land cover product is not always provided along with the
corresponding land cover map. Even when it is speciﬁed, this information may prove
to be of limited beneﬁt if it is based on ground control data that were collected outside
the region of interest, where other conditions could be prevailing. For this reason, we

start by assuming that no speciﬁc information is currently available about the respective
quality and performances for the ﬁve land cover products that have been selected here.
When lacking speciﬁc information,
it was suggested to choose f ðqÞ in eq. (3) as a
uniform distribution (i.e. the standard Dirichlet distribution) over the intersection S \ C,
where S ¼ p : pijj;k 2 ½0; 1(cid:2);
is the unit simplex that deﬁnes valid prob-
ability vectors and C is the domain generated by the set of inequality constraints C for a
given land cover product L. As we are dealing with four diﬀerent labels and ﬁve distinct
land cover products, let us deﬁne the corresponding values for the i and k indexes as
given in Table 1.

Using eq. (3), from the maximum entropy/minimum divergence principle, we can
obtain the conditional probability estimates presented in Tables 2 and 3. One can
easily observe the symmetry of the results in Table 2, where the most likely label
corresponds to the label that was assigned by the land cover product, while other
labels are equiprobable. While the same symmetry properties are observed in
Table 3, the probability estimates are diﬀerent. As an example for the GFC product,
stating that j(cid:1)2 (or equivalently j ¼ 5) is much less informative than stating that
j ¼ 2. As a consequence, the contrast between the most probable class and the other
ones is much less marked. This also illustrates that the inequalities in eqs. (1) and (2)
convey diﬀerent amounts of information, and using such coding oﬀers a lot of
ﬂexibility to the user, depending on the information he or she is able to or willing
to incorporate for the estimation.

As a ﬁnal remark, it can also be noted that if there are no constraints to be fulﬁlled for
the conditional probabilities (i.e. there is no information at all to be accounted for), we
then have S \ C ¼ S in eq. (3), and the corresponding estimate for p is the uniform
probability vector (i.e. the centroid of the unit simplex), with p ¼ ð1=mÞð1; . . . ; 1Þ0. This
solution can be considered as the estimates for the non-conditional probabilities
PðZ ¼ iÞ, that are also needed in eq. (4). Again comparing the results from Tables 2

see that the probabilities for the GCF and CCI-WM products do not strongly depart from
these values when the ‘No forest’ and ‘No water’
labels are assigned, respectively,
thereby conﬁrming the weakest content of information compared to the situation
where the ‘Forest’ and ‘Water’ labels are assigned.

3.2. Combining land cover maps

Let us now consider the fusion of the various land cover products at a given
location, based on the conditional probability estimates in Tables 2 and 3 and
the labels assigned by these various land cover products at that location. The
requested conditional probabilities PðZ ¼ ijL ¼ jÞ are directly obtained from eq.
(4), where the non-conditional probabilities PðZ ¼ iÞ are all assumed to be equal
(see section 3.1) and PðL ¼ jÞ is a constant that does not need to be explicitly

computed, as we can rely on the fact that
i PðZ ¼ ijL ¼ jÞ ¼ 1. Doing this for all
locations leads to Figure 2(a), which maps the most probable label over the study
area, along with the corresponding probability for this label given in Figure 3(a);
this can be viewed as quantifying the conﬁdence we have for this choice. Indeed,
the lowest probability values typically correspond to locations where information
sources are discordant concerning the assigned land cover, thereby increasing the
uncertainty about the right choice to be made at these locations. The minimum
mapping unit of the fused map is expected to be the same as the general product
CLC, that is, minimum mapping unit of 25 ha. As no prior quality was supposed to
be available for the ﬁve land cover products used in the fusion process,
it was
assumed a priori that they all provided information of identical quality. This can be
revised as soon as control data become available, as we show below.

Let us illustrate how the probabilities are combined through eq. 4 with a
‘No
numeric example. Let us consider a speciﬁc location, where labels ‘Crop’,
forest’,
‘Crop’ and ‘No data’ are assigned by the CLC, GFC, CCI-WM,
CCI-LC, and OSM products, respectively. The probability of observing cropland at
this location is

where PðZ ¼ 1Þ ¼ 0:25 (the uniform distribution is a consistent choice for the prior as no
information is available about the respective occurrence of the four classes) and where
the values for each PðZ ¼ ijLk ¼ jkÞ can be found in Tables 2 and 3. Following the same
reasoning for the ‘Forest’ (Z = 2), ‘Urban’ (Z = 3) and ‘Water’ (Z = 4) classes, the complete
posterior distribution can be computed. For this speciﬁc location, we obtain p = (0.90,
0.03, 0.04, 0.03).

As a remark, it can be seen in Figure 1(e) that the case where a given land cover
product does not assign any label is easily handled by eq. (4), as this is equivalent
to stating that any labels are possible at that location; thus,
in our case, the
corresponding conditional probability is PðZ ¼ ijL5 2 1; 2; 3; 4

to PðZ ¼ iÞ, as L5 2 1; 2; 3; 4

Thus, the corresponding factor is ﬁltered out from the product; consequently, this
land cover product does not play a role in the ﬁnal result at that location.

To assess the quality of the various land cover products and the fused map, a
validation data set of 100 control data is randomly sampled over the area of interest
(62 of the data belong to areas where the OSM product does not assign any label; see
Figure 1(e)). Sampled pixels were classiﬁed by an expert based on Google Earth images
(2015). The observation area for these control points corresponds to the pixel size of the
fused map, that is, 400 m2. Thus, it is possible to obtain Table 4 that shows the total
accuracy estimates for the land cover products along with the concordance rates among
them. Clearly, binary products like GFC and CCI-WM, which target a speciﬁc label, exhibit
high total accuracies (93% and 99%, respectively) compared to more generic products
like CLC and CCI-LC (79% and 64%, respectively), but they are clearly not discriminant for
the other labels. The generic OSM product also exhibits a high total accuracy of 95%, but
it does not provide labels everywhere, and thus, it cannot be compared on the same
grounds. Finally, one can also see from Table 4 that the concordance rates between the
generic CLC, CCI-LC, and OSM products are in the 63–76% range, so they can disagree
with each other to a large extent. When all products are assigning the same label, this
label is always the correct one, but this only happens for 61% of the locations.

When it comes to the validation of the fused map (see Table 5) based on the most
likely label, the correct label is clearly identiﬁed for 78% of the control data, while for an
additional 9% of these control data, there is a probability tie (i.e. the correct label and
another label have the highest but equal probabilities). This last situation occurs when
all the following conditions are fulﬁlled: (i) the OSM label is not assigned; (ii) binary
products assign the absence of the speciﬁc label they are focused on; and (iii) one
generic product assigns the label ‘Crop’, while the other assigns the label ‘Urban’. Thus,
the total accuracy rate is in the 78–87% range, depending on how one is solving for

these ties. For the remaining 13% of wrongly labeled locations, it can be seen that 92%
of these correspond to cases where the correct label is the second most probable one. It
is worth noting that the methodology proposed in this paper provides a measure of
uncertainty, and errors of classiﬁcation occur when uncertainty is higher. Indeed, the
probability assigned to the most likely label is lower when errors are committed: the
average maximum probability is equal to 0.58 when the produced map fails to assign
the correct label without ambiguity, while it is equal to 0.88 when the correct label is
assigned. Although these probabilities should not be interpreted as surrogates for
accuracy, the results are illustrative of the possible usefulness of the probability informa-
tion obtained using this method. It is clear that the fused map makes consistent use of
the various land cover products that were combined. However, the variation in accura-
cies across land cover products (e.g. CLC and CCI-LC) undermines the assumption of
equal quality. By relying on a classical Bayesian updating procedure, however, we show
below how the maximum entropy/minimum divergence conditional probability vectors
that were used can be updated based on control data to adequately reﬂect the various
performances of the land cover products.

3.3. Updating probabilities using control data

Control data allow us to obtain information about the respective performances of
each land cover product.
Indeed, when control data are at hand, the quality of a
speciﬁc product can be assessed through a confusion matrix, where a probability of
assigning the correct label can be directly derived for each label (see, e.g., Olofsson
et al. 2014). Thus, more meaningful estimation of the various conditional probabilities
PðZ ¼ ijLk ¼ jkÞ can be provided; this,
in turn, allows us to give more weight to
reliable products at the fusion stage in eq. (4). To accomplish this, we suggest the
use of a standard Bayesian updating procedure, so that information provided by
control data can be integrated into the maximum entropy/minimum divergence
procedure. The interested reader may refer to section 2.2. of Gengler and Bogaert
(2016b) for more theoretical details; only the most important results are given below.
The procedure is then applied to our case study in the Namur area, using our set of
100 control data set to pursue this objective.

Let us start from the uniform Dirichlet distribution f ðqÞ that was used in eq. (3), where q is a
possible choice for the vector of probabilities that belongs to the domain S \ C, and where S is
the unit simplex and C the domain that corresponds to the inequality constraints related to
these probabilities. For a speciﬁc choice of q, any set of control data can be associated with a
multinomial distribution, N ,Muðn; qÞ, where N ¼ ðN1; . . . ; Ni; . . . ; NmÞ0
is the vector of
counts for each label among the n relevant control data, with N1 þ (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4) þ Nm ¼ n. For our
100 control data, Table 6 gives the counts for the various labels for each land cover product. As
an example, focusing on the assigned ‘Crop’ label (j1 ¼ 1) for the CLC product (k ¼ 1), the
counts for the four labels are n ¼ ð27; 6; 3; 0Þ0, so that there are n ¼ 36 control data that were
assigned the label j1 ¼ 1. Thus, assuming a given choice for the probabilities q ¼ ðq1; . . . ; q4Þ0
of observing these labels when j1 ¼ 1, it is possible to compute the probability of observing
these counts from the general formula of the multinomial distribution, with

This updated distribution f ðqjN ¼ nÞ can then be used instead of f ðqÞ in eq. (3),
providing new probability estimates for p.

Using this method for all land cover products and all assigned labels yields the new
probability estimates in Table 7. In contrast with results in Tables 2 and 3, the values for
these probabilities will depend on the control data, and they will change if either new or
other control data are used in eqs. (9) and (10). Looking again at the CLC product (k ¼ 1)
as an example, and the assigned ‘Crop’ label (j1 ¼ 1), the initial probability estimates
from Table 2, where p ¼ ð0:607; 0:131; 0:131; 0:131Þ0, favor ‘Crop’, while other labels
have the same probability. Based on the control data n ¼ ð27; 6; 3; 0Þ0 in Table 6, the
‘Crop’ label is indeed the most frequently assigned one, but other labels do not appear
with the same frequencies. For example, ‘Forest’ was assigned six times while ‘Water’
was never assigned. As a consequence, accounting for this information leads to new
probabilities p ¼ ð0:72; 0:17; 0:09; 0:02Þ0

higher than before, while the probability of ‘Water’
is now much lower than the
probability of ‘Forest’. Should new or other control data become available, these prob-
ability estimates can be modiﬁed accordingly.

A new map is obtained by fusing the ﬁve land cover products now that the probability
estimates account for the control data (see Figure 2(b) and 3(b)). Clearly, the CCI-LC
product – which exhibits low performance when compared to the other products –
does not aﬀect this ﬁnal map as much as it did the previous one (see, e.g., the ‘Crop’-
labeled border for the superimposed rectangle in Figure 2). It is worth noting that the
probability ties are now solved. As an example, pixels initially labeled as ‘Urban’ (randomly
selected between the ‘Urban’ and ‘Crop’
labels, since they had equal probabilities of
occurrence) are now unambiguously labeled as ‘Crop’ for the superimposed rectangle in
Figure 2. These correspond to the case where CLC, GFC, CCI-WM and CCI-LC assign the
‘Crop’,
is
assigned). Since CLC is more reliable than CCI-LC according to the control data at hand,
it has greater weight in the fusion (see Table 8), and the ﬁnal result now favors ‘Crop’
accordingly. As a ﬁnal remark, we also observe a general decrease in the uncertainty at
each location. This is clear for locations where the more reliable products are consistent as
illustrated in Table 8. Locations with discordant information between CCI-LC and the other
products lead to the same observation.

However, fusing multiple data sources does not automatically lead to decreased
uncertainty. In our study, 88% of the map is estimated as more reliable when accounting
for the control data, while the remaining 12% leads to increased uncertainty. These last
cases include switching from an incorrect label assignment to a correct one. As an
example, let us focus again on the superimposed rectangle in Figure 2. In this area, small

forest patches are detected at places where the fused map initially assigned the ‘Crop’
label. For one of these locations, CLC, GFC, CCI-WM and CCI-LC assign the ‘Crop’, ‘Forest’,
‘No water’ and ‘Crop’ labels, respectively (while no OSM label is assigned), the initial
fused distribution yields the highest probability for the ‘Crop’
label (see Table 9).
However, taking into account the control data, this switch to the (correct) ‘Forest’
label occurs because the GFC product is considered eﬃcient when assigning the
‘Forest’ label, and this assignment now outweights the previous ‘Crop’ assignment by
the CLC and CCI-LC products. Even if uncertainty did slightly increases in this case, these
forest patches are now correctly labeled, as it can be seen by referring to Figure 4, in
which the patches are easily visible.

4. Discussion and conclusions

Land cover mapping is of major importance in environmental sciences, and many
applications require high-quality land cover products – that is, products that correctly
label the various land covers over a given geographical area. However, a common
situation users are facing is that several land cover products need to be accounted for
at the same time over a same area, as each product has its speciﬁc strengths and
weaknesses. For example, binary products typically outperform more generic, non-
binary ones when it comes to correctly labeling a speciﬁc land cover, as they have
been designed for this task; however, at the same time, they fail to provide discriminant
information about other land covers. Moreover, even if land cover products exhibit
reasonably good performance in general, it is not rare for them to disagree with each
other for the same location. Thus, the user must face the diﬃcult choice of selecting
what is supposed to be the most probable label for each location, for example, by

referring to the supposedly best product. This situation is made even more complicated
in that it is common for land cover products’ performances to be undocumented over
an area of interest.

To overcome these problems, this paper has proposed a consistent approach where
(i) the quality of each product can ﬁrst be assessed thanks to maximum entropy/
minimum divergence principles, while (ii) these products can be combined later using
a Bayesian data fusion procedure. Should control data also be available,
it is even
possible to (iii) further improve this fused map by accounting for control data using a

Bayesian updating approach. Based on a case study for an area located around the city
of Namur in Belgium, the use of this three-stage methodology has been illustrated, and
some general conclusions can be drawn.

At the ﬁrst stage, an interesting feature of this approach is its ability to provide an
estimate for the performance of a given land cover product when no information is initially
at hand. This was done here by coding the information provided by a given product in terms
of inequality constraints on conditional probabilities. Interestingly, when a product does not
convey information about all possible labels but focuses instead on some of them (e.g. for
the binary products in this study), this naturally leads to diﬀerent coding and diﬀerent
uncertainty assessments that are consistent with common sense. For a binary product that
targets a speciﬁc label, this yields diﬀerent uncertainty estimates from those obtained for a
more generic product that account for all labels on the same ground, as illustrated in Tables
2 and 3. This speciﬁc study focused on four labels, namely ‘Crop’, ‘Forest’, ‘Urban’ and
‘Water’. It is worth noting that if one is interested in a ﬁner level of classiﬁcation, uncertainty
will logically rise with the number of classes considered. Broadly speaking, the more classes
there are, the higher the uncertainty is about the correct label.

When it comes to the second stage, the need for combining the various land cover
products is also clear from Table 4, as it can be seen that no single product outperforms the
others. Indeed, the best products with respect to the overall accuracy criterion are GCF, CCI-
WM and OSM, but GCF and CCI-WM are binary products that fail to provide information for
discriminating the ‘No forest’ and ‘No water’ labels, respectively, while the OSM product
does not label a large part of the study area at all. Moreover, the agreement rates between
these various products (excluding the GCF and CCI-WM binary products in this comparison)
range from 63% to 76%. Thus, combining these land cover products by accounting for their
respective quality is clearly a way to improve the quality of the single ﬁnal land cover map.
The proposed methodology does not address speciﬁc issues, like scale problems, legend
diﬀerences or mixed-pixels. No legend diﬀerences appear in our data after the harmoniza-
tion step into four main classes; each land cover product is resampled at a spatial resolution
of 20 m, following the decision rules described in Radoux and Bogaert (2017), so that no
scale or mixed pixels problems arise here. Clearly, those issues may naturally arise when the
purpose is to combine information sources. However, they are not speciﬁc to our method
compared to other possible fusion methods. Our goal here is to present the way information
content should be coded to assure that no information is inadvertently assumed.

Depending on whether control data are available, the last stage can be used for
further improve the quality of the fused map. As more control data become available,
the Bayesian updating procedure will lead to conditional distributions that increasingly
rely on this factual information, as seen from a comparison of Tables 2 and 3 (which only
rely on the estimates from the ﬁrst stage), on the one hand, and Table 7 on the other,
where the speciﬁc information provided by the control data about each land cover
product has now been accounted for. Clearly, should the control data results be diﬀerent
from those used here in Table 6, the results in Table 7 would change accordingly, so this
updating stage covers the whole spectrum of possible situations where, on one side,
there is no control data at all (i.e., only stages (i) and (ii) are needed), and on the other
side, the control data are so numerous that the conditional distributions would closely
approximate those that one could directly estimate from the confusion matrix; that is,
the results would no longer depend on those obtained by the end of the ﬁrst stage.

Thus the obtained results honestly translate the respective importance of the prior
information (as derived from the ﬁrst stage) and factual information (as coming from
control data). The results of our case study show that accounting for control data leads
to a general decrease in uncertainty and will lead to non-trivial results. This is most
clearly illustrated in situations where several medium-performance products are assign-
ing a wrong ‘No forest’ label, while the binary GFC product is assigning the ‘Forest’ label.
Due to the high performance of the GFC product when assigning the ‘Forest’ label in
comparison with other products, it overrules the others. Thus the GFC product plays an
important role in correctly labeling the forest patches that now appear in the ﬁnal map,
although they were missing in several products.

As a ﬁnal remark – although this was not illustrated in the present paper – it is also
clear that having the full vector of conditional probabilities for the fused map available
at every location is beneﬁcial in several ways. First, there is the quality of the choice that
one is making for labeling the fused map, as this probability vector allows the user to
employ the best labeling, and at the same time, quantify the quality of this labeling at
every location. This allows him or her to obtain a clear view of the product quality over
the whole area (as in Figure 2), where the maximum probability can be viewed as a
quality index associated with the labeling procedure that consists of selecting the most
probable label (as in Figure 1). A second beneﬁt is that it provides an approach to better
designing possible subsequent sampling campaigns over the area, as targeting areas
where the uncertainty is higher is a way of optimizing the cost-beneﬁt ratio of these
campaigns.

Although one cannot pretend that the methodology that was advocated in this paper
will be capable of dealing with all possible situations that one can face when it comes to
combining various land cover products, it proved to be mathematically tractable and
practically beneﬁcial based on the real case study that was processed, which involved no
less than ﬁve land cover products that, in two cases, focused on speciﬁc land covers.
Thus, we think that this methodology deserves serious attention, as it has a signiﬁcant
potential for subsequent applications in this ﬁeld.

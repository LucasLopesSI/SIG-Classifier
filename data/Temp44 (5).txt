ABSTRACT
Cellular automata (CA) models are widely used to simulate land-
use changes because of their simplicity, ﬂexibility,
intuitiveness
and ability to incorporate the spatial and temporal dimensions of
processes. A small number of CA-based models have been devel-
oped to simulate changes in multiple land uses, most of which use
the hierarchical allocation strategy and/or inertia factors to enable
these CA models to do so accurately. However, only some of these
models allow explicit determination of the allocation sequence for
active land uses according to the hierarchical allocation strategy
and the objective calculation of inertia factors. In this paper, we
proposed a CA-based model,
the LAND System Cellular
Automata model for Potential Eﬀects (LANDSCAPE), with a hier-
archical allocation strategy and resistances, to simulate changes in
multiple land uses. Furthermore, we introduced eﬀective ways to
objectively determine the allocation sequence for active land uses
and calculate resistances for individual land uses. The results show
that the LANDSCAPE model, with a calibrated allocation sequence
and resistances, is reliable and accurate for simulating multiple
land-use changes.

1. Introduction

Simulating changes among multiple land uses plays an important role in understand-
ing human–environment interactions. A high number of land-use change models
have been developed to simulate multiple land-use changes, but many lack the
advantages of cellular automata (CA)-based models such as ﬂexibility, good perfor-
mance of process simulation and neighbourhood eﬀects. As one of the most widely
used land-use models, the Conversion of Land Use and its Eﬀects (CLUE) model is
successful in simulating changes in multiple land uses (van Asselen and Verburg 2013,
Verburg et al. 2013). However, the CLUE model only has logistic regression as an
option for model calibration (Renwick et al. 2013, Strck et al. 2015), which is a
hindrance for
land allocation in CLUE is
land uses (Britz et al. 2011, Hellmann and
based on suitability maps of individual
Verburg 2011), which may result in false demonstration of land-use changes. For
example, a plot of land with higher suitability as grassland than a built-up area has a

greater chance of being converted to a built-up area in reality, since built-up land use
is more aggressive than grassland in the land system. Land-use models, such as
LandSHIFT (Schaldach et al. 2011) and the Nexus Land-Use model
(Souty et al.
2012), are used to demonstrate changes in multiple land uses. However, the neigh-
bourhood eﬀect is ignored in most of these models. Generally, few land-use change
models used to simulate changes in multiple land uses are as ﬂexible and process-
oriented as the CA-based model.

Numerous CA-based models have been developed over the past two decades and
have been successful in urban expansion simulation (Xie 1996, White and Engelen 1997,
Liu et al. 2008a, 2014). Since the ﬁrst CA-based model was developed for urban growth
modelling (Batty and Xie 1994), the approach has rapidly proliferated at various scales
(Jantz et al. 2010, Poelmans and Van Rompaey 2010, Sant et al. 2010, Thapa and
Murayama 2011, Seto et al. 2012, Veerbeek et al. 2015). Meanwhile, CA-based models
for urban expansion simulation have been improved in the aspects of transition rules,
neighbourhood eﬀects and cell segments. The transition rules in CA-based urban
expansion models are calibrated based on diﬀerent statistical methods and intelligent
algorithms, such as logistic regression (Chen et al. 2014), artiﬁcial immune systems (Liu
et al. 2010b), the Kalman ﬁlter (Zhang et al. 2015), the gravitational ﬁeld model (He et al.
2013), artiﬁcial neural networks (Li et al. 2013), kernel-based learning methods (Liu et al.
2008b), memetic algorithms (Veerbeek et al. 2015) and decision tree algorithms (Anon.,
Ke et al. 2015). Furthermore, the neighbourhood eﬀect of CA-based model has been
proved and used to calibrate CA-based models for simulating urban expansion
(Geertman et al. 2007, van Vliet et al. 2013). Moreover, the shape and size of cells is
also an attractive feature of CA-based urban expansion models (Hiyoshi et al. 2014,
Dahal and Chow 2015). All of these studies show that CA-based models have been
successfully used to simulate urban expansion.

Some CA-based models were developed to demonstrate the change in multiple land
uses (White and Engelen 1997, Barredo et al. 2004, Li et al. forthcoming, Liu et al.
forthcoming). White and Engelen (1993) developed a CA model which can simulate
changes of four land uses to investigate basic questions of urban form. To ensure time
eﬃciency, a hierarchical strategy for allocating multiple land uses was deﬁned, which
speciﬁed that cells could only be transformed from a state with lower inertia to that with
higher inertia. For example, housing cells cannot be converted to vacant cells. In their
subsequent research (White and Engelen 1997), land uses were deﬁned as active land
uses and ﬁxed land-use features. An active land use can be converted to another active
land use, while the ﬁxed land-use features may aﬀect the transition of active land uses
but cannot themselves be changed. Furthermore, inertia factors were introduced in their
new model to increase the likelihood that a cell will remain in its current state.
Subsequently, the ideas of deﬁning active land uses and ﬁxed land features were
broadly used in simulating changes in multiple land uses (Barredo et al. 2003, 2004).
In general, both hierarchical allocation strategies and inertia factors play essential roles
in CA-based models used to simulate changes in multiple land uses.

Despite their importance for accurate simulation, the allocation sequence for active
land uses as well as the inertia factors for individual land uses are seldom clariﬁed in
existing research. Therefore, we propose a CA-based model, LAND System Cellular
Automata model for Potential Eﬀects (LANDSCAPE), which is based on the concepts of

both hierarchical allocation strategy and resistances. More importantly, we propose
methods for ranking the allocation sequence for active land uses as well as calculating
resistances for all land uses in the model.

2. Study area and data sources

2.1. Study area

The proposed LANDSCAPE model was tested in Wuhan, a densely urbanized and large
city in central China (Figure 1). According to the statistical yearbook of Hubei province,
the population of Wuhan reached 10.2 million in 2013, and over 80% of its population
lives in urban areas. Wuhan is located to the east of Jianghan Plain and the junction
point of Yangtze River and Han River, which makes it a productive agricultural area. Of
the total area of 8494 km2, the intensive cropland accounts for 5230 km2. Moreover,
Wuhan is the pilot area for China’s resource-saving and environmentally friendly society.
Thus,
land competition among ecological conservation, agricultural production and
urban expansion has become increasingly severe in Wuhan. It is necessary to understand
the processes of land-use change in this area, in both the past and the future. In this

2.2. Data sources

land use,
Five data sets were needed to calibrate the LANDSCAPE model (Table 1):
terrain, accessibility, soil and meteorological data. The land-use data had three roles in
the modelling exercise: (1) revealing the relationship between location suitability for
individual land uses and the inﬂuential factors; (2) representing the initial land-use map
for the simulation; and (3) providing a benchmark for model calibration. Accessibility
data, terrain data, soil data and meteorological data were used as inputs for the support
vector machine (SVM) algorithm to derive a relationship between suitability of locations
for each land-use type and the characteristics of the locations.

Land-use data were available in 2005 and 2013, representing seven land uses (crop-
land, forest, grassland, river, wetland, rural settlements and urban area). Among these
land uses, the river remained static since the observed land-use maps showed that the
location and area of the river was almost unchanged from 2005 to 2013. The land-use
data from both 2005 and 2013 have a spatial resolution of 30 m and were obtained from
the land-use database of the Data Centre of Resources and Environment, Chinese
Academy of Science (Liu et al. 2010a). Since the maximum size of the land-use data in
the current LANDSCAPE model is 4000 × 4000 cells, the land-use data in this research
were resampled to a spatial resolution of 100 m using the majority rule.

Accessibility data were used to calculate the accessibility of locations, which was used
in the suitability maps. There are six types of transportation networks, including railways,
highways, national roads, provincial roads, main roads and minor roads. All transporta-
tion network data sets were extracted from the Traﬃc Atlas of Wuhan as follows: (1) the
Traﬃc Atlas of Wuhan was scanned to produce digital images; (2) the images were
registered to the spatial reference of land-use maps; (3) the registered images were

digitized to obtain transportation data sets for each road type; and (4) distance raster
data sets for each road type were calculated based on their Euclidean distance.

Two types of terrain data sets were used in this research, representing elevation and
slope; both were used for calculating the suitability maps. The Digital Elevation Model
(DEM) data set was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM), which is a
joint mission conducted by NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of
USA) and NGA (USA National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency). The spatial resolution of the
SRTM DEM in the study area is 90 m. A slope data set was derived from the SRTM DEM data
set using the Slope function in ArcGIS. Finally, both elevation and the slope data set were
resampled to a spatial resolution of 100 m to match the spatial resolution of the land-use
data sets.

Soil data sets are essential to assess agricultural suitability in land-use change simula-
tion. Thus, soil data sets were collected, including soil types, soil phosphorus content and
soil nitrogen content, from the China Soil Database (gis.soil.csdb.cn). All of the original soil
data sets were in shapeﬁle format with a measurement scale of 1:1,000,000. To match the
format and spatial resolution of the land-use data sets, soil data sets were converted from
shapeﬁle formats to rasters with a spatial resolution of 100 m.

Meteorological data sets play important roles in agricultural suitability. Thus, we obtained
meteorological data sets, including daily observed precipitation and temperature data from
1981 to 2010 from the ground meteorological observatory in Hubei Province. Then, the
kriging function in ArcGIS was employed to derive raster data sets with a spatial resolution
of 100 m for both annual average accumulated temperature and annual precipitation.

3. Methods

3.1. Overall framework of the LANDSCAPE model

The overall framework of the LANDSCAPE model is shown in Figure 2. Iterative steps in a
simulation can be calculated by the demand of each land use and the maximum number
of changing cells in each step. The demand of each land use is determined by socio-
economic demands, or land-use planning. The maximum number of changing cells in
each step is a parameter for the trade-oﬀ of simulation accuracy and time consumption.
The smaller the maximum number of changing cells, the more accurate and time-
consuming the simulation.

In each iterative step, a hierarchical allocation strategy was employed to simulate
changes in multiple land uses. According to this strategy, land uses would be allocated
in sequence according to their capacity to be transferred from other land use.
Speciﬁcally, the most aggressive land use indicates the highest priority of the allocation
sequence, and less competitive ones are allocated successively.

For each active land use, the transfer probability is determined by both suitability and
resistance. Suitability indicates the suitability degree of a location for the targeted active
land use and is determined by its driving forces. Resistance represents the diﬃculty of
transferring a particular land-use type to a diﬀerent state, which is determined by the
original land-use map and resistance coeﬃcient for each land-use type.

3.2. Hierarchical allocation strategy

In the LANDSCAPE model, land uses are categorized into two groups based on the
relationship with human demands: active and passive. Speciﬁcally, active land uses
indicate that land-use changes are directly driven by human demands, such as urban
land and cropland. In contrast, land uses such as grassland and wetland are regarded as
passive because their changes are driven by urban growth and/or agricultural expan-
sion. Changes in active land uses are driven by human demands for residence, food and
recreation, whereas changes in passive land-use result from active land-use changes.

According to the categories of active and passive land use described earlier, land uses are
allocated in two interactive processes in the LANDSCAPE model: changes in active land uses
driven by human demands and changes in passive land uses driven by active land-use
changes. On the one hand, active land uses are allocated hierarchically based on their
sequence of aggressiveness. On the other hand, when active land uses expand, passive land
uses are occupied by active land uses according to the suitability and resistances. When
active land uses shrink, their corresponding locations would be occupied by a passive land
use based on the suitability of the location for each passive land use. For example, active
land uses expand or shrink actively according to the demands of human activities, while
passive land-use areas would be occupied as a consequence of active land-use changes.

Active land uses are allocated hierarchically based on their allocation sequence in the
LANDSCAPE model. In many developing areas, urban land will mainly be allocated based
on its suitability in priority for its highest aggressiveness across the entire land system.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

Speciﬁcally, the land use with the highest conversion ability will be allocated ﬁrst,
followed by the remainder. For each active land use, the allocation can only occupy
passive land uses or active land uses with lower aggressiveness. For example, in most
it is possible for all other land uses to be transferred to urban land
circumstances,
because urban land has the highest priority in the allocation sequence. In contrast, there
is little chance that urban land will be transformed into agricultural land.

The allocation sequence varies among diﬀerent stages of land use. Land-use transition
follows a particular sequence: from pre-settlement natural vegetation to frontier clearing,
then to subsistence agricultural and small-scale farms, and ﬁnally to intensive agriculture,
urban areas and protected recreational lands (Foley et al., 2005). The transition stages also
vary temporally and spatially. Therefore, the aggressiveness of individual land use may be
diﬀerent in diﬀerent stages. For example, urban land is regarded as most aggressive at the
beginning of the ﬁnal stage of intensive land uses, while this may be not true at the end of
that stage. Therefore,
it is important to estimate the aggressiveness and allocation
sequence properly based on the stage of each land use to accurately simulate multiple
land-use change. In general, the allocation sequence for each land use should be deter-
mined by its ability to occupy other land uses. For example, if a land use can easily occupy
all other land uses but is not readily occupied by almost any other land use, it would be
regarded as the most aggressive land use in the LANDSCAPE model. Conversely, if a land
use never occupies any other land use, it would be the least aggressive land use.

In this research, the allocation sequence for active land uses in the LANDSCAPE model
was determined by the transition pattern between individual
land uses. First, the
land uses during the period 2005–2013 in
transition pattern between individual
Wuhan was demonstrated. Changes in active land uses, including urban areas, rural
settlements and croplands, are illustrated in Figure 3. From 2005 to 2013, the expansion
of both urban area and rural settlements occurred at the cost of cropland, forest,
grassland and wetlands, while neither of them was occupied by any other land use.
Obviously, both the urban area and rural settlements were the most aggressive land
uses in this research. Furthermore, cropland on one hand expands at the cost of forest,
grassland and wetlands; on the other hand, it was occupied by the expansion of the
urban area and rural settlements. This indicates that in Wuhan from 2005 to 2013, the
aggressiveness of cropland was lower than that of the urban area and rural settlements
but higher than that of the other land uses. With respect to the allocation sequence of
the urban area and rural settlements, the urban area was considered as more aggressive
than the rural settlements since Wuhan has experienced rapid urbanization, which
required urban growth prior to rural settlement expansion. Therefore, the urban area
should be the most aggressive, followed by rural settlements and cropland.

3.3. Allocation of individual active land uses

In the LANDSCAPE model, allocation of individual active land uses is determined by two
factors: suitability and resistance. Suitability is a parameter that represents the attrac-
tiveness of a location for becoming a target land use, while resistance is a parameter
that indicates the degree of diﬃculty for a cell to be transferred from its current state.
Usually, land uses with high capital investment correspond to a low probability of being
converted to other land uses (Verburg and Overmars 2009). Thus, the allocation of

individual active land uses in the LANDSCAPE model
(Equation 1):

is formulated as follows

TTPl;tu ¼ Pl;tu
Rl;cu

where TTPl,tu is the total potential for location l to be converted to the target land use tu,
Pl,tu is the suitability of location l to be the target land use tu and Rl,cu is the resistance of
location l to be converted from its current land use cu to another land use. In the
LANDSCAPE model, the higher the TTPl,tu, the higher the possibility that a cell in location
l will become the target land use.

where r is a stochastic factor ranging from 0 to 1, and α is a dispersion factor controlling

nomic characteristics of a location, such as the elevation, slope and the distance to
roads; Con(Cl,tu) is the constraint score for each cell, with 0 for unchangeable cells and 1
for changeable cells; and Ωl; tu is the neighbour eﬀect, which is calculated by

where n(SC = tu) is the number of cells that represent the type of target land use in a
given neighbourhood of location l, and N is the total number of cells in the given
neighbourhood.

PGl,tu represents the relationship between the suitability and its driving forces, which
can be determined by expert knowledge captured using statistical or machine-learning
approaches or an econometric estimation based on current land-use patterns. Machine-
learning approaches, such as Ant Colony Optimization (Li et al. 2009), SVMs (Huang et al.
2009), Neural Networks (Li et al. 2013) and Decision Trees (Ke et al. 2015), have
performed excellently in the determination of the suitability for a particular use.

In this paper, SVM approach was employed to calculate PGl,tu because of its elegance
and simplicity. SVM is a classiﬁcation approach that has been shown to perform well in a
variety of applications, such as credit scoring (Bellotti and Crook 2009), ﬁnancial time-
series prediction (Lu et al. 2009) and brain tumour classiﬁcation (Khan and Syed 2015).
SVM operates by projecting input vectors into a Hilbert space in which they can be
linearly classiﬁed by a hyperplane. The strength of this technique lies in its ability to
model non-linearity and its capability for global optimization.

We applied SVM to derive suitability maps of land uses (Figure 4). Figure 4(a)
illustrates the suitability of cropland, in which every cell exhibits a continuous value,
indicating its suitability for cropland. Compared with the observed land-use map for
Wuhan in 2013 (Figure 5), the suitability map of cropland derived by SVM closely agrees
with the actual distribution of cropland. This demonstrates that SVM performs well in
calculating the allocation suitability of cropland in our case. Figure 4(b)–(f) shows the
suitability maps of forest, grassland, waterbodies, the urban area and rural settlements,
all of which match well with their real distribution in the 2013 land-use map of Wuhan.
This illustrates that SVM has excellent performance in deriving a suitability map of land
uses in this research. It is notable that rivers were set to stable in this research to ensure
little change according to the observed land use during the research period.

The LANDSCAPE model is ﬂexible in deriving suitability maps by supporting most
statistical learning algorithms as well as intelligent algorithms. Studies on CA-based models
for urban land simulation have shown that both statistical learning algorithms and intelli-
gent algorithms are capable of achieving high accuracy and overcoming some limitations in
simulating urban expansion. Therefore, with the ﬂexibility of implementing statistical
learning algorithms or intelligent algorithms to derive suitability maps of land uses, the
LANDSCAPE model can be expected to perform well in simulating land-use change.

3.5. Resistance of individual land use

Resistance indicates the diﬃculty associated with converting one land use to another.
land use in the
Figure 6 illustrates the calculation of resistance for an individual
LANDSCAPE model, where bright cells are more aggressive than dark cells. This implies
that land use in bright cells may occupy land use in dark cells by overcoming their
resistance. During the same period, land use in bright cells occupying that of dark cells
only overcomes resistance from just one-cell-thick wall of the dark cells in Figure 6(a),

10

X. KE ET AL.

Figure 4. Probability maps from SVM. (a) Cropland, (b) forest, (c) grassland, (d) wetland, (e) urban
area, (f) rural settlements.

while it needs to overcome resistance from two-cell-thick wall in dark cells in Figure 6(b)
and at least three-cell-thick wall in Figure 6(c). This indicates that the resistance of land
use in dark cells in Figure 6(a) is more diﬃcult to overcome than that in Figure 6(b,c).
This means that the resistance of land use in dark cells in Figure 6(a) is higher than that
in Figure 6(b,c).

Therefore, the thickness of the occupied dark cells could be used to calculate the
resistance of land use in the dark cells. Speciﬁcally, the resistance of land use in dark cells
with thicker occupied walls should be lower than that with thinner occupied walls. In
general, a thicker occupied wall indicates a lower resistance.

In the LANDSCAPE model, we calibrated the resistances of individual land uses by
calculating the median of the thickness of each land use being occupied by other land
uses. The smaller the median, the higher the resistance of the individual land use. Thus,
we can determine the resistance of each land use using

where Rl is the resistance of land use l, Ml is the median of the thickness of land use l occupied
by other land uses and Mmax and Mmin represent the maximum and minimum, respectively, of
the median of the occupied thickness for all land uses. Rmax and Rmin are the respective upper
and lower bounds of the resistance range, which are determined by expert knowledge.

In this research, the thickness distributions of occupied cells for each land use were
extracted from the land-use map of Wuhan in 2005 and 2013 (Figure 7). First, all
occupied cells in 2005 and 2013 were located on the land-use map using map algebra.
Second, the thicknesses of the occupied cells were calculated for each land use. The
thickness distribution of the occupied cells in each land use is demonstrated in Figure 7.
The parameters in Equation (4), such as Ml, Mmax, Mmin, can be obtained from Figure 7.
Combined with Rmax and Rmin, the resistances for individual land uses in this research
were calculated (Equation 4) based on Figure 7.

In Figure 7, river, urban area and rural settlement cells were not occupied by other
land uses during 2005–2013. Thus, their resistances were highest in the LANDSCAPE
model. For the remaining land uses, the median value of the occupied thickness for
cropland was 200 m, while that for forest, grassland and wetland was 100 m. This
indicates that cropland is more easily occupied than forest, grassland and wetland. In

this research, Rmax and Rmin were valued as 1.5 and 1.0, respectively, and the resistances
of individual land uses are shown in Table 2.

3.6. Accuracy assessment of the LANDSCAPE model

Accuracy assessment is used to calculate a model’s goodness of ﬁt (Rykiel 1996). Land-
use models are typically validated by assessing the agreement between a simulated
land-use map and the corresponding actual land-use map. One of the most popular
parameters for accuracy assessment is the Kappa coeﬃcient of agreement (Doswell et al.
1990). However, due to its inability to indicate the diﬀerence between persistent cells
and changed cells in the land-use change process, the Kappa coeﬃcient is insuﬃcient in
the assessment of land-use change models (Pontius et al. 2004). Because most land-use
change models are used to simulate land-use changes for a relatively short period, the
majority of cells retain stability during these periods (van Vliet et al. 2011). Thus, an
overestimation in a land-use model may be caused by persistent cells when using the
Kappa coeﬃcient to validate land-use models.

To avoid this overestimation, Kappa simulation was developed to estimate the accu-
racy of land-use models (van Vliet et al. 2011). The Kappa simulation performs better in
accuracy assessment of land-use models than does the Kappa coeﬃcient, and was thus
employed to assess the accuracy of the LANDSCAPE model in this research.

The Kappa simulation score has values ranging from −1 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect
agreement, and 0 indicates that the agreement is only as good as a random distribution of
given class transitions. Kappa simulation values below 0 demonstrate less accuracy, while
values above 0 can be interpreted as being more accurate than a random distribution.

4. Results

4.1. Experiment 1: LANDSCAPE model with only a calibrated allocation sequence

In this experiment, only the allocation sequence for active land uses was calibrated in
the LANDSCAPE model, while all land-use resistances were set to 1. Speciﬁcally, there
were three active land uses in the LANDSCAPE model in this experiment: cropland, rural
settlements and the urban area. Other land uses, such as forest, grassland, river and

14

wetland, were regarded as passive. By analysing the land transition pattern in Wuhan
from 2005 to 2013, the allocation sequence for active land uses was ranked as follows:
urban area, rural settlements and cropland. The simulated land-use map of Wuhan in
2013 using LANDSCAPE model with the calibrated allocation sequence is shown in
Figure 8(c). Combining the observed land-use map (Figure 8(a)) and the simulated
map (Figure 8(b)), we can see the general trend of land-use changes in Wuhan during
the period 2005–2013. However, the LANDSCAPE model
in this experiment did not

in detail, which can be seen from the diﬀerences between the
perform that well
observed land-use map in 2013 (Figure 8(b)) and the simulated one (Figure 8(c)). It is
noticeable that spatial patterns of land use are obviously diﬀerent in the green circles in
Figure 8(b,c), where fewer wetlands should be occupied in reality.

To assess the accuracy of the LANDSCAPE model

in this experiment, the Map
Comparison Kit (Visser and de Nijs 2006), developed and provided by the Netherlands
Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), was employed to calculate the Kappa simula-
tion score. In the Map Comparison Kit, three maps are required to calculate the Kappa
simulation score: the original land-use map and the actual and simulated land-use maps
at the end of the period. In this research, these three maps were the observed land-use
map of Wuhan in 2005 and the observed and simulated land-use maps of Wuhan in
2013.

The Kappa simulation scores for land uses in this experiment were all greater than 0,
which indicates that the LANDSCAPE model performed well in the land system simula-
tion. The urban area had the highest Kappa simulation score, 0.390, while rural settle-
ments had the lowest Kappa simulation score of 0.050. The Kappa simulation scores for
cropland, forest land, grassland and wetlands were 0.237, 0.119, 0.143 and 0.171,
respectively. Therefore, the LANDSCAPE model
in this experiment could be used to
simulate and project multiple land-use changes, although it did not perform very well in
simulating detailed land-use changes.

4.2. Experiment 2: LANDSCAPE model using both calibrated allocation sequence
and resistances

In this experiment, both calibrated resistances for land uses and the calibrated allocation
sequence for active land uses were implemented in the LANDSCAPE model. The alloca-
tion sequence for active land uses was determined by the land transition pattern in
Wuhan from 2005 to 2013, as described in Experiment 1. In addition, the calibrated
resistances in Table 2 were introduced into the LANDSCAPE model. The simulated land-
use map of Wuhan in 2013 using LANDSCAPE model with both the calibrated resis-
tances and the calibrated allocation sequence is shown in Figure 9(c).

It can be seen from Figure 9 that in contrast to Experiment 1, the simulated land-use
map in this experiment is more accurate compared to the observed land-use map.
Figure 9(a) shows the observed land-use map of Wuhan in 2013, while Figure 9(b,c)
illustrates simulated land-use maps of Wuhan in 2013 in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2,
respectively. It is clear that the pattern of urban expansion in Figure 9(c) is closer to that
in the observed land-use map in Figure 9(a) than that in the simulated result of
Experiment 1 in Figure 9(b). This illustrates that the simulation result in this experiment
is more logical than that in Experiment 1.

In order to demonstrate the impacts of the calibrated resistances on the accuracy of
the LANDSCAPE model, the Kappa simulation score was calculated in Experiment 2 and
compared with that in Experiment 1 (Table 3). In this experiment, the urban area had the
highest Kappa simulation score of 0.419, which is higher than that of 0.390 in
Experiment 1. The Kappa simulation score for rural settlements was 0.050 in this
experiment, which is equal to that in Experiment 1. The Kappa simulation scores for
forest and grassland in this experiment were 0.258, 0.123 and 0.165,
cropland,

respectively, all of which are higher than those in Experiment 1. However, the Kappa
simulation score for wetland in this experiment was 0.163, which is slightly lower than
that in Experiment 1. In general, the Kappa simulation scores indicate that implementing

both calibrated resistances and the calibrated allocation sequence resulted in better
model performance than that obtained using only the calibrated allocation sequence.

Furthermore, the spatial pattern of land uses in the simulated result of Experiment 2
(Figure 9(c)) was more similar to that of the real land-use map (Figure 9(a)) compared
with the simulated land-use map in Experiment 1 (Figure 9(b)). Speciﬁcally, urban
expansion in the black circle in the simulated land-use map in Experiment 1 obviously
occupied much more wetland than that in the black circle in the observed land-use map,
while the spatial pattern of urban expansion in the black circle in simulated land-use
map in Experiment 2 was similar to that in the observed land-use map in 2013. This
indicates that the parameters in Experiment 2 yielded higher accuracy with respect to
the spatial pattern.

5. Discussion and conclusion

This paper presented a CA-based land system change model, LANDSCAPE, which
implemented not only hierarchical allocation strategy but also resistances. More impor-
tantly, we have provided methods to rank the allocation sequence for active land uses
and calculated resistances for
land uses in the LANDSCAPE model.
Furthermore, the land transition pattern was analysed to determine the allocation
sequence for active land uses. In addition, the median of the thickness of each land
use that was occupied by other land uses was used to calculate the resistances.

individual

The simulations of multiple land-use changes in the study area have shown that the
proposed LANDSCAPE model is an eﬀective and accurate CA-based model for revealing
and simulating changes of multiple land uses. The kappa simulation scores for the
LANDSCAPE model with only the calibrated allocation sequence demonstrate that the
model performed well in simulating exchanges among multiple land uses.

Furthermore, the Kappa simulation scores for the LANDSCAPE model using both
calibrated resistances and the calibrated allocation sequence illustrate that the proposed
method for calibrating the resistances is eﬀective. The land-use map of Wuhan in 2013
simulated by the LANDSCAPE model using both calibrated resistances and the calibrated
allocation sequence reveals a spatial pattern of land use that is more similar to the
observed land-use map compared with that obtained using only the calibrated alloca-
tion sequence. Moreover, the Kappa simulation scores of most land uses when using the
LANDSCAPE model with both calibrated resistances and the calibrated allocation
sequence are obviously higher than those obtained using only the calibrated allocation
sequence.
It is apparent that the method for calculating resistances of land uses
proposed in this research is accurate and eﬀective.

However, in Experiment 2, the simulated result was slightly clumpy. This was probably
due to weakness of stochasticity in this research. Although stochasticity was included in the
calculation of land use suitability in Equation (2), it was weakened by the resistance values.
This could be improved by adjusting the stochastic factor in Equation (2).

Further research should focus on implementing the LANDSCAPE model to ex ante or
ex post assess the impacts of land-use policies on land-use changes. The LANDSCAPE
model is not only an accurate tool to simulate and project changes among multiple land
uses but also an eﬀective method to conduct assessments of the impacts of land-use
policies or ecological conservation strategies on land-use change and the potential

eﬀects. This model has the potential to assess the impacts of land-use policies or
ecological conservation strategies on land-use change by using parameters such as
resistances, demands and aggression.

A novel application of Sensitivity Analysis is presented. Useful applications of
Global SA (GSA) already exist in the field of numerical modelling. In this paper,
we explore the joint use of GSA, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and
Multi-Criteria Evaluation. In this preliminary case study, 11 factors have been
used to find the best place to locate a hazardous waste landfill. Two variance-
based methods (Sobol’ and E-FAST) are used to compute sensitivity indices in
order to identify the factors that determine the variance of the model output. The
results show that only three factors jointly account for 97% of the output
variance. This information is employed to make a simplification of the original
model, retaining only these three influential factors. In addition, if the SA is
carried out in a pilot area where the spatial properties are similar to those of the
whole region, we can infer the results to the whole area. This procedure achieves
the goal of the study with an optimized allocation of resources for GIS data
acquisition.

Introduction

In the last few years, many applications of multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) can be
found in the literature of decision-making (Saaty 1995, Barba-Romero and Pomerol
1997, Malczewski 1999). More recently, sensitivity analysis (SA) has been employed
in conjunction with MCE (Siddiqui et al. 1996, Charnpratheep et al. 1997,
Jankowski et al. 1997, Qureshi et al. 1999, Joerin et al. 2001, Store and Kangas
2001). In these studies, SA is used to assess the robustness of the results following a
‘what if’ process simulation, i.e. to examine the effects that a change in the weights
of the objectives, or criteria, has upon the outcomes of the decision model.
Simulations are performed, whereby different scenarios are explored and the
outcomes are compared. In the scenarios, the hierarchy of the criteria is changed,
and different MCE methods are tested (Go´ mez and Bosque 2004 review almost 30
different papers dealing with this practice). However, in most cases, the geographic
component is not acknowledged.

In addition, several works discuss the most adequate methods of SA to be used in
multi-criteria decision-making (see, for example, Journal of Multi-Criteria Decision
Analysis, Vol. 8, 1999). Some authors suggest the use of global methods of SA
(GSA) in this context (Saltelli et al. 1999a, 2000). GSA allows us to evaluate both
weights and criteria simultaneously, a practice that is not usual in the common SA
process carried out in decision analysis. GSA derives from applications in numerical
modelling, where the SA studies the contribution of the variation of the model
components (usually called factors) in the model output. A number of authors have
also started recognizing the benefit of embedding structural, or scenario uncertainty
in the GSA, i.e. the analysis of the effect of different model structures, or scenarios
on the model output. A collection of application studies, and the underlying theory
of GSA, can be found in Saltelli et al. (2000).

Joint uses of GIS-based models and GSA are also known in hydrological studies
(Crosetto and Tarantola 2001, Francos et al. 2003), in the detection of burnt areas
(Crosetto et al. 2001), flood forecasting (Crosetto et al. 2000), and environmental
impact assessment in road planning problems (Tarantola et al. 2002), but without
the MCE approach.

MCE tools and GIS technology are commonly combined in planning the location
of hazardous waste disposal facilities (Banai 1993, Charnpratheep et al. 1997, Lin
et al. 1997, Malczewski et al. 1997, Lin and Kao 1998, Pettit and Pullar 1999,
Trista´ n et al. 2000, Witlox and Timmermans 2000, Dai et al. 2001), but GSA has
never been used in conjunction with these tools.

In this paper, GSA is linked to a multi-criteria spatial-decision analysis problem
for the location of a hazardous waste landfill site. Confidence in the model results is
very important in this context, because of the potential impact on human health and
the environment. The utility of GSA to evaluate the importance of both weights and
criteria simultaneously is tested. This approach would improve our knowledge of the
decision model properties, either to simplify for the model or to prioritize resources
for data collection procedures.

2. Global sensitivity analysis

The aim of a sensitivity analysis is to ascertain the degree of influence of any input
factor on the model output. A thorough description of sensitivity-analysis methods,
including local, screening, and global methods (such as linear regression, corre-
lation analysis, variance-based, Morris, etc.), can be found in Saltelli et al. (2000). In
in which the input
this paper, only variance-based techniques are considered,
factors Xi are assumed to be independent. These quantitative sensitivity analysis
methods display a number of attractive features in the combined use of GIS and
MCE:

the input factors.

N The sensitivity measure is based on exploring the whole range of variation of
N The measure captures interaction effects. This aspect represents an important
to traditional one-at-a-time methods that only
advantage with respect
allow one factor to be varied, while others are held fixed to their nominal
values.
N The methods can deal with sets of factors as single factors. This means that the
analysis can be performed by partitioning the k factors into a few subgroups of
interest, rather than analysing the factors themselves.

451
N These methods are useful and easy to interpret and contribute to the
transparency of the model (very appropriate in the location of hazardous
facilities).

The variance-based techniques are based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
performed with a specific sampling strategy, taking into account k input factors and
using N samples. The variance-based techniques allow SA to use the so-called
sensitivity indices. For a given input factor Xi, the sensitivity index represents the
fractional contribution to the variance of the model output which is due to Xi. In
order to calculate the sensitivity indices, the total variance V of the model output Y
is apportioned to all the input factors Xi, that is, it is decomposed as a sum of terms
of increasing dimensionality:

This represents the part of the variation of Y that is explained by Xi individually.
Higher-order sensitivity indices, responsible for interaction effects among input
factors, are usually not estimated because of their high computational cost (a
significant number of model executions might be required, depending on the
complexity of the model). However, several methods developed in the last few
years have these capabilities. Among these, the extended FAST method (the ori-
ginal FAST method only computes first-order sensitivity indices; Saltelli et al.
1999b) and the method of Sobol’ (Sobol’ 1993, Homma and Saltelli 1996) are
capable of estimating the total sensitivity index STi, defined to be the sum of all
effects (first- and high-order) involving factor Xi. Estimating the pair (Si, STi) is
important to appreciate the difference between the impact on Y of the factor Xi
alone (the Si) and the overall impact on Y of factor Xi through interactions with
the others (STi). For example, in a three-factor model, the three total effect terms
are

ST1~S1zS12zS13zS123,
ST2~S2zS12zS23zS123,
ST3~S3zS13zS23zS123,

Normalizing each STi, by the total of the effects STi, we obtain a suitable condensed
output statistic:

The difference between the method of Sobol’ and FAST is that while the original

method of Sobol’
is based on quasi-random numbers and MC estimation of
multidimensional integrals, in the FAST method this multidimensional integral is
replaced with a one-dimensional integral based on a Fourier transformation (Saltelli
et al. 2000, Lu and Mohanty 2001).

The extended FAST was seen to be computationally more efficient than the
method of Sobol’, since the pair of indices (Si, STi) related to the factor I can be
estimated with a single computation.

3. Location of a hazardous waste landfill site using GIS and multicriteria evaluation

The study area, presented in figure 1, includes the city of Madrid (Spain). The region
occupies 7995 km2 and has a population of almost 5.5 million people. The region
has a significant industrial activity that produces a large volume of hazardous waste
in different sectors: chemicals, primary metals, manufacturing, etc.

The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a spatial model for the
localization of a hazardous waste landfill site. The model is based on the criteria
usually applied to this kind of planning problem. We have taken into account:

N The European, national, and regional legislation (Europe: Directive 91/689/
EEC of 12 December 1991 on hazardous waste; Directive 99/31/CE of 26 April
1999 on the landfill of waste. Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996 on
control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances, so called
Seveso II Directive. National: Real Decreto 1481/2001, de 27 de diciembre, por

N The engineering guidelines on hazardous-waste management: Lagrega et al.
(1994), Rodrı´guez and Irabien (1999), Hontoria and Zamorano (2000), and
Maran˜ o´ n (2000). Other related sources and papers include: Erkut and Moran
(1991), Massam (1991), Banai (1993), Petts and Eduljee (1994), Lowry et al.
(1995), Siddiqui et al. (1996), Charnpratheep et al. (1997), Kao et al. (1997),
Lin and Kao (1998), Bosque et al. (1999), Lahdelma et al. (2000, 2002), and
Dai et al. (2001).

Based on this literature and the availability of data, the criteria (i.e. constraints
and factors for the MCE) used for the preliminary site screening were determined as
follows.

3.1 Constraints

The first step in the design of the site location involves applying exclusion criteria to
eliminate areas that cannot be used for the landfill site. The landfill site cannot be
located close to urban centres or, outside urban centres, close to potentially crowded
places such as schools, hospitals, commercial centres, and rest houses. A 1000 m
protection buffer was established around urban centres, and a 200 m buffer around
non-urban features including surface water, natural protected areas, and historical
buildings catalogued like ‘Patrimonio Histo´ rico’.

A 100 m buffer was also established around infrastructure located in densely
populated regions: industrial areas, road and rail networks, airports, penitentiaries,
urban and industrial wastewater treatment plants, waste-treatment plants, landfills,
power lines and pipelines (oil and natural gas). A 100 m buffer was also set up
around the administrative boundaries to avoid a candidate land parcel occupying
two municipalities and to prevent conflicts between local authorities.

3.2 Criteria

The location of a hazardous waste landfill facility is a complex task involving a
multitude of engineering, economic, social, environmental, and political aspects.
Although not all pertinent criteria are considered in this study due to a lack of data,
the study includes the following groups of criteria:

N Environmental criteria:
1. Geological properties of the groundwater system: Over clay and gypsum
deposits are the optimal areas to locate a landfill facility, as leakage into
underground water and surrounding land is minimized.

2. Soil permeability: The texture and the existence of an argillaceous horizon are

indicators of soil permeability, which must be avoided.

3. Distance to surface water bodies: Surface water provides a source of water for
infiltration and subsequent percolation. Areas farther from streams are more
suitable to locating the facility then areas bordering the stream buffer.

4. Geo-technical risk: A geo-technical map of the region is available to avoid
fault lines, seismic zones, or unstable areas (subject to landslides, mudslides,
or sinkholes).

5. Distance to natural protected areas: Potential sites should be located as far as

possible from protected areas.

M. Go´mez-Delgado and S. Tarantola
N Economic criteria (related to the construction of the landfill or during its

operational life):

1. Slope: Land suitability decreases as slope increases. At a 15% slope, the
suitability is null, since the area would require unreasonable expenditure
for adequate landfill design, construction, and operation.

2. Land expropriation costs: Estimated expropriation costs are considered in

the analysis depending on land use and vegetation coverage.

3. Accessibility from waste production centres: A function of distance and type
of road used to transport waste from the production centres to the disposal
facility is set up in order to minimize operational costs (Bosque et al. 1999).

N Social criteria:

1. Distance (weighted) to population: Population is a very important factor
for designing emergency response as well as reducing health risks.
Vulnerability is considered greater among the population below 15 and
over 65 years old (Zografos and Davis 1989). We use the indicator of
vulnerable population suggested by Bosque et al. (1999):
2. Vulnerable population density5(26A) + (B) + (26C)/area
3. ,15 years; B. From 15 to 65 years; C..65 years
4. Distance to social infrastructure: Commercial centres, hospitals, schools,
and rest houses are especially vulnerable because population concentra-
tions are higher.

5. Technological risk exposure: The purpose is to measure the negative
externalities that dangerous installations can generate in the surrounding
land. The risk exposure at a given point is a function of the distance to each
installation. The buffer size for each installation (set between 250 and
2000 m) is established as a function of the danger category of the developed
activity.

Each criterion was defined as a raster map of standardized values between 0 and 255
over the case study area. Once we established that the criteria were not cross-
correlated, a weight for each criteria was obtained via the pairwise comparisons
method of Analytic Hierarchy Process (Saaty 1995), taking into account the
literature reviewed (section 3); see table 1.

The criteria were linearly weighted with the weights given in table 1, to produce
the suitability map. The compensatory process was performed within the raster GIS
IDRISI32 Release Two (MCE module), and the raster grid definition was 50650 m.
Once the suitability map was obtained, the pixels were ranked in order of their
degree of suitability, and the best candidates (land parcels) were identified (see
figure 2). The area of each selected parcel was more than 5 ha (the minimum area
requirement to settle the waste facility).

4. Sensitivity analysis for resources optimization

As seen in section 1, GSA has been used in conjunction with MCE, but not for
spatial problems. On the other hand, GSA is employed in GIS-based models, but
not jointly with MCE techniques. Here, we will explore the joint use of GSA, GIS,
and MCE on the decision model described in section 2.

We noted before that the aim of SA is to identify the factors that determine the
variance of the model output. But another goal of SA is to model simplification.
Therefore, if the influence of some factors on the model output uncertainty is almost
negligible, they can be eliminated from the model (Saltelli et al. 2000, 2004). If the
simplified model produces the same results as the original model, we can use the

simpler model, which requires fewer data to collect and, thus, fewer resources to
spend. Crosetto et al. (2000) propose carrying out the SA on a restricted pilot area,
for which data collection is not too large a burden, and then, possibly, inferring the
results to the whole area. This can be done provided that the pilot area is
representative of the whole area, i.e. its spatial properties are similar to those of the
whole region.

4.1 SA results for the whole region

The SA was carried out employing SimLab (2004). This software offers a variety of
SA techniques and applications. Three different GSA methods were used in our case
study: Sobol’, FAST, and E-FAST.

4.1.1 Application and results of the Sobol’ method. The sensitivity analysis is based
on performing multiple model evaluations with randomly selected model input
according to a specific design. First, we select a range and a probability distribution
function (PDF) for each input variable. Then, we generate a sample from the PDFs
specified using the Sobol’ sample design (see Saltelli 2002).

In our case, the PDFs for the factors are set up using observed values for the
factors themselves. Distributions that best fit with factors are triangular, uniform,
exponential, and gamma. For the factors having a discrete set of values (e.g.
sensitivity to groundwater system pollution, type of soil, expropriation land costs,
and geotechnical
the
distributions used for all the criteria involved.

risk), we use a discrete distribution. Figure 3 shows

A uniform distribution was established for the weights assigned to each criterion.
Two scenarios with different degrees of variation were developed in order to
investigate the effect of the variation of the weights in the model output.

1. SA with ¡20% of variation for the weights: In the first scenario, we assumed
¡20% variation of each weight value and performed 5884 model evaluations.
The sensitivity indices are reported in table 2 (Scenario A1). The first-order
indices show that the three criteria—c1, slope (46%); c4, sensitivity of
groundwater system to pollution (28%); and c5, type of soil (23%)—account for
most of the output variability. They jointly account for 97% of the output
variance. The influence of the other criteria and weights is almost negligible,
given the small values of their total effect indices. These indices collect more
information than the first-order indices about the action of each factor over
indices are used to identify
the variation of the results. In fact, total
unessential variables (those that are not important, either singularly or in
combination with others) for model simplification. This means that the less
influential factors could be replaced by a fixed value in their range of variation
(e.g. the mean) without significantly affecting the results. Fixing these factors
at their mean values, and allowing variation only for the three influential
factors, the standard deviation of the model output is 33.64. The variance was
just slightly larger (34.49) when all the factors were varied. The difference in
variance is the contribution to the variance of all the factors that were fixed in
the second analysis. The difference STi – Si is a measure of how much a factor
is involved in interactions with any other input factor. (The interaction could
occur between any subset of factors in a model, depending on the analytical
formulation of the model.) In practical cases, we consider this difference
significant if it is larger than 0.2. In our case, the results show that these

differences are never larger than 0.0077. We conclude that the variation of the
results is due to the action of the factors individually, not in combination with
others.

2. SA with ¡50% and ¡75% of variation for the weights: The second analysis
was carried out allowing a greater variation of the weight values. The results
of the SA are reported in table 2 (scenarios A2 and A3). Note that the major
source of uncertainty is again represented by the same factors as in the
previous analysis (figure 4). Si and STi indices show too the negligible effect of
these components of the model (weights), even if they have a high variation.
Though the Si for some of the weights has increased, this increment is very
small, and all the weights remain very far from the factors that represent the
major source of uncertainty. The weight of the type of soil factor and the
weight of the slope factor yielded greater differences for the first sensitivity
indices (in the ¡75% scenario): from 0.0131 to 0.0643 and from 0.0041 to
0.0535, respectively.

4.1.2 Application and results of E-FAST method by grouping factors. The
advantage of the E-FAST method is its ability to perform a SA regarding not
only single factors but also groups of factors with less computational cost than the

Sobol’ method, since it does not involve the evaluation of many integrals. The
analysis of the total normalized effect index for each group of factors renders this
method more attractive because the analysis may be performed at a higher
description level in complex models. In EMC problems, this method allows us to
interpret the uncertainty due to the weights attached to the criteria separate from
those due to other model inputs (Saltelli et al. 1999a: 141).

For this case study, the SA was carried out with six groups, separating criteria and
weights. The results are reported in table 3 (B1). The important effect of the
environmental criteria (Si50.52) and economic criteria (Si50.44) is confirmed (note
that two of the top influential factors are in the environmental group). In addition,
these results highlight the modest role played by social criteria and the different
groups of weights.

In a second analysis, the variation of the weights was incremented up to ¡75% of
their first values, but the results did not change drastically (table 3, B2). This
confirms that the variation of weights has a negligible effect on the variation of the
model output, even if they are jointly analysed. However, it is noticeable that the
group of economic weights increases its rank, from fifth to third place, as a result of
a greater variation in the weight values. Consequently, the group of social criteria
decreases its importance, from fourth place to last. In light of these results, one
strategy to reduce the uncertainty of the model output would be to improve the
measurement of accuracy for the more influential factors. The improvement of
sample techniques or interpolation methods is one recommended action. In this
case, one strategy would be to improve the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) or to
make an exhaustive verification of it, since slope is the factor that mostly drives the
output uncertainty. However, information from the SA could also be used to decide
how much risk the decision-maker is inclined to assume in the decision-making
problem.

4.2 Results of model simplification

As mentioned above, the results in table 2 and figure 4 show that only three factors
drive the output uncertainty of the model. A reduction of the factors involved in the
model was consequently done in order to check the impact of a simplified model on
the results.

The model was run with only three criteria: slope, sensitivity of groundwater system
to pollution, and type of soil. Despite demonstrating that weights do not influence the
output variance of the results, the established hierarchy was maintained (see table 1):
a weight of 0.38 was assigned both to sensitivity of groundwater system to pollution
and to type of soil, and a weight of 0.24 was assigned to slope (notice that the weights
have been recalculated to sum 1).

Once the model was executed, it was observed that the best suitability distribution
for the region was not substantially modified (again concentrated in the south-
eastern part of the region). The greatest differences were registered in areas with
suitability values near to 0 (null suitability).

A quantitative analysis of the results was made in a second stage. The correlation
coefficient obtained between the results of the original and the reduced model (0.94)
confirmed that the differences are negligible (figure 5(a)). We also examined the
frequency distribution of the differences between the suitability index of both images
(original suitability map and modified suitability map). As shown in the histogram
(figure 5(b)), 64% of those differences are concentrated between –20 and 20, which
demonstrates again the low impact of the simplification carried out.

This analysis shows that the new results are more flexible, but they do not imply
any risk in the decision-making process. This is because the average values of
suitability are similar, and the differences between them are insignificant.

Finally, the best parcels were extracted from this new suitability map. Figure 6
shows how again the same eight original parcels were identified; in addition, all the
parcels registered average levels of suitability greater than 252 (255 being the highest
possible value).

4.3 SA and resources optimization: Test in two pilot areas

As we mentioned earlier, some authors propose an application of these analyses as a
tool of resources optimization, making a previous test in a pilot area (Crosetto et al.
2002). The authors referenced argue that it is possible to use laboratory data about
the variables involved in the study, but it is also necessary to have previous
knowledge about the spatial distribution of these variables. In this section, we
should emphasize the need for making the right selection of the pilot area in spatial
models in order to obtain robust results through the SA.

In our analysis, two pilot areas were used in order to see if the selection of the test
area could change the SA results significantly. The distributions of the variables
involved in the model (mainly the variables that most heavily influence the output
variance) in these two areas are very different. Each of these areas occupies an
extension of a National Topographic Map, on a scale of 1:50 000 (with an extension
of approximately 521 km2):

1. The first area is located in the north of the Madrid region (MTN 1:50 000,
Torrelaguna), where the distribution of all the variables with respect to the
whole region is very similar.

2. The second area is located in the southern region of Madrid. In this case, the
distribution of several variables is very different with respect to the whole
region.

These two pilot areas are presented in figure 7, superimposed on the distribution
of the slope criteria. As can be seen, the variation of this variable in Torrelaguna
area (A) is very similar to the distribution of this variable in the whole region. By
contrast, the distribution in the south pilot area is very uniform.

The SA was carried out for the original model (with all the criteria and weights
assigned to them). For this analysis, the most computationally efficient method was
used: E-FAST (first-order and total-effect indices are calculated with only one set of
model evaluations).

First, the distribution of each criterion in both pilot areas was examined. Then,
appropriate modifications were introduced in order to assign the correct distribution
for the sample procedure.

Finally, the SA was carried out with these modifications, and the results are
shown in table 4. As a first conclusion from this exercise, the selection of the pilot
area has an obvious impact, because it must adequately represent the whole region
under study. Indeed, the results in pilot area A (with a configuration similar to the

whole region) are the same as those obtained in section 3.1. Slope, sensitivity of
groundwater system to pollution, and type of soil are again the factors that control the
output of the model.

However, the situation varies in the second pilot area where the characteristics of
the multiple criteria change. In this case, the factor slope reduces in importance,
while type of soil appears in first position, and the second position is now occupied
by the expropriation land costs. The remaining factors again have negligible effects in
the model output.

The fourth place in the influence factors ranking has also changed. In pilot area A
(as in the whole region), this place is occupied by sensitivity of groundwater system
pollution, while in pilot area B, it is occupied by the weight assigned to the slope
criteria.

Finally, a simplification of the model was carried out, taking into account the
results of pilot area B. The number of parcels obtained in this case is over 400.
Though the eight original parcels were among those, we cannot consider these
results as a proof of robustness, given the great difference with respect to the
previous results.

5. Conclusions

In this paper, a procedure to control the risk associated with a spatial decision-
making process is proposed. This risk control is based on SA methods traditionally
used in the field of experimental sciences (on predictive models) and now applied to
a normative model, based on MCE techniques in a GIS environment.

The results of SA show that, in order to improve the model, special attention
should be focused on the three most influential input factors among the 22 factors
(taking into account criteria and weights) included in the model.

We propose these SA methods as a tool to assess the risk derived from the use of
given data and the use of a given model. The results will allow us to make
knowledge-based decisions. This is especially important
in the location of
undesirable facilities like hazardous waste landfills, where a consensus between all
the implied agents in the planning process is rarely reached.

Additionally, SA techniques can be applied as an effective tool to derive a
simplification of the model under study. The scientific community’s endeavour to
build models increasingly closer to reality has resulted in the development of
complex models that require a great amount of input information. Consequently,
the execution of
the models can be cumbersome, especially within a GIS
environment where the process of data collection is still an important ‘bottleneck’.
SA would allow retaining the essence of the model and would only require that
quality data be obtained for the relevant factors.

The simplification process mentioned also proves to be a resource optimization
procedure when the analysis is first applied on a test area. However, as in any spatial
problem, this pilot area has to be carefully selected in order to represent as well as
possible the whole study area; otherwise the results can vary significantly.

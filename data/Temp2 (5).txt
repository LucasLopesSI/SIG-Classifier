Abstract. This paper proposes an exploratory method for detecting qualitative
change in trend curves that is robust against low quality data. First, a measure
of qualitative similarity between trend curves is de(cid:142) ned. Second, using this meas-
ure, a method of qualitative classi(cid:142) cation of trend curves and a method for
detecting qualitative change in trend curves are developed. Last, these methods
are applied to the analysis of land cover change in the Persian Gulf Area in
1982–1993, and advantages of these qualitative methods are shown in comparison
with ordinary quantitative methods.

Introduction
The objective of this paper is to propose an exploratory method for qualitative
trend curve analysis that is robust against low quality data. An illustrative (cid:142) gure is
shown in (cid:142) gure 1. We (cid:142) rst propose a measure of qualitative similarity between trend
curves (§2 and §3). Using this measure, we then show a method for qualitative
classi(cid:142) cation of trend curves (§4 ) and a method for detecting qualitative change in
trend curves (§5). Last these methods are applied to the analysis of seasonal land
cover change in the Persian Gulf Area (§5).

Applications of trend curve analysis are found in various (cid:142) elds. For example,
monthly temperature over twelve months at a location (Handcock and Wallis 1994 ),
monthly piezometric readings at a well (Rouhani and Wackernagel 1990 ), seasonal
land cover change at a location (Eastman and Fulk 1993, Samson 1993, DeFries
and Townshend 1994, Millington et al. 1994 ), unemployment series over years in
several regions (Unwin 1996 ), population density in a city with respect to the distance
from the central business district (Clark 1952 ) and so forth. Although applications
are many, most of these studies deal with quantitative characteristics of trend curves
(such as parameter values of a function representing a trend curve), and little attention
is paid to qualitative characteristics of trend curves (except Okabe 1982 ). Recently,
qualitative analysis has become increasingly important because of the data rich
environment brought about by rapid progress in modern data acquisition technolo-
gies, such as remote sensing, GPS and mobile GIS. In such an ‘excess’ data environ-
ment, two step analysis is recommended: (cid:142) rst, exploratory data analysis (qualitative

analysis); second, explanatory data analysis (quantitative analysis). In the (cid:142) rst-step
analysis, using huge low quality (non-preprocessed ) data, we attempt to (cid:142) nd qualitat-
ively distinct phenomena that would be worth investigating quantitatively (originally
exploratory data analysis was proposed by Turkey (1977 ) and developed in GIS by
Openshaw et al. (1987 ), Haslett et al. (1987 ), Walker and Moore (1988 ), Anslein
et al. (1993 ) and others). In the second step, we develop an explanatory model
suggested by the results obtained from the (cid:142) rst step and test the model with high
quality (preprocessed ) data. The objective of this paper is to propose a method for
qualitative trend curve analysis employed in the (cid:142) rst step analysis. In sprit, our
method is close to the method proposed by Unwin (1996 ).

2. Qualitative similarity between trend curves

We (cid:142) rst introduce several concepts related to ‘qualitative’ characteristics of a

trend curve.

Consider a continuous curve, f (t), de(cid:142) ned on 0<
, ..., tn, are observed, where t
), ..., f (tn ) at points t

t< T , and suppose that values
f (t
< ... < tn . In theory a continu-
ous function f (t) is desirable, but in practice, the function is observable at a (cid:142) nite
number n of points. Thus we make the assumption that the curve f (t) is represented
by the chain consisting of line segments joining f (ti) and f (ti+1) for i 5 1, ..., nÕ 1
((cid:142) gure 1). We refer to this chain as a discrete trend curve or simply a trend curve
when it is understood.

We inspect qualitative characteristics of a discrete trend curve from two aspects:
local characteristics and global characteristics. Local characteristics are character-
istics in a small neighbourhood around a point ti in i 5 1, ..., n. To be explicit, we

according to the following criteria ((cid:142) gure 2).

f (tiÕ 1)< f (ti)< f (ti+1) or f (tiÕ 1)> f (ti)> f (ti+1) for i 5 2, ..., nÕ 1;

) for i 5 1; f (tnÕ 1) > f (tn ) for i 5 n.
For notational convenience we use C( f (ti)) 5 S, P, B if the local characteristic of f (t)
around ti is a slope, p eak and bottom, respectively.

It should be noted that the local characteristics de(cid:142) ned above are qualitative in
the sense that a slope, a peak and a bottom remain a slope, a peak and a bottom,
respectively under a broad class of monotonically increasing transformations. Stated
precisely, if C( f (ti)) 5 X, then C( f (g(ti)))5 X and C(g( f (ti)))5 X (X 5 S, P, B) for any
monotonically increasing function g.

Having de(cid:142) ned local characteristics, we next turn to global characteristics. Global

in the sequence are discarded, because non-critical points (slopes) are always between
two critical points (peaks and bottoms).

The qualitative similarity de(cid:142) ned above is robust against low quality data. In
the real world we often have data whose acquisition time is inaccurately recorded.
For instance, timing equipment in a data acquisition device may be inaccurate, or
researchers may record the acquisition date inaccurately. It is, however, likely that
the order of observation points in time is preserved even in such cases. This order

preservation property implies equation (1), implying that qualitative similarity is
robust against such inaccuracy. Inaccuracy also occurs when we observe attribute
values. In the real world, sensitivity of a sensor may be diŒerent from device to
device, or it may deteriorate over time. It is, however, likely that peaks remain peaks
and bottoms remain bottoms, because the sensor is likely to be stable over a short
range of time (recall that peaks and bottoms are local properties). This property
implies equation (1), implying that qualitative similarity is robust against such
inaccuracy.

3. Qualitative similarity at level h*

In the preceding section, we assume that a peak is a peak no matter how small
it is. This assumption, however, is arguable. For example, consider the two trend
curves in (cid:142) gure 4. These two trend curves are not qualitatively similar, because the
curve in panel (a) has the sequence (B, P, B, P, B, P, B, P, B), whereas the curve in
panel (b) has the sequence (B, P, B, P, B, P, B). We feel, however, that these two
curves are qualitatively similar to a certain extent, because the sequence of ‘distinct’
peaks is the same for the both curves.

To deal with this kind of qualitative similarity, we (cid:142) rst de(cid:142) ne the height of a

they de(cid:142) ned it in a two-dimensional context). In terms of h(tÃ
j), we de(cid:142) ne a distinct
peak by the peak whose height is greater than a threshold height, h*, and refer to
such a peak as an h*-distinct peak. The trend curve of h*-distinct peaks is obtained
by the procedure: if h(tÃ

a line segment joining f (tÃ

by f (t| h*) and call
f (t |h*) the h*-distinct trend curve of

trend curves are qualitatively similar at level h*.

As is seen in this example, parametric h* reveals overall qualitative similarity.
To measure the magnitude of this overall qualitative similarity, we use the length of
h* in which two trend curves are qualitatively similar. In the curves on the right-
hand side of (cid:142) gure 6, the heavy line segments show the range in which the relation
(t| h*) holds. If the heavy line segment becomes longer, qualitative simil-
f
arity becomes stronger. This property suggests the de(cid:142) nition the magnitude of the
overall qualitative similarity between fi(t) and fk(t) by

We make two remarks on this measure. First, Okabe (1982 ) also proposed a
measure of qualitative similarity but his measure considers only local qualitative
similarity and does not consider global and overall qualitative similarity. Second,
the measure M( fi, fk) is robust against small (cid:143) uctuation of peaks resulting from the
choice of time intervals, because a large value of h* smoothes small peaks.

In terms of M( fs, fs+1), we can easily de(cid:142) ne the magnitude of qualitative change
in a trend curve between periods s and s 1 1. To be explicit, we de(cid:142) ne the magnitude

An actual example is shown in §5.

4. Qualitative classi(cid:142) cation versus quantitative classi(cid:142) cation

Using the qualitative similarity de(cid:142) ned above, we can classify trend curves
into categories. To be explicit, suppose that there are N h*-distinct trend curves,

We make two remarks on K . First, classes in K are qualitative in the sense that
trend curves are classi(cid:142) ed by the qualitative similarity. Second, we can control the
number k of classes through h*. As the value of h* increases, the number of classes
decreases.

It is instructive to compare the above qualitative classi(cid:142) cation method with a
quantitative classi(cid:142) cation method. Since we assume a huge amount of data, non-
hierarchical classi(cid:142) cation is tractable in practice. To be speci(cid:142) c, let us consider
the k-means method (MacQueen 1967 ). To apply it, discrete trend curves fi(t),
i 5 1, ..., N should be represented by points in the multi-dimensional Euclidean
space. This can be done by representing a sequence f (ti1), ..., f (tin) by a vector
( f (ti1), ..., f ( tin)). Then we can apply the k-means method to the data set
xi 5
{x1
, ..., xN}. The k-means method is an iterative method for clustering N points in
the multi-dimensional Euclidean space (n-dimension in this example) into k clusters.
Regarding the iteration procedure, the reader should consult MacQueen (1967 ), but
here we brie(cid:143) y mention the outline of the procedure. First, initial k kernels are given.
Second, points are assigned to their nearest kernels. Third, the means of the values
assigned to each kernel is regarded as a new kernel. The iteration continues until
the means of k clusters becomes stable.

We can apply the qualitative classi(cid:142) cation method and the k-means method to
the same data set, ( f (ti1), ..., f (tin)). These two classi(cid:142) cations show diŒerent aspects
of trend curves, and we discuss it with an actual data set in §5.

Last, we make one remark. Like many ‘spatial’ clustering methods in the litera-
ture, the proposed method does not directly deal with spatial aspects. We may
directly deal with spatial aspects by extending qualitative trend curve analysis to
qualitative trend surface analysis (Okabe and Masuda, 1984 ), but this method is
beyond the scope of this paper.

5. Seasonal land cover (NDVI ) change in the Persian Gulf Area in 1982– 1993

To examine the usefulness of the qualitative methods proposed in the preceding
sections, we applied it to the data of seasonal land cover change in the Persian Gulf
Area (E40ß –50ß , N27ß –37ß ) over twelve years (1982–1993 ). The data source was
Path(cid:142) nder AVHRR Land Data Set (NOAA-7, -9 and -11 ) in 1982–1993 (Smith et al.
1997 ). The area consists of 100 by 100 pixels; consequently, one pixel represents a

72

0.1ß by 0.1ß region (approximately 8 km by 8 km). We used the NDVI (Normalized
DiŒerence Vegetation Index; roughly speaking, NDVI indicates the amount of vegeta-
tion) over twelve months, which gave trend curves fis(tj),
j 5 1, ..., 12 (months),
i 5 1, ..., 10 000 (locations), s 5 1982, ..., 1993 (12 periods).

We considered that the above data set was a good test example for applying the
qualitative trend curve analysis, for the following reasons. First, to remove the eŒect
of clouds, we had to use the maximum value of NDVI among the NDVI values
obtained at three time-points in a month. This treatment resulted in unequal time
intervals because the maximum value was achieved at a diŒerent point in each
month. As we remarked on equation (1) in §2, the qualitative trend curve analysis
is invariant for unequal time-intervals.

Second, the data quality may change due to the shot time in a day. In fact,
Tateishi and Kajiwara (1992 ) showed that the NOAA-9 satellite experienced a
progressive delay in the time of equatorial crossing and this resulted in increase in
the NDVI between diŒerent points in time. This increase, however, may be repres-
ented by an order-preserving transformation, and so the qualitative trend curve
analysis is, as remarked on equation (1), invariant for this change.

Third, the amount of data was huge. We used three sets of data in every month
over twelve months over twelve years; consequently the total data amounted to
10 000 (pixel )Ö 3 (times in a month)Ö 12 (months) Ö 12 (years) 5 4.32Ö 106 .

Using the qualitative classi(cid:142) cation method, we (cid:142) rst classi(cid:142) ed 10 000 locations
(pixels) into three categories. The result is shown in (cid:142) gure 7. As mentioned in §4, the
number of categories is controlable by the h* value. To show a distinction between
the qualitative classi(cid:142) cation method and the k-means method (a qualitative method ),
both methods were applied to the same data set. The result is shown in (cid:142) gure 8,
where panel (a) shows three typical trend curves belonging to the three categories
obtained by the qualitative classi(cid:142) cation method and panel (b) shows the average
trend curves of three clusters obtained by the k-means method. In both (cid:142) gures, the
(cid:143) at trend curves indicate sandy soil areas. A distinct diŒerence is noticed in the non-
(cid:143) at trend curves. In panel (b), since both trend curves have a single peak, these trend
curves may correspond to single-cropping areas (probably wheat and rice). On the
other hand, in panel (a), one trend curve may correspond to single-cropping areas
and the other may correspond to double-cropping areas. From this examination, we
notice that the qualitative classi(cid:142) cation method can reveal qualitative characteristics
that cannot be detected by the k-means method.

Second we attempted to detect qualitative change in the Persian Gulf Area using
the measure D proposed in §3. The result is depicted in (cid:142) gure 9 where the luminosity
of the gray color indicates the magnitude of overall qualitative similarity between
successive two years; as
the luminosity becomes darker, qualitative change
becomes larger.

According to the precipitation data, the Persian Gulf Area had distinctively high
rainfall in 1987– 88, and distinctively low rainfall in 1988– 89. These phenomena may
correspond to the fact that luminosity of panels ( f ) and ( g) is relatively darker than
that for the other panels.

According to the agricultural census, the production of barley distinctively
increased in 1987– 88 and distinctively decreased in 1988–89. These phenomena may
also correspond to the fact mentioned above (panels ( f ) and ( g)).

We learned from Sakai (1998 ) that the north-west area in panels ( f ) and ( g) was
the area where barely was cultivated without irrigation systems but the south of that

area had good irrigation systems. It is interesting to notice that qualitative change
in the south was small.

We noticed dark gray pixels in the south-west corner in panels (b), (c) and (h).
This area corresponded to the self-su(cid:141) ciency policy of Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. It
is reported that the yield increased twenty times at the end of 1994.

Last, we emphasize that the above analysis was to (cid:142) nd a clue to the second-step
analysis. Researchers are supposed to (cid:142) nd places that would be worth examining in
depth by inspecting (cid:142) gure 9.

6. Conclusions

The major conclusions of this paper are summarized as follows.
First, when we want to classify trend curves according to their qualitative charac-

teristics, we may use the qualitative classi(cid:142) cation method proposed in §4. As shown
in §5, this method reveals diŒerent aspects which a quantitative classi(cid:142) cation method,
such as the k-means method, cannot detect (recall (cid:142) gure 8).

Second, when we want to detect qualitative change in trend curves, we may use

the measure de(cid:142) ned by equation (5). As shown in (cid:142) gure 9 (§5 ), this measure is useful
to (cid:142) nd places that would be worth examining in depth.

Third, these methods are robust against low quality data. Thus these methods

are applicable to non-processed data in the (cid:142) rst step analysis.

Fourth, the computation of these methods is simple; the order of computation
time is linear with respect to the number of trend curves. Thus we can manage a
huge amount of data.

Considering these advantages, we may say that the proposed methods provide a

useful exploratory tool for trend curve analysis.

There are nearly 700 cities in China, each with their own particular characteristics of
natural environment quality and rates of economic development. When people are able
to choose a city to live in, they will take into account these characteristics in order
to improve their lifestyles. Based on geographic information system technology and
the analytic hierarchy process method, a model of the living environment suitability
index (LESI) for the larger cities of China was designed. The LESI was constructed
by using the factors of economic condition, convenience and livable degree, natural
environment and natural resources. The LESI model was then applied to compare the
living conditions in 35 major cities in China in 2007, including 30 provincial capitals
and 5 sub-provincial cities. LESI values were higher for cities in southeast China than
for cities in the northwest. The highest LESI values were mainly distributed along the
Chinese southeast coast and the Yangtze River Delta. Cities with the lowest LESI values
were found in the centre and north of China. Of the 35 cities, 4 had highly suitable living
environments and 7 had unsuitable living environments.

Introduction

1.
Urbanization is a current and future trend in China and the number of young people who
seek work and live in cities is increasing (Fan et al. 2009, Liang 2009). With rapid devel-
opment of the Chinese economy and related urbanization, the urban living environment in
China has undergone dramatic changes (Long et al. 2008). At present, in some of China’s
larger cities housing prices have become so high that people cannot afford to live com-
fortably in them and have to accept lower quality living accommodation. Therefore, it is
relevant to evaluate the living environment in these cities (Weng 2001).

This article applies the combination of visualization tools with a specialized analysis
method to evaluate the living environment of cities through the research tools provided by
the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and geographic information system (GIS) technol-
ogy (Malczewski 2006, Ohta et al. 2007, Rinner 2007). AHP is a decision analysis method

that considers both qualitative and quantitative information and combines them by decom-
posing ill-structured problems into systematic hierarchies to rank alternatives based on a
number of criteria (Xiong et al. 2007). As a result, AHP has a special advantage in multi-
indices evaluation. It has been applied in many research ﬁelds, including the natural and
social sciences and economics (Ohta et al. 2007, Choi et al. 2009, Yu et al. 2011). GIS
technology has provided users with new platforms for data management and visualization
(Bojorquez-Tapia et al. 2001). Combined with the rapid development of computer tech-
nology, GIS has been widely applied in research on evaluation of natural resources and
environmental management (Grabaum and Meyer 1998, Bayliss et al. 2003).

Previous studies have examined the characteristics of urban living environments. Some
countries have established a standard evaluation system based on remote sensing and GIS,
for example, the LEED standard of the United States and the Dutch Eco-Quantum Standard
(Choguill 1996, Gilbert 1998, Emmanuel 2005, Xiong and Zeng 2007). Urban living envi-
ronments in China have been a recent topic of interest leading to many studies. Cities of
Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Beijing have been used as case studies and there have
been discussions about the deﬁnition and evaluation methods of human settlements (Li
et al. 1999, Liu 1999, Ning and Cha 1999, Chen et al. 2000, Liu et al. 2004). Other stud-
ies have endeavoured to set an evaluation index system for sustainable development of
urban living environments (Liu and Liu 1999, Li et al. 2002, Ye and Dong 2003). Wen
and Fang (2007) qualitatively analysed the spatial expansion trend of human settlement
at the provincial level in China. Additionally, the climatic suitability for human inhabita-
tion has been evaluated (Huang et al. 1990, Zhang and Feng 1991, Liu 1999, Li and Liu
2003). However, these studies have examined only single Chinese provinces or cities, and
the research methods used were based on qualitative analysis.

To quantitatively analyse the living environments of China’s major cities and to reveal
their spatial distribution in China, GIS technology is used to acquire quantitative informa-
tion about the cities’ natural environments, economic strengths, convenience and livable
degrees and natural resources. Using this information AHP was used to construct the liv-
ing environment suitability index (LESI) model. The LESI values for the study areas were
calculated using ArcGIS.

2. Study area
China has 23 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4 municipalities and 2 special administra-
tive regions. Thirty-ﬁve of the most populous Chinese cities were selected for this study
(Figure 1). These cities included 30 provincial capitals and 5 sub-provincial cities (Table 6).
The provincial capitals, Lhasa, Hong Kong, Macao and Taipei, were not studied because
there were insufﬁcient data available for them. Further, Hong Kong, Macao and Taipei
have speciﬁc political, economic and cultural differences from the other cities that make
the comparability of their statistical data difﬁcult.

Excluding Hong Kong, Macao and cities in Taiwan, at the end of 2007, there were
655 cities in Mainland China which together had a total population of 0.37 billion and
occupied an area of 176,070 km2. The population of the cities included in this study was
0.18 billion at the end of 2007 and occupied a total area of 56,640 km2 (China Urban
Construction Statistical Yearbook 2007). These major cities are the political, economic
and cultural centre of each province. Beijing is the political centre and Shanghai is the
ﬁnancial hub of China. Shenzhen was the ﬁrst special economic zone in China and with its
development over 30 years it is the ‘bright pearl’ of the economy of China.

3. Methods
3.1. Design of the evaluation index system

The establishment of an appropriate evaluation index system was the basic requirement
for the scientiﬁc analysis of living environment suitability. Synthetic evaluation of envi-
ronmental suitability for living is affected by many factors, including natural features
and economic conditions with reference to many subjects and at many levels. The fac-
tors included in the design should be able to represent the features of the LESI system.
The main problems that affect the environmental suitability for living should be taken into
account when the indicator groups are chosen. At the same time, access to the required
data should also be considered when selecting factors.

The urban living environment has been determined by assessing sets of demographic
and socio-economic indicators (Rinner 2007). Traditionally, wealthy places with educated
and employed populations have been considered high-quality living environments (Li et al.
1999). More recently, indicators such as convenience of transport, housing price and urban
facilities have been taken into account (Yu 2007, Dong et al. 2010, Li et al. 2011, Liang
2011).

Chinese LESI studies (Li et al. 1999, Yu 2007, Dong et al. 2010, Li 2011, Liang
2011), especially the Publication of Scientiﬁc Evaluation Criterion of Amenity City, a sci-
entiﬁc index system for the evaluation of urban human settlements (Gu and Luo 2007),
provided a base for our study. After considering data availability, natural environment,
economic strength, convenience and livable degree and natural resources were selected as

Y. Xu et al.

the indicators for our model of LESI. The index system is consistent with that of the China
Statistics Yearbook, because the data sources of this study are from that yearbook (Table 1).
The statistical data of this study are for the year 2007. All of the source data were re-
sampled into a complete data set. Data were transformed to the same coordinate system: the
Albers equal area projection system with an original longitude of 105◦ E, double standard
parallel of 27◦ N and 45◦ N, Beijing 1954 geodetic datum and Krasovsky ellipsoid.

3.2. Technical scheme of the evaluation model

We established a criteria system for living environment suitability evaluation and arranged
the factors and indices deﬁned in Table 1 in a hierarchical order (Figure 2).

3.3. Standardization of evaluation factors

Because the evaluation factors had their own characteristics and extent, and each datum of
factors had its own dimension and distribution, it was difﬁcult to directly compare them or
include them together in an operational system. Consequently, the original data of evalu-
ation factors need to be made dimensionless by range transformation (Xiong et al. 2007).
Furthermore, the evaluation factors had negative and positive interrelations in the LESI
evaluation. Positive interrelations between factors were highly advantageous in deﬁning
living environmental suitability. Higher evaluation values of factors indicated better living
environment suitability. Negative interrelation for factors was disadvantageous in deﬁn-
ing living environment suitability. Thus, the higher the evaluation values of those negative
factors, the worse the indicated living environment suitability. Consequently, negative and
positive factors should be dimensionless, with Formula (1) for positive factors and Formula
(2) for negative interrelation factors. The dimensionless unit made all of the factors con-
sistent, giving higher values of factors more importance in their contribution to the LESIs.
In the data set, C18 was a negative factor, whereas the other indices were positive (Table 3):

STDk, j = ACTk, j − Mink, j
Maxk, j − Mink, j

× 100

STDk, j =

(cid:2)
1 − ACTk, j − Mink, j
Maxk, j − Mink, j

(cid:3)

× 100

(1)

(2)

where STDk,j is the standardized score, ACTk,j is the actual score, Mink,j is the minimum
score and Maxk,j is the maximum score. For convenience of processing, all transformed
data were magniﬁed 100 times. All the indices were processed by these methods.

3.4. Weighting of evaluation factors
AHP is a systematic analysis evaluation method used to treat complex and multi-index
systems quantitatively. This decomposes complex problems to fewer layers and factors and
improves comparisons and calculation as a result of weighting (Xu 2002). Due to its ability
of assigning proper weights to various factors of complex systems, it was appropriate to
apply AHP in the derivation of an LESI system (Xiong et al. 2007). Thus, the AHP method
was applied to calculate the weight of each factor according to the expert advice system.
The detailed analytical process is as follows.

3.4.1. Establishment of the hierarchic structure

The evaluation system was divided into three levels – A, B and C, denoting objective layer,
factor layer and index layer, respectively (Table 3). The objective layer is the synthetic
evaluation of living environment suitability. Each layer in this hierarchical structure was
compared in pair-wise comparisons related to each of the elements at the levels deﬁned
above. The level structure was established by analysing the relationship of each index.

3.4.2. Establishment of comparison matrix
Layer A was broken down into layer B and layer C to establish the pair-wise comparison
matrix. The matrix was expressed with A = (aij)n×n:

A =

The relative importance of B1, B2, B3 and B4 was analysed by the expert judgement sys-
tem. We invited ﬁve experts to give their opinions on the relative importance of each factor
in determining suitability for living. The experts were ﬁve doctorate graduates: two special-
izing in natural environments, one in economics, one in spatial analysis with application
to urban planning and the ﬁfth is involved in research on data sharing. They were invited
because of their interest in and familiarity with urban living environments. We analysed

their opinions to rank the relative importance for each factor. The pair-wise comparison
matrix was established for layers A and B (Table 2).

3.4.3. Calculation of single ranking

In order to gain the weights of B1, B2, B3 and B4, the following are considered:

(1) The elements of the judgement matrix were normalized by column:

(2) Derive the sum for each row:

(3) Obtain the weights of B1, B2, B3 and B4 by the following formulae:

aij(cid:10)

aij =

n
k=1 akj

(i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4)

wi =

aij (i = 1, 2, 3, 4)

j=1

w = (w1, w2, . . . , wn)T

wi =

wi(cid:10)

i=1 wi

(i = 1, 2, 3, 4)

The derived weights of B1, B2, B3 and B4 were 0.4168, 0.1928, 0.1209 and 0.2695,
respectively.

(4) Calculating the eigenvalue of λmax

Based on the corresponding pair-wise comparison matrix of the A–B level, elements in a
level of the hierarchy were related to single elements at the level directly above and ranked
by eigenvector of the matrix. The eigenvalue of λmax was calculated as follows:

λmax =

n(cid:11)

i=1

where W is the corresponding eigenvector of λmax and wi (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) is the weight
value for ranking. The value derived was λmax = 4.0712.

(5) Certifying the consistency of the judgement matrix

To keep the consistency of the judgement matrix, its consistency should be tested by
deﬁning CI as

where CI is the consistency index; λmax is the largest or principal eigenvalue of the matrix
and could be easily calculated from the matrix; and n is the order of the matrix. When the
matrix had a complete consistency, CI = 0. The higher the CI, the worse the consistency
of the matrix (Xu 2002). In this study, CI = 0.0237.

Then, the consistency ratio (CR) was calculated as follows:

CI =

λmax − n
n − 1

CR = CI
RI

(9)

(10)

(11)

where RI is the average of the resulting consistency index depending on the order of the
matrix (Saaty 1977). When CR is less than 0.10, the matrix has a reasonable consis-
tency. Otherwise, the matrix should be changed. The calculated results of weight would
be accepted when the CR was satisfactory (Xu 2002). In this research, RI = 0.90, CR =
0.0263 < 0.10.

3.4.4. Calculation of total ranking
Because of the pair-wise comparison, matrixes of layers B and C were derived by the same
method as those derived for layers A and B. Based on the results of a series of simple
rankings, the weights of all elements in a level of the hierarchy relative to a whole level
directly above were obtained and were totally ranked from the upper layer to the lower layer.
After the above analytical process, the weight of each evaluation factor was determined for
the LESI system (Table 3).

3.5. Calculation of synthetic index and sub-index of environment suitability for major
Chinese cities
The synthetic evaluation index of living environment suitability was adopted to make levels
more conﬁdent and accurate. This was because it is a multi-subject complex system, which
means that values of all indices were overlaid in each evaluation unit. The derived syn-
thetic value was used to determine the living environment suitability. Based on the LESI

information system database, ArcGIS software was used in the calculation of the index,
gradation and creation of the grade map in the synthetic evaluation of living environment
suitability. The process of calculation was as follows: (1) a characteristic database of each
evaluation unit was established; (2) the four sub-indices of living environment suitability
for each city were automatically calculated with ArcGIS based on the weight of each factor
after standardization and quantization of the thematic data; (3) the quantiﬁcation evaluation
of living environment suitability was carried out with the method of multi-level weighted
sum; and (4) the output represented the synthetic index of living environment suitability
evaluation.

The synthetic evaluation value of each city was the sum of the corresponding weight

values of all related factors by using the equation

where LESI is the synthetic index of living environment suitability, r is the value of each
index, w is the weight of each index and n is the total number of indices, i = 1, 2, 3, . . ., n.

3.6. Gradation of living environment suitability
The evaluation of living environment suitability was aimed not only at determining the
living environment suitability but also to identify factors that cause deterioration of liv-
ing environment suitability. This was helpful in seeking ways to reduce the rate of onset
of deteriorating factors or to reduce or reverse their impact. The synthetic index of living
environment suitability evaluation was graded with the spatial analysis module of ArcGIS.
According to the equality distribution function, the results of the synthetic evaluation index
and each sub-index were graded into ﬁve levels. Each level presented the spatial distribu-
tion speciality and the regional differences of living environment suitability. The numbers
ranging from 1 to 5 were assigned to better, good, middle, bad and worse. The classiﬁed
boundaries of the evaluation factors are shown in Tables 4–9.

3.7. Creation of grade maps

The thematic maps with ArcGIS were created based on the evaluation index of each fac-
tor, including grade maps of natural environment index (NEI), convenience and livable
degree index (CLI), natural resource index (NRI), economic condition index (EPI) and

cost of living, especially for housing, has impacted on the economic position of more and
more people. For example, as house prices go up proportionally, fewer people can afford
to buy a house in favoured cities such as Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing. Compared with
B1 and B4, B2 (NEI) and B3 (NRI) were less important in inﬂuencing living suitability,
but should not be ignored because natural environment and natural resources are directly
related to living environment suitability.

4.1. Analysis of economic condition sub-indices
The results for economic condition show that 10 (28%) cities had better, good and middle
grades (Table 4). The map of economic condition illustrates the signiﬁcant difference of
economic development of cities in the east and west of China, the most developed cities
being on the Chinese east coast, the Yangtze River Delta and the Bohai Central District
(Figure 3). Shenzhen and Shanghai are deﬁned as the most developed cities; Beijing,

Guangzhou, Ningbo and Hangzhou are more developed cities; while Nanjing, Xiamen,
Dalian and Qingdao are developed cities. The remaining 25 cities deﬁned as having bad and
worse grades of economic condition are located in the central and western regions of China.
Regional disparities of economic development are a feature of the world, particularly in
low- and middle-income countries (Fan et al. 2010).

The imbalance of economic development between eastern and midwestern cities has
two main causes, the ﬁrst arising from geographical factors and the second from gov-
ernment policy (Wang and Xu 2009). Geographically eastern Chinese coastal cities have
better infrastructure and more convenient transportation linking them to overseas markets
and fostering development of export industries. The development of export industry has
been very rapid during the last 30 years and this has been aided by favourable government
policies. Some southeastern coastal cities, for example, Shenzhen, began to carry out spe-
cial preferential policies from the time China launched its reform and opening policy in
1978. The result of this policy is that the economy of these cities is integrated with the rest
of the world with huge direct foreign investment and establishment of modern industries.

4.2. Analysis of natural environment sub-indices

Seven cities had worse and bad grades for natural environments and 28 had better, good
and middle grades (Table 5). Cities in the east, the centre and the south of China have better
natural environments than the cities in the north of China (Figure 4).

The highest value of NEI was for the cities of Haikou, Nanchang, Xiamen, Shenzhen
and Fuzhou. The next highest values of NEI were for cities in the Yangtze River Delta
region, the Bohai Central District and the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau. An explanation for
this is that these cities have humid and semi-humid climates that provide better air and
water quality, higher green coverage rate and more green space. The days of air quality
equal to or above grade II exceed at least 300 in these cities (Table 6). Lower values of
NEI were derived for Xining, Harbin and Shijiazhuang and even lower values for Urumqi,
Taiyuan, Beijing and Lanzhou. These cities are located in semiarid regions so that their
climates contribute to poorer air quality, less water and less green coverage rate. The days
of air quality equal to or above grade II in 2007 of 252 in Urumqi, 269 in Taiyuan, 246 in
Beijing and 271 in Lanzhou are rather low (Table 6).

4.3. Analysis of natural resource sub-indices

The number of cities with better, good and middle grades for NRIs was 18, while 17 cities
had bad and worse grades (Table 7). The grade map of NRI (Figure 5) showed a signiﬁcant
difference of natural resources between southern and northern cities.

Cities in the southern China have better natural resources than the northern cities. There
are two main reasons for this. First, water resources in China are more plentiful in the
south and east and are limited short in the north and west. The concentration of water
resources is greatly different from the concentrations of population and cultivated land.
This makes it necessary to convey water from distant areas straddling big river basins
(Zhong 1999). The second reason relates to land as the study is based on the population
density of developed districts. China’s economy has grown continuously and quickly since
the reform and opening up and gross domestic product has increased nearly 40 times from
1979 to 2007. This growth has greatly increased the process of urbanization in China, a
process that started in the coastal cities of southern China. Under these circumstances, the
per capita surface area of developed districts is mostly larger in the southern cities than in
the northern cities of China (Zhu 2009).

4.4. Analysis of convenience and livable degree sub-indices

Twenty-ﬁve or 71.4% of the cities were graded as better, good and middle grades of CLI
(Table 8). Three cities, Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai (Figure 6), had the worse grade and
this relates to the high average selling price of commercial houses (Figure 7) arising from
the sustained high-speed economic development of these cities. Educational resources are
limited, and the trafﬁc density is very high in these densely populated cities.

Kunming, Urumqi, Fuzhou and Nanchang had the better grades for CLI (Figure 6).
CLI is high in these cities principally because the average selling price of commercial
houses is lower (Figure 7). As the population densities of these cities are lower, educa-
tion resources are more accessible to the general public and trafﬁc movements are more
convenient. Further, water supply and power supply are favourable for these cities.

4.5. Analysis of synthetic living environment suitability
Nineteen or 54% of the cities had better, good and middle grades of LESI (Table 9). These
19 cities are located in the southeast coast of China and the Yangtze River Delta (Figure 8).
The cities with better grade, Shenzhen, Ningbo, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, have beautiful
environments, abundant natural resources and the most productive economies (Figures 3–
5). Although these cities have the worse grade of CLI (Figure 6), grades for the other three
indices contribute to high LESI grades (Table 9).

As the capital of China, Beijing’s economy (EPI) is relatively well developed
(Figure 3), but its LESI is in the middle grade (Figure 8). This is because the city has
low grades of CLI, NEI and NRI.

Seven cities, Lanzhou, Sian, Harbin, Xining, Chongqing, Taiyuan and Wuhan, with the
worse grade for LESI are located in central and north China (Figure 8). These cities are
in less developed regions, their natural environment is poor (Figure 4) and their natural
resource is limited (Figure 5). Another contributing effect is that some of these cities, for
example, Chongqing municipality, have large rural areas.

the 2011 Urban Blue Book. This report provides a comprehensive evaluation of cities
in terms of integrated urban scientiﬁc development. This is the ﬁrst of the Blue Books
that has included a measure of living environment suitability. Consequently, as there are
no estimates of living environment suitability given in the 2007 Urban Blue Book, the
best comparison we can make with our 2007 LESI is with the 2010 values. The living
environment of 35 major cities listed in the 2011 report is shown in Table 10.

It can be seen from Table 10 that cities located in the Yangtze River Delta, Bohai
Central District and Pearl River Delta have better living environments. This is consistent
with our results (Figure 8). But there are still some differences between the LESI we derived
and the living environment suitability measures given in the 2011 Blue Book, because the
factors used in the two assessments are not exactly the same and the methods that were
used were also different. There may also have been changes in the factors that determine
living environment suitability between 2007 and 2010.

5. Conclusion
By combining the methods of AHP and GIS, this study used the factors of natural environ-
ment, economic strength, convenience and livable degree and natural resources as indices.
Then, an evaluation model was established to quantitatively calculate the LESI values for
35 of China’s largest cities. The output of evaluation indices for each factor derived from
the model was presented as thematic maps produced with ArcGIS.

The following conclusions are drawn from these estimations and maps:

(1) Economic condition is the base of living environment suitability and its weight
is biggest in evaluating LESI. The convenience and livable degree affects every-
day life, and its weight is larger than the remaining two factors. Although natural
environment and natural resources are important, it is considered that their inﬂu-
ence on living environment can be reduced by the application of science and
technology.

(2) Cities in eastern and especially coastal regions of China have the best living envi-
ronments (LESI). China’s reform and opening-up policy began in these regions,
and the policy of encouraging economic development has been signiﬁcant in
improving people’s living conditions in these regions.

(3) Cities with the lowest LESI are in central and north China. Because of the uneven
development of regional economies in China, central and particularly western
regions generally lag behind the coastal areas of eastern China. In particular,
convenience and livable degree is low in northwestern cities.

The integration of AHP and GIS, which provides a powerful tool for ranking sites based
on multiple attributes, can be applied to any city of China or indeed the world to analyse
living environment suitability. With the rapid development of the Chinese economy, there
are many issues to be addressed in relation to the impact of economic development on
living conditions in the country’s cities. The analytical methods developed and applied in
our study should be useful for analysis of the factors that deﬁne living environments of the
almost 700 cities in China. Deﬁnition and ranking of these factors would aid planning and
action to ameliorate negative impacts of industrialization, population growth and urban-
ization on the environments of these cities in order to make them more pleasant places for
people to work and live in.

Abstract

Sprawl  measures  have  largely  been  neglected  in  land‐use 

forecasting models. The current approach for land‐use allo‐

cation using optimization mostly utilizes objective functions 

and  constraints  that  are  non‐spatial  in  nature.  Application 

of spatial constraints could take care of the contiguity and 

compactness  of  land  uses  and  can  be  utilized  to  address 

urban sprawl. Because a land‐use model is used as an input 

to transportation modeling, a better spatial allocation strat‐

egy  for  more  compact  land‐use  projections  will  promote 

better  transportation  planning  and  sustainable  develop‐

ment. This study formulates a scenario‐based approach to 

normative  modeling  of  urban  sprawl.  In  doing  so,  it  seeks 

to improve the land‐use projections by employing a spatial 

optimization  model  with  contiguity  and  compactness  con‐

sideration. This study incorporates urban sprawl measures 

based on smart growth principles together with a mixed‐use 

factor, and adjacency consideration of nearby land uses. The 

objective  function  used  in  the  study  maximizes  net  suita‐

bility based on imposed constraints. These constraints are 

based on smart growth principles that enhance walkability 

in neighborhoods, promote better health for residents, and 

encourage mixed‐use development. The formulated model 

has  been  applied  to  Collin  County,  TX,  a  fast‐developing 

suburban  county  located  to  the  north  of  the  Dallas–Fort 

Worth metroplex. The suitability of land cells indicates the 

probability  of  conversion,  which  is  calculated  using  spatial

discrete choice analysis with Moran eigenvector spatial fil‐

ploying factors of the built environment, and socioeconomic 

and  demographic  characteristics.  This  study  demonstrates 

how  spatial  proximity  between  land  uses,  which  has  been

better mixing of different land uses based on constraints im‐

Population  growth  has  been  the  most  important  motivator  of  urban  growth.  During  the  last  two  decades,  the 

world has experienced the largest population growth in its history, with growth continuing to be concentrated 

both within and adjacent to metropolitan areas. In most cases, this recent urbanization mostly resulted in a rapid 

spatial  expansion  of  urban  areas,  with  uncoordinated  urban  growth  and  urban  sprawl  (Batty,  Besussi,  &  Chin, 

2003). Current population projections suggest continued and substantial growth over the next few decades (UN, 

2017) that may lead to increased suburbanization. Such outward expansion of suburban and rural development 

encroaches a large amount of farmland and forest (Radeloff, Hammer, & Stewart, 2005), and brings adverse ef‐

fects to the environment (Ewing, 2008; Johnson, 2001).

Urban sprawl is viewed as relatively low‐populated residential and employment areas combined with low‐den‐

sity suburbanization in the urban fringe (Glaeser & Kahn, 2003; Kahn, 2000). Such development leads to highly 

unsustainable and inefficient utilization of land, leading to air (Stone, 2008) and water pollution (Tu, Xia, Clarke, & 

Frei, 2007), diminishing human health (Stone, Hess, & Frumkin, 2010), inadequate public transportation systems 

(Bertaud, 2004), and increasingly expensive infrastructure facilities and services (Carruthers & Ulfarsson, 2003; 

Zhang, 2004). Sprawl has been noted as both a cause and a consequence of urban problems, reflecting the two‐

way connection between land use and transportation (Glaeser & Kahn, 2003). Due to urban sprawl, open space 

is  gradually  replaced  by  urban  structures,  resulting  in  the  loss  of  parks  and  open  spaces  (Brueckner  &  Largey, 

2008). It makes people live further away from the city center, and drive longer distances and more frequently 

(Kahn, 2000). As the mode choice is limited in suburban areas, it creates traffic congestion (Rode et al., 2017). 
Urban sprawl also leads to racial and income segregation (Galster & Cutsinger, 2007) and limits upward mobility1  

(Ewing, Hamidi, Grace, & Wei, 2016) in society. Different income groups have different spending limits and can‐

not travel equal distances. Low‐income groups prefer downtown areas or areas served by public transportation, 

while higher‐income groups prefer areas further from downtown, accessible by automobile only. This segregation 

in  income  levels  exacerbates  racial  segregation,  as  lower‐income  groups  tend  to  be  mostly  minorities  (Chetty, 

Hendren, Kline, Saez, & Turner, 2014).

These are essential societal problems meriting redress. To reach a solution, the following research question 

needs to be answered: Can sprawl be used as a measure in a land‐use forecasting model to get improved projec‐

tion scenarios for future land uses? As the forecast land‐use plan acts as an input to the travel demand model, if 

the projected land‐use plan has sprawl, the transportation plan will encourage sprawl. Therefore, a need exists for 

sound land‐use projections that can be integrated with transportation planning, particularly in rapid urban growth 

areas,  and  hence  a  need  for  urban  sprawl  forecasts.  New  Urbanism  (Leccese  &  McCormick,  2000),  along  with 

other advocacy groups such as smart growth (O'Neill, 1999), have been involved in developing planning guide‐

lines against urban sprawl. Such urban growth is characterized by pedestrian‐friendly development, multi‐nodal 

transportation coordination, and urban redevelopment. The measures of smart growth have been advocated by 

SINHA ANd GRIFFITH    |  747

the “Charter of the New Urbanism” (Talen, 2013), which recommends that mixed‐use development (commercial, 

civic, residential, public spaces, and other) should be incorporated in each community at the neighborhood scale. 

It advocates for short commute and walkability of a neighborhood, so that residents can walk or bike to their des‐

tinations, and recommends alternative forms of transportation (Calthorpe, 1993). In this context we developed a 

land‐use model that incorporates some of the guiding principles of New Urbanism, encouraging less auto‐depen‐

dence, walkability, and diverse, mixed‐use landscapes. Such a model could potentially lessen the environmental 

impacts and social costs of sprawling development growth. The remainder of this article is structured as follows. 

In Section 2, we provide a background review on current land‐use models, which forms the basis of our simulation 

experiment. Our methodology and covariates are presented in Sections 3 and 4. The final three sections present 

our results and provide a discussion and conclusion.

A land‐use model simulates the location choice of household and employer, leading to a distribution of household 

and employment. Some of these models are aggregate models, which simulate the change at zonal level, while a 

few are disaggregate models, simulating the change at parcel level. In general, land‐use models can be classified 

into two main perspectives: normative vs. predictive. The normative perspective of land use is the “desired” or 

“optimum” pattern. It asks the “what should be” question. Its purpose is “what should be” the land‐use patterns to 

ensure certain goals (e.g. goals based on sustainable land use or environmental conservation). Predictive theories 

postulate “what will happen” in the future, based on trends from past/empirical data. A land‐use model employing 

suitability analysis coupled with rule‐based allocation is an example of a normative model. Suitability analysis is 

a geographical process used to determine the appropriateness of a given area for a particular use (Malczewski, 

2004, 2006). The method relies on a subject matter expert to describe the relationship between the suitability 

and a given set of criteria or factors that describe the environment. Examples of predictive models include mathe‐

matical models such as spatial interaction‐based models (Hunt, Kriger, & Miller, 2005), input/output‐based models 

(Abraham & Hunt, 1999; De La Barra & Anez, 1998), and microsimulation‐based models (Landis, 1994; Waddell et al., 

2003). These land‐use models forecast and allocate population and employment to small areas/zones in a way 

well suited for input into a travel demand model. These models use historical data coupled with a behavioral and 

economic theory to make forecasts.

Based on the application purpose and modeling technique, each model had its limitations. Some (e.g. input/

output‐based models and gravity‐based models) cannot be applied to small areas, as they assume the model area 

is a closed system. The other major criticism of predictive models is their business‐as‐usual (BAU) nature. Almost 

all of these models try to simulate and capture the forces that brought the present situation into existence, to 

extrapolate to the future for projections and planning. This perspective means that these models facilitate growth 

outward—meaning  more  sprawl,  or  BAU.  Rule‐based  land‐use  models  are  useful  tools  for  long‐range  scenario 

testing and impact of policy decisions because they are easy to apply, and the data required to operate them are 

generally available. However, the allocation of land uses generated by these models is not guaranteed to be opti‐

mal (Anjomani, 1984; Church, 2002). Normative models usually portray the “ideal” situation and lay out principles 

that can be applied universally. To make a model that can be applied universally, the model is often abstracted 

into simple measures, with strong assumptions. In contrast, predictive models are made functional based on the 

specific study area and empirical data, applied in situations where abstract assumptions don't hold or aren't clearly 

visible. The integration of predictive and normative theories results in optimization‐based models.

Optimization‐based models consist of one or more objective functions and a set of constraints. The land is 

allocated to each land‐use type to optimize one or more objectives. Possible objectives include minimization of 

environmental impacts or maximization of the benefits of sustainable development. Examples of this kind of con‐

ceptualization are the Hebert–Stevens linear programming model (Herbert & Stevens, 1960; Wheaton, 1974) and

of sprawl.

the technique of optimal placement of activities in zones (TOPAZ) (Dickey & Leiner, 1983), which was developed 

to allocate land‐use activities for the Penn–Jersey Transportation Study. There is also a significant part of the liter‐

ature that is concerned with simultaneous optimization of land‐use assignment and transportation, with the focus 

on minimizing sprawl (i.e. minimizing travel cost) (Los, 1978; Moore II & Gordon, 1990; Ouyang & Lam, 2009; Vold, 

2005). The increasing popularity of the concept of sustainability has led to research focusing on sustainable spatial 

optimization of land‐use allocation (Ligmann‐Zielinska, Church, & Jankowski, 2005; Ward, Murray, & Phinn, 1999), 

which also accounts for sprawl partially using density‐based constraints (Cao & Huang, 2010; Gabriel, Faria, & 

Moglen, 2006) and compactness‐based constraints. As the measures of sprawl are interdependent, the rationale 

for using such a measure is that increasing compactness or density would automatically lead to the minimization 

Gabriel et al. (2006) take a multi‐objective foundation approach to controlling sprawl in land development. 

They do so by taking into account objectives from the perspective of the government, planners, environmental‐

ists,  conservationists,  and  land  developers.  They  intend  to  balance  trade‐offs  between  the  different  objective 

functions.  They  employ  linear  and  quadratic  objective  functions,  subject  to  polyhedral  and  binary  constraints, 

to  specify  a  quadratic  mixed  integer  program  (QMIP).  Spatially,  the  various  objectives  considered  in  their  arti‐

cle were maximizing compactness, minimizing impervious areas, protection of certain environmentally sensitive 

areas, and maximizing the total value of developed land pieces. Ligmann‐Zielinska, Church & Jankowski (2008) de‐

veloped an optimization model that utilizes a multi‐objective optimization to minimize open space development, 

incompatibility between land uses, distance to already developed areas, and redevelopment of inner regions. This 

model employs a constraint to limit population density. They suggest that having density as an objective function 

might result in an unsustainable solution. Cao, Huang, Wang, and Lin (2012) used compactness along with several 

other factors in a multi‐objective optimization of land use to create a sustainable development pattern. Kumar, 

Rosenberger, and Iqbal (2016) applied a mixed‐integer programming model to optimize land use to a smaller area 

based on density factors, mixed‐use factors, street factors, and center factors.

In this study, we develop an integer programming model for land‐use optimization. The objective of the model 

is to maximize suitability as well as manage sprawl. The constraints are constructed based on smart growth prin‐

ciples. In the literature mentioned above, few have accounted for measuring and minimizing sprawl clearly and 

comprehensively.  Instead,  the  focus  has  been  on  sustainability,  which  focuses  on  the  broader  context  of  the 

land‐use problem. If sprawl itself is focused on and minimized, then all the other symptoms of sprawl, like pollu‐

tion and low‐density development, would be minimized. This research uses a two‐phase procedure for land‐use 

modeling:  a  predictive  land‐use  model  for  development  potentials  and  a  land‐use  projection  model.  Further,  a 

normative  conceptualization  is  developed,  considering  what  the  optimal  allocation  of  land  use  should  be  with 

sprawl management.

For land‐use projections and forecasting, an analysis using variables causing the change is required. Such analysis 

of land‐use changes in a discrete choice framework requires consideration of spatial effects. The land‐use deci‐

sions are often spatially autocorrelated, and spatial components account for the spillover effect of neighboring 

land uses. Ignoring the spatial effects leads to inefficient and sometimes biased estimators. Estimation for spatial 

models becomes challenging for large datasets in a discrete choice framework. In this context we have utilized a 

Moran eigenvector spatial filtering (MESF) (Getis & Griffith, 2002; Griffith, 2003) specification, which is a rela‐

tively new method. MESF is a spatial statistical methodology that captures the inherent spatial autocorrelation 

(SA) in geo‐referenced observations by using a set of synthetic proxy variables, which are extracted as eigenvec‐

tors from a spatial connectivity matrix, and then adds these vectors as control variables to a model specification. 

SINHA ANd GRIFFITH    |  749

This study uses the MESF‐based multinomial logistic (MNL) model coupled with a discrete choice theory to esti‐

mate the transition probabilities of land pixels (Figure 1).

3.1 | Predictive land‐use model

A land development potential model exploits spatial econometrics to calculate development potential by apply‐

ing multinomial logistic regression. Theoretically, if we establish a relationship between explanatory variables 

and the choice of land‐use development (e.g. residential vs. commercial) from past data, then we can use this 

relationship to project the development of land parcels with similar characteristics. The MNL model has a logis‐

tic equation with a logit (log of odds of land developed for land use type i at time t2) term on the left‐hand side 
as the dependent variable and all the relevant factors at time t1 with their related coefficients in linear form, 
akin to a regression model, on the right‐hand side. In this logit formulation, the dependent variable measures 

change in land use between, say, 2000 (base year) and 2010, from undeveloped to one of the selected land uses 

for the model.

3.1.2 | Method of estimation

To  calculate  the  estimators  of  discrete  choice  models,  the  conventional  maximum  likelihood  estimation  proce‐

dure becomes cumbersome and infeasible as the likelihood function involves integrals of dimension equal to the 

sample  size.  Other  proposed  estimators  in  the  literature  provide  consistent  estimates  for  spatially  dependent 

binary choice data (e.g. LeSage, 2000; Pinkse & Slade, 1998). However, these estimators become infeasible in large 

datasets due to their requirement for the inversion of large matrices. Sidharthan and Bhat (2012) apply the maxi‐

mum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) approach for a multinomial probit (MNP) model that 

involves spatiotemporal land‐use data. This methodology worked for a small dataset but can be cumbersome to 

apply for a large dataset. Another recent study by Carrion‐Flores, Flores‐Lagunes, and Guci (2009) superimposed 

a spatial lag structure on an MNL model using a linearized version of Pinkse and Slade's (1998) generalized method 

of  moments  (GMM)  approach.  However,  it  is  based  on  a  two‐step  instrumental  variable  estimation  technique 

after linearizing around zero interdependence, and so works well only in the case of large sample size estimation 

and weak spatial dependence. Chakir and Parent (2009) use a Bayesian MCMC methodology to estimate an MNP 

model of land‐use change, which requires extensive simulation, is time‐consuming, and not straightforward to im‐

plement. MESF is a comparatively newer technique that does not involve inversion of matrices and is much simpler 

to apply. Few studies have used MESF in land‐use modeling (Sinha, 2014, 2017; Wang, Kockelman, & Wang, 2013).

Briefly, MESF extracts eigenvectors from a spatial weights matrix, and uses them as independent variables in a 

stepwise regression specification (Griffith, 2003). Computationally efficient calculations for this technique are avail‐

able for both linear and generalized linear models (e.g. Chun, Griffith, Lee, & Sinha, 2016); however, they have not 

been implemented for multinomial models. For a binomial dataset, MESF requires shorter and more straightforward 

computation. In the case of a multinomial dataset, the computation time increases significantly. The k eigenvectors 

are selected from the candidate set using stepwise multinomial logistic regression, maximizing the model fit at each 

step, which requires a substantial computation time as n increases. To reduce the computation time for MESF in the 

multinomial setting, Sinha (2014, 2017) proposed decreasing the number of eigenvectors in the candidate set by 

making the spatial resolution for the eigenvectors coarser. The spatial resolution of the response variable was kept

at finer resolution, but the eigenvectors were calculated at coarser resolution, as shown in Figure 2a in which nine 

cells of eigenvectors have been aggregated into one larger cell for spatial effect, as shown in Figure 2b.

3.2 | Allocation model

To constrain urban sprawl, possible formulations would be to consider certain measures for smart growth and New 

Urbanism. These measures have been advocated by the “Charter of New Urbanism” and other smart growth ad‐

vocacy groups (Talen & Ellis, 2002). Smart growth is a concept from urban planning that advocates a compact land 

development model focusing on downtowns and town centers, characterized by higher density, incorporating a mix‐

ture of land uses and providing a wider range of transportation choices. The “Charter of New Urbanism” (Congress 

for the New Urbanism, 2000) is composed of three sections (region: metropolis/city/town; neighborhood/district/

corridor; and block/street/building). This study uses the following excerpts from the neighborhood/district/corridor 

section of the Charter:

1.  Neighborhoods  should  be  compact,  pedestrian‐friendly,  and  mixed‐use.

2.  Concentrations of civic, institutional, and commercial activity should be embedded in neighborhoods and dis‐

tricts, not isolated in remote, single‐use complexes.

3.  Many activities of daily living should occur within walking distance, allowing independence to those who do not 

4.  A range of parks, from tot‐lots and village greens to ball fields and community gardens, should be distributed

within neighborhoods.

These guidelines are incorporated using the contiguity of pixels, and that controls the compactness and increased 

walkability in a neighborhood. A commonly accepted rule‐of‐thumb is that one's neighborhood could be considered 

walkable if services, facilities, and amenities—what one needs for daily life—are within 0.25 to 0.5 miles of one's home, 

with a maximum cutoff of 1.5 miles (Talen & Koschinsky, 2017). As a scenario analysis, this study uses 0.75 miles 

(1,200 m) for shops and services and 0.5 miles (750 m) for parks and open spaces.

For the current study, land cells are aggregated into the following six mutually exclusive land‐use catego‐

ries: (1) Single Family (SF); (2) Multi‐Family (MF); (3) Commercial (C); (4) Industrial (I); (5) Open Space (OS); and 
(6) Vacant (V). The development suitability of location i for land use j can be represented as Pij (probability of 

SINHA ANd GRIFFITH752  |    

conversion to land use i at location j). Let the binary 0–1 variable Xij denote the allocation of land use j to cell 
i, where i = 1, …, n and j is the selected land‐use category according to demand. The objective function to be 
optimized is a function of suitability indices Pij whose values record the suitability of assigning use j to cell i. If 
land use j is allocated to cell i, then Xij will take the value 1; otherwise, Xij takes the value 0, which indicates that 
land use j is not allocated to cell i. As such, Xij is the solution matrix for the land‐use problem as formulated in 
the optimization model:

where Z is the total net benefit for the area as a whole and M represents the demand for each of m land uses, in the 

proposed research. The set of constraints is needed to restrict a piece of land to only one land use. The solution is 
a permutation matrix Xij that has one 1 and the remainder zeros in each row. The solution to this problem does not 
consider the interaction between land uses, which can be used to control sprawl. To incorporate sprawl and adja‐

cency measures, the location index i can be linked to (u, v) coordinates, where u is the horizontal axis and v is the 

vertical axis.

The additional notation used in the model is as follows:

u = the set of horizontal indices of the centroid of land pixels (varies from 1 to nu)
v = the set of vertical indices of the centroids of the land pixels (varies from 1 to nv)
Puvj = the probability of conversion land pixel (u, v) from vacant to land use j ∈ M

Equation (7) maximizes the net suitability of land uses. Equation (8) ensures that the total allocation for each 

land use is within the lower and upper bounds of the specified requirements. Equation (9) ensures that a single 

land pixel is allocated to only one land use. Equation (10) ensures that the decision variable is binary. Equations 

(11) and (12) are for the edge effect which ensures that all the decision variables outside the boundary are forced 

to be zero. Equation (13) ensures that if a pixel is not vacant, it will not be considered in the allocation process. If 
a pixel (u, v) is vacant VCuv1 takes the value 1, otherwise 0. When a pixel is developed, VCuv1 − Duvj can take either 
value 0 when Duvj is 0 or −1 when Duvj is 1 for any value of j. Since VCuv1 − Duvj cannot be greater than 0, Duvj is forced 
to be zero. Equations (14)–(16) are logical constraints associated with scenarios 2, 3, and 4 as discussed below:

Scenario 1: The base scenario as expressed in Equation (7), where the net probability of conversion is maximized.

This constraint makes sure that if pixel (u, v) is assigned to single‐family land use, there will be at least two near‐

est‐neighbor pixels allocated to single‐family land use. A 5 × 5 geographical landscape is shown in Figure 3a. If 

the center pixel is assigned to residential, there have to be at least two allocations of residential land use adja‐

cent to it. The first‐order queen neighbor is shown in gray. Figures 3b and c represent two possible allocations.

Scenario 3: Expanding scenario 2, at least one commercial pixel is located in “a” pixel proximity of residential 

land use. The accompanying constraint is:

if (Duvj1

+ Duvj2

= 1) ⇒

Duvj3

≥ 1 ∀j3 ∈ commercial land use

(18)

u+a

v+a

∑u=u−a

∑v=v−a

Figure  3d  portrays  one  such  possible  allocation.  In  this  case,  the  value  of  “a”  is  8,  which  ensures  that  in 

8 × 150 m = 1,200 m distance around a given pixel there will be at least one allocation of commercial land use. Single

and multi‐family land use are both residential land use, denoted by j1 and j2. The logical constraints are formulated as 
for pixel (u, v): the summation of land use type j1 and j2 is 1, then in the 8‐pixel proximity of that (u, v) there is at least 
one allocation of commercial land use. By ensuring an allocation of commercial land use within walking distance, this 

constraint makes a neighborhood less dependent on the car for convenience or deli shopping (Figure 3).

Scenario 4: Location of parks and open spaces increases walkability and makes a neighborhood livelier. This 

constraint is similar to the previous constraint. In addition to the previous constraints, at least one open‐space 

pixel is in the proximity of residential land use. The accompanying constraint is:

if (Duvj1

+ Duvj2

= 1) ⇒

Duvj5

≥ 1

u+b

v+b

∑u=u−b

∑v=v−b

(19)

This logical constraint makes sure that for pixel (u, v) the summation of land use type j1 and j2 is 1, then in “b” 
pixel proximity of that (u, v) there is at least one allocation of the park. The “b” parameter can be based on the 

mode choice of the neighborhood. The “Charter of New Urbanism” advocates that this distance should ideally not 

be more than 0.5 miles (Leccese & McCormick, 2000).

The study area selected for this research is Collin County, TX. With a total area of 886 square miles and a pop‐

ulation  of  782,341  (2010  census),  Collin  County,  TX  is  a  suburban  county  located  in  the  northern  part  of  the 

Dallas–Fort  Worth  metroplex.  The  study  area  is  divided  into  approximately  101,874  square  cells  (pixels),  each 

with  dimension  150  ×  150  m.  The  land‐use  dataset  for  2000  and  2010  (NCTCOG,  2013)  is  obtained  from  the 

North Central Texas Council of Governments regional data center. The study area is divided into approximately 

101,874 square cells (pixels), each with dimension 150 × 150 m and six mutually exclusive land‐use categories. 

The centroid of each cell is designated to the land use of the parcel located in that grid cell. If a grid cell has more 

than one parcel, the cell is assigned to that land use in which its centroid falls. If the centroid falls well within the 

right‐of‐way of an arterial roadway or other roadways with high land‐use access functionality, the corresponding

grid cell is assigned to the predominant land use of the adjacent area. However, if the centroid of a grid cell falls 

within a major highway, which primarily serves the functionality of through movement, the corresponding grid 

cell has been removed from the analysis. The preceding method may lead to some level of misclassification error 

due to the cell size restriction. Small land parcels, like neighborhood‐level shopping or industrial land use, which 

have dimension less than 150 × 150 m, may not be well represented. This process of assigning land use based on 

centroid location results in the misclassification being randomly distributed across the study area. Figures 4a and 

b show different land uses in 2000 and 2010. After masking floodplain, highways, and utilities land use, 89,793 

pixels have been distributed in six land‐use categories.

The  distribution  of  land  use  in  2000  and  2010,  and  the  percentage  change  in  land  use  between  2000  and 

2010, is shown in Table 1. It shows that compared to 19,664 developed land‐use pixels in 2000, 25,759 pixels have 

developed between 2000 and 2010, which is a 131% increase in 10 years. Figure 5 displays the change in land use 

from vacant to five land‐use categories.

The  independent  variables  have  been  grouped  into  three  categories:  natural  environment,  built  environ‐

ment,  and  socioeconomic  variables.  The  natural  environment  factors  typically  include  water  resources,  wildlife

or endangered species habitat, soil types, and slope. Due to safety and environmental concerns, several natural 
environment factors, such as the degree of slope, floodplains, and sensitive habitats, prohibit development.2  The 

water body layer and 100‐year floodplain layer mapped by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 

have  been  masked  from  the  study  area.  For  the  built  environment  factors,  the  selected  variables  are  based  on 

accessibility and/or proximity of land parcels to the location of specific activities. These factors typically include 

(but are not limited to) employment centers, airports, highways, major road intersections, schools, city centers, 

shopping  centers,  and  public  transit  facilities.  Socioeconomic  variables  include  population,  economic  condition, 

housing characteristics, vacancy rate, and employment characteristics. These data are available at the block group 

level from the U.S. Census Bureau (http://geogr aphic resea rch.com/simpl ymap).

The selection of the explanatory variables depends on the characteristics of the planning area and the cat‐

egories of development or land use considered. Every region has unique specific natural environment as well as 

built environment features. Table 2 enumerates the descriptive statistics of the explanatory variables used in this 

study for the year 2000, and 2010. It has 14 built environment factors, 9 socioeconomic factors, and 3 natural 

environment factors. The year 2010 column shows all the factors which changed in the last 10 years. Since the 

natural environment factors tend not to change with time, these cells are blank.

Many of these variables are collinear; the relevant variables were selected using principal component analysis 

(PCA) of the continuous variables. Out of 25 continuous variables, the cumulative effect of 21 principal compo‐

nents accounts for 96% of the variability in the explanatory variables (Table 3), indicating a low level of multi‐
collinearity. The condition number, defined as 𝜅 = 𝜆max∕𝜆min, represents the ratio of variances. Since all condition 
numbers are below 100 (Table 3), this indicates a low level of multicollinearity.

The MESF model is used to account for SA in data as part of the multinomial logistic regression equation specifi‐

cation. The next coarser pixel resolution of eigenvectors, 450 × 450 m, has been used (i.e. 3 × 3 pixels have been 

aggregated  for  the  eigenfunction  calculation  while  keeping  the  geographic  resolution  of  the  response  variable 

the same). At the coarser resolution, 2,419 sets of eigenvectors have been selected in the candidate set, each of

which has a Moran's value greater than or equal to 0.25. Figure 6a shows the predicted land use by an MNL model 

with 25 explanatory variables and Figure 6b shows the predicted land uses by MESF‐based MNL model with 25 

explanatory variables and 618 eigenvectors. Comparing predicted to actual change in land use, the non‐spatial 

MNL model has a higher amount of misclassification errors than the spatial MNL model. The spatial MNL model 

achieves a better prediction accuracy for single‐family, commercial, industrial and parks, and open spaces land 

use. Table 4 shows the cross‐tabulation of observed with predicted responses of the same.

The multi‐family land‐use prediction is only 25.11% accurate and has been misclassified mostly into single‐

family and vacant land uses. This finding could be attributable to the absence of an exploratory variable to explain 

multi‐family land‐use changes. Also, both single‐family and multi‐family are residential land uses with mostly simi‐

lar characteristics. Single‐family land use has been predicted with 58% accuracy, commercial land use with 50.14% 

accuracy, and industrial land use with 60.3% accuracy. Open spaces have the least amount of misclassification 

among the developed land uses, and have been predicted with 74.6% accuracy. The accuracy of predicted land 
use has a pseudo‐R2 of 0.6238 and the percentage correctly classified (PCC) for both the categories was high as 

the vacant cells consisted of 78.2%.

For the land‐use projection, socioeconomic variables were collected again from the 2010 census. The built 

environment variables are updated with newly added facilities, schools, shopping, highways, and public transit

facilities. A few of the built environment variables and all environmental variables remain unchanged for 2010. 

Using the coefficients for explanatory variables and eigenvectors, the probability of conversion for the year 2020 

was calculated. Figure 7 shows the probabilities of conversion for 44,370 vacant land use pixels for 2020. These 

values of the probabilities serve as a supply for future land uses.

The population of Collin County, TX in 2010 was 490,682, which is projected to be 813,650 in 2020, indicating a 

65.82% growth in the population of the study area. Table 5 furnishes the same trend in future land requirements for 

2020. Out of 70,129 vacant cells in 2000, 25,759 cells were converted, and 44,370 cells remained vacant in 2010. 

Based on the trend extrapolation, out of 44,370 vacant cells, 16,951 cells may get converted into different land uses 

in 2020. Because the projection always has some uncertainty, this study assumed a 5% variation from the calculated 

projection.

Based  on  the  preceding  multinomial  choice  model,  the  probability  of  conversion  has  been  assigned  to  10,201 

vacant pixels of the study area. CPLEX (IBM, 2014) is used to assign land uses to the best possible locations based 

on conversion probabilities. For the allocation, four scenarios have been analyzed. These scenarios have been de‐

vised based on different constraints imposed on the spatial optimization model. The first scenario is the base case, 

where no spatial constraints are imposed. The second scenario forces the residential land uses to be clustered in 

the base case. The third and fourth scenarios promote walkability by allocating commercial land uses and parks at 

walkable distances. Each of these scenarios is discussed below.

Case 1: A business‐as‐usual situation, where there is no adjacency and policy‐based constraints. Allocation, in 

this case, may be concentrated or dispersed.

Figure 7 shows the development when the allocation model is maximizing the summation of net transition 

probabilities. The 2010 land uses are shown in light colors. It is clear that commercial and industrial developments 

are mostly occurring near the commercial and industrial land use in 2010. Due to the construction of the outer 

loop, compared to 2000–2010, more commercial development is projected in the west of Lavon Lake.

F I G U R E   8  Predicted land‐use change for 2020 (Case 2)

Case 2 represents the scenario when residential land uses (single and multi‐family) are forced to be clustered 

(Figure 8). This effect has been shown at a finer scale in Figure 9.

Figure 9b shows the effect of adding secondary constraints; the yellow pixels indicate that single‐family land 

use is clustered in Figure 9b compared to Figure 9a. Figure 9b does not have any single cell allocations of residen‐

tial land.

Figure 11.

Case 3: Figure 10 represents the scenario where, in addition to the Case 2 constraints, at least one commer‐

cial pixel is located within a mile radius of any residential land use. This effect has been shown on a micro level in 

Figures 11a and b show Case 2 and Case 3 at a smaller level. Figure 11b demonstrates that by imposing adja‐

cency constraints for commercial land use, the maximum distance from red pixels to residential pixels (single and 

multi‐family) is less than or equal to 8 pixels, or 0.75 miles.

Case 4: At least one park and open‐space pixel is located in the 5‐pixel proximity of residential land use. This 

means that the maximum distance one person has to travel to access a park is 0.5 miles. Figures 12 shows the 

allocation based on Case 4. Figures 13a and b show the distribution at the finer level for Cases 3 and 4. For the 

same area, the open spaces are now more evenly distributed.

As the constraints are added one after another, Table 6 shows how the objective function decreases with the 

increased number of constraints. Case 1 is a scenario where no other policy constraints have been considered. 

This is a BAU scenario that has the highest possible objective score.

In  this  study,  we  developed  a  methodology  that  uses  spatial  MNL‐based  projection  to  simulate  the  land‐use 

change based on constraints imposed in the spatial optimization problem. Land‐use data in smaller zones, grids, 

or land parcels can be analyzed using this methodology. The two sub‐models reported here require a specific 

set of data. The first sub‐model uses past and current employment and household data to project future values 

for the region and establishes a parametric relationship between sociodemographic, built environment variables 

and  natural  environment  factors.  The  second  sub‐model  distributes  the  projected  jobs  and  different  types  of 

households based on the indices of each land use in study area zones or cells. The findings of this simulation ex‐

periment can be summarized in two parts: findings for development potential modeling, and findings for spatial 

optimization.

The estimation of a spatial MNL is computationally intensive and very cumbersome for traditional approaches 

such as maximum likelihood, generalized method of moments, and MCMC‐based estimators. The MESF specifi‐

cation accounts for spatial autocorrelation in the response variable. Due to the large study area, the computation 

was feasible by making the resolution of eigenvectors coarser, which decreases the number of eigenvectors in 

the candidate set. Compared to other methods, such as those based on auto‐models, MESF‐based specification is 

relatively more straightforward to apply in a spatial discrete choice model for a large dataset, as it involves com‐

paratively straightforward computation. The MESF‐based model can be transferred to other urban areas, but it 

will require calibrating with the explanatory variable of that area and eigenvectors of that geographic landscape. 

The eigenvectors are unique to its geographic landscape and will vary for each study area.

In the allocation stage, four scenarios of development were analyzed. The first scenario did not consider any 

adjacency or proximity of land uses and has the highest objective function value. However, a single allocation of 

residential pixels was possible. In the second allocation model, a spatial constraint was imposed that forced the 

residential land uses to be clustered. In the third and fourth allocation models, smart growth objectives were imple‐

mented such as parks and open spaces at walkable distances, and light‐use commercial pixels at walkable distances. 

The third model constrains commercial land use to be a maximum of eight cells away from residential land use. It 

ensures that within a certain distance there will be some type of deli or convenience store allocated. Allocating 

pocket parks within five cells increases the walkability of a neighborhood. The constraints used in this study are not 

exhaustive, but show the possibility of considering the compactness of different land uses. Including more spatial 

constraints  in  the  optimization  model  increases  the  computation  time.  This  computation  load  has  a  polynomial 

relationship  with  the  search  radius  of  the  adjacency  effect.  For  the  same  number  of  constraints,  as  the  search 

radius increases, the computation time increases rapidly. Imposing a higher number of constraints in the allocation 

process also impacted the objective score. The type of spatial projections reported here can be aggregated later to 

larger zones as needed, such as traffic analysis zones, providing figures of various employment types and house‐

holds with different socioeconomic categories, which can be used as inputs for transportation demand modeling.

This study contributes to the literature on land‐use optimization, dealing with urban sprawl. Two major contribu‐

tions of this research are: presenting an MESF‐based spatial discrete choice model to obtain the probability of 

land‐use  change  and  to  use  the  proximity  between  land  uses  to  reduce  urban  sprawl.  The  optimization  model 

does not present an exhaustive set of constraints, but showcases the possibility of spatial constraints. A few other 

constraints could also be imposed, such as forbidding industrial land uses adjacent to residential land uses or con‐

straining the density of residential allocation.

This work could be extended in many ways. One possible extension would be considering land‐use control vari‐

ables as covariates. These variables include zoning, minimum/maximum lot size zoning, building height limitations, 

SINHA ANd GRIFFITH766  |    

population density restrictions, impact fees, square footage limitations, and rent control. Including these variables 

can help us to see the effect of this policy on land‐use change and may improve the accuracy of the predictions. 

The second possible extension would be considering the proximity of undeveloped pixels to developed pixels in 

the allocation process. Including developed pixels with constraints in the allocation process will improve the com‐

pactness of land uses. The third possible extension could be the inclusion of “mixed use” as a land‐use category. As 

Collin County, TX is a suburban county, this study only considers land‐use change from vacant to other land uses. 

However, with better computing resources, the same model could be used to calculate the transition probabilities 

for developed land uses along with temporal dynamics for multinomial change models. Finally, a circular search 

could be implemented in future research.

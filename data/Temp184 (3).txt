(Received 28 June 2011; ﬁnal version received 5 October 2012)

The Commission on Geoinformation Infrastructures and Standards of the International
Cartographic Association (ICA) is working on deﬁning models of spatial data
infrastructures (SDIs). SDI models from the enterprise and information viewpoints
of the Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) have already
been presented. Our model from the computational viewpoint identiﬁes the main
computational objects of an SDI and their interfaces, which are modelled using
Uniﬁed Modelling Language (UML) component diagrams. Presented here is the ﬁrst
comprehensive SDI model from the computational viewpoint, which enhances the
understanding of the computational objects and their interactions in an SDI. This
viewpoint complements the previous two and together, the three viewpoints contribute
towards a more holistic interpretation of an SDI, which is independent of speciﬁc
SDI legislation, technology and implementations. For the computational viewpoint,
we identiﬁed six computational objects, SDI Registry, SDI Data, SDI Processing, SDI
Application, SDI Portrayal and SDI Management, and their provided and required inter-
faces. We describe the interactions of the computational objects in stakeholder activities
and the roles they play in the different processes of SDI development and use, which
we identiﬁed as Initiation, Creation, Management, Manipulation, Access, Processing,
Evaluation and Liaison. Two tables summarise the SDI services that are provided by
computational objects for stakeholder activities and SDI processes.

Keywords: spatial data infrastructure (SDI); analytical cartography; reference model;
computational viewpoint; uniﬁed modelling language (UML)

Introduction

Over many decades, spatial data scientists in many parts of the world have worked to
develop mechanisms to share various kinds of scientiﬁc spatial data. More recently, efforts
have been organized to design and build spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) at the global,
regional, national and local levels. There are two major facets to this effort: organizational
and technical. The organizational side is concerned with various groups developing agree-
ments, protocols and policy strategies for the SDI, see Groot and McLaughlin (2000),
Masser (2005), Rajabifard et al. (2006), and Delgado (2005). Another aspect of the orga-
nizational side is the building and maintenance of the organizational structures to maintain
the elements of the SDI, as well as running the daily SDI business.

The second facet of the SDI effort is of a technical nature: designing and implementing
the mechanisms and networks that will bring the SDI to reality. This article focuses on
the technical facet. More speciﬁcally, it discusses the contribution of the Commission on
Geoinformation Infrastructure and Standards of the International Cartographic Association
(ICA) (hereafter called the Commission) by modelling the SDI through the prism of the
various model views of the Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP)
(ISO/IEC 10746-1 1998), using the Uniﬁed Modelling Language (UML) (ISO/IEC 19501
2005, Object Management Group 2011). The work discussed here operates in a broader sci-
entiﬁc milieu of geographical information science and analytical cartography, for example,
see Moellering (2000).

Previous work by the Commission described SDI models from the enterprise and
information viewpoints (Hjelmager et al. 2005, Hjelmager et al. 2008). In this article, the
Commission’s SDI model from the computational viewpoint is presented. The computa-
tional viewpoint is a functional decomposition of a system into a set of objects that interact
at interfaces – enabling system distribution (ISO/IEC 10746-1 1998). This article con-
solidates and reﬁnes earlier work. The initial SDI model from a computational viewpoint
identiﬁed computational objects and brieﬂy described them (Cooper et al. 2007). Further
work identiﬁed the processes of SDI development and use (Cooper et al. 2009). In this
article, the descriptions are reﬁned and examples are added to improve the understanding.
We also consolidate earlier work by describing how stakeholders (identiﬁed in the enter-
prise viewpoint) interact through interfaces (identiﬁed in the computational viewpoint)
during the activities associated with the information classes (identiﬁed in the information
viewpoint).

The remainder of the article is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a short
overview of previous work by the Commission leading up to this article, as well as other
work that is related to ours. Section 3 describes an SDI from the computational viewpoint.
Section 4 links the enterprise, information and computational viewpoints by showing how
stakeholders identiﬁed in the enterprise viewpoint interact through the interfaces identiﬁed
in the computational viewpoint during the activities identiﬁed in the information viewpoint.
Section 5 identiﬁes the different processes of SDI development and use, and then shows
how SDI services are provided by computational objects for these SDI processes. Examples
from the European SDI, INSPIRE (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe), are
included to illustrate the service needs for processes. Two tables summarize the speciﬁc
SDI services for the stakeholders provided by each computational object for each activity
(Table 1 in Section 4) and process (Table 2 in Section 5), respectively. Section 6 eval-
uates the SDI model from a computational viewpoint and provides conclusions on this
work.

2. Previous and related work

2.1. SDI modelling framework
Business and enterprise systems are becoming more and more ﬂexible and increasingly
dependent on local and global communication networks. As a result, the software sys-
tems have to become more modular and distributed throughout these networks. The design
and installation of such distributed systems is a complex task, which requires comprehen-
sive conceptual work before beginning the implementation. The International Standard
ISO/IEC 10746-1 (1998), Information technology – Open Distributed Processing –
Reference model: Overview, aids in this challenge by providing a framework for the design
and description of distributed software and information systems.

RM-ODP deﬁnes ﬁve viewpoints for the design and description of distributed software
and information systems: the enterprise viewpoint (purpose, scope and policies for the
system); the information viewpoint (semantics of information and information processing
incorporated into the system); the computational viewpoint (functional decomposition of
the system into a set of objects that interact at interfaces); the engineering viewpoint (mech-
anisms and functions required to support distributed interaction between objects within the
system) and the technology viewpoint (the speciﬁc technologies chosen for the implemen-
tation). Figure 1 shows the ﬁve RM-ODP viewpoints and their dependencies, with the focus
in this article being on the computational viewpoint.

Earlier research work by the Commission began with a general overview of the SDI
(Aalders and Moellering 2001), and then proceeded to examine SDIs using UML (Cooper
et al. 2003). Subsequently, the Commission developed formal models of SDIs from the
enterprise and information viewpoints of RM-ODP (Hjelmager et al. 2005, 2008). The
investigation of the enterprise viewpoint of an SDI identiﬁed the stakeholders of an SDI
and their activities, that is, the actors and the use cases, in UML; and identiﬁed the core
components of an SDI and their relations.

While the enterprise viewpoint deals mainly with the administrative aspects of an SDI,
the information viewpoint has its focus on the products (data and services), their speciﬁca-
tion, their description via metadata, and product registries (catalogues). For the information
viewpoint, we identiﬁed information classes that are required for SDIs to deliver data
and services and showed how stakeholders are linked to the information classes through
stakeholder activities in an SDI.

2.2. Other attempts at modelling SDIs
There are a number of documents that publish guidelines or speciﬁcations for the soft-
ware architectures of speciﬁc SDI implementations. For example, the INSPIRE Network
Services Architecture (INSPIRE Network Services Drafting Team 2008) describes the
INSPIRE service types that are mandated by the INSPIRE Directive (2007) and shows
how these services connect to portals and applications through the INSPIRE service bus.
Another example is the Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure (CGDI) (Geoconnections
2005), which provides a high-level overview of the CGDI architecture and describes the
range of services that comprise the CGDI. The CGDI architecture endorses the RM-
ODP, and describes elements that can be used to support the information, engineering and
computational RM-ODP viewpoints, while the implementation details of the RM-ODP
technology and engineering viewpoints are left as the responsibility of agencies collab-
orating in the CGDI. Both the INSPIRE Network Service Architecture and the CGDI
architecture are technology independent, similar to the Commission’s scientiﬁc model, but

both of them are bound by the policies and legislation of the respective organizations. The
Commission’s model recognizes that policies and legislation play a role in an SDI, but the
model is independent of speciﬁc policies and legislation, an approach also taken for the
SDI Cookbook (Nebert 2004).

Béjar et al. (2009) analyse published architectural SDI models and based on this anal-
ysis, propose an architectural style for SDI software architectures. This style provides a
tool and a shared vocabulary to help system architects to design SDIs, and facilitates
the exchange of knowledge about them. The style is deﬁned under the component-
and-connector architectural viewtype, extending the client-server and shared-data styles.
In contrast, the functional decomposition into a set of objects provided in the computa-
tional viewpoint of the Commission’s SDI model provides the basis for decisions on how
to distribute objects. The Commission’s model is therefore not restricted to client-server
architectures, but can also be implemented in emerging architectures, such as data grids and
cloud environments. In addition, the Commission’s work provides a holistic view of an SDI
by linking components of the different viewpoints, for example, by listing SDI services
that are performed by objects (computational viewpoint) during stakeholder (enterprise
viewpoint) activities associated with information classes (information viewpoint).

Coetzee (2009) presents Compartimos, a reference model for sharing address data on a
data grid in an SDI environment. The computational viewpoint for Compartimos describes
the essential components, and their relationships and interactions, which are required for
sharing address data on a data grid. In Coetzee and Bishop (2009), commonly available
technology choices for Compartimos are explored. Compartimos is similar to the extended
client-server and shared-data architectural styles of Béjar et al. (2009) because it is speciﬁc
in terms of an architectural style, namely the data grid. The Commission’s model from a
computational viewpoint, on the other hand, does not specify the physical distribution of
the computational objects and is therefore not bound to a speciﬁc architectural style. The
actual distribution of computational objects could be speciﬁed in future in one or more
engineering viewpoints. In addition, while Compartimos is speciﬁc to address data, the
Commission’s model applies to any kind of spatial information.

While there are those who have nominally applied systems theory to SDIs (e.g. Mavima
et al. 2001), they have not actually done so (i.e. considering SDIs as self-regulating sys-
tems), but have rather applied various theories of systems to SDIs (soft systems theory, in
the case of Mavima et al. (2001)). Grus et al. (2010) considered SDIs as complex adap-
tive systems, which are systems that changed from stable and predictable to unstable and
unpredictable, and then exhibited more complex patterns of behaviour. Mansourian and
Abdolmajidi (2011) applied system dynamics to SDIs, that is, where positive and negative
feedback loops are used to model systems with multiple components that mutually inter-
act within a common goal and where the system adjusts internally in response to external
disturbances.

3. Description of an SDI from a computational viewpoint
The computational viewpoint is a functional decomposition of the modelled system into a
set of objects that interact at interfaces, such as to provide services – enabling system dis-
tribution (ISO/IEC 10746-1 1998). In the context of an SDI, the computational viewpoint
captures the details of the computational objects and their interfaces deﬁnitions without
regard to the physical distribution of the objects (i.e. where they actually are located in the
world). The latter is covered by the engineering viewpoint. The computational viewpoint
sets the scene for distribution by decomposing the system and by specifying a binding
model describing how interactions between given computational interfaces are carried out.

3.1. SDI computational objects modelled as UML components
We use a UML component diagram (Object Management Group 2011) to model the SDI
computational objects. The component diagram allows one to structure the components of
a system (autonomous and encapsulated units within the system providing one or more
interfaces) and their interrelations. Brieﬂy, the basic elements of a component diagram are
(as shown in Figure 2):

(cid:129) Component (rectangle with small symbol in upper right corner): A component
represents a modular part of a system that encapsulates its contents and whose man-
ifestation is replaceable within its environment. A component deﬁnes its behaviour
in terms of provided and required interfaces;

(cid:129) Provided Interface (connector with circlet): An interface is a named set of operations
that characterize the behaviour of a component. A provided interface is one that is
implemented directly by the component;

a component needs in order to perform its function and fulﬁl its own obligations to
its clients;

(cid:129) Dependence (dashed arrow): A dependency is a relationship that signiﬁes that a
component requires services from another component through its provided interface
(Object Management Group 2011).

The RM-ODP deﬁnes a computational interface as being characterized by a signature, a
behaviour and an environmental contract. However, since we are modelling the SDI compu-
tational objects as UML components, we specify the interfaces of the provided and required
interfaces of the SDI computational objects, as deﬁned in the list above. For simplicity rea-
sons, we did not model the details of the signature and contract of individual interfaces.
These could be provided in a further reﬁnement of the computational viewpoint.

Figure 2 shows the six SDI computational objects in a UML-component diagram: SDI
Registry, SDI Data, SDI Processing, SDI Application, SDI Portrayal and SDI Management.
Each SDI computational object offers a number of functionalities, modelled by the pro-
vided interfaces, as well as uses functionality offered by other SDI computational objects,
modelled by the required interfaces.

3.2. Purpose and interfaces of the SDI computational objects

3.2.1. SDI Registry
The main purpose of the SDI Registry is to register data, services (i.e. products) and other
items in the catalogue, to publish them, and afterwards let users search through them.
This functionality is provided by the three interfaces of SDI Registry described below. The
SDIManagement::Control is the only required interface. The double colon notation ‘::’
means Interface.

The SDIRegistry::Register interface provides the necessary operations to regis-
ter information about resources available on a network, such as Register Product
Speciﬁcation, Register Product, Register Metadata, Register Catalogue, Register Policy,
Register Business Plan and Update Register.

The SDIRegistry::Search interface facilitates searching for the required items in
the relevant catalogue and includes operations such as Search Register, Search Product
Speciﬁcation, Search Product, Search Metadata, Search Catalogue and Search through
Catalogue.

The SDIRegistry::Publish interface provides functionality for publishing the output
information from Registers through the Internet or other media. Operations such as
Publish Product Speciﬁcation, Publish Product, Publish Metadata and Publish Catalogue
are typically included.

3.2.2. SDI Data
SDI Data deals with data sets shared and registered on the Internet. For example, SDI
Data provides access to the collections of data in repositories and databases. The only
provided interface is SDIData::DataDelivery, which is designed in such a way that it
provides data to users via the SDI Processing or SDI Application. No other SDI compu-
tational object deals with data sets directly. Required interfaces are SDIRegistry::Register,
SDIRegistry::Publish and SDIManagement::Control.

3.2.3. SDI Processing
SDI Processing provides the interfaces for data processing, such as coordinate
computation and projection system transformation. It provides only one interface,
interfaces are required,
SDIProcessing::ServiceDelivery. However, a number of
including
SDIRegistry::Search,
SDIData::DataDelivery and SDIManagement::Control.

SDIRegistry::Register,

SDIRegistry::Publish,

3.2.4. SDI Application
SDI Application is a key part of the SDI computational architecture. It does not
provide any interface, but requires a large number of interfaces in order to meet
the needs of users. These include SDIRegistry::Register, SDIRegistry::Publish,
SDIRegistry::Search,
SDIProcessing::ServiceDelivery,
SDIPortrayal:: PortrayalDelivery and SDIManagement::Control.

SDIData::DataDelivery,

3.2.5. SDI Portrayal
SDI Portrayal deals with displaying the results of application services. It provides
one interface for these purposes, SDIPortrayal::PortrayalDelivery, which facilitates

A.K. Cooper et al.

output, such as designing layouts, editing functions, specifying delivery options and
formats. SDI Portrayal has the following required interfaces: SDIRegistry::Register,
SDIRegistry::Publish and SDIManagement::Control.

3.2.6. SDI Management
SDI Management monitors the overall functionality of the SDI. For this purpose, it has
one interface, SDIManagement::Control, which, for example, controls the interoperability
among services or rights of access.

3.3. Binding model
According to the RM-ODP (ISO/IEC 10746-1 1998), binding should be modelled in a
computational viewpoint. The purpose of the binding model is to specify how liaisons are
to be created between objects in order for interactions to occur.

The ICA computational model of an SDI is a service-oriented architecture (SOA), as
shown in Figure 3 (W3C 2011). An SOA is based on the concept that a service provider
publishes its services at a service registry. A service requester ﬁnds details about a speciﬁc
service at the registry, proceeds to bind to the service at the service provider and starts inter-
acting with the service at the service provider. Since our model is technology independent,
the binding model is inherited from whichever technology is used in the implementation
(e.g. SOAP, REST, DCOM or CORBA).

4. SDI services provided by SDI computational objects for stakeholder activities

In Section 3, we identiﬁed the provided and required interfaces of SDI computational
objects. In this section, we show how stakeholders (identiﬁed in the enterprise view-
point) interact through these interfaces during the activities associated with the information
classes (identiﬁed in the information viewpoint).

Initially, the Commission deﬁned the concept ‘service’ for its own purpose, starting
with the deﬁnitions from ISO 19119:2005, Geographic information – Service. As such, an

SDI service was deﬁned as the distinct part of the SDI functionality that is provided by an
SDI computational object through interfaces, either manually or automatically.

Additionally, an interface is deﬁned as a named set of operations that characterize the

behaviour of an object.

Moreover, an operation is deﬁned as something that an object may be called on to do,

may do without request, or may do for internal reasons.

By the integration of these deﬁnitions, an SDI service is deﬁned as the distinct part of
the SDI functionality that is provided by an SDI computational object through named sets
of operations that characterize the behaviour of the SDI computational object, where each
operation may be called on to do, may do without request, or may do for internal reasons,
either manually or automatically.

Thus, in this model, an SDI service is the distinct part of the SDI functionality that
is provided by a collection of operations from (one or more) interfaces of (one or more)
SDI computational objects. An operation is part of a single interface and is performed by
a single SDI computational object, but a service is more general, collectively referring to a
number of operations from one or more computational object’s interfaces.

Based on this deﬁnition of an SDI service, we identiﬁed more than 180 services within
an SDI and classiﬁed them in a matrix showing which computational object provides them
and where they are required for stakeholder activities associated with the ﬁve information
classes (i.e. Policies, Product speciﬁcation, Product, Metadata and Catalogue) from the
information viewpoint. Table 1 provides a detailed list of the SDI services. Column
1 contains the information classes deﬁned in the information viewpoint (from Table 1 in
Hjelmager et al. 2008). Column 2 contains the stakeholder activities associated with these
classes, also deﬁned in the information viewpoint (from Table 1 in Hjelmager et al. 2008).
Row 1 contains the SDI computational objects. The rest of the cells in the table show the
SDI services that fulﬁl the functionality required by the stakeholder activities. Note that
there does not have to be a speciﬁc SDI service linking every activity to every object in the
table.

Consider, for example, the Publishing service, which makes all kinds of information
publicly available. The SDI Registry computational object provides the required interfaces.
The Publishing service is required in all the information classes for various stakeholder
activities, such as ‘Make policy’ and ‘Make business plan’ of the Policies information
class and ‘Stipulate requirements’, ‘Translate into product speciﬁcations’ and ‘Obtain and
implement product speciﬁcations’ of the Product speciﬁcations information class.

Another example is the Delivery service, which delivers data, metadata and catalogues
to SDI stakeholders. SDI Data and SDI Processing provide the SDIData::Delivery and
SDIProcessing::ServiceDelivery interfaces for the ‘Provide product’, ‘Use product’ and
‘Maintain product’ stakeholder activities of the Product information class; the ‘Provide
metadata’ of the Metadata information class and the ‘Provide catalogue’ of the Catalogue
information class. SDI Application does not provide interfaces but acts as intermedi-
ary to deliver data, metadata and catalogues through the above-mentioned SDI Data and
SDI Processing interfaces to the SDI stakeholders in the ‘Provide product’ and ‘Provide
catalogue’ of the Product and Catalogue information classes, respectively.

5. SDI services for SDI development and use

The development and use of an SDI requires eight processes (Cooper et al. 2009) and these
are illustrated in Figure 4. The Liaison process is not shown as an arrow because it links
together everything. The roles of the processes can be described in this way:

Figure 4. The eight SDI processes.

(cid:129) Initiation: includes the initial idea for the SDI, assembling the relevant stakeholders,

developing the framework for the SDI and motivating it;

(cid:129) Creation: establishing the SDI;
(cid:129) Management: ongoing management of the SDI;
(cid:129) Manipulation: includes ﬁnding and using metadata and ﬁnding data;
(cid:129) Access: covers accessing data, including production of customized real and virtual

maps;

(cid:129) Processing: includes transforming, integrating and modelling data;
(cid:129) Evaluation: assessing the functioning of the SDI and the quality and utility of the

data, metadata and services offered by the SDI; and
(cid:129) Liaison: maintaining relationships with stakeholders.

These processes represent different ways of interacting with an SDI and, in this regard,
have different needs for SDI services provided by the computational objects. We describe
the processes in subsequent subsections. Some examples from INSPIRE are included to
illustrate how computational objects provide the required services for these processes.

Table 2 provides an overview of SDI services required by different SDI processes. The
rows represent SDI processes and the columns represent computational objects. At the
intersection of each row and column, all the relevant SDI services provided by the given
computational object (of that table column) in the given SDI process (of that table row) are
listed.

Initiation

5.1.
During Initiation, the strategy, concepts and rules for the proposed SDI are developed.
SDI Management plays an important role in this process: it should provide the necessary
Development service. Further, all computational objects should afterwards implement this
strategy, this concept and these rules through the provided Implementation services in this
process.

For example, in INSPIRE, the European Union represents some aspects of SDI
Management. It provides a Development service by creating policies, such as the INSPIRE

Downloaded by [University of Saskatchewan Library] at 18:58 15 March 2015 International Journal of Geographical Information Science

1147

Directive of 2007. Other aspects of SDI Management are represented by the relevant
authorities in the Member States who set up business plans for INSPIRE activities.

5.2. Creation
The main goal of this process is to create the SDI. The SDI services provided by compu-
tational objects in this process are much richer and differ substantially from one object to
another, as described in Sections 3 and 4.

SDI Registry should start to register Products, Metadata, Registers, etc. SDI Data
provides services focused on Storing data sets. The SDI Processing starts Harvesting,
Capturing and Reporting on metadata. SDI Portrayal provides a Design service to support
the production and the use of products. SDI Application supports Capture and Reporting
functionalities.

For example, the INSPIRE Geoportal (http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/editor/)
resembles the SDI Application computational object. The Geoportal’s Metadata Editor
provides a Capture service: it allows users to create metadata according to the INSPIRE
implementing rules. The Geoportal’s Validator provides a Reporting service: it tests
compliance of INSPIRE metadata against the INSPIRE Metadata Regulation.

5.3. Management
The management of an SDI service is, as was the case with creation, much richer and
differs substantially from one computational object to another, as described in Sections 3
and 4.

SDI Management should provide a Scheduling service. SDI Registry should manage
registration of Products, Metadata, Registers, etc. SDI Data provides services focused
on managing and storing data sets. SDI Processing manages Harvesting, Capturing and
Reporting on metadata. SDI Portrayal provides a Design service to support and manage the
production and use of products. SDI Application supports the management of the Capture
and Reporting functionalities. All computational objects are part of the Update service and
thereby help in the management of an SDI.

In INSPIRE, the Member States and the INSPIRE Geoportal represent SDI Data in the
Updating and Storing services, respectively, when data are updated and subsequently made
available in the INSPIRE Geoportal. The European Commission Decision 2009/442/EC
of 5 June 2009 states that Member States have to report annually a number of indicators for
monitoring the implementation and the use of their infrastructures for spatial information.
Various other Commission regulations set deadlines for regulation implementations by
Member States. Here, the Commission represents SDI Management in the Scheduling
service.

5.4. Manipulation

The Manipulation process bears on the use of the SDI by users. Because of this its activities
(and the services provided) concentrate mainly on the SDI Registry, SDI Data and SDI
Processing computational objects.

SDI Registry supports the Searching, Sampling, Extraction and Publishing of Metadata
and Products, while SDI Data supports Sampling, Extraction and, primarily, Delivery
to enable the use of data. SDI Processing and SDI Application play important roles as

Downloaded by [University of Saskatchewan Library] at 18:58 15 March 2015 1148

A.K. Cooper et al.

manipulation services – they support the Delivery service (besides the manipulative role)
to deliver Metadata, Catalogues and Products to users.

The INSPIRE Geoportal represents SDI Registry because it supports the Searching and
Publishing services. It also represents the Delivery service by making the data available in
a Web browser, that is, a Delivery service.

5.5. Access
The Access process is supported by the Access service allowing access to the Registry and
Product while controlled by the Registry service. The Registry service controls who and to
what part of the data the user in question is allowed access. These services are provided by
the SDI Data, SDI Processing and SDI Application computational objects. SDI Portrayal
provides the Representation service and SDI Management provides the Adherence service.
Once again the INSPIRE Geoportal represents more than one computational object,
including SDI Data, SDI Processing and SDI Application, when providing the Access
service to data and services.

5.6. Processing
This process is supported mainly by SDI Processing and SDI Application. Both provide a
Transformation service, and the latter one also provides Application and Chaining services,
as processing will invariably consist of multiple services chained together.

At the moment, it does not seem as if the INSPIRE Geoportal provides Transformation

and Chaining services, but it could well do that in the future.

5.7. Evaluation
SDI Evaluation provides the widest suite of services in this process, taking care of the
Monitoring, Survey, Assurance, and Auditing services. SDI Data, SDI Processing and
SDI Application provide the Assessment service. Additionally, SDI Register supports the
Classiﬁcation service, and SDI Processing provides the Calibration service.

Here,

the European Commission through its Decision 2009/442/EC of 5 June

2009 represents SDI Evaluation in the Monitoring service.

5.8. Liaison

SDI Management and SDI Registry act in this liaison process. The former provides the
Relationship Management service and the latter the Stakeholder Tracking service.

Information about registered INSPIRE stakeholders is available on the INSPIRE

website, representing SDI Registry and providing the Stakeholder Tracking service.

6. Conclusions
In this article, a novel approach has been used to model SDIs based on the RM-ODP
viewpoints. This approach contributes to a better understanding of the concept of an SDI.
This article presents the recent contribution of the ICA Geoinformation Infrastructures and
Standards Commission’s model towards a holistic understanding of an SDI that is inde-
pendent of speciﬁc SDI legislation, technology and implementation. The work presented

Downloaded by [University of Saskatchewan Library] at 18:58 15 March 2015 International Journal of Geographical Information Science

1149

in this article is in the continuity of the previous Commission work on the enterprise and
information viewpoints of RM-ODP (Hjelmager et al. 2005, 2008).

This article has focused on the description of an SDI model from the RM-ODP com-
putational viewpoint. The proposed computational viewpoint model is composed of six
computational objects, that is, SDI Registry, SDI Data, SDI Processing, SDI Application,
SDI Portrayal and SDI Management. Each computational object offers functionalities
as well as requests and uses functionalities from other objects. These functionalities are
modelled by the way of interfaces in a UML component diagram. The types of function-
alities are identiﬁed for each computational object along with their dependencies. This
proposed SDI model from a computational viewpoint simpliﬁes the description of an SDI
by representing related functionality in a single computational object.

Additionally, a deﬁnition of SDI service has been proposed and, based on it, required
services have been classiﬁed by information class (i.e. policies, product speciﬁcations,
product, metadata and catalogue), stakeholder activities and computational objects in a
matrix (Table 1). Examples of the use of the classiﬁcation matrix have been given.

Finally, this article has analysed and identiﬁed the requirements for SDI services from
the identiﬁed computational objects based on the processes for the development and use of
an SDI (i.e. initiation, creation, management, manipulation, access, processing, evaluation
and liaison). The SDI services have been illustrated with examples from the INSPIRE
implementation of an SDI. For example, SDI Management in the INSPIRE implementation
corresponds to various computational objects such as registration, storing, updating and
scheduling services, and the INSPIRE geoportal implements more than one computational
object depending on the service that it provides (see the description of the Creation and
Manipulation processes in sections 5.2 and 5.4, respectively). Our proposed computational
model makes it possible to describe an SDI independently of its implementation.

In the current ICA computational viewpoint SDI model, it has been chosen for sim-
plicity reasons to exclude the details (e.g. signature and contract) of individual interfaces.
However, future work will provide a further reﬁnement of the computational viewpoint.
Also, as part of future work, the assessment of the proposed SDI model from the different
viewpoints (enterprise, information and computational viewpoints) must be considered by
applying it to speciﬁc SDI communities. This will allow one to identify weaknesses and
to propose reﬁnements. No attempts to model an SDI from the engineering or technol-
ogy viewpoints were considered yet, since these are meant to be implementation speciﬁc,
whereas the Commission is oriented towards providing technology-independent models for
an SDI. However, the reverse engineering of the engineering and technology viewpoints of
an existing SDI implementation could be considered to provide additional feedback and
beneﬁts to both the computational viewpoint and the SDI implementation.

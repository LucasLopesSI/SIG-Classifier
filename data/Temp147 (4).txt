The availability of spatial data on an unprecedented scale as well as advancements in
analytical and visualization techniques gives researchers the opportunity to study com-
plex problems over large urban and regional areas. Nevertheless, few individual data sets
exist that provide both the requisite spatial and/or temporal observational frequency to
truly facilitate detailed investigations. Some data are collected frequently over time but
only at a few geographic locations (e.g., weather stations). Similarly, other data are
collected with a high level of spatial resolution but not at regular or frequent time intervals
(e.g., satellite data). The purpose of this article is to present an interpolation approach that
leverages the relative temporal richness of one data set with the relative spatial richness of
another to fill in the gaps. Because different interpolation techniques are more appropriate
than others for specific types of data, we propose a space–time interpolation approach
whereby two interpolation methods – one for the temporal and one for the spatial
dimension – are used in tandem to increase the accuracy results.

We call our ensemble approach the space–time interpolation environment (STIE). The
primary steps within this environment include a spatial interpolation processor, a tem-
poral interpolation processor, and a calibration processor, which enforces phenomenon-
related behavioral constraints. The specific interpolation techniques used within the STIE
can be chosen on the basis of suitability for the data and application at hand. In this article,
we first describe STIE conceptually including the data input requirements, output
structure, details of the primary steps, and the mechanism for coordinating the data
within those steps. We then describe a case study focusing on urban land cover in
Phoenix, Arizona, using our working implementation. Our empirical results show that
our approach increased the accuracy for estimating urban land cover better than a single
interpolation technique.

Introduction

Better understanding of complex, earth-related processes is being viewed by scientists and
governments with an increasing level of urgency to address problems such as the spread of
disease, the drivers and consequences of urban growth, and the effects of global climate
change. Such challenges are characterized by the dynamics of many factors that interact and
vary over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Coincident with this, recent advancements in
data availability and computing capacity are enabling a new era in the analysis of physical
and social phenomena. We can now begin to examine phenomena in both space and time at

the appropriate level of detail, which is essential for meeting the challenges of understanding
complex systems.

There has been much activity over the past 10–20 years in advancing methods for
space–time analysis such as development of new data models (Langran and Chrisman
1988, Peuquet 2002, Yuan et al. 2005, Spaccapietra et al. 2006), extension of statistical
techniques to the space–time domain such as Bayesian techniques for space–time analysis
(SenGupta and Ugwuowo 2006, Lee and Wentz 2008), and creation of new analytical
techniques for characterizing patterns of motion (Laube and Purves 2006). Nevertheless,
such techniques are most effective when used with spatially and temporally continuous data
with a consistent spatial resolution and temporal granularity. Despite growth in the data
acquisition and distribution infrastructure, including high-resolution satellite systems, tele-
metry, and radar, as well as the accumulation of archival map data in digital form, researchers
remain challenged in reliably acquiring the necessary data that provide both the requisite
spatial resolution and temporal grain. This is particularly true with respect to historical data,
which pose a major obstacle for the utilization of new space–time analysis capabilities.

Interpolation is used to supplement, smooth, and standardize observational data. The
interpolation process typically involves three primary steps, which are often used iteratively:
exploration, estimation, and validation of observational and calculated values. For explora-
tion, analysts typically utilize multiple statistical and graphical techniques in tandem to
explore data trends and interactions. Multiple statistical and graphical techniques are also
used for model validation to determine how well the interpolated values approximate
observed data. An analyst will use the results of data exploration and validation to decide
upon a statistical or mathematical interpolation technique for estimation (e.g., kriging with
an exponential model). We view the use of a single technique as simplistic relative to the
complex multidimensional interrelationships inherent in space–time data.

Researchers have demonstrated that many spatial interpolation techniques, including
inverse distance weighting (IDW), splining, kriging, and spatial regression, can be extended
to the temporal dimension (Goldstein et al. 2004). Most efforts have focused on
interpolation in either the spatial or the temporal dimension but not both simultaneously,
even for space–time data. To examine urban growth, for example, Goldstein et al. (2004) used
Delaunay triangulation to fill in missing urban/non-urban values for parcel records for each
year between 1929 and 2001 in Santa Barbara County, California. Values for spatial neighbors
were used to estimate the value of a given missing parcel value within a given time slice.

One problem with this general approach to space–time interpolation is that it ignores
possible temporal correlations that could aid in the estimation process. The primary excep-
tion is kriging. Researchers refining and extending space–time kriging have recognized the
need to correlate the temporal and spatial dimensions. Although many applications of
space–time kriging view the spatial and temporal dimensions as equivalent, most who
address the geospatial context realize that there are fundamental and essential differences
between the spatial and temporal domains (Rouhani and Myers 1990, Christakos and Vyas
1998, Kyriakidis and Journel 2001). Of primary importance with respect to space–time
interpolation, values for a given variable at a specific location may be influenced by values in
any spatial direction, whereas values in time can only be influenced by values at a preceding
time, even though backward correlations may exist. Because kriging incorporates global and
local influences for estimating values, the increased dimensionality of time as well as space,
and the resultant increase in the number of observations, causes a dramatic increase in the
computational requirement. Kerwin and Prince (1999) proposed a recursive solution to the
data dimensionality problem, coupling kriging with a stochastic state equation, to deal with
the computational challenge.

A clear improvement to ordinary space–time kriging includes the use of ancillary data to
aid in the estimation process, referred to as external drift (Wackernagel 1998, Chiles and
Delfiner 1999). Snepvangers et al. (2003) demonstrated the improvements possible in
estimating soil water content by using net precipitation as ancillary data. They found that
spatio-temporal kriging with external drift produced more realistic results than spatio-
temporal kriging alone. The use of ancillary data has also proven effective in other space–-
time interpolation approaches. Goldstein et al. (2004) were able to better the results of the
Delaunay triangulation of urban extents by utilizing cellular automata along with ancillary
data, which included slope and road networks.

We reason that any single interpolation technique has advantages and limitations with
respect to representing patterns of variation in the observed data. Nevertheless, results can be
potentially improved by using an ensemble of interpolation techniques combined with
ancillary data to incorporate space–time interactions. Integrating multiple methods has
been shown to provide a flexible and coherent structure to solve problems with increased
complexity (Drecourt et al. 2006, Roy 2008, Wang and Armstrong 2009). Drecourt et al.
(2006), for example, constructed an ensemble framework to estimate the parameters of a
covariance matrix in a groundwater model, which lead to insight into the uncertainty in the
groundwater model. The approach that we describe in detail below integrates multiple
techniques with ancillary data to improve space–time interpolation of earth-related data.

Data currently available tend to be of two distinct types: one type has a much greater
observational density in the temporal dimension than in the spatial dimension, and another
with the reverse. An example of the former is air-quality data, which may be collected hourly
but there may be only a few observation stations located throughout a study area. An
example of the latter is Landsat data, which provide complete spatial coverage (at 30 m
resolution) but these ‘snapshots’ are repeated only once every 16 days. These two types of
data represent different sampling approaches and require different types of interpolation.
However, when a relationship exists between these data, one can in theory be used to inform
the other.

Our aim in this article is to describe and illustrate an ensemble approach to space–time
interpolation that utilizes these uniquely different but complementary space–time data to
create a fully populated space–time cube for one or more variables. Our proposed approach
consists of a multistep and iterative process, which uses ancillary data to provide additional
information for interpolating data in both the spatial and temporal dimensions. We name our
approach the space–time interpolation environment (STIE). The approach consists of a set of
interpolation and cross-checking techniques as well as a management structure that handles
the data flow.

We begin by presenting STIE framework, with a description of the individual compo-
nents, or processors, followed by how they work together within the overall management
structure. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of STIE using our prototype implementa-
tion to interpolate land cover as it changes from year to year in Phoenix, Arizona. Our
conclusions highlight the opportunities and challenges associated with this approach.

2. Ensemble framework for space–time interpolation
The STIE uses three processors within an overall management structure for handling data
flow. The three processors are a spatial interpolation processor (SP), a temporal interpolation
processor (TP), and a calibration processor (CP). The SP estimates values for gridded
locations without observational data based on observations recorded in other locations in
the study area. The TP estimates all gridded values for a single time slice based on values

Figure 1. The three model processors of STIE show the required and possible flow of data between
them. Data are input into the system in the form of a space–time cube (P) with observational data
missing in either the spatial or temporal dimension. Intermediate data (Q) are derived from the TP and
SP processors. The CP integrates these data to complete the space–time cube. Solid arrows indicate
required data flow between the processors. Dashed arrows illustrate where data flow may exist
depending on data relationships in a given application. ST represents the complete space–time cube,

from the preceding time slice. The CP integrates the output from the SP to refine and
constrain the output from the TP. The relationship between these processors and the specifics
of what they do are illustrated in Figure 1 and described below.

Formally, input to the entire process is a set of observational data arranged conceptually

in a gridded space–time cube with missing observations in (x, y) or t:

f

Pjp 2 ðx; yÞ; ti
½

(cid:2)

g

For each (x, y) location in space, there is a chronological time series, where ti = (t0, t1, t2, . . .,
tn). The spatially rich data will have complete (x, y) coverage for some but not all values of t
with a regular distance between locations defined by dim. The temporally rich data will have
missing (x, y) observations for some time slices (t). The goal of the three processors is to
apply appropriate interpolation technique(s) to each data set based on their unique char-
acteristics and their space–time relationships to complete the space–time cube.

The role of the SP is to interpolate each value of p P P on the basis of observational p
values for the same time t (i.e., all points within the same time slice). The particular
interpolation technique used in the SP could be deterministic (e.g., IDW) or stochastic
(e.g., kriging) and is selected based on the spatial stationarity and distribution of the data.

The role of the TP is to estimate missing values of p P P on the basis of the values of p in
tn-1 (i.e., the preceding time slice). Selecting the appropriate TP technique is based on the
knowledge of the temporal dynamics of the observational data, including stationarity, trends,
and temporal lags.

The SP and the TP are run in parallel to produce estimated values "p 2 P for a single
time slice (tn) as shown in Figure 1. The CP integrates these to refine all values for that
iteration by imposing known constraints specific to the local context for the given attribute.
These constraints are specific to the application and take into account local knowledge and
known relationships. The output from the CP is the completed estimated time slice, which is
then used as input for estimation of the next time slice in the next iteration. The completed
space–time cube will have the spatial extent and support (dim) of the spatially rich data and a
regular, chronological time series consistent with the set P. This conceptual cube can be
extended into four or more dimensions to accommodate two or more variables.

3. Demonstration of STIE

We demonstrate that STIE can effectively interpolate space–time data using a case study on
urban growth for the Phoenix metropolitan area (PMA). The PMA is a region in the
southwest United States that includes the city of Phoenix and 14 other incorporated areas.
The total metropolitan region covers approximately 7650 km2 of central Arizona (Figure 2).
Massive population growth regionally is resulting in unprecedented conversion of natural

semi-arid desert vegetation and of historically agricultural land to urban land cover and uses.
Questions arise regarding the drivers of this type of growth and the environmental and social
consequences (Lopez et al. 2001, Buyantuyev et al. 2010).

Recent research investigating urban growth in the PMA has shown that most land
transformation trajectories are from agricultural to single family residential, and that the
space–time pattern of development is increasing growth outward from the urban core (Keys
et al. 2007). This study, however, was very basic in its conclusions because the land use data
used were decadal. With rapid growth, as is the case in the PMA, decadal data may not
represent land transformations such as how soon commercial development appears after the
development of a residential neighborhood. Land use data at a finer temporal resolution,
such as annual data, could answer such questions. Extracting historical observational data,
however, is nearly impossible because delineating detailed land use from aerial photography
is prohibitively time consuming and, more often, there is simply a lack of historical aerial
photographs (Wentz et al. 2006). Likewise, satellite data without cloud cover in the appro-
priate season may also be unavailable or prohibitively expensive to acquire. The goal for the
case study is to demonstrate how an implementation of STIE can estimate realistic annual
land cover for the years 1985–2005 in Phoenix, Arizona.

Our selection of the data for testing our ensemble framework is based on documented
relationships between surface temperature and land cover type (Jenerette et al. 2007).
Research shows higher surface temperatures associated with impervious surfaces compared
with undeveloped and vegetated land covers. We use the surface temperature–land cover
relationship to better assign the conversion of land cover from undeveloped and/or agricul-
tural to urbanized classes. What this means is that instead of using strictly a spatial process
(e.g., that a neighboring cell has changed), we use the relationship between surface tem-
perature and land cover to help identify when the land cover change may have occurred at a
particular cell. In cases when we did not have observed surface temperature data, we used
ancillary data to estimate these from air temperature and elevation data.

3.1. Data
To generate land cover estimates over a 20-year period (1985–2005), three variables were
used. They were average air temperature, elevation, and land cover and surface temperature.
Air temperature data were acquired from 36 PMA meteorological stations (Figure 2).
These stations collect hourly air temperatures along with other meteorological variables. We
calculated the average air temperature at 10:30 am for 4 days in May for all years
(1985–2005). Temperature at 10:30 am was selected to correspond to the Landsat capture
time for Phoenix. For each year, we selected 4 days without recorded precipitation at the
Cooperative Observer Stations and days near the middle of the month. These averaged air
temperature data represent our temporally rich data. Elevation data were acquired from the
US Geological Survey from the 7.5 min series.

Land cover and surface temperature data were derived from Landsat TM images for the
following dates: 14 May 1985, 12 May 1988, 18 May 1990, 24 May 1998, 21 May 2000, and
8 March 2005. The middle to late May dates were selected to maintain annual consistency in
terms of minimal weather extremes, minimal cloud cover, and maximum vegetation cover-
age. For 2005, the only data available to us were for March, which is not a significant
problem because these data were not used to calibrate the model for subsequent years.

For the land cover, the images were classified into nine categories using the Stefanov
et al.’s (2001) knowledge-based classification model. The resulting classes are ACTVEG
(irrigated non-residential vegetation), NATVEG (native vegetation), CANAL (fluvial and

man-made canals), MESIC (residential with irrigated landscaping), XERIC (residential with
low-water landscaping), COMM (commercial and industrial), ASPH (asphalt including
roads and parking lots), UNDEV (undeveloped), and WATER (lakes, rivers, and reservoirs).
Surface temperature for each image was calculated using the Thermal Band (band 6). Land
cover and surface temperature are our spatially rich data.

3.2. Model processors

Figure 3 illustrates the data and management structure for the three processors for this
implementation of STIE. The inputs to the SP are land cover, elevation, and air temperature.
Inputs to the TP are land cover data. The results from these processors are estimated surface
temperature and estimated land cover, respectively, for the next year. These become the
inputs to the CP, which refines the estimated land cover values using known land cover and
surface temperature relationships. The estimated time slice showing land cover is then used

as input for the next iteration. This process is repeated until all values within the output
space–time cube have been estimated (Figure 4).

The interpolation procedure used in the SP for this case study uses two ancillary
variables and a different interpolation procedure for each. First is the point to grid interpola-
tion of air temperature; second is the estimation of surface temperature based on air
temperature. Interpolated air temperature was calculated using IDW. Although kriging
would have been preferable because it provides more detailed results (e.g., error estimates),
we noted the observed data did not have a suitable spatial structure for kriging. Next,
regression-based mapping was used to estimate surface temperature for each grid cell in
the study area. Surface temperature depends on land cover class, air temperature, and
elevation. As these mathematical relationships change depending on land cover, we applied
a unique regression equation for each land cover class. The dependent variable, surface
temperature (Ts) for a specified land cover class, is estimated on the basis of maximum and
minimum monthly air temperatures (Tamax and Tamin), observed air temperature (Ta), and
elevation (EL). Beta (b) denotes the coefficient for each of the independent variables
(Johnson 1986, Stoll 1990):

Ts ¼ a ¼ b1Tamax þ b2Tamin þ b3Ta þ b4EL

One regression equation was determined for eight land cover classes, each statistically
significant at ,0.0001. The ninth class (UNDEV) required two different equations because
of a large air temperature range for the UNDEV category. There are UNDEV cells at higher
elevations (resulting in generally lower air temperatures) and also UNDEV cells at lower
elevations (with generally higher air temperatures). To calculate the regression equations, we
selected 100 sample locations per land cover class (10 classes total, resulting in n = 1000).
The sample means were plotted against the population means to ensure population repre-
sentation. The R2 values range from 0.169 to 0.659. The independent variables explain
approximately 17–66% of the temperature variance for the specified land cover classes. This
wide variance is somewhat expected because air masses and other synoptic variables
influence these relationships. The land cover classes with the lowest R2 are ACTVEG,
CANAL, and the lower elevation UNDEV class.

The TP in this study used a cellular automata model to derive the intermediate estimated
gridded land cover values for the next time slice (t + 1). Cellular automata are dynamic

models that calculate a new value for a grid cell based on the relationship of the current target
cell to its neighborhood. We defined the neighborhood with a 3 · 3 matrix of eight cells.
With a cell size of approximately 30 · 30 m ground resolution, the distance from the center
of the target cell to the edge of the neighborhood is less than 100 m. This resolution allows
local microclimate influences to be seen (Hubble 1993) and is also below the 120 m
resolution of the surface temperature data.

We initiated the cellular automata with land cover derived from the interpreted and
calibrated satellite data from 1985. From there, we applied rules to govern the transition from
time t to time t + 1 for a target cell (j) relative to the set of eight cells around j, which we
define as (cid:2)j.

We define all land cover classes in our study area that remain stable over time as

A ¼ MESIC; XERIC; CANAL; COMM; WATER; ASPH

f

g

and the land cover classes that can change over time as

B ¼ UNDEV; NATVEG; ACTVEG

f

g

Therefore the set of all nine land classes in our study data can be expressed as

We can then express the unique land cover classes in the neighborhood (cid:2)j as

Ci ¼ A¨B

D ¼

Ci; "di 2 D;

di(cid:2)diþ1

\

i2(cid:2)j

Then, Ka ¼ fðk;mkÞ: k 2 D; mk 2 M (cid:3) N : mk (cid:4) 8 and ma þ mb þ (cid:5) (cid:5) (cid:5) ¼ 8g. Ka is a multi-
set where each pair (a) represents the land cover type (k) and the number of occurrences (mk)
of that type in the neighborhood (cid:2)j. For example, we could define Ka = {(UNDEV, 3),
(CANAL, 3), (NATVEG, 2)}, which means that there are three cells with UNDEV, three
CANAL cells, and two NATVEG cells in a neighborhood surrounding the cell (j). We define
a sorted list of integers as the set M such that max(mk) is the highest number in the set and
max(mk-1) is the second highest, and so on. In the preceding example, max(mk) = 3,
corresponding to the frequency of cells in the UNDEV and the CANAL classes.

Informally, the rules for the transition for jt to jt + 1 are as follows:

If the target cell is a land cover type that is temporally stable, then the target cell remains

unchanged.

Else if the majority of land cover types are stable in the neighborhood then the target cell

is assigned the majority neighborhood land cover type.

Else the target cell is assigned the next highest majority stable land cover.

Note that in case of a tie in land cover frequency, the program will simply assign the land
cover type that is the first in the stored sequence for land cover types in the neighborhood.

Formally, the rules can be stated as follows:

Downloaded by [Central Michigan University] at 14:56 24 December 2014 1318

E.A. Wentz et al.

If jt P A ) jt+1 = jt
If jt P B and |D| (cid:6) 1 and mk = max(mk): k P A ) jt+1 = k
If jt P B and |D| (cid:6) 1 and k P B: (k, max(mk)) ) jt+1 = k: mk = max(mk-1) and k P A

These rules were developed from other published cellular automata models of land use/
cover change created for different geographic settings (Clarke and Hoppen 1997, Meyler
et al. 1998, Ward et al. 2000a, 2000b, Jenerette and Wu 2001). We modified the rules from
those prior models to reflect the specific Phoenix context. In Phoenix, there is rapid urban
expansion and therefore there is a greater likelihood that cells with values in set B will
change to developed types (set A).

The CP for this study invokes a set of rules to adjust the land cover values that were
estimated by the TP. This is a refinement performed by cross-checking those values with the
gridded surface temperature at the corresponding cell for the same time slice. The rules used,
governing the relationship between surface temperature (Ts) and specific land cover classes
(LC), are based on empirical observations and supported in the literature (Quattrochi and
Ridd 1994). Some land cover classes are not included in the rules because the surface
temperature ranges are not narrowly enough defined to be adjusted reliably.

The CP rules are as follows:

If LC = ACTVEG &
Ts . Tmax_ACTVEG then LC = ACTVEG
Else If Ts , Tmax_ACTVEG & IN_BOUND = TRUE then LC = MESIC
Else If LC = NATVEG &
Ts . Tmean_UNDEV & IN_BOUND = FALSE then LC = UNDEV
Else If Ts . Tmax_UNDEV & IN_BOUND = TRUE then LC = XERIC
Else If Ts . Tmean_UNDEV & IN_BOUND = TRUE then LC = MESIC
Else If LC = MESIC &
Ts , Tmin_UNDEV & LU = Agriculture & IN_BOUND = TRUE then LC = ACTVEG
Else If Ts . Tmean_UNDEV & IN_BOUND = FALSE then LC = UNDEV
Else If LC = COMM &
IN_BOUND = FALSE then LC = UNDEV
Else If Ts . Tmax_ACTIVE & LU = Residential then LC = XERIC
Else If Ts , Tmax_ACTVEG & LU = Residential then LC = MESIC
Else If LC = ASPH &
IN_BOUND = FALSE then LC = UNDEV
Else If LC = UNDEV &
Ts , Tmean_ACTVEG & LU = Agriculture then LC = ACTVEG
Else If Ts , Tmin_NATVEG then LC = NATVEG

where Tmin, Tmax, and Tmean are the overall minimum, maximum, and mean surface
temperature values, respectively, for the named land cover types; IN_BOUND is the area
within the urban boundary; LU is the observed Maricopa Association of Governments land
use (MAG 2010).

The three processors were executed 19 times to create a fully populated space–time cube
of air temperature, surface temperature, and land cover that is represented by a 30 m grid
over space and annually in time (Figure 4). We had observed land cover data for the years
1988, 1990, 2000, and 2005, which we used in place of the estimated land cover for that
iteration.

3.3. Case study validation

We evaluated our results by answering two fundamental questions: (1) Does the space–time
interpolation procedure we developed using the three processors work effectively? (2) Does
it work better than an alternative approach? In this section, we describe how these two
questions were answered.

To evaluate if the approach estimated land cover correctly, we compared our estimated
values to observed data from satellite imagery for the year 1998 (which was left out of the
interpolation), using standard accuracy measures from the remote sensing field (Foody
1995, Congalton and Green 1999). The measures we used were overall accuracy, Kappa
coefficient, and user’s and producer’s accuracy. Overall accuracy is a ratio of the number of
pixels assigned to a particular class to the number of pixels that actually belong to the class.
The Kappa coefficient examines the measure of agreement beyond chance with a ratio of the
difference between the observed and expected accuracy over 1 minus the expected accuracy.
The user’s measure identifies errors of commission and the producer’s measure identifies
errors of omission, each for a particular class. A standard for an acceptable classification is at
least 85% (Foody 2002).

To assess whether our approach worked better than previous approaches, we estimated
land cover from 1985 to 2005 with a cellular automata model without the ancillary temporal
temperature data. We compared our results to the temporal interpolation method because we
did not use a single spatial interpolation method for land cover. As described in the TP, we
used the same adapted rules for Phoenix for the simple cellular automata. We calculated the
overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and user’s and producer’s statistics as described above
using the 1998 observed data and estimated values.

4. STIE evaluation

Our case study resulted in a conceptual space–time cube of 20 years with approximately
30 m cells containing annual estimates of land cover, air temperature, and surface tempera-
ture for the PMA. The dimension (e.g., size of the study area as well as the time span) and the
resolution (e.g., ,30 m spatially and annual temporally) used by the STIE can be changed
depending on the availability of input data.

The case study above was successful at estimating land cover with an overall accuracy of
85.2%, higher than the standard of 85%. The Kappa statistic, another measure of agreement,
is 82.9. Both suggest strong agreement between observed land cover from satellite imagery
and output from STIE. Tables 1 and 2 show the contingency matrix reports for the producer’s
and user’s accuracies for the 1998 land cover data. The land cover classes having both a
producer’s and user’s accuracy greater than 85% are the ACTVEG, CANAL, XERIC,
COMM, ASPH, and WATER. The classes with accuracies lower than the standard 85%
are the NATVEG, MESIC, and UNDEV.

Land cover change from 1985 to 2005 as determined by STIE is similar to other reports
on urban growth in Phoenix (Jenerette and Wu 2001, Keys et al. 2007). Our efforts show a
46.9% increase in the area of urban land covers from 1985 to 2005 with changes to
individual categories shown in Figure 5a and b. The difference between Figure 5a and b is
that 5a shows only observed land cover change, whereas 5b shows the land cover with values
included for the interpolated years. While the same trends from beginning and end are visible
in both, we are able to use the STIE interpolated values to create graphs, maps, and
animations of estimated land cover at finer temporal resolutions providing a more detailed
picture of space–time trends.

We determine that STIE provides better results than the cellular automata alone. The
estimated land cover using a cellular automata model alone, which resulted in an overall
accuracy for 1998, is 55.6%. This is lower than the accuracy from the STIE (85.2%) as well
as below the 85.0% accuracy standard. To deepen the comparison between the 1998 land
cover estimated from STIE and the cellular automata, we calculated and compared user’s and
producer’s accuracy scores (Table 3). All classes had higher scores with STIE approach
except for one class in the producer’s (CANAL) and one class in the user’s (COMM). The
difference between these, however, is relatively small. In the Phoenix area, commercial areas
(COMM) tend to develop slowly temporally and remain spatially clustered, which is well
matched with simple cellular automata. The greatest improvement over the cellular automata
is reported by the user’s score for UNDEV and XERIC (Table 3). The cellular automata
performed poorly for UNDEV because a large portion of the study area in 1985 is classified
as UNDEV. When the cellular automata evaluates a target for the next time slice, the values
of neighboring cells are examined and used to reassign the value of the target. For XERIC,
the surface temperature in the CP provided guidance on the type of development. With just a
cellular automata, there were no rules to account for the amount or type of Phoenix’s rapid
urbanization (e.g., assigning several cells in a neighborhood) or leapfrog development (new
development occurring without adjacency) (Morrison 2000). Using STIE with the temporal
information can aid in identifying the location of these growth trends.

As shown in Figure 5a and b, the overall trends in all categories remain the same. The
difference, however, is that for categories with significant year-to-year variability, use of the
ancillary data to adjust those values reveals significant details in that variability. In our case
study, this is particularly evident in land cover categories that are sensitive to climate
variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation). There is a spike in NATVEG in 1987 and
1992 (Figure 5b) not visible in the observed data (Figure 5a) but is known via the association
between vegetation and climate variables. This increase (and the subsequent decrease) is that
undeveloped areas changed to natural vegetation because of more precipitation in these
years. The increased precipitation in these specific years increased vegetation, which has the
effect of decreasing temperature. Air temperature is our observed ancillary data used in the
SP and CP to modify interpolated land cover values. ACTVEG is not as sensitive to short-
term changes in precipitation (reflected in temperature) because it is generally irrigated.
However, there is seemingly a lag and modified amplitude effect because of enhanced
irrigation in subsequent years. MESIC shows the overall trend of urban growth, but also
has some annual sensitivity to climate variables revealing possible competition with
ACTVEG for irrigation in Figure 5b.

From both the overall results and the individual class results we conclude that for this
case study, the ensemble approach improved space–time interpolation over a single techni-
que. We attribute this to two distinct advantages of our ensemble approach. The first
advantage is that as hypothesized, STIE provides greater interpretative power. The advan-
tage of the ensemble method is increased accuracy that results from integrating multiple
interpolation methods and using the space–time autocorrelations inherent in different ele-
ments of a phenomenon through use of ancillary data. A second advantage of our approach is

that implementations can be parallelized for improved performance (Plumejeaud et al. 2008,
Wang and Armstrong 2009). This makes our approach scalable for dealing with the immense
data sets becoming available, particularly high-resolution geospatial data sets over long time
periods.

A challenge of STIE is selecting the most suitable interpolation technique(s) for each
processor and assuring that the data relationships have been defined appropriately. While
selecting the most suitable technique for the specific characteristics of the input data to
perform a given task is always critical, the selection is made more complex in the case of our
ensemble approach in that multiple interpolation techniques and the associated data must
work synchronously. Nevertheless, a range of exploratory and validation tools have recently
become available to aid the researcher in this process (Andrienko and Andrienko 2006).

5. Conclusions

Past research on space–time interpolation has relied on a single technique for estimating
attribute values and often without ancillary data or considering space–time interdependen-
cies. This research presented an ensemble approach for space–time data interpolation to
address these challenges. We demonstrated that a suite of techniques can provide interpretive
power far beyond what a single method can provide. These techniques are selected to include
the use of ancillary data. Furthermore, the preliminary task of investigating the space–time
interrelationships, specifically, to select the appropriate mix of interpolation methods may
itself yield unexpected insights.

The application of STIE confirms that high-resolution spatial data can be utilized to
enhance temporal data and vice versa. Based on the case study results, we conclude that an
ensemble technique provides an improved approach for interpolating space–time values
when there are missing spatial and/or temporal data. Some might argue that the interpolated
space–time values do not reliably represent true values and therefore results and conclusions
drawn can be questioned. This argument, however, remains a challenge for any interpolation
technique and should not be viewed as an excuse to avoid ‘imperfect’ data sets and the virtue
of estimated values. A better strategy is to recognize that the estimated values should be used
to evaluate overall macro-scale patterns and trends rather than as a means to determine
specific values at exact times and locations (Goldstein et al. 2004).

We demonstrated that an ensemble approach improves estimation over a single
approach. We anticipate that ancillary data and an ensemble of appropriate techniques in
other applications would yield similar improved results. This is a general framework that can
be adapted to numerous application contexts.

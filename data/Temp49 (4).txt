Abstract
Numerous  authors  have  presented  ontology  building  tools  that  have  all  been
developed  as  part  of  academic  projects  and  that  are  usually  adaptations  of  more
generic tools for geo-spatial applications. While we trust that these tools do their job
for the special purpose they have been built, the GIScience user community is still a
long way away from off-the-shelf ontology builders that can be used by GIS project
managers. In this article, we present a comparative study of ontology building tools
described in some twenty peer-reviewed GIScience journal articles. We analyze them
from the perspective of two application domains, crime analysis and transportation/land
use. For the latter, we developed a database schema, which is substantially different
from the three main templates commonly used. The crime analysis application uses
a  rule  base  for  an  agent-based  model  that  had  no  precursor.  In  both  cases,  the
currently available set of tools cannot replace manual coding of ontologies for use
with  ESRI-based  application  software.  Based  on  these  experiences,  we  outline  a
requirements list of what the tools described in the first part of the article are missing
to  make  them  practical  from  an  applications  perspective.  The  result  is  an  R&D
agenda for this important aspect of GIScience.

1 Introduction

Ontologies are en vogue. Many conferences such as GIScience or AGILE are dominated
by  ontology  papers  and  most  relevant  journals  have  had  special  issues  on  this  topic.
Even trade magazines have jumped onto the bandwagon, and it is now considered to be

good  practice  to  develop  domain-specific  data  models  by  paying  at  least  lip  service  to
the  underlying  ontology.  “Traditional”  (what  is  traditional  in  a  discipline  that  was
virtually non-existent 10 years ago?) ontology building tools such as OilEd, OntoEdit,
PowerLoom, Protégé, or WebODE are (1) not geared towards geo-spatial phenomena,
and (2) are not exactly aimed at end users such as GIS managers in a regional authority.
The  situation  is  similar  to  the  fashion  industry,  where  the  models  on  the  runway  have
little to do with Joe or Jane Public. Even the result is the same, in that we are (all made
to) feel bad about our ineptitude to develop sound database and service schemas while
we are made to believe that this is what we ought to do. 

We now have a generation of peer-reviewed articles that describe ontology building
tools for geo-spatial applications and the next section will review them to take stock of
what  may  be  regarded  as  the  current  state  of  the  art.  There  is,  however,  an  obvious
disconnect  between  these  special  purpose  built  tools  and  off-the-shelf  or  preferably
public  domain  ontology  builders  that  can  be  used  by  GIS  project  managers.  Section  3
describes  two  projects,  where  the  authors  developed  complex  schemas  that  on  the  one
hand  are  based  on  very  reasonable  needs  of  the  practice,  while  on  the  other  hand  are
completely beyond the scope of what could be produced by currently existing tools. This
suggests a gap in current applied research and we therefore conclude this article with a
list of recommendations on how to address this mismatch.

2 State of the Art: In Theory

General purpose ontology builders and editors have matured, at least from an information
scientist’s  perspective  (Duineveld  et  al.  2000,  Escórcio  and  Cardoso  2007).  Within
academia and in the open source world, Protégé (2007) has become the tool of choice
for  close  to  100,000  registered  users,  who  (in  addition  to  it  being  free)  appreciate  its
many  extensions  for  different  paradigms  (frames  vs.  OWL),  multiple  APIs,  many
export  formats,  and  several  different  editing  tools.  Originally  developed  for  the  medical
community,  it  is  now  widely  used,  even  in  geospatial  communities  (Souza  et  al.  2006,
Lüscher et al. 2007). However, Protégé has its limitations. As Lüscher et al. (2007,
p.  9)  point  out,  “Protégé  may  be  too  complex  for  domain  experts”.  They  therefore
employed  a  special  user  interface  for  creating  spatial  patterns.  Another  issue  is  that
while Protégé is well suited for the development of Semantic Web applications, most
GIS  are  still  desktop-  or  heavy  server-based,  i.e.  they  require  a  database  schema.
Protégé  can  read  database  schemas  but  the  only  way  to  export  to  them  is  through
XML.

One  solution  to  this  is  to  move  to  another  public  domain  ontology  editor  called
WebODE (2003). As the name suggests, WebODE is the web-based front-end to what
the authors call an Ontology Development Environment (ODE). In its latest incarnation
as ODE Semantic Web Services designer (Gómez Pérez et al. 2004a, b), this tool limits
itself to the creation of OWL-S services, albeit in a very comfortable manner. Of higher
value for our purposes here is the still available version of WebODE 2.0, which exports
to  a  wide  range  of  data  exchange  standards  such  as  XML,  RDF,  OWL,  Java/Jess,  and
UML.  The  latter  two  can  be  used  then  to  create  database  schemas  in,  for  example,
Oracle  or  MySQL  (Corcho  et  al.  2002).  This  gets  us  a  long  way  towards  linking
original geospatial ontology development with the creation of professional GIS database
schemata.

2.1 From Ontologies to Spatial Data Models

Database  systems  can  be  conceptualized  at  three  different  levels:  the  conceptual,  the
logical  and  the  physical  level  (Jardine  1977).  Especially  in  our  geospatial  application
areas, the first of these is often based on a domain ontology that defines concepts and
their  relationships;  the  ESRI  geodatabase  schemas  are  widely  used  examples.  These
conceptual models are usually documented in the form of UML diagrams. At the logical
level,  the  formalized  concepts  are  represented  symbolically,  for  example  as  objects
versus  fields.  At  the  physical  level,  we  specify  the  implementation  in  form  of  low-level
software  structures  and  data  serialization.  A  crime  event  may  hence  be  described  in
formal  (legal)  terms  as  a  burglary,  in  logical  terms  as  the  intersection  of  behavioral
strains of various actors (the burglar and the victim leaving their house), and in physical
terms as an event object that waits to be triggered until the opportunity arises. 

Lemmens  et  al.  (2007)  and  Staub  et  al.  (2008)  in  this  journal,  as  well  as  Pundt
(2007)  describe  the  process  of  ontology  generation  across  different  abstraction  levels.
An analysis of this process is complicated by the fact that different authors use ontologies
for different purposes, which in turn biases their choice of tools and experiences. Visser
et al. (2002), for example, separate different ontology uses into benefits of their application
(communication,  systems  engineering,  interoperability),  and  their  purpose  (shared
vocabularies  and  conceptualizations,  specification  of  context  knowledge,  etc.). Staub
et  al.  (2008)  expand  on  Obrst  (2006)  to  discuss  an  “ontology  spectrum”  that  ranges
from  taxonomies  and  thesauri  to  conceptual  models  and  logical  theories.  Each  level
requires additional levels of specificity and eventually larger amounts of user interaction.
In other words, depending on what we mean by ‘ontology’ we may be able to do what
is needed with some of the general purpose ontology builders, or we may have to use a
whole tool chest of software packages, plus a lot of manual coding.

Computers

The range of publication outlets for the description of ontology tools in geospatial
applications is fairly limited and can be found first and foremost in this journal, but then
International  Journal  of
 
Environment  and  Urban  Systems,  the
also  in 
, and several online conference proceedings. Of these,
Geographical Information Science
most of the authors (e.g. Visser et al. 2002, Linková et al. 2005, Pundt 2007, Lemmens
et al. 2007, McCarthy et al. 2008) prefer Protégé over all other tools. This is consistent
with the use of ontology editors in general IT (Nieto 2003, Cardoso 2007). Protégé has
a wide range of import and export options and a good effort/result ratio, meaning that
while it is not the most powerful tool it provides many users with as many capabilities
as  they  need  for  an  acceptable  amount  of  learning.  Purists,  and  information  scientists
who have experience with knowledge-based systems, prefer OntoLingua (Gruber 1993),
which is based on the knowledge interchange format (KIF), which reaches into the top
end  of  the  abovementioned  ontology  spectrum  by  making  use  of  more  contextual
information. The discipline is maturing enough to now allow for commercial products
such  as  Altnova™,  Ontoprise™,  TopBraid  Composer™,  or  SemTalk™,  to  enter  the
market;  here  the  learning  curve  is  often  less  steep  and  eased  with  a  comfortable  user
interface – albeit at the price of real dollars or Euros rather than student labor.

However, Cardoso (2007) reports that still four out of five users of ontology editors
work in academia, where the working conditions differ considerably from those in non-
research  oriented  companies  or  public  agencies  at  local  or  regional  levels.  It  deserves
mentioning  that  the  majority  of  recent  articles  on  ontology  building  in  the  recent
GIScience  literature  (Visser  et  al.  2002,  Dolbear  et  al.  2006,  Hart  and  Dolbear  2006,

Lemmens  et  al.  2007,  Staub  et  al.  2008)  originate  in  Europe  and  typically  involves
partnerships  between  universities  and  national  agencies.  They  all  describe  projects
involving many person years of effort, where ontology editors, regardless of which ones
were employed, cover only a small part of the effort.

One of the reviewers of this article asked for a table that compares various editors
by  their  features.  Just  limited  to  the  editors  themselves,  this  request  is  well  covered  by
Duineveld et al. (2000) and more recently Escórcio and Cardoso (2007). However, the
discussion  above  alludes  to  the  fact  that  an  editor  is  only  a  small  component  in  the
workflow  underlying  an  ontology-driven  GIS  (Fonseca  et  al.  2002,  Cruz  et  al.  2005).
After looking at another major aspect of ontology building on the immediately following
pages, we will therefore work in section 3 through two examples to discuss the gaps in
the workflow with ontology building tools.

2.2 Process Model Specifications

GIS is more than just a data repository. As Noy and Guinness (2001) point out, programmers
make design decisions based on the operational properties of a class, whereas an ontol-
ogy  designer  makes  these  decisions  based  on  the  structural  properties  of  a  class.  In
consequence, we are still short of ontologies of geographic processes, and ontologies are
much easier translated into a database schema than into process models – although the
most recent crop of articles (Klien and Probst 2005, Lemmens et al. 2007, Peachavanish
and Karimi 2007, McCarthy et al. 2008) attempts to address the problem.

Both Protégé and WebODE allow for OWL-S output, i.e. the specification of services,
which according to the WorldWideWeb Consortium (W3C 2004) can in turn be modeled
as processes. We have, however, yet to see the development of geographic process libraries,
notwithstanding  the  efforts  of  NASA  (Raskin  2004),  a  few  intrepid  companies  (GOL
2004), and the odd GIScientist (Reitsma and Albrecht 2005, Peachavanish and Karimi
2007), the formal specification of geographic processes is at this point restricted to web
services  and  queries  á  la  Google  Maps.  This  should  come  as  no  surprise  because  the
ontology  community  has  not  really  gone  beyond  the  SNAP/SPAN  view  introduced  by
Grenon  and  Smith  (2003).  We  are  still  missing  a  practical  ontology  of  process  that  is
both proven to be formally correct and at the same time well enough developed to reach
to the level of real world applications.

The best we have at this point is UML output based on OWL-S encoded ontologies.
As mentioned above, (web) services, the usual target of OWL-S ontologies are a far cry
from the complexities of desktop-based spatial decision support systems. The best link
that  these  authors  have  found  so  far,  is  a  commercial  ontology  editor  called  SemTalk
(2008). Originally designed for business workflows, it is an OWL interpreter developed
as an extension to MS Visio. Formal consistency is assured with the open source OWL
reasoner PELLET (2008). Pre-existing ontologies such as SWEET (Raskin 2004) can be
imported  and  form  the  foundation  for  subsequent  user-defined  extensions.  One  of  the
advantages of this tool is its relationship with MS Visio, a widespread software package
that  is  also  commonly  used  to  define  the  data  models  for  various  ESRI  communities
(ESRI 2008). This allows for using one and the same tool to define both geospatial data
structures and processes. It is no coincidence that SemTalk has been designed for and is
most  widely  used  for  business  process  models.  In  the  following,  we  will  revisit  the
notion of workflows, originally introduced in a GIScience context by Smith et al. (1995)
and revisited by Lemos-Dias et al. (2004).

In  GIScience,  we  distinguish  between  two  different  notions  of  ‘process’  (Albrecht
2008).  One  is  the  notion  of  GIS  as  a  sequence  of  operations  with  the  goal  to  fulfill  a
specific set of tasks. The other is the attempt to represent dynamic geospatial phenomena
(Reitsma and Bittner 2003). The dynamic phenomenon aspect was revisited for individual
applications  (Feng  et  al.  2004,  Raubal  and  Worboys  1999)  but  conceptually  remains
with  the  representation  of  processes  as  a  sequence  of  events  (Worboys  and  Hornsby
2004,  Worboys  2005,  Galton  and  Worboys  2005).  Medeiros  must  be  credited  as
being  just  about  the  only  one  who  looked  beyond  the  realm  of  traditional  GIScience
(Weske  et  al.  1998,  Russell  and  Norvik  2003,  Ghallab  et  al.  2004)  to  work  with  plan
synthesis.

Plan synthesis is a mature area in information science, with well-studied algorithms
applied  to  manufacturing  processes  and  emergency  management,  among  others
(Munoz-Avila  et  al.  2001,  Nau  et  al.  2003).  Recent  research  efforts  have  investigated
the use of plan synthesis to solve the problem of automatic composition of web services
(Ambite  and  Kapoor  2007).  This  requires  the  consideration  of  additional  factors  such
as complex control structures with loops, non-determinism and conditionals (Srivastava
and  Koehler  2003).  None  of  the  plan  synthesis  methods  treats  complex  objects  or
objects created dynamically.

In contrast to the primitive analysis of user tasks in a GIS workflow (Albrecht 1995)
we  now  find  solid  applications  for  different  user  communities  (Jayavarapu  2007)  that
are based both on a deeper understanding of the communication process (MacEachren
et al. 2003) and new standards for business applications (Fillies et al. 2003). Notwith-
standing  the  advent  of  web  and  location-based  services  (Lemmens  2006),  much  of  the
GIScience standardization community is still stuck in the surveying perspective (Albrecht
1999). This contrasts with the development of the Object Management Group’s business
process  modeling  notation  (Thiagarajan  et  al.  2002,  BPMN  2008),  which  has  been
widely  adopted  and  could  easily  be  applied  to  the  OGC’s  information  communities
(Kottman  1999).  A  direct  outflow  of  that  framework  is  the  XML  process  definition
language  (Hollingsworth  2004,  WFMC  2008),  which  together  with  the  asynchronous
service  access  protocol  (Ricker  et  al.  2008,  Swenson  et  al.  2008)  forms  the  basis  of
Workflow-XML.

Using  the  BPMN  framework,  XPDL  and  Wf-XML  are  now  widely  accepted
standards  that  are  applied  in  dozens  of  software  packages  such  as  SemTalk,  and  are
used  for  the  formal  specification  of  workflows  in  neighboring  disciplines  such  as
bioinformatics  (Digiampietri  et  al.  2007).  Formally,  each  of  these  can  be  proven  using
Petri Nets (van der Aalst and Ter Hofstede 2000), which are increasingly being supported/
implemented in process modeling software packages.

In  the  next  section,  we  will  discuss  two  larger  application  examples,  where  the
authors  struggled  with  the  definition  of  new  data  and  process  models.  This  discussion
is  intended  to  illustrate  the  needs  from  an  applied  perspective,  in  this  case  two  university/
public agency partnerships.

3 Practical Experiences Highlighting Gaps between Theory and Practice

This section consists of two parts. In the first, we describe and analyze the needs of an
agent-based GIS model developed by Groff and described across a range of publications
(Groff  2007a,  b;  2008).  The  emphasis  in  this  discussion  is  on  the  formal  specification

J Albrecht, B Derman and L Ramasubramanian

of agent behavior in a geographic context – thereby addressing the process perspective
discussed in section 2.2. In the second part, we look at a transportation/land use model
developed  for  a  regional  planning  authority  that  builds  on  a  new  and  rather  involved
database  schema  beyond  the  scope  of  what  is  publically  available  in  this  application
domain. In both cases, the authors are forced to manually code their ontologies rather
than using any of the above mentioned tools, underlining the assertion made at the end
of section 2.1 that the current tools are of limited use in “the real world”.

3.1 Formal Specification of Actions in an Agent-based GIS

This model has been described in detail in Groff (2007a, b). We will here instead focus
on the process of agent specification, which is the foundation for what eventually was
implemented  in  AgentAnalyst  (2008),  a  Python  interface  between  the  agent-based
modeling  environment  Repast  (North  et  al.  2006)  and  ERSI’s  ArcGIS.  Following  the
logic of Kuhn (2001) Groff develops a formal framework of agent actions within a well-
defined  context,  in  this  case  crime  analysis.  ‘Context’  is  a  useful  feature  in  database
reasoning that allows adding some depth beyond mere descriptors (Visser et al. 2002).
But it becomes absolutely essential in the definition of agent behavior when those agents
represent  human  decision  making.  As  Cai  (2007,  p.  255)  describes  persuasively,  the
concept  of  ‘near’  is  dependent  on  the  context  of  what  mode  of  travel  we  are  talking
about. Analyti et al. (1999) and subsequently Cai (2007) describe how context specifications
and  ontologies  can  be  linked  and Bouquet  et  al.  (2004)  have  even  developed  an  OWL
dialect to accomplish just that, however, there is no tool that the authors of this article
are  aware  of  that  (1)  implements  C-OWL  and  (2)  does  so  with  a  comfortable  user
interface.  Groff  (2008)  therefore  develops  her  specifications  the  way  a  programmer
would:  defining  in  a  painstaking  iterative  process  all  the  variables  and  actions  of  the
agent-based model (Figure 1) and arranging them in the complex schedule that operates
at four different hierarchical levels.

The total model consists of four types of agents (places, citizens, cops, and activity
nodes) that perform 35 defined activities based on the state of 64 variables. It took Groff
a  good  year  of  her  PhD  to  develop  this  model,  which  is  a  lot  less  than  most  of  the
projects described in the cited literature but a lot more than the average GIS consultant
or employee in a regional authority could devote. The closest to a tool that assists in the
setup of the model logic would be something like Stella® (ISEE 2008) or a UML editor
that  supports  the  BPMN  framework  such  as  SemTalk.  The  same  tools  could  also  be
used  for  checking  the  formal  consistency  of  the  model.  If  the  agents  could  be  defined
within a GIS, then the resulting UML could be used to at least create a database schema.
We  do  not  have  any  tools  though  that  read  BPMN  notation  and  translate  it  into  GIS
procedures. Jäger et al. (2005) and Bambacus et al. (2007) provide examples of how to
do this for semantic web services but neither incorporate domain knowledge (Pike and
Gahegan 2006) nor allow access to functional levels of desktop GIS software. As agent-
based systems are not yet a feature of GIS but exist only in a coupled environment, we
would  have  to  follow  the  path  mapped  by  Endert  et  al.  (2007)  to  theoretically  relate
BPMN to a highly abstract definition of (JIAC) agents. This is not particularly practical
either though; to quote Endert et al. (2007, p. 55):

“Since there is no XML schema or similar given for BPMN, the editor’s domain
model  had  to  be  created  from  scratch  and  thus  is  not  compatible  with  other

BPMN  editors” . . . (and) . . . “Although  the  mapping  from  BPMN  to  JIAC  is
not  yet  fully  specified  and  there  is  still  some  work  to  do  to  support  the
transformation  of  unstructured  workflows,  the  basics  are  working  fine  and
simple BPMN diagrams can be transformed to JIAC multi-agent systems”. 

On an earlier page, we argue that agents are supposed to act depending on context
and  introduced  the  notion  of  context  ontologies.  From  a  developer’s  perspective
however, this context quickly gets out of hand because of the combinatorial explosion
of  possible  situations  among  the  many  dimensions  that  Groff’s  model  spans.  A  more
practical  solution  is  described  by  Ali  et  al.  (2007)  who  address  this  problem  with  a
spatial variant of an online analytical process (OLAP) to keep track of the complexities
in  the  real-time  analysis  of  their  multi-agent  geosimulation  software  decision  making
process. This takes care of some of the implementation issues but leaves the question of
ontology-based design tools that this article is about unresolved.

3.2 Formal Specification of a Land Use-based Transportation Model

The  second  model  to  be  discussed  here  has  not  yet  been  released  to  the  general  public
and the description is purposefully general as to not identify the agencies involved. The
goal of this spatial decision support system (SDSS) is to model existing flow in a multi-
modal network and to find optimal locations for a transit hub based on existing parcel-
level land use. The resulting geodatabase (all vector data) is approximately 2 GB in size,
and the procedures of the SDSS combine many hundreds of GIS operations for a single
model iteration. A top view of the underlying database schema is depicted in Figure 2,
while Figure 3 provides a superficial view of the geoprocessing model. 

At  first  sight  one  would  think  that  a  land  use-based  transportation  model  is  a  lot
easier to develop than the agent-based model described above because everything can be
implemented under the hood of a single software package such as ArcGIS. GIS databases
are  often  treated  as  mere  repositories  that  once  created  are  frozen  in  time  and  form  a
stable  basis  for  subsequent  analysis.  The  efforts  of  creating  a  database  are  hence
neglected  in  the  academic  literature  (notwithstanding  publications  on  management
(Huxhold and Levinsohn 1994, Tomlinson 2003, Watson 2005, Obermeyer and Pinto
2007,  Yeung  and  Hall  2007),  metadata  (Williamson  et  al.  2003,  Nogueras-Iso  et  al.
2005, Wootton 2007) or spatial decision support (Geertman and Stillwell 2002).

structure

Similar to the crime model of the previous section although not at the fine-grained
 is dynamically changing
individual level of perpetrators and victims, our model 
as we run the model. For instance, the choice of a commuter’s mode or route is influenced
by how many other commuters crowd one’s first or second option. Many train riders in
Seattle,  for  example,  are  familiar  with  the  added  number  of  passengers  when  flooding
closed a highway during exceptional rainstorm in fall of 2007. The same happens on a
smaller  but  cumulatively  as  effective  scale  every  day  in  metropolitan  areas  around  the
world. From an abstract perspective, the phenomenon is well studied and has become a
popular example in complexity theory (Qiu et al. 2000, Shen et al. 2005; Selçuk 2007).
As a matter of fact, it is one of the hallmarks of complexity theory (Gimblett 2002) that
its  objects  arise  from  innocent  looking  simple  setups.  With  the  exception  of  a  draft
paper by Line (2004), there is no ontology of complex systems and we are left with basic
tools  such  as  the  Unified  Modeling  Language  (Tsang  et  al.  2006),  which  lacks  the
mechanisms to deal with complex systems.

Still, the outlook is not as bleak as it is for the attempt to find a working environment
for the development of a multi-agent GIS. At least for the development of database schemas
we now have comfortable tools that create UML code that can be used to automatically generate
the desired schemas. Using BPML-aware editors, we can even generate process models that
at least from a conceptual modeling perspective allow for comfortable model development
and consistency checking. As mentioned above, however, there is currently no interface to
any of the mainstream GIS software packages and there is no reason to expect manufacturers
to jump into the gap because we are lacking application schema standards (ISO 19109
2005) at this higher level. The GML (OGC 2007) is at least a common denominator but
has  no  chance  to  cover  the  wide  range  of  functionality  that  a  standard  desktop  GIS
offers.  The  proliferation  of  add-on  packages  such  as  CityGML  (OGC  2008),  LandGML,
etc. serves as an indicator, although recent developments such as a schema definition for
moving features (ISO 19141 2008) promise interesting perspective in the long run.

This  then  leads  us  to  a  call  for  an  applied  research  agenda  that  we  outline  in  the

concluding section.

4 Conclusions

Based on the above examples we outline a requirements list of what the tools described
in  the  first  part  of  the  article  are  missing  to  make  them  practical  from  an  applications
perspective.  Klien  and  Probst  (2005),  as  well  as  da  Silva  et  al.  (2005)  call  for  research
on methods and tools that support application ontology engineering, e.g. by automating

the  process  of  creating  application  ontologies.  We  cannot  agree  more.  So,  how  do  we
get  there?  Apparently,  the  problem  is  non-trivial;  the  authors  are  not  aware  of  any
solutions in the wider non-spatial realm. 

In  a  first  step,  we  need  to  increase  our  efforts  on  the  low-level  ontology  side.
Grenon and Smith’s (2003) SNAP/SPAN dichotomy is a neat logical device to compart-
mentalize views of dynamic phenomena but we need a unified view that allows for the
application of one methodology rather than the continued parallel use of two. Reitsma
and Albrecht (2005) introduced a radical approach, which does not seem to have found
too big a following, yet they seem to have been onto something: Line (2004) and Raskin
(2004)  independently  came  up  with  similar  notions  of  ‘flux’  and  ‘trajectory’  that  do
away with the idea that we can capture processes in the form of discrete automata steps.
In  information  science,  the  solution  to  the  latter  was  introduced  by Petri  (1962).  Petri
nets,  also  known  as  place/transition  nets  allow  for  formally  complete  specifications,  are
uniquely suited for dynamic phenomena, and could conceivably be linked with network-
as  well  as  with  Voronoi-based  GIS  (e.g.  Gold  and  Cormack  1987).  The  International
Standards  Organization  (ISO/IEC  JTC1  2005)  is  about  to  accept  a  Petri  Net  markup
language  that  will  go  a  long  way  towards  public  access  to  what  used  to  be  a  rather
theoretical  tool.  Galton  and  Worboys  (2005)  use  similar  directed  multi-graphs  to
represent processes and Worboys and Hornsby (2004) provide an application-oriented
UML-based notation of objects and processes. This is a good start; what we need next
are industry-strength tools that implement the ideas put forward in those papers. 

Second,  we  need  spatio-temporal  schema  editors  that  assist  with  the  development
of complex scheduling and update routines in dynamic models. Even industrial-strength
UML tools like Rational Rose (2003) cannot cope with the spatio-temporal granularity
of models such as those described in the previous section. SemTalk (2008), described in
section 2, comes closest so far, but its BPML output cannot yet be readily translated into
specifications  that  a  GIS  or  an  agent-based  modeling  system  can  read.  An  immediate
solution for this problem is not visible, as this kind of optimization of a geospatial process
model specification is not an inherently academic endeavor. Similar to the development
of true three-dimensional GIS, we may even miss the inauguration of such tools because
they remain behind the closed doors of the defense and oil industry.

Finally, and here we join the tenor of Klien and Probst (2005), a widespread move
from static GIS repositories to GIS-based process modeling systems requires the development
of reusable libraries of process model specifications, similar to their counterpart in the
data model world. This is of course dependent on the availability of standardized tools
and  methodologies  –  the  steps  one  and  two  from  above.  Until  then,  the  conceptual
difficulties  of  bridging  domain-specific  models  (Albrecht  2007)  as  well  as  the  sheer  effort
required  to  develop  real-world  dynamic  GIS  will  render  them  a  rare  and  endangered
species.

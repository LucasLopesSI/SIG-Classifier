Abstract.
It is investigated whether a GIS-based distributed model developed
for rockfall assessment at slope scale, which uses data with a support of
2.562.5 m, could be used for rockfall assessment at the regional scale, using
input data with a support of 25625 m and of poorer quality. It was anticipated
that in the latter case the model error would increase. Three types of simulations
were applied to the same model and the outcomes were validated with ﬁeld data.
The ﬁrst simulation used input data with a support of 2.562.5 m and aggregated
the output to a support of 25625 m. The second simulation used the same input
data as in the ﬁrst simulation, but these data were aggregated to a support of
25625 m before running the model. The third simulation used input data of
poorer quality obtained at a support of 25625 m. The results show that
simulating the maximum extent of rockfall runout zones with a distributed
model using data with a support of 25625 m is realistic and feasible. This is also
true for data with poorer quality as the third simulation resulted in a slightly
larger mean-squared error than the ﬁrst simulation. Surprisingly, it also gave a
smaller error than the second simulation. We investigated the cause of the large
error produced by the second simulation and concluded that this was mainly
caused by the combination of a high-quality digital elevation model and the loss
of spatial structure in the input data due to spatial aggregation.

Introduction
Geomorphological research focuses on understanding processes, patterns and
landforms in geoecosystems. This type of research contributes to the basis needed
for
solving or preventing environmental
problems such as soil erosion, ﬂooding and rapid mass movements. Distributed
models are increasingly popular tools within geomorphological research (Willgoose
et al. 1991, Montgomery and Dietrich 1994, Tucker et al. 2001). They provide
excellent frameworks for the conceptualization of developed theories and for
simulating current or future processes and patterns in geoecosystems.

Models are simpliﬁed representations of reality and therefore model outcomes

always deviate from ‘the truth’ to some extent and contain errors or uncertainties.
These are caused partly by the model’s simpliﬁcation of the reality, but also because
model
input data are rarely known exactly and also probably contain errors
(Burrough and McDonnell 1998). The degree of model simpliﬁcation depends on
the availability and quality of input data, which are often determined by the
feasibility of measuring the inputs with sufﬁcient detail. Clearly, it is more difﬁcult
to obtain detailed input data for a large catchment than for a small monitoring
plot. Therefore, models and their input and output data are usually less detailed
when moving up from a smaller to a larger spatial scale (Heuvelink 1998).
Uncertainties or errors of model outcomes are thus related to spatial scale, of which
one factor is the ‘support’ of the model input data. Here, support is deﬁned as the
largest area treated as homogenous such that an average value of the property of
interest is known but not the variation within (Bierkens et al. 2000). Errors of
model outcomes do not necessarily increase at larger supports. For example,
aggregating data to large supports could decrease uncertainties about the average
value in a large raster cell (Van Rompaey et al. 1999). On the other hand, if the
model input data have a large support, errors in the model outcomes could increase
due to the loss of terrain information. The input data for a model should be of
sufﬁcient detail to capture the spatial variation that is essential to describe the
process or pattern being modelled (Goodchild 2001). In most cases a simpler or at
least another model structure is required for modelling larger study areas, since the
processes controlling changes in spatial patterns are different at different spatial
scales (Bergkamp 1995). In some cases, however, the same model can be used for
both a small and a large spatial scale, only the support of the input data may
change.

The present paper focuses on a GIS-based distributed model developed for
rockfall assessment at the slope scale, which was designed to use input data with a
support of 2.562.5 m. The main objective was to analyse whether such a model
could also be used for a larger scale (e.g. regional scale, for a study area covering
500 km2), using input data on a support of 25625 m. The larger support data are of
poorer quality because they have less detail and involve a reduced sampling or
mapping effort. It was anticipated that the model using data with a support of
25625 m would produce a larger error than that used on a support of 2.562.5 m.
The hypothesis was that poor data quality is the main cause of a larger model
prediction error rather than the effect of simulating a similar process on a larger
support. The distributed rockfall model was applied with data on a support of
2.562.5 m. Subsequently,
the same model was applied using the same data
aggregated to a support of 25625 m. Finally, the model was applied using input
data of poorer quality, which were obtained directly at a support of 25625 m. The
main objective is to determine how realistic or feasible rockfall simulation is with
data on a support of 25625 m.

2. Method and model overview

Three simulation schemes were deﬁned to analyse the effect of input data with
different aggregation levels on the accuracy of the output (ﬁgure 1). In simulation
scheme 1, input data with a support of 2.562.5 m were used. The output was
aggregated to a support of 25625 m by averaging the outputs on the 2.562.5 m
support. The output data were compared with validation data at the same support.

In simulation scheme 2, the same input data were used as before but they were
aggregated to a support of 25625 m before running the rockfall model. In
simulation scheme 3, the support of data was the same as in scheme 2, but the input
data for simulation scheme 3 were obtained directly at a support of 25625 m. Since
the data used in simulation scheme 3 were obtained at the regional scale and thus
less detailed than the data used in simulation schemes 1 and 2, it can be stated that
the quality of these data was considerably poorer.

The same rockfall simulation model was used throughout the three simulation
schemes. This model simulates a falling rock by calculating the kinetic energy
balance during sequences of motion though the air and collisions on the slope
surface or against trees. Start locations for the rockfall simulations were derived
from ﬁeld mapped rockfall source areas. From each start location, one single falling
rock was simulated. For details of the used rockfall simulation program, see Dorren
et al. (2004). A sensitivity test of the model showed that repeating the simulations
100 times using the Monte Carlo method (Lewis and Orav 1989, Mowrer 1997)
produced sufﬁciently stable results. This number of repetitions was considered an
acceptable trade off between computation time and the stability of the obtained
results.

Standard algorithms for a uniform accelerated parabolic movement through the
air calculated the motions through the air. Algorithms modiﬁed from Pfeiffer and
Bowen (1989) calculated the energy balance before and after collisions with the
the factor
slope surface and tree stems. The modiﬁcations were such that
compensating for the effect of the rockfall velocity on the elasticity of the collision
was left out, because the empirical constants required to calculate it were not
available for the study site. The algorithms for bouncing and motion through the
air were combined with a procedure that calculated the fall direction based on a
digital elevation model (DEM) as described in Section 3. A ﬂow diagram of the
model is given in ﬁgure 2.

The model inputs that are affected by a change of support, which were also the
model inputs focused on in this study, are a DEM, the rasters containing values for
the tangential and normal coefﬁcient of restitution and the tree distribution raster,
which includes both the number of trees per cell and the range of tree stem
diameters. The DEM was used to determine the mean slope gradient and therefore
the acceleration and deceleration of a falling block. Furthermore, the DEM

determined the fall direction. The coefﬁcients of restitution determined the amount
of energy lost during a bounce, where the tangential coefﬁcient of restitution
determines energy loss parallel to the slope surface (due to surface roughness or
vegetation) and the normal coefﬁcient of restitution determines energy loss
perpendicular to the slope surface (due to elasticity of the material covering the
slope surface). The tree distribution determined the probability of a falling rock
hitting a tree.

The outcomes produced by the three simulation schemes were compared with a

validation data. The correlation coefﬁcients between the observed and predicted
values were also calculated for each simulation scheme.

3. Test site and available data

The test site was a forested, active rockfall slope in the most western part of the
Austrian Alps, located at 47‡00’ latitude and 10‡01’ longitude. The site could be
divided into two areas. The rockfall source area, which is a steep cliff face dissected
by large denudation niches and an accumulation area, and a large post-glacially
developed talus cone consisting mainly of rockfall scree, but also some debris ﬂow
material. The mean slope gradient in the source area was approximately 70‡ and in
the accumulation area 38‡, The slope length of the talus cone is approximately
900 m. An overview of the site is shown in ﬁgure 3.

Two DEMs were available for the site, both raster based with supports of
25625 m (LRDEM) and 2.562.5 m (HRDEM). The LRDEM was created by
interpolation of photogrammetric height measurements at a ground distance of
50 m, enhanced and supplemented with prominent terrain structures. The given
maximum error in this DEM was 20 m (BEV 2002).

The HRDEM was derived from a TIN (Triangular Irregular Network), which
was created from contour lines with an equidistance of 5 m. The contour lines were
derived from a combined data set consisting of slope transects measured in the ﬁeld,
a detailed geomorphological ﬁeld map (1:2000) and existing contour lines with an
equidistance of 20 m. Since the site was fully covered with forest, we did not use a
tachymeter or photogrammetric height measurements based on aerial photographs

to create the HRDEM. The maximum error of the HRDEM was 6 m. The main
difference between the HRDEM and the LRDEM was that important terrain
structures, which determine the variation in the slope gradient of the site, were well
represented in the HRDEM, whereas in the LRDEM such structures were not
evident at all (ﬁgure 4).

Maps of mean slope gradients were derived from both the HRDEM and the
LRDEM using the method described by Zevenbergen and Thorne (1987). In
addition, fall directions were calculated using a modiﬁed multiple-ﬂow algorithm
(Quinn et al. 1991, Wolock and McGabe 1995, Tarboton 1997). To randomize the
fall direction from a central cell for each simulation run, this method calculated a
fall direction raster map by sampling the fall direction for each cell randomly from
a probability distribution. The latter was determined by the steepness of the mean
slope gradients between the central cell and all its downslope neighbouring cells.

The probability of a rock falling to a downslope cell was largest towards the lowest
downslope cell. For details about the procedure used, see Dorren et al. (2004).

The tangential coefﬁcient of restitution (rt), the normal coefﬁcient of restitution
(rn) and the tree distribution were represented as raster maps with a support of
25625 m (hereafter, respectively, LRrt, LRrn and LRtree) and with a support of
2.562.5 m (hereafter HRrt, HRrn and HRtree). The coefﬁcients of restitution
determine the energy efﬁciency of a collision (Chau et al. 2002). The vegetation
cover and the surface roughness determine the tangential coefﬁcient of restitution.
The normal coefﬁcient of restitution is determined by the elasticity of the slope
surface. The LRrt and LRrn were derived from data from the literature (Pfeiffer and
Bowen 1989, Kobayashi et al. 1990, Van Dijke and Van Westen 1990, Giani 1992,
Azzoni et al. 1995, Chau et al. 1998, Meißl 1998) and a land cover map, which was
obtained by classifying a Landsat TM image of September 1998 (Dorren and
Seijmonsbergen 2003). LRtree was also derived from this land cover map in
combination with data from a regional forest inventory (Maier 1993). Both HRrt
and HRrn were based on a detailed map (scale 1:2000) that depicted the spatial
distribution of different hill-slope characteristics potentially affecting rockfall tracks
(Dorren et al. 2004). From this map, rt and rn could be estimated using data from
the literature (Pfeiffer and Bowen 1989, Van Dijke and Van Westen 1990,
Kobayashi et al. 1990, Giani 1992, Azzoni et al. 1995, Chau et al. 1998, Meißl
1998). We created HRtree using a combination of a tree crown map and forest
inventory data. The tree crown map was derived from an object-based classiﬁcation
of high-resolution digital colour-infrared (CIR) orthophotos (0.2560.25 m) on
which each individual tree crown was visible. The forest inventory, which was done
with the ‘Winkelza¨ hlprobe’ method (Bitterlich 1948), provided additional data on
the forest stands throughout the study site. This inventory method is also known as
prism plot
the
probability of a tree being selected within a sampling plot is proportional to the
diameter of the tree (Shiver and Borders 1995). A grid was deﬁned over the test site
and tree stem diameters, the number of trees per ha and the rockfall damage per
tree stem (number of fresh scars) were measured. From this inventory the tree
volume, the number of trees and the damage per hectare were calculated for each
grid cell.

These data were aggregated for simulation scheme 2. LRDEM, LRrt, LRrn and
LRtree provided input data for simulation scheme 3. A summation of all the values
of the aggregated cells gave the aggregated tree map for simulation scheme 2. The
input data for the three simulation schemes are given in table 1 and a ﬂow diagram
of the method is given in ﬁgure 4.

Validation data were extracted from the detailed forest inventory data. Within
the grid cells covered by the forest inventory in the upper part of the accumulation
area 18 squares of 25625 m were selected randomly. We discarded the forest
inventory data in the lower parts of the accumulation area because rockfall activity
also originated from source areas outside the area used for this study. The size of
the validation dataset is small (n~18). Therefore results have to be interpreted
carefully,
these data are derived from a very large set of detailed
measurements.

rock impacts were measured. These data were compared with the number of rock
impacts on trees as simulated by the model. For standardization purposes, both
the validation data (observed values) and the simulated data (predicted values) in
the 18 squares were expressed as percentages of the summed values of all the
randomly selected squares. In other words, the observed value is the number of
scars per unit tree volume in a square expressed as a percentage of the total number
of scars per unit tree volume in all squares. Here, the number of scars per unit tree
volume is the number of scars per hectare caused by rock impacts divided by the
tree volume within the square. The predicted value represented the number of
impacts in a square expressed as a percentage of the summed number of impacts in
all squares.

4. Output of the three simulation schemes

Figure 5 shows the percentage of impacts in each cell for the three simulation
schemes. They show a similar gradient in the number of impacts per cell. Most
impacts occur in the upper right part of the area on the transition between the
source area and the accumulation area. Generally, the number of impacts decreases
towards the lower left, which is the accumulation area or runout zone. A notable

difference between the three simulations is the location of the maximum number of
impacts (ﬁgure 5). For simulation scheme 1, this is in the lower parts of the rockfall
source areas, but for simulation schemes 2 and 3, it is located on the upper part of
the accumulation area. However, for simulation scheme 3 the maximum number of
impacts is more evenly distributed over the accumulation area.

Comparison of the simulated impacts with the number of observed scars per
unit tree volume provided the results shown in ﬁgure 6. The histograms show that
simulation scheme 2 produced the largest errors and simulation scheme 1 the
smallest errors. In general, all errors are quite large. The scatter plots in ﬁgure 6
show the difference between each predicted and observed value for the three
schemes in detail. The scatter plot of simulation scheme 1 shows that the degree of
scatter between observed and predicted values is generally less than in the scatter
plots of schemes 2 and 3. This is caused by a more accurate estimation of the larger
observed values. Nevertheless, simulation scheme 1 also produced some consider-
able mismatches of the smaller observed values. The latter affects the mean-squared
error
shown in table 1
(MSE1~24.9). Simulation scheme 2 produced the largest error (MSE3~44.4)
and simulation scheme 3 produced an intermediate one (MSE2~31.3). This is also
(table 2). The correlation coefﬁcient
indicated by the correlation coefﬁcient
measures the strength of a linear relationship, but is not bound to the 1:1
relationship between observed and predicted values. The correlation coefﬁcient is
given here because it will indicate a systematic error in the model if both it and the
MSE are large.

5.1. ‘Intermediate’ simulation schemes

We did not expect simulation scheme 3 to give a smaller MSE than scheme 2.
Rather, we anticipated that scheme 3 would perform the worst, because it uses input
data of the poorest quality. The only difference between simulation schemes 2 and 3
is
four model parameters, which have all been changed
simultaneously. To assess which of these four input parameters caused a smaller
MSE for simulation scheme 3, we analysed ‘intermediate’ simulation schemes. These
‘intermediate’ simulation schemes are explained in table 3.

The results presented in table 3 show that the substitution of LRtree by the
aggregated HRtree (simulation scheme 7) resulted in an MSE of 29.3, which is
smaller than the initial MSE for scheme 3 (ﬁgure 7a). Substitution of LRrt by the

the substitution of LRrn by the aggregated HRrn
Table 2 also shows that
(simulation scheme 6) resulted in an increase of the MSE of 0.1, which indicates
that the net effect of rn on the simulation results was small.

A remarkable result is that the substitution of the LRDEM by the aggregated
HRDEM (simulation scheme 4) did not decrease MSE3. On the contrary, it resulted
in a large increase of the MSE from 31.3 to 47.8. The scatter plot of this simulation
result is shown in ﬁgure 7b. This simulation scheme strongly overestimated the
smaller observed values and strongly underestimated the larger observed values.

5.2. Causes of simulation errors

is averaged out

to a certain extent

The ‘intermediate’ simulation scheme 4 indicated that the aggregated HRDEM
was mainly responsible for the increase in error (table 2), which could be explained
as follows. The transport channel shown in ﬁgure 3, which is represented in both the
HRDEM and HRtree (ﬁgure 4),
in the
the fall directions
aggregated HRDEM but still represented. Consequently,
calculated based on the aggregated HRDEM were generally towards this channel.
This led to a concentration of falling rocks in the right side of the raster. Therefore,
the number of impacts is more on that side of the area (ﬁgure 8; simulation
scheme 4). This effect is reinforced by the fact that the transport channel is almost
free of trees. Therefore, hardly any rock impacts against trees occur in the channel
in reality. However, when using the aggregated HRtree, the forest structure in the
channel as observed in the ﬁeld and in HRtree is completely lost (ﬁgure 4).
Consequently, the number of trees in the fall track of the simulated rocks, as
represented by the aggregated HRtree, is overestimated, although the number of
trees in the channel is still smaller than in the surrounding areas. As a result, the
number of impacts in the channel is more strongly overestimated than in the other
simulation schemes, as shown in ﬁgure 8 (simulation scheme 1–3). This error
occurred to a lesser extent in simulation scheme 3, since in the LRDEM the channel
was completely ‘smoothed-out’. Consequently, a more uniform distribution of rock
impacts was produced.

The squares with an overestimation of 10.7% and an underestimation of 7.9% in
ﬁgure 8 (scheme 1) indicate a spatial mismatch between model results and ﬁeld
observations. Figure 8 shows that simulation schemes 2 and 3 have an under-
estimation only in the same area, which is about 12%. The errors in the validation
squares on the lowest part of the test site show that the simulation schemes 1–3
modelled the maximum extent of rockfall runout zones quite well (ﬁgure 5), as the
error values in those parts are smaller than 5%. None of the simulation schemes
produced rocks at the bottom part of the hill slope, which is in agreement with
reality. As mentioned before,
impacts on tree stems
reproduced the trend observed in reality, but were not very accurate as the
MSEs of all the simulation schemes were quite high.

5.3. Rockfall simulation at different scales

Overall, the results indicate that the GIS-based distributed model used in this
study, which was developed for rockfall assessment at a slope scale, can be used for
rockfall assessment at a regional scale. As expected, the simulation schemes
analysed indicated that input data with a support of 25625 m increased the MSE

compared to input data with a support of 2.562.5 m. However, the simulated
maximum extents of rockfall runout zones were similar for simulation schemes 1–3.
In addition, these simulated maxima also corresponded with those observed in
reality, which shows that modelling rockfall runout zones at the regional scale is
feasible and realistic, even for forested catchments. The simulated rockfall impacts
on tree stems using data with a support of 25625 m were not accurate, as the
mean-squared errors produced by simulation schemes 2 and 3 were much larger
than the MSE of scheme 1. Using tree distribution data of higher quality could
reduce the MSE of scheme 3 with about 2% as shown by the ‘intermediate’
simulation scheme 7. The accuracies of the results produced by schemes 2 and 3
indicate that simulating damage on tree stems caused by rockfall using data with a
support of 25625 m is not realistic. To assess where and how much tree stem
damage will occur, high quality data with a small support are required.

6. Conclusions

This paper has investigated the relationship between the aggregation level of the
input data and the accuracy of the output of a rockfall simulation model. The
results showed that the simulation of rockfall with a GIS-based distributed model
using data with a support of 25625 m is feasible and realistic to simulate rockfall
runout zones, but not for the simulation of tree damage caused by rockfall. The
latter arose because collisions of rocks against tree stems cannot be simulated
accurately where the data are of poor quality and the support is large.

As anticipated, the model using data with a support of 25625 m produces a
larger error than that using data with a support of 2.562.5 m. Our hypothesis was
that poor data quality is a more important cause of a larger model prediction error
than the effect of a larger support. This study showed that this is not necessarily
true because the simulation scheme that used data of higher quality produced a
larger error than the simulation scheme that used data of poorer quality. Here it
was interesting to observe that the loss of important spatial structure in the input
data (i.e. the rockfall channel represented in the slope map and in the tree
distribution map), as caused by spatial aggregation, resulted in a larger model
prediction error than the use of data that represented the landscape with less detail.
The results of this study also indicate that the use of a regional DEM of high
quality requires data on forest structure of higher quality than does a regional
DEM of poorer quality in case of simulating rocks falling through mountain
forests. We realize that other spatial simulation models and other input data than
those used in this study may well produce quite different results. However, since the
forest that was chosen as a study area is representative for many forests that protect
houses and infrastructure in the European Alps, we consider the outcomes also
applicable for other forests in the European Alps. The main reason for this is that
steep non-forested tracks, which are often preferential rockfall and also avalanche
tracks, occur in many of these protection forests. The existence of such non-forested
tracks was the main reason why the simulation scheme that used a DEM and tree

structure data at different supports was the most inaccurate. The same effect is
likely to happen when using data from other rockfall forests. It would be interesting
to aim future rockfall modelling research determining the minimum support
required to obtain realistic and trustworthy modelling results for the assessment of
the degree of protection provided by mountain forests against rockfall hazards in
the European Alps. These assessments probably could be done using data with a
support ranging from 1 to 25 m, but the question is which support would be
sufﬁcient. Goodchild (2001) stated that the input data for a model should be of
sufﬁcient detail to capture the spatial variation that is essential to describe the
process or pattern being modelled. The results of this study conﬁrm this, because it
shows that to model tree damage caused by rockfall, the tree distribution must be
known at a level of detail that corresponds with the physical process of rockfall.

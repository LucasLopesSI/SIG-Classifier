In this paper, we aim to clear up a significant conceptual error in the use of the
‘sink method’ as presented by Valavanis et al. (2005) for oceanic thermal front
detection. We argue that the features identified by the authors in their paper are
mostly cyclonic or cold ring eddies in the Aegean Sea.

Keywords: coastal applications; ocean processes; remote sensing; geographic
information systems

1. Introduction

In volume 19(10) of the International Journal of Geographical Information Science,
Valavanis et al. (2005) proposed a new method – ‘sink method’ for identifying
oceanic thermal fronts. Although it is encouraging to see the authors apply
geographic information system (GIS) in an oceanographic study, we argue that this
proposed method for front detection in the oceans is flawed as it is based on an
erroneous definition of an oceanic thermal front.

2. The sink method and its application to Istrian front, Adriatic Sea

Valavanis et al. (2005) use AVHRR sea surface temperature (SST) grid as a lattice of
elevation values. Using the ArcGIS implementation of the D8 algorithm, sink cells
are identified and flagged. SeaWiFS chlorophyll concentration (Chl) data are then
combined with the SST data. When the relationship between SST and Chl inside and
outside the flagged sink cells fall within the necessary parameters they are mapped as
oceanic thermal fronts.

We tested their method on the Istrian front in the northern Adriatic Sea (Figure 1),
clearly identifiable by the SST images on both 2 and 7 February 2002 (Figure 2). The
front was located south of the Istrian peninsula stretching from the southern tip of
Istria across the northern basin with a temperature gradient of approximately
0.5uC km21. According to Lee et al. (2005), the Istrian front is a mesoscale density-
compensated temperature-salinity front, characterized by warmer, more dense water
on the southern side of the front and fresher, colder water to the north of the front.
The front exists at the boundary between two counter-rotating gyres, a cyclonic gyre
to the south and a smaller anticyclonic gyre to the north in the northern Adriatic

Sea. These gyres are primarily driven by the Bora jets, formed as the cold and dry
winds move across the Dinaric Alps from Euro-Asian continent.

It became apparent that neither the Istrian front nor any of the other fronts
distinct in the SST images were being located or identified. In order to demonstrate
that this method is not locating the thermal front features in the images and that the
fronts do exist, an alternative gradient method using the ArcMap ‘Slope’ function
was applied to the same images. The slope function is designed to identify slopes and
the degree of slope or gradient on a digital terrain model. It identifies the maximum
rate of change in value from each cell to its neighbours. The function determines the
slope using the basic ‘rise over run’ function of a right-angled triangle. In our
situation where the height values of a digital terrain model are substituted with SST
values the ‘rise’ refers to units of temperature while the ‘run’ value refers to units of
distance. The results of applying the gradient method contrast with the results gained
from the sink method. A well-defined Istrian front was identified by the gradient
method, with the front location and strength similar to those observed by previous
researchers (e.g., Wang 2005, Pullen et al. 2007).

3. What went wrong with the sink method?

The D8 algorithm identifies sinks as areas of topography that do not drain. They are
localized depressions. When SST is used as the data type, the temperature values are
treated as height values creating a terrain picture such that areas of higher SST are
treated as higher ‘ground’ and lower SST values represent lower ‘ground’. The sink
method is based on a method for identifying local depressions in the digital terrain
model (DTM), which are not analogous phenomena to that of a front.

In oceanographic terms a thermal front is a zone of temperature change between
two water masses of different temperatures. Areas where fronts commonly occur
include the boundary between warm and cold currents, the boundary between
coastal and oceanic waters, off estuaries, along the margins of areas of upwelling and

around banks, reefs, shoals, island edges and shelf edges (Fearnhead 1975). What
will be formed between these two different water masses will therefore be a gradient
where the temperature changes from the temperature of one water mass to the other.
Given the limitations this definition imposes it follows that throughout the area of
the front the water temperature at any given position will match either that of the
the colder water mass or lie somewhere between the
warmer water mass,

temperatures of these two masses, thus creating a slope as opposed to a depression in
the temperature range. There is little scope in this definition for the water
temperature at any point within the front to fall outside the range dictated by the two
water masses involved. Although it may be possible for spot temperatures outside of
this range to exist, these would be anomalies and not reliable or sufficiently distinct
upon which to base a front location technique. Figure 3 illustrates this in simplified
terms. It is clear that the two features being described above are separate, unrelated
phenomena.

4. What does the sink method actually find?

This Valavanis et al. (2005) method locates an area or patch of water with lower
surface temperatures than the areas immediately surrounding it (Figure 1); according
to the definition of a thermal front given previously this does not constitute a front.
The explanation given above of what the method actually finds describes an area of
cold water.

The additional testing of chlorophyll in the proposed method allows for a more
specific definition of what the features actually are. The method states that the
surface chl must be higher within the identified feature than in the surrounding areas.
If both SST is lower and Chl is higher within the identified feature then that feature
is considered to be of interest, however, incorrectly defined as a ‘front’ by this
method. The higher Chl requirement implies that the area has increased biological
activity, indicating that the identified area experiences higher organic productivity
than surrounding areas. This, combined with the localized cold water, characterizes
an area of upwelling.

Upwelling is the vertical movement of water by which deep, cold, nutrient-laden
water is brought to the surface. On the basis of this information an area of upwelling
would appear in an SST image as an area of water with surface temperatures lower
than that of the surrounding water. Furthermore, high productivity of the nutrient-
laden water results in higher Chl values than those of the surrounding water. This is
consistent with the Chl requirements stipulated in the sink method where Chl within
the identified feature must be greater than those in the surrounding area.

We believe that the features identified by Valavanis et al. (2005) in their paper are
mostly cyclonic or cold ring eddies in the Aegean Sea. Cold eddies produce
upwelling, whereas warm (anticyclonic) eddies produce downwelling in the oceans
(http://www.geol.sc.edu/cbnelson/eddy/eddy.htm). In the Aegean Sea, a complex

system of cyclonic and anticyclonic features of smaller scale has been observed in the
various sub-basins owing to a very complex topography of the region (Sofianos et al.
2006). One example of such eddies is so-called ‘Sporades cyclone’, which forms in
Sporades Basin (Kourafalou and Tsiaras 2007). Indeed, Valavanis et al. (2005) found
high correlations between the bottom topography and the locations of the features
found by the sink method. This provides further support that the features identified
may be cyclonic or cold ring eddies generated by the complex topography such as
islands, seamounts, shelf breaks and basins.

5. Conclusion

It has been our aim in this comment to clear up a significant conceptual error in the
use of the ‘sink method’ as presented by Valavanis et al. (2005) for oceanic thermal
front detection. It has not been our intention to diminish the significance of their
work. In contrast, we see the emergence of GIS/remote sensing technology as having
great potential for oceanographic research.

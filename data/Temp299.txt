Abstract. A locational error model for spatial features in vector-based geograph-
ical information systems (GIS) is proposed in this paper. Using error in points
as the fundamental building block, a stochastic model is constructed to analyse
point, line, and polygon errors within a uni® ed framework, a departure from
current practices which treat errors in point and line separately. The proposed
model gives, as a special case, the epsilon band model a true probabilistic meaning.
Moreover, the model can also be employed to derive accuracy standards and
cartographic estimates in GIS.

Introduction
In the theoretical development and application of geographical information sys-
tems (GIS), the issue of spatial database accuracy has attracted much attention in
the GIS community. Ever since it was identi® ed as a research initiative at the US
National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (Goodchild 1988), a
systematic e(cid:128) ort has been made to investigate various aspects of accuracy in spatial
databases (see Goodchild and Gopal 1989, Heuvelink et al. 1989, Veregin 1989 a, b,
Goodchild 1989, 1991, Hunter 1991 ).

Among various problems, the issue of positional error in vector-based GIS has
received intensive investigation over the years. Error models for point, line, and
polygon have been developed on the theoretical and/or experimental basis.

In vector-based GIS, accuracy of a point is a fundamental issue that has signi® cant
bearing on the analysis of error in other spatial features. Analogous to classical
theory of measurement, positional error of a point can ordinarily be modelled as a
two-dimensional normal distribution, or speci® cally a circular normal distribution.
This is, in fact, a common point error model employed in the GIS community
( Bolstad et al. 1990, Goodchild 1991).

Di(cid:128) ering from the relatively consistent treatment of point errors, researchers are
more divergent in the modelling of line errors. The epsilon band concept is perhaps
the most popular line error model in the literature ( Perkal 1956, 1966, Maling 1968,
Chrisman 1982, 1987, 1989, Blakemore 1984, Dunn et al. 1990, Carver 1991, Veregin
1994, 1996, Edwards and Lowell 1996 ). In its deterministic form, the epsilon band

model gives a boxcar distribution of width 2e around the digitized line serving as a
bu(cid:128) er of uncertainty along the true line. In its pseudo-probabilistic form (it should
be noted that distributions used in the epsilon band models are not probability
distributions in the strict sense), the model may give a rectangular, bell-shaped, or
bimodal distribution demarcating the zone of uncertainty along the true line
(Chrisman 1982, Dunn et al. 1990 ).

Regardless of which version (deterministic or pseudo-probabilistic) the epsilon
band concept assumes, the band width is a ® xed constant imposing arti® cially a
sharp boundary within which the true position of the line lies. It falls short of being
a stochastic process model (Chrisman 1989, Goodchild 1991).

Except for some empirical studies (see for example Honeycutt 1986, quoted in
Goodchild 1989), the epsilon band model
is largely a conceptual undertaking.
Furthermore, the model gives no clear linkage with the positional errors of the points
constituting a line. This is exactly why an error band is used in the epsilon band
model. The move is supported by some arguments suggesting that errors in lines
cannot be derived entirely from errors in points (Goodchild 1991 ).

However, separating errors in points from errors in lines appears to be counter-
intuitive since lines are obtained from points and polygons are obtained from lines.
Errors in lines and polygons should in one way or the other be related to errors in
points. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the fundamental building block of error
models for vector-based GIS should be the positional error model of the basic
primitiveÐ points. A separate treatment of errors in points and errors in lines will
prevent us from deriving a consistent and comprehensive error model for the point-
line-polygon features in GIS. Furthermore, it makes it di(cid:129) cult to derive an accuracy
standard and to assess errors in GIS products.

Though some attempts have been made to link errors in points to errors in lines,
the solution is, nevertheless, not satisfactory. For example, Shi and Temp¯ i ( 1994)
treat line error as the linear combination of errors of the endpoints. This, however,
is inconsistent with the concept of epsilon-band where a ® xed band width for the
whole line is enforced.

The purpose of this paper is to derive a general error model for point, line, and
polygon features in GIS, accounting simultaneously for the circular normal model
for positional errors in points and the epsilon band model for errors in lines. The
proposed locational error model is a probabilistic model which degenerates into the
epsilon band model under a certain con® dence limit. It treats errors in points, lines,
and polygons within a uni® ed framework and provides an accuracy standard, error
assessment, and cartographic estimate of spatial databases.

IN §2, we discuss the assumptions, structure, and properties of the locational
error model. Based on the model, an accuracy standard of a GIS is then proposed
in §3. Some cartographic estimates in GIS are correspondingly derived in §4. We
conclude the paper with a summary and some directions for further research in §5.

2. The locational error model for spatial features
2.1. Assumptions and justi® cations

The basic assumption of the locational error model is that the positional error
of a point takes on a circular normal distribution. Specially, for a point locating at
coordinate (a, b) on a planimetric map, the probability of any point (x, y) being the
true location of the point is given by:

f (x, y)=

We further assume that positional error of all points in a spatial database

conforms to the distribution in ( 1) with the same standard deviation s.

It can be argued that this additional assumption may be too ideal or perhaps a
little too simple. Our making of the assumption, however, has some appealing
justi® cations. First, if di(cid:128) erent standard deviations are assumed for di(cid:128) erent points,
then it is di(cid:129) cult to derive an accuracy measure for the whole database and to track
errors as they propagate through GIS operations. For example, errors propagate
di(cid:128) erently through di(cid:128) erent GIS operations. After a GIS operation, the propagated
error at the resulting new points may not be the designated error of the new point.
Second,
if di(cid:128) erent points have di(cid:128) erent standard deviations, then the standard
deviation should vary continuously as the points vary continuously along the line.
That is, to be consistent, we should have a continuous standard deviation surface
for the whole database. The implication then is that the epsilon band should have
di(cid:128) erent widths at di(cid:128) erent points along the line, contrary to the conventionally
rationalized constant band width for the whole line. Therefore, the assumption of
the uniform standard deviation for all points circumvents the above di(cid:129) culties, and
the uniform standard deviation may be treated as an average measure of deviation
for all points (see equation ( 11)).

2.2. Model structure and properties

The curve of f (r) is depicted in ® gure 1 (see appendix 1 for the derivation of its

characteristics).

Based on equation ( 5), the expectation, E [F ], and the variance, VA R [F ], of the
distribution function F (r) in equation ( 4) can be obtained as follows (see appendix

We can calibrate some probability values of F (r) for further information. For

selected values of r, we have:

F (s)#39´35% ;

F (E [F ])#54´41% ;

F ( 2s)#86´47% ;

F ( 2´146s)#90% ;

F ( 3s)#98´8% .

We are now in the position to detail the locational error model for features in a
vector-based GIS. Suppose that a spatial object B ( point or line) on a planimetric
map is digitized as feature O*. The locational error model for points or lines says
that the probability that the true digitized representation, O, of the object B located
in the r-band of O* is F (r), given by equation (4 ), or in other words,

where DÅ (O, O *) is called the distance of O away from O *, and is de® ned by

P (DÅ (O, O *)<

r)=F (r)

DÅ (O, O *)=max
p×O

min
q×O*

d ( p, q)

where d ( p, q) is the Euclidean distance between points p and q.

We further elaborate the locational error model by giving interpretations of the

distance in equation ( 8 ) as follows:

(a) Since all point or line features in vector-based GIS are closed sets with respect
2, then for features O and O *, there

to the Euclidean distance topology of R
exists p0×O and q0×O* such that DÅ (O, O *)=d ( po, q0 ).

(b) If O is a single point set, O ={p}, then for any feature O *, we see from equation
( 8) that DÅ ({p}, O *) is just the de® nition of the distance from point p to set
O *:

DÅ ({p}, O *)= min
q×O*

d ( p, q ).

In particular, DÅ ({p}, {q})=d ( p, q ) is just the distance between points p and q.
The situations are depicted respectively in ® gures 2 (a), (b) and (c) where O *=
{q}, O *=L , and O *=A denoting respectively that O * is a point feature, a
line feature, and a polygon feature.

(c) If O * is a single point set, O *={q}, then for any feature O [O ={p} (a point),
O =L (a line), and O =A (a polygon)], DÅ (O, {q}) is the maximal distance from
q to any of the points in O , i.e. DÅ (O, {q})=max
p×O

d ( p, q ) (® gures 3 (a), (b), (c)).

(d ) Depending on the types of features O and O * stand for, DÅ (O, O *)Þ DÅ (O *, O )
in general. So, we call DÅ (O, O*) the distance of O away from O *, but not the
distance between O and O *. Figures 4 (a), (b) and (c) depict some typical
examples.

(e) DÅ (O, O *)=0, if O kO *, in particular DÅ (O, O )=0.
( f ) For any ×>0 and any feature O ( point or line), the set

{p|DÅ ({p}, O )<

e}

( 9)

is just the e-band (or e-bu(cid:128) er) of feature O .

r2=DÅ (O *, O ), between spatial features.

(g ) For any line feature L , the e-band of L can be considered as the interior of
the e-equidistance line of L . The e-equidistance line of L is the set ( line)

{p|DÅ ({p}, L )=e}

( 10)

(see ® gures 5 (a), (b)). For any closed line L , the e-equidistance line of L has
two parts, one in the interior of L and the other in the exterior of L . So, the
e-band of L can also be divided into two parts, one is the part between L
and the interior e-equidistance line, and the other is the part between L and
the exterior e-equidistance line. Thus, the proposed locational error model
gives naturally the epsilon band model with a probability interpretation.

Since a polygon is de® ned by its boundary, we can de® ne the locational error
model of a polygon feature through the locational error model of its boundary. That
is, for an area object A on a planimetric map with boundary B (closed line), suppose
that B is digitized as a line feature O * (the implication is that A is digitized as a
polygon-feature boundary by O *), then the locational error model for polygons says
that the probability of the true digitized representation of B (the boundary of A )
locating in the r-band of O * is F (r) given by equation ( 4 ).

Remark 1: For a polygon A (® gure 6 (a)), the e-band of A (® gure 6 (b)) and the
e-band of the boundary of A (® gure 6 (c)) are di(cid:128) erent. So, the locational error model

for polygons gives the probability, F (r) in equation ( 4), of the true digitized repres-
entation of the boundary of a polygon A locating in the r-band of the digitized
representation of the boundary of A, but not the probability of the true digitized
representation of A locating within the r-band of the digitized representation of A.
That is, the probability is de® ned according to the boundary but not the polygon
itself.

2.3. Justi® cations for the locational error m ode l

The proposed locational error model has several theoretical and practical appeals.

They are summarized as follows:

(a) The classical error model of measurement is a stochastic model and the
normal distribution serves as a basis of error analysis. The proposed locational
error model for spatial features is also deduced from the normal distribution.
Thus, it ® ts error analysis in GIS quite nicely with the classical error analysis,
and gives a genuine probabilistic treatment of error in spatial databases.
Furthermore, the present model generalizes the classical model by particular-
izing error models for points as a circular normal model.

(b) Since all spatial features in a vector-based GIS are de® ned on the basis of
point features (e.g. a line is de® ned as a sequence of digitized points connected
by straight line segments, and a polygon is de® ned as the interior of its
boundary delimited by a closed line), then, the positional uncertainty of points
should form the basis for the uncertainty analysis of all spatial features.
(c) In the proposed model, we need only one parameter, s, to describe the
accuracy of a database. This simpli® es the establishment of an accuracy
standard and the assessment of errors in GIS (see discussion in §3).

(d ) We can observe in §4 that the locational error model for spatial features also
forms an analytical basis of cartographic estimates of length and area.

(e) The model becomes the epsilon band concept when we restrict our error to
a certain con® dence limit. As a result, we can use the ready-made tools in
conventional GIS to analyse and display the corresponding uncertainty in
the database.

( f ) If the model is used to measure the error of the entire GIS (or the end
product of a GIS), then the accuracy index s in the model becomes an index
which approximately accounts for all sources of errorÐ
including the errors
induced by the overlay operation through which propagation of error is

notoriously di(cid:129) cult to trace. So, our model can be used as a short cut to
integrate all error sources.

Remark 2: It should be noted that in the proposed model the line error is not
considered as the linear combination of errors of the end points. Instead, we consider
that all points on a line segment are independent and have the same probabilistic
distribution as the endpoints of the segment. This enhances our generalization power
from points to lines to polygons as discussed above. However, the new model only
considers the distance the real line is away from the digitized representation of it
and ignores the distortion in shape and the shift in location, such as the uniform
shift in location of every point resulting from misregistration of spatial objects.
Therefore, our model is perhaps a bit simple compared to the complexity of plausible
errors in spatial databases. Nevertheless, it is a necessary trade o(cid:128) between the level
of generalization and the exact replication of reality.

3. A direction for establishing an accuracy standard in GIS

In the United States, several accuracy standards for topographic maps have been
developed and adopted by di(cid:128) erent mapping agencies, e.g. the National Map
Accuracy Standard ( NMAS), the Engineering Map Accuracy Standard ( EMAS),
and the American Society of Photogrammetry Standard ( Veregin 1989 b). These
standards were developed for di(cid:128) erent scales and applications. By the same token,
it is natural to ask whether some accuracy standards should be developed for GIS.
The answer is positive if an appropriate error model exists. Since the locational error
model for spatial features is deduced from the normal distribution which serves as
the error model for maps, so we can suggest a direction for establishing an accuracy
standard for GIS somewhat similar to that developed for maps.

The NMAS is based on the compliance with a horizontal and a vertical accuracy
standard which de® ne the limit of acceptable error in the horizontal and vertical
map dimensions. Compliance testing is based on the comparison of at least 20 well-
de® ned map points relative to a survey of higher accuracy. The horizontal accuracy
standard states that at most 10% of the map points may have a horizontal error
greater than 1/30 inches for map scales greater than 1520 000, or 1/50 inches for
scales of 1520 000 or less. The vertical accuracy standard states that at most 10%
of the map points may have a vertical error greater than one-half of the contour
interval of the map ( Veregin 1989 b).

For planimetric accuracy, a standard for GIS similar to that of NMAS can be
formulated. We can use, for example, the magnitude of the earth surface that a GIS
intends to represent instead of the scale in NMAS; and use a set limit to the accuracy
index s (or 2´146s, see equation ( 17)) instead of 1/30 inches or 1/50 inches in NMAS.
Since the parameter s in the locational error model has the same meaning as
that of the normal distribution, so s can be similarly estimated as that in the normal
distribution. For example, suppose we have a set of well-de® ned map points

{p1 (x1, y1 ), p2 (x2, y2 ), ´´´, pn(xn, yn)}

where the coordinates of the points are obtained from a survey of higher accuracy
with respect to a real-world coordinate system. Let the same points take on
coordinates

n, y¾

n)}

with respect to the same real-world coordinate system in a spatial database. Then,
s can be estimated as

4. On cartographic estimates in GIS

In a vector-based GIS, a curve is digitized as a broken line, a series of digitized
points joined by straight line segments, and its length is measured by the length of
the broken line. A region is represented as the interior of a polygon and its area is
measured by the area of the polygon. Taking error into consideration, if accuracy
information is to be entertained in a GIS, how can we make cartographic estimates,
e.g. length and area, in GIS?

The answer lies in the accuracy index s in the locational error model. We can
actually add accuracy information to the cartographic estimates or answers to
queries. The following are some examples (see also Goodchild 1991):
(a) A point p (a, b) has a 90% chance of lying within the circle

(since the boundary of P is a closed line, then its e-band is ring-like. So we can
establish the outer and inner boundaries of the boundary of P (® gure 6 (c)).

The problem of cartographic estimate of the length of a curve is much more
complex than the above estimate problems. Sinuosity of a curve complicates its
locational error. Since a curve is generalized as a sequence of digitized points joined
by straight line segments, then the di(cid:128) erence between the real curve and its digitized
representation becomes huge when the sinuosity of the curve increases. So, the length
of the digitized representation of the curve can be much smaller than that of the
length of the real curve. Galloway and Bahr ( 1979 ), and Baugh and Boreham ( 1976 )
reported that the coast line can have very di(cid:128) erent lengths under di(cid:128) erent measure-
ments. As pointed out by Maling ( 1968), the line on a map which represents an
empirical curve is itself an empirical curve. So, we can assume that the cartographic
estimate of the length of a curve is empirical.

An empirical formula based on fractal geometry says that

L =L 0r1Õ D,

( 18)

where L is the empirical length of a curve, L 0 is the estimated length obtained by
cartographic estimate, r is the length of the intercept in cartographic estimate, and
D is the fractal dimension of the curve (which represents the sinuosity of the curve)
and 1< D < 2.

Under our locational error model, we can deduce a new empirical formula which
can be used to estimate the lengths of curves in GIS. Since under 90% con® dence
limit, the real digitized representation of a curve L locates within the 2´146s-band
of its digitized representation L 0, then we can conjecture that under 90% con® d-
ence limit,

L =L 0( 2´146s)1Õ D,

( 19)

(for simplicity, we also use L and L 0 to denote the length of L and L 0 respectively).
That is, we take 2´146s as the minimal distinguishable unit length in a GIS and take
it as the length of the intercept in the cartographic estimate.

Under this situation, the empirical length of a curve obtained by equation ( 19)
is not the measure obtained from cartographic estimate, but the result of error
estimate.

Another interesting cartographic etimate that can be addressed through the
locational error model is the weighted centre. Suppose there are N points pn(xn, yn),
n=1, 2, ..., N , and we want to know the weighted centre of these points under the

weight coe(cid:129) cients w1, w2, ..., wN, with wn>

0, and (cid:158)

wn=1.

If pn(xn, yn), n=1, 2, ..., N , have no error, then the weighted centre of {pn(xn, yn),

n=1, 2, ..., N }, under weight {wn, n=1, 2, ..., N }, is P (x, y), where

postulated in the locational error model for points. Then what is the distribution of
the weighted centre of {pn(xn, yn), n=1, 2, ..., N } under weight {wn, n=1, 2, ..., N }?

To obtain such a distribution, the independency hypothesis of {pn(xn, yn), n=
1, 2, ..., N } is necessary. According to probability theory, the weighted centre, as the
linear combination of {pn(xn, yn), n=1, 2, ..., N }, has the following normal distribution:

5. Conclusion

We have proposed in this paper a locational error model for point, line, and
polygon features in GIS. Di(cid:128) ering from existing error models which treat errors in
points and errors in lines separately, the proposed model, using errors in points as
the fundamental building block, analyses errors in points, lines, and polygons within
a uni® ed framework. It is a truly stochastic model which includes the epsilon band
model with a probabilistic argument as a special case.

In addition to error analysis, the locational error model also provides a means
to determine an accuracy standard in GIS. Furthermore, it can be employed to
derive cartographic estimates in GIS. Therefore, error analysis, accuracy standard,
and cartographic estimates can all be analysed within a uni® ed framework.

For further research, we can investigate how the model can be used to entertain
spatial queries, e.g. point-in-polygon query ( Leung and Yan 1997 ), in GIS, especially
under uncertainty. To further substantiate its theoretical arguments, empirical ana-
lyses should be performed for a variety of GIS products.

Appendix 1. Derivation of the characteristics of the density function, f (r) in
equation ( 5 ), of the distribution function F (r)

We can derive the characteristics of the function f (r) in equation ( 5) as follows:

So, f ¾ (r)>0 if 0<r<s; f ¾ (r)<0 if s<r; and f ¾ (r)=0 if r=s. Therefore, f (r) increases
monotonically within the interval ( 0, s); decreases monotonically within the interval

(s, +2); and takes on the maximum value f (s)=

at r=s.

is concave in ( 0, Ó 3s); convex in (Ó 3s, +2); and r=Ó 3s is the point of

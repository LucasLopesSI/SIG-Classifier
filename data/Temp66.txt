This study uses cartometric techniques to reveal cartographic design considerations operative in Frank H. Galbraith’s
1897 railway mail service training maps. Galbraith’s maps make extensive use of humorous cartouches intended to serve as
mnemonic devices for learning railway mail service routes. Poisson and quadrat point pattern analyses are performed on
all eight maps in the series to determine whether the mimetic symbols are clustered along the railway mail routes or
dispersed throughout the mapped spaces to achieve better graphic balance. Evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the
placement of the mnemonic symbols was primarily driven by design considerations. The study therefore proves that it is
possible to use cartometric techniques to deconstruct the map document to determine the cartographic design principles
operative during the map’s construction.

INTRODUCTION

Frank H. Galbraith was a Gilded Age United States
railway mail service worker who developed a fascinating
series of maps to help train people to pass the civil service
examinations necessary to qualify for employment as a
railway mailman. The late nineteenth century was a period
of rapid expansion in the US railway mail network, as the
number of rolling mail clerks increased from 752 in 1873
to 8794 in 1902 (Wilking, 1985). With the advent of a
stringent Civil Service Reform Act in 1889, applicants
were given six months of probationary training before
being tested on their accuracy at sorting ‘100 envelopes
in 7 to 12 minutes with 5 to 10 errors’ (Mason, 2002,
p. 24). This accomplishment necessitated knowledge of
around 1500 post ofﬁces and the rail networks to access
them.

the need for

To help meet

learning tools during
this intensive apprenticeship, Galbraith (1897) developed
a series of maps of eight midwestern states (Illinois, In-
diana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and
Nebraska), examples of which are housed at the Library of
Congress (LOC) and available online in digitized format.
The hallmark of Galbraith’s work is its extensive use of
colourful — quite often comical — cartouches intended to
stimulate memory through presenting ‘the railway [mail]
scheme as a visual and spatial entity by associating pictures
with words on the maps to heighten the interest in
studying’ (Mason, 2002, p. 26). Galbraith’s impressive

iconography has been extensively illustrated and categor-
ized by Mason (2002); examples are provided in Figures 1
and 2 below. In short, Galbraith illustrates his railway
network training maps with amusing cartoons which have
some direct or indirect connection to a nearby toponym.
The symbols therefore serve as mnemonic devices to
stimulate learning of those place names. Examples include
a picture of Santa Claus beside the town of Holiday,
skeleton illustrations associated with places named for
saints, and caricatures of famous ﬁgures of history and
contemporary popular culture next to relevant placenames
(Mason, 2002). The overall results of this composition can
be seen in the Galbraith state maps reproduced as insets
in Figures 3–10 below. Cartographically, these mnemonic
map elements can be called mimetic, pictographic, or
ideographic symbols because they attempt to represent map
concepts through realistic (as opposed to abstract) graphic
devices.

Based on an examination of advertisements and other
statements from the McEwen Map Company of Chicago
which produced manuscript Galbraith maps for rental to
probationary railway mail service workers, Mason (2002)
concludes that ‘Galbraith’s purpose in the design of his
maps was to selectively incorporate only those features
relevant to the study practices of the railway mail clerk’ (p.
26). Indeed, Mason (2002) provides compelling evidence
that Galbraith’s basemaps represent a conscious simpliﬁca-
tion along those lines relative to other contemporary railway

network maps which would have been available to those
studying for the civil service tests. Nevertheless, the high
density of city and symbol features populating the maps
prevents certainty in qualitative assessment of their dis-
tribution. It is impossible to tell through visual analysis
whether the placement of mimetic symbols is guided by
pedagogical need (i.e., in intimate proximity to railway post
ofﬁces), or whether they are placed more evenly throughout
the mapped space to provide a balanced, aesthetically
pleasing cartographic layout.

The present study examines observed distributions of city
and symbol points across the eight 1897 Galbraith railway
mail service learning maps to determine whether symbol
placement appears to have been driven by a cartographic
concern for balanced graphic design or by a concern for
reinforcing toponymic recall along railway mail routes. This is
accomplished through a combination of quadrat and Poisson
analyses of observed point patterns. Results indicate that
Mason’s (2002) assertion must be rejected since this study’s
quantitative analysis suggests that Galbraith’s primary design
consideration in mimetic symbol placement was aesthetic. As
feature clutter greatly impedes cartographic functionality,
Galbraith’s mimetic symbols are potentially pedagogically

counterproductive and therefore cannot be employed extra-
neously without hindering the maps’ stated primary purpose.
Since the purpose of this study is to collect quantitative
data from which to infer cartographic design decisionmak-
ing, it therefore lies within the tradition of Harley’s (1989)
call for researchers to analyze the internal evidence of the
cartographic text to discover the conscious and subconscious
role the cartographer plays ‘in structuring cartographic
representation’ (p. 6). In demonstrating a technique for
using the map’s internal
feature geometry to quantify
cartographic design considerations, this study responds to
the question of how the map text functions, as Wood and
Fels (2008) express a contemporary evolution of Harley’s
rhetoric. For the particular example of the Galbraith texts it
would, of course, be silly to advance the discussion along the
lines of the cartographic text as a tool for power relations, so
there are limits to which this study engages the traditional
map decoding discourse. Nevertheless, this research repre-
sents an effort to actually deconstruct a map’s structural
components in a GIS to provide data with which to infer
cartographic decisionmaking in contrast to stated design
principles. In this it is unique, as previous cartometric studies
have tended to focus on what Harley (1989, p. 8) calls ‘the

assessment of geometric accuracy…the ﬁxing of location’.
Examples of studies accessing accuracy in historical maps
include the following: Giordano and Nolan, 2007; Hooke
and Perry, 1976; Hsu, 1978; Hu, 2001; Laxton, 1976;
Lloyd and Gilmartin, 1987; Locke and Wyckoff, 1993;
Murphy, 1979; Pearson, 2005; Pulsipher, 1987; Ravenhill
and Gilg, 1974; Strang, 1998; Wolter, 1972; and Yerci,
1989. Accuracy assessment is a compelling avenue for
cartometric investigation because it is frequently informative
speciﬁcally to historical cartography and generally to other
historical disciplines. Maps and circumstances which support
a more deconstructive approach are far less common.

The following discussion will

examine Galbraith’s
mimetic symbols
the literature of
in the context of
cartographic symbology. It will also place Galbraith’s maps
within the tradition of historical maps.

MIMETIC SYMBOLS AND CARTOGRAPHIC LEGIBILITY

Maps can provide more information than ‘the cartographer
used in the creation of the map’ (Neumann, 1992, p. 112),
because of the addition of details introduced by the user
while digesting the map. Given an underlying tendency for

information overload in intricate graphics, a study of maps
as visually complex as Galbraith’s naturally introduces the
question of map legibility. Studies have consistently
demonstrated that the speed of use and the quality of
impeded by increasing visual
map comprehension is
complexity and number of symbols (see,
for example,
Beshentsev, 1997; Forrest and Castner, 1985; Garmiz
et al., 1988, 1989; Gerber et al., 1990; Lloyd, 2005;
Phillips and Noyes, 1982; Rowell and Ungar, 2003). The
visual complexity introduced by Galbraith’s basemaps and
mimetic symbols undoubtedly introduces cognitive chal-
lenges for the map reader, although it is impossible to assess
this impact without conducting live trials (Garmiz, 1990)
which would nevertheless test current rather than con-
temporary map reading skills (Aoyama, 1986).

One aspect of Galbraith’s symbology which complicates
comprehension and would impede the utility of the maps as
for modernday users is the multitude of
a study tool
symbols alluding to aspects of nineteenth century popular
culture (see Mason, 2002). Although guided by individual
psychology (Eastman, 1985; Hsu, 1979), map perception is
culturally biased (Guelke, 1979; Wilmot, 1999). For the
modern reader, therefore, much of Galbraith’s symbology
impedes cognition because culturally-encoded meanings are

222

lost to the person from the early twenty-ﬁrst century, and
there is a mismatch between the symbol and the symbolized
which can completely confound cognition (Gregg, 2001).
This is unlikely to have plagued Galbraith’s contemporaries
for whom appropriate cultural training and temporality
would have made this popular culture-based iconography
much more lucid.

On the other hand, the variety of amusing cartouches which
constitutes the map series’ primary attraction would seem to
favour readability and map comprehension. As long as the other
aspects of cartographic design are fairly standard, unconven-
tional symbols can be quite effective (Guelke, 1979), especially
then they are more visually stimulating (Lai and Yeh, 2004;
Nelson, 2000; Shortridge, 1982). Further assisting the reader
at comprehension is the relatively large, colourful nature of
Galbraith’s mimetic symbols, both of which qualities encourage
cartographic legibility (Castner, 1997; Morrison and Forrest,
1995; Shurtleff and Geiselman, 1986).

Theoretically at least, Galbraith’s choice of mimetic
symbols in a series of training maps should encourage

usability since it ‘has been shown experimentally … that
pictographic symbols consistently outperform abstract
symbol displays… in terms of the accuracy with which the
displays’ are interpreted (Morrison and Forrest, 1995, p.
127), although there is evidence that unframed pictural
symbols slow user accessibility to map content (Gerger
et al., 1990). There is no inherent reason to think that
mimetic symbology is inefﬁcient for map applications,
especially since this has been the cartographic standard for
many cultures prior to the advent of Western scientiﬁc
cartography (Aoyama, 1986; Potter, 2003). Although some
researchers have considered iconographic maps as ‘frivo-
lous, outside the realm of serious cartography’ (Cole,
1998), the literature consistently indicates that they are
quite useful especially on maps for tourists (see Brown
et al., 2001; Clarke, 1989; Gerber et al., 1990; Forrest and
Castner, 1985; Morrison and Forrest, 1995) and for the
disabled (see Dodds, 1989; Fry, 1988; Gardiner and
Perkins, 2003). Furthermore, even if the symbols are not
directly meaningful to the individual user, they are still

Deconstructing Galbraith

likely to stimulate place memorization since both relevant
and irrelevant cues are equally important for stimulating
memory recall (Reed et al., 2003).

In short, Galbraith’s choice of high-interest mimetic
symbols to augment his railway mail service training maps
was reasonable and likely to facilitate memorization and
general map functionality as long as their numbers and
distribution does not introduce clutter into the graphic.

HISTORICAL CARTOGRAPHIC PRECEDENTS FOR
GALBRAITH’S USE OF MIMETIC SYMBOLS

The use of ideographic symbols has a very long history
within the Euro-American cartographic tradition, just as it
has in East Asian cultures, as previously discussed. There is
something of a continuum between the stylized iconograpy
and ideography of the medieval mappamundi and the
mimetic symbols used in sixteenth century decorative
mapping (Turner, 2003). Ideographic symbols are very
common in seventeenth and eighteenth century Scottish
mapping, which frequently causes interpretive issues for the
modern reader (Stone, 2005). Similarly, Gulf Stream

mapping by Benjamin Franklin and his contemporaries
frequently employed various kinds of
ideographs and
illustrative cartouches (de Vorsey, 1981). Pictographic
and other complex cartographic embellishments are char-
acteristic of early urban mapping of Chicago (Apostol,
1990), London (Laxton, 1999), and New York (Hudson,
1998).

systems

So nineteenth century mapmakers such as Galbraith
followed a long tradition of ideographic symbology in
cartography. This was enhanced by the propensity of
Victorians to utilize extremely complex mimetic graphics
(O’Hara, 1991), which
to represent natural
tendency was manifest in the popularity of cartouches and
realistic ornamentation in nineteenth century county atlases
and tourist maps (Goodwin, 1989). Overall, Galbraith’s
work was produced in a climate of experimentation with
colour and cartographic production (Pearson, 1980).
Railway mapping was particularly notable — in Great
Britain, at
representational creativity, as
cartographic publishers jockeyed for market share in a
highly competitive environment (Smith, 1998).

least — for

Galbraith’s decision to use his distinctive mimetic symbol-
ogy is therefore consistent with the type of cartographic

224

design employed by contemporary popular map publishers,
just as it is likely to be pedagogically successful as long as it
the symbols are employed judiciously.

POINT PATTERN ANALYSIS

In terms of map feature classes, Galbraith’s mimetic devices
are point symbols. Studies engaging point pattern analyses
come from a variety of disciplines, with ecological research
predominating. For example, Stampﬂi (1991, 1992) and
Robinson (1999) use quadrat analysis of a network of point
observations to determine, respectively, species diversity in
meadowlands and desert oases. Likewise, Chueca (1992)
studies the spatial distribution of rock glaciers in the
Pyrenees, while Sengupta et al. (1990) generalize image
data to a point grid to examine cumulus cloud ﬁeld
morphology. The application of geostatistical analysis to the
spatial distribution of point patterns are not limited to the
physical sciences, however, as Wall et al. (1985) traces
changes in the patterns of Toronto’s postwar housing
market, and Lo (1984) analyzes Shuttle Imaging Radar data

to observe settlement patterns manifest on the North China
Plain. Point pattern analysis techniques have even been
applied to investigate the activity spaces enjoyed by
nocturnal prosimians (Sterling et al., 2000).

There is little uniformity in technique employed by studies
of point pattern, partly because of the variety of experimental
the plethora of
circumstances and partly because of
geostatistical approaches possible. Many studies use some
form of quadrat analysis to investigate patterns of clustering
and dispersion in point data,
including the following:
Chueca, 1992; Lo, 1984; Robinson, 1999; Sengupta et al.,
1990; Stampﬂi, 1991, 1992; Sterling et al., 2000; and Wall
et al., 1985. Quadrat analysis involves laying a uniform grid
over the study area and counting the number of points which
fall in each grid cell and then mathematically comparing the
observed pattern to a theoretical distribution. In its most
common form, this involves the development of inferential
statistics based on the variance mean ratio, although
Robinson (1999) uses a Wilk-Shapiro statistic instead.

Perhaps because there is frequently no clearly best
technique to examine a particular point pattern, many
studies provide parallel analyses with multiple statistical

analysis

approaches. Some studies also subject their grid count
information to nearest neighbour
(such as
Brimicombe and Tsui, 2000; Lo, 1984; and Sengupta
et al., 1990), or to an analysis based on a comparison of
observed grid counts to those expected by a Poisson
random probability distribution (such as Chueca, 1992; Lo,
1984; and Sengupta et al., 1990). The Poisson analysis
random or
examines whether a point distribution is
non-random.

Visually, point patterns become increasingly obtuse as the
number of observations increases, with a commensurate
rising propensity to perceive clustering (Sadahiro, 2000).
They are likewise difﬁcult to assess through geostatistics
because of the frequent presence of multiple, nonredundant
applicable techniques and because the results from any
given trial commonly differ with changes in the scale of
observation (i.e., with changes in grid size). Therefore,
studies frequently ﬁnd it necessary to conduct parallel trials
with grids of different resolutions, a problem that some
researchers have tried to avoid through the development of
iterative approaches to identify a dataset’s
complicated,
ideal grid cell size (such as Brimicombe and Tsui, 2000;
Thomas, 1983; and Tsui and Brimicombe, 1997) so that

only one trial is necessary. Sterling et al. (2000) expanded
on this idea and developed a technique to avoid multiple
scales of observation through algorithms to develop ﬂexibly
shaped observational areas, thus substituting distribution-
speciﬁc polygons for grid cells in the analysis.

THE DISTRIBUTION OF CITIES AND MIMETIC SYMBOLS
IN GALBRAITH’S MAPS

The observed distributions of city and pictographic symbols
on Galbraith’s railway mail service state training maps are
reproduced in Figures 3–10. Table 1 provides city and
symbol counts for each state map, with the average state
having around 1900 cities and around 500 symbols. There
is greater variability in city counts per map than in symbol
counts, as indicated in Table 1 below. This is indicative of a
graphic design focus: since the document page sizes are
rather similar across the map series, there is great similarity
in the number of symbols the graphics could support.

The present study uses both Poisson and quadrat analysis
of point patterns with four grid sizes based on the internal
characteristics of the data. Grid cells were determined using

Since each map has more cities than symbols, this results in
the generation of four grid resolutions for this study. Trials
were conducted for both the distributions of cities and of
symbols for each state map using all four grids. Grids
associated with each state are reproduced in Figures 3–10.
An observed distribution of points can be compared to
that expected based on a Poisson (random) probability
distribution to determine whether the observed spatial
distribution is random or not. To accomplish this, the
uniform grids are sequentially overlayed in a GIS with the
city and symbol point layers and spatial joins are performed
to count the number of points contained by each grid cell.
The Poisson distribution is based on the observed mean
frequency for each trial and is generated using the following
equation taken from McGrew and Monroe (2000)

where X is frequency of occurrence, z is mean frequency, e
is Euler’s number and equals to 2.7183, and X! is X
factorial.

Expected frequencies are calculated by multiplying
the Poisson probability for that cell count — P(X) — by
frequency or the number of grid cells. The
the total
larger the difference between the observed and expected
cell
frequency counts, the greater the probability that
the observed pattern was created through non-random
processes.

The signiﬁcance of the difference between the observed
and expected distribution of point counts per cell
is
determined based on a Chi-squared test where H0 is that
there is no difference between the observed and expected
distributions. Low P values for x2 suggest that the null
hypothesis should be rejected and that the data therefore is
non-random, because it differs markedly from the Poisson

will be discussed in the following section.

Whereas an analysis based on the Poisson distribution

The variance-mean ratio is then used to calculate x2

and Monroe (2000)

where m is the number of cells. The P value for the resulting
x2 measure can be interpreted to indicate whether the
spatial distribution is clustered, dispersed, or random. Large
P values result from the relatively small VMRs produced by
dispersed data and yield small chi-square values with

correspondingly high p-values. By contrast, clustered data
yields large VMRs which leads to large x2 values with
correspondingly small P values. Intermediate Chi-square
observations indicate a random distribution.

Results of the quadrat analysis appear in Table 3 and are

discussed below.

DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS

This study tests the hypothesis that Galbraith’s maps are
carefully crafted pedagogical tools with symbology oriented
exclusively towards stimulating memory of placenames along
the railway mail network. Since the rail post ofﬁces are
necessarily distributed along the rail routes, then their point
symbols on Galbraith’s maps (i.e., the cities) should be likewise
distributed along these corridors and, hence, non-randomly.
The observed spatial distribution of cities on Galbraith’s maps,

therefore, will demonstrate a nonrandom distribution, as will
the symbols if their primary purpose is to facilitate memory of
features along that route. So, for the broader study’s null
hypothesis to hold true and Galbraith’s design decisionmak-
ing prove oriented to the railway mail network, then the
null hypotheses of the Poisson trials will be summarily re-
jected for both the city and mimetic symbols’ observed
distributions.

Most notable in Table 2 is the preponderance of random
spatial distributions among the mimetic symbols compared

to the relative scarcity of random observations among the
city distributions. Table 4 summarizes results of Table 2’s
Poisson analysis according to ‘random,’ ‘non-random,’ and
‘possible non-random’ categories. A ‘possible non-random’
column is included for those state-feature combinations
where one trial
is found to be non-random. Since the
Poisson analysis itself operates from the assumption that
normalcy is deﬁned by similarity to the expected frequency,
then the typical observed condition should be random.
the Poisson analysis is most sensitive to non-

distribution for a particular state-feature combination is
deemed non-random if at least half the trials indicate that
characteristic.

trials

As was anticipated, these results suggest that cities are
distributed non-randomly on Galbraith’s state railway mail
service training maps. In contrast to expectations, the
symbol distributions show a very strong tendency towards
randomness. Thus, the cities and symbols demonstrate
different spatial distributions across the Galbraith map
series. It is difﬁcult therefore to conclude that the symbols
were placed on Galbraith’s maps primarily guided by the
railway mail network. It is accordingly the assertion of this
study that Galbraith placed symbols in response to a sense
of aesthetics or graphic design principles which is revealed
in the Poisson analysis by a determination of randomness,
or the lack of the clustering implied by a non-random
distribution.

As previously introduced, the results of quadrat analysis
indicates whether a spatial distribution is clustered, dis-
persed, or random. Given the strong afﬁnity for randomness
observed for the symbol distributions under Poisson analysis,
it is surprising that only a trivial 5% of trials under quadrat
analysis indicate random distributions. Even with these
random trials, the majority of state-feature combinations
represented either clustered or dispersed distributions. The
plurality (60%) of trials in Table 3 demonstrate spatially
dispersed distributions, while 35% reveal clustered patterns.
Overall the quadrat analysis appears less sensitive to changes
in grid cell size than is the Poisson analysis, since there is a
greater degree of correspondence across the different trials
for each state-feature combination. For example, 31% of
state-feature experiments yielded uniform results across all
four trials, while another 38% showed consistency in seventy-
ﬁve percent of trials. In terms of Table 3’s colour coding,
blue colours (dispersal) dominate among the symbols data,
while green (clustered) dominates among the cities.

Results of this study’s quadrat analysis are summarized
in Table 5 below. State-feature combinations are herein
classiﬁed according to ‘clustered’, ‘dispersed’, and ‘split’
categories, the latter reserved for those four examples of
conditions where half of the observations indicate clustering
and the other half dispersal. In no trials are symbols
clustered, although some state-city combinations are
dispersed. Seventy-ﬁve per cent of state maps are observed
with dispersed symbol distributions (and the remaining
maps have half their trials indicating dispersal). Placement
of mimetic symbols, therefore, are clearly most typically
dispersed across Galbraith’s map series. Moreover, the
quadrat analysis reveals clustering for cities in 62% of the
state maps.

In short, the results of this quadrat analysis suggest that
Galbraith’s mimetic symbols are dispersed throughout his
maps, indicative of a desire to develop a visually balanced
cartographic document. Even in the presence of some slight
ambiguity, results further indicate that Galbraith’s cities are
clustered, as would be expected for features arrayed along
the rail network. Just as was the case with the Poisson
analysis, the quadrat experiments indicate that the ideo-
railway mail
graphic symbols embellishing Galbraith’s
service maps belie a graphic design aesthetic instead of a
pedagogical focus, since the latter would require symbols
with patterns of clustering much like that observed for the
cities.

CONCLUSIONS

Perhaps most importantly, this study has demonstrated that
it is possible to use cartometric techniques to test mapped
feature relationships as a key to deducing a cartographer’s
design principles for a map series which are in contrast to his
stated aims. This work therefore provides an example of a
cartographic circumstance where it would be ‘better for us
to begin from the premise that cartography is seldom what
cartographers say it
is’ (Harley, 1989, p. 1). It also
demonstrates a way to quantify a qualitative phenomenon,
the cartographer’s conceptual framework for layout and
feature placement.

Evidence from both Poisson and quadrat analyses
supports the assertion that, contrary to the map publishing
company’s stated paradigm, Galbraith’s symbol placement
fails to manifest a distribution similar to that observed for
the placement of his cities. It is unlikely, therefore, that the

primary motive for mimetic symbol placement was linked to
toponyms since the spatial distribution of symbols is unlike
that observed for the cities. Given these results, this study
asserts that a desire to create a balanced, aesthetically
pleasing graphic guided Galbraith’s arrangement of symbols

instead of a desire primarily to provide mnemonic devices
associated with sites along the railway mail network.

International Correspondence School
textbooks provided
training maps to support railway mail service training courses
(International Textbook Company, 1906, 1909). Different
from Galbraith’s maps, the International Correspondence
School maps are very minimalistic, with crisp, thin black lines
for states and rail routes which are highly contrast against a
white background (see example reproduced in Figure 11
below). Since contemporary competitive training materials
did not emulate Galbraith’s mimetic symbol innovation, it is
possible that the inclusion of these symbols was seen as an
impediment to map cognition and learning. This would
certainly be possible when the pattern of mnemonic devices
has no fundamental association to the distribution pattern of
the features those signs are supposed to signify.

In terms of Galbraith’s work itself, it would be useful to test
their effectiveness with a sample of users to determine how
effective the maps are as a training tool. In terms of the
broader cartometric techniques, it would be useful to see if
there are other maps or map series to which this type of
analysis could be applied to test its effectiveness in other
mapping circumstances. Another avenue for further study
concerning Galbraith’s maps involves assessing the thorough-
ness of their representation of the US rail network in 1897.

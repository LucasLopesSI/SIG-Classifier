Abstract. Curvature is a fundamental surface property whose application, for
example in geomorphology and hydrology, has long been recognised. Its
measurement from Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) has received less attention
than that of slope, and there is even disagreement about which deﬁnitions of
curvature are most applicable. Here these problems are related to semantic
problems in the deﬁnition of the land surface, and three distinct algorithms for
the three main gravity-related components of curvature are compared for both
artiﬁcial and real surfaces. Quadratic-based algorithms are shown to give more
stable results. Higher-order local surfaces (e.g. partial quartic) can ﬁt more
complex landform features, but are reliable only for very accurate data.

Introduction
Techniques in digital

(GIS), have become popular

landform analysis, which are included in most Geo-
Information Systems
in various geoscientiﬁc
applications throughout the last few decades. However, careful use of digital
surface representations and geomorphometric tools is a prerequisite for any
application because there are various potential sources of errors. ‘Error’ in this case
means a mismatch between the surface representation and the ‘real terrain’.
However, what is called ‘real terrain’ is controlled by the application or scientiﬁc
background (e.g. scale, Schneider 2001, Evans submitted): a ‘semantic model’
representing the earth’s surface is speciﬁc to the application (see ﬁgure 1; Dehn et al.
2001) and therefore provides the benchmark for error measurment.

There are various formats for displaying and storing a terrain model: most
commonly digital elevation rastermaps are used. Here we term these datasets digital
terrain models (DTMs). However a DTM is generated (ﬁgure 1), knowledge about
the form of terrain is highly desirable. Where DTMs are generated manually from
stereographic aerial images, operators apply their knowledge about the terrain.
Whether consciously or subconsciously, this implies a semantic model of the

Figure 1. Process of digital terrain modelling. Providing a continuous digital surface
representation (digital terrain model, DTM) of a real complex terrain is carried out
by (a) choosing a terrain model dependent on the speciﬁc application and scale, (b)
surveying measurements, and (c) interpolation methods. The ﬁnal quality of the
terrain model depends strongly on these steps. The quality of the DTM is improved
by optimizing the modelling steps according to information about the surface to be
interpolated (terrain type, scales, etc.).

surface. Likewise any interpolation process, for example from digitized contours or
points, is based on expectations of detailled surface form, especially smoothness.
Both data survey method and interpolation model are sources of error and should
be optimized using information about the semantic surface model to be represented,
including terrain type and scale (ﬁgure 1).

Deriving primary geomorphometric parameters from DTMs is a fundamental
task not only in geomorphometry, but also in many branches of physical geography
and the environmental sciences (Moore et al. 1991, Schmidt and Dikau 1999).
Derivatives have found application in various process models (Moore et al. 1991,
Schmidt et al. 1998, Hutchinson and Gallant 1999, Schmidt et al. 2000). Curvature
in particular has important implications for surface processes (Carson and Kirkby
1972). Slope calculation (ﬁrst derivative) has been considered in a number of papers
(Florinsky 1998, Evans and Cox 1999): here we focus on curvature (the second
derivative of the altitude or elevation surface). Curvature of a surface at a point
generally varies with orientation and many deﬁnitions are possible. In order to
deﬁne curvatures for a surface point, orientations must be speciﬁed by provision of

criteria or constraints. These can be derived either from characteristics of local
curvature or from external constraints. Shary (1995) thus distinguished curvature
measures that are calculated solely from surface geometry. (i.e. independent on the
coordinate reference system) from those that depend on a reference ﬁeld such as
gravity (i.e. on the elevation reference ﬁeld: table 1; Shary et al. 2002).

Examples of the ﬁrst curvature category are maximum, minimum and average
curvature (Shary 1995). The second category of measures (with gravity ﬁeld
constraints) is related to stress ﬁelds and surface and subsurface water and sediment
ﬂows. It include ‘proﬁle curvature’ cp, which is the rate of change of slope gradient
(in the direction of greatest change), and ‘contour curvature’ cc, the rate of change
of direction of a contour line (a contour line being deﬁned by the elevation
reference ﬁeld) (Carson and Kirkby 1972, chapter 16). Evans (1972) used the terms
‘vertical convexity’ and ‘horizontal convexity’ to emphasize that convexity is taken
as positive and concavity as negative.
‘Curvature’ was avoided because of its
different implementation in mathematics (Shary 1995). Later, Evans (1980, 1998)
switched to ‘proﬁle convexity’ and ‘plan convexity’ with the same meanings as
above. Mitasova and Hoﬁerka (1993) and Moore et al. (1993) used ‘plan curvature’
for contour curvature. Krcho (1991) and Mitasova and Hoﬁerka (1993) suggest
that for ﬂow studies it is more appropriate to introduce ‘tangential curvature’ ct as
curvature perpendicular to slope gradient (see ﬁgure 2).

in plan view. According to the user documentation,

Terms like ‘horizontal curvature’ or ‘plan curvature’ have been used in
confusingly different ways in the literature. For example, Zevenbergen and Thorne
(1987) used the term ‘planform curvature’ for tangential curvature, which is clearly
the equations of
not
Zevenbergen and Thorne (1987) are implemented in Arc/Info as ‘plan curvature’.
This shows that the user needs a sound understanding of the underlying algorithms
to interpret the results of standard curvature algorithms. Here we use the terms
‘contour curvature’ and ‘tangential curvature’ to achieve clarity. Another measure
for curvature is the horizontal curvature of the ﬂowpath viewed from above cf
(Krcho 1991, Friedrich 1996), which expresses the ‘twisting of drainage lines’
(Evans and Cox 1999): this may be useful for hydrological studies. The term
‘curvature tendency’ is used in this paper to describe any curvature of a surface
point in categorial terms: straight, convex, or concave. Curvature tendency can be
calculated by classifying curvature, and has been used to deﬁne landform elements
(Dikau 1989).

In this paper, we discuss the effects of different methods used for the calculation
of surface curvature in the gravity ﬁeld. Polynomial models implementing the three
described, widely used gravity-constrained curvature measures are compared for
both artiﬁcial and real surfaces. The results are discussed in relation to the
geometric constraints and semantic implications for surface modelling.

2. Methodology
2.1. Polynomial models as local surface representations for curvature calculation

Assuming a surface is measured by discrete surface sampling points (xs, ys, zs),
with s~(1, †, n), n~number of sample points, a continuous representation z~f(x,
y) is found as f(x, y)~T(xs, ys, zs), where T is some transformation. Deriving a
transformation T is done by deﬁning an inﬁnitesimal representation

(interpolation function) of the surface and an error measurement (a norm) for

optimization. Both steps have degrees of freedom, requiring knowledge about the
semantic surface model. A common method for curvature calculation is to use a
polynomial function fpol(x, y), and a linear equation system based on the nearest
sampling points as a local interpolation method (Evans 1972, 1980, Zevenbergen
and Thorne 1987, Shary 1995) to derive a piecewise continuous surface from a
regular elevation grid stored in a GIS. Whatever polynomial is used, it is calculated
centred on a data point in the grid. A continuously differentiable surface can be
produced either by adapting programs to calculate polynomials for any point, or by
combining overlapping local polynomials with a weighting function based on
distances to their centres (Bell 1983).

Zevenbergen and Thorne (1987) adopted a partial quartic model with nine
coefﬁcients,
that exactly ﬁts the central cell and eight neighbours within a
rectangular grid. This interpolation method is implemented in Arc/Info. Moore

modelling. The statement of Florinsky (1998), that the algorithms developed by
Zevenbergen and Thorne (1987) and Moore et al. (1993) differ, can not be justiﬁed:
it results from a difference in notation (Florinsky, personal communication; see
table 2). Other authors used full quadratic functions (Evans 1980, Bell 1983), that
are solved using an error measure (usually a least-squares ﬁt, Florinsky 1998). The
full quadratic has six ﬁtted coefﬁcients and thus gives a smoother surface, not quite
passing through the original data points. Evans (1998) maintains that no data are
error-free and thus some smoothing is appropriate: the amount needed varies with
the data generation method. Most data are rounded (e.g. to the nearest metre) and
it is pointless to respect such data by ﬁtting exactly to them. Artefacts are thus to be
expected from exact ﬁts. Moreover, the exact ﬁt does not deliver any measure of
error and signiﬁcance for the function and the curvature measures, therefore, from
a statistical point of view, the partial quartic model is less reliable. Wise (1998) and
Shary et al. (2002) go even further and smooth their data to remove artefacts such
as ‘grid line effects’. Shary et al. (2002) go on to ﬁt local quadratics after Evans
(1980). Heerdegen and Beran (1982) used a full quadratic polynomial, but ﬁtted the
interpolation exactly through the central point. However, they applied an incorrect
equation for contour curvature. Shary (1995) used the same approach, but with the
correct curvature formulae. Therefore, this literature review leads to three different
interpolation methods for curvature calculation (table 2). These different interpola-
tion algorithms were implemented within the GIS Arc/Info using the Arc Macro
Language (AML). The interpolation models were used to calculate the different
curvature measures as shown in table 1. The AML can be obtained from the ﬁrst
author by request.

curvature measures related to the gravity ﬁeld: proﬁle curvature, contour curvature,

of different curvature measures based on analytical derivation. The function was
sampled into grids in Arc/Info using different cell sizes. The curvature models were
then applied to the artiﬁcial DTMs and compared both visually and using
scattergrams. In addition, an error assessment for the curvature models was
performed by adding an artiﬁcial, normally distributed, spatially random error to
the DTM.

‘Heidersiefen’

Three DTMs from different areas around Bonn (Germany) were used to test the
curvature models (ﬁgure 5). The ﬁrst-order catchment
(average
gradient: 4.5¡3.1‡) is located in rolling hill country east of Bonn. Geologically, the
area comprises Tertiary sediments covered by Pleistocene loess. The weak lithology
in combination with intensive land use and erosion history has produced a
landscape highly dissected by a series of small streams, with gentle convex-concave
hillslopes. The second site is the volcanic hill
‘Dollendorf’, also east of Bonn
(average gradient: 8.8¡6.7‡). Landform and lithology are dominated by a basaltic
dome forming the top of the hill, and trachyte tuff, Tertiary sediments (clays, sands)
and the Devonian baselayer (from top to bottom) exposed on the steep southern
hillslopes. The gentle north-eastern part is largely covered with terrace material and
loess (Hardenbicker 1994). The third test site is the ‘Melbtal’ (average slope:
7.8¡4.5‡), a small valley west of Bonn, incised into a horst of Pleistocene and
Tertiary sediments, and a Devonian baselayer. The valley was affected by tectonic
displacements. For all three test areas, a 10 m DTM was available, created from
contour lines. The curvature models were applied to the areas and the results
compared.

3. Results
3.1. Theoretical considerations
3.1.1. Geomorphometric interpretation of interpolation surfaces

In this section, the geometrical forms of the different polynomial interpolation
functions are evaluated with respect to their utility in modelling Earth surfaces. In
the case where a planar surface (straight slope) is used as interpolation function (i.e.
aij|0 where |izj|v2 in equation (1),
there are only ﬁrst-order derivatives
(gradient). Adding a non-zero term a11xy results in a twisting of the surface.
The contour lines are now curved resulting in a non-zero second-order derivative
fxy~a11. The quadratic components result in the equation fpol(x, y)~a00za10xz
a01yza11xyza20x2za02y2. This interpolation surface has a homogeneous curvature
(i.e. second derivatives constant), useful in describing basic landform elements and
slope units (ﬁgure 6; Wood 1996).

Adding third- and fourth-order terms (e.g. ax2y or ax2y2, as used in the
ZEVENBERGEN algorithm) to the equation results in complex curved surfaces as
shown in ﬁgure 7. The surfaces show homogeneity in curvature tendency only for
speciﬁc combinations of parameters. A simple description of
the curvature
properties is not possible. Because of the interpolation algorithm, curvature can
vary over short distances. As shown in ﬁgure 7, complex geomorphic forms can be
realized using different parameter combinations.

3.1.2. Geometric interpretation of the differences in interpolation algorithms

The equations for the partial derivatives for the different algorithms used in this
study (Florinsky 1998) can be interpreted for a regular grid in the following way
(ﬁgure 8). The mixed second-order derivative fxy has the same solution for all
algorithms. The partial fourth-order approach (termed ZEVENBERGEN) leads to
relatively simple solutions for the partial derivatives. The ﬁrst-order derivatives fx
and fy are simply the height differences in the x and y directions respectively,

approaches are most sensitive to errors in elevation data, while the EVANS method
is the most robust technique (lowest sensitivity) to determine derivatives where
there are errors in the elevation database.

3.2. Curvature modelling on a mathematical surface

The mathematical surface described above was used to model proﬁle, tangential
and contour curvature with the algorithms implemented. As can be expected for the
perfectly smooth surface, the algorithms delivered similar results, which are in accor-
dance with the theoretical curvatures (ﬁgure 9). The partial fourth-order algorithm
(ZEVENBERGEN) shows small differences in proﬁle and tangential curvature in
comparison to the quadratic approaches (EVANS and SHARY). These differences
increase for contour curvature (ﬁgure 9). The quadratic approaches (EVANS and
SHARY) deliver more similar results, compared with the ZEVENBERGEN
approach, as can be expected from the similarity of the algorithms.

Figure 9. Scatterplots for curvature derived from different algorithms for the sampled test
surface (ﬁgure 3) against analytical curvature values (ﬁgure 4). The ZEVENBERGEN
approach shows the greatest differences from analytical values. Contour curvature
shows considerable greater scatter than proﬁle and tangential curvatures.

methods and curvature measures in relation to cell size of the DTM. X-axis: DTM
cell size in metres. Y-axis: standard deviation of curvature error (in relation to

The effect of increasing cell size (resolution: reduced sampling) was investigated
by sampling the function at different intervals and comparing the results of the
curvature models with the analytical ﬁgures (ﬁgure 4). The results showed the
expected increasing curvature error with cell size (ﬁgure 10), because of loss of
information. From a certain resolution (approximately 10 m), the errors remain on
a relatively constant level with high ﬂuctuations. The ZEVENBERGEN approach
showed the highest sensitivity to reduced sampling rate.

The error assessment (ﬁgure 11) showed the large effects of DTM errors on
curvature calculations: curvature errors strongly increase with elevation errors. The
ZEVENBERGEN approach showed the greatest increase of curvature error with
DTM error. As shown in the scatterplots (ﬁgure 9), contour curvature showed the
highest sensitivities to DTM errors in comparison to proﬁle and tangential
curvatures.

3.3. Curvature modelling on ‘real world’ DTMs

The algorithms were applied to the selected test areas. A series of scatterplots
was produced to compare the resulting curvature values. Here, only the graphs for
the test area ‘Heidersiefen’ are displayed (ﬁgures 12, 13). However, relationships are
similar for all test areas, as indicated by table 3. The results conﬁrm the ﬁndings
from the previous sections. Generally, the curvature patterns (ﬁgure 12) are similar
and curvature tendency is modelled consistently by all algorithms (most data lie in
the scatterplots). However, relatively high

The scatterplots show higher variability for graphs including the ZEVENBER-
GEN algorithm. This again indicates the sensitivity of higher-order interpolation
methods to small data variations, leading in combination with data inaccuracies in
digital elevation data to even higher variations in local curvature values. The
difference between the algorithms is considerably greater for contour curvature
than for proﬁle and tangential curvatures (ﬁgure 13). For similar reasons, Wise
(1998)
found the ZEVENBERGEN algorithm consistently produced poorer
estimates of aspect than did the quadratic-based ASPECT algorithm in Arc/Info.

4. Discussion and conclusions

We have calculated three curvature measures using three different interpolation
algorithms for a smooth artiﬁcial surface, and for real-world DTMs of different
topography. Curvature tendency and the general spatial pattern of curvature are

modelled consistently by all three algorithms. However, the results show the
algorithms indicate differences in curvature values, which must be considered in
landform-modelling approaches. Generally, the modelling results from the higher-
order approach (ZEVENBERGEN) show higher sensitivity to local variations in
input data and to DTM resolution, leading to greater scatter in spatial patterns of
curvature especially for ﬂatter areas. Scatterplots for proﬁle, tangential and contour
curvatures indicate that the fourth-order model shows greater deviation from the
quadratic models. The results accord with the properties and structures of the
different interpolation models: second-order models do not have to ﬁt exactly
through the elevation points and therefore perform a considerable amount of
smoothing of the DTM. The ﬁndings correspond with the results of Florinsky
(1998), who showed that data errors have larger effects on higher-order algorithms.
Therefore, higher-order models may be applied when the elevation database has
very low errors (standard deviation in the order of centimeters, see ﬁgure 11) and is
expected to represent the semantic terrain model in an adequate way (e.g. sampling

differences in calculation for the different methods. The ﬁgures indicate the greater
sensitivity of contour curvature to the used algorithm and the differences between the
different polynomial models. The differing results for the different areas are related
to steeper slope angles for ‘Dollendorf’ and ‘Melbtal’.

distance and sampling sites). In the more general case of lower conﬁdence in the
base data, the second-order algorithms should be preferred. The two second-order
algorithms (EVANS, SHARY) modelled curvature in a similar pattern. More
generally, because of the high sensitivity of the algorithms to errors, curvature
tendency may be used as a simpler and more robust measure for surface curvature.
However, adequate generalization tools and classiﬁcation techniques are required to
calculate curvature tendency from DTMs: the classiﬁcation of ‘straight’ areas
requires the speciﬁcation of thresholds, which adds an amount of subjectivity to the
parameter (see the different thresholds used in Young 1972, Dikau 1989).

The results also show the high sensitivity of contour curvature in comparison to
proﬁle and tangential curvatures. Contour curvature needs one more (not constant)
parameter to be calculated: the angle between the section plane and the surface
normal, which is directly related to slope (Mitasova and Hoﬁerka 1993). Therefore,
contour curvature relates to tangential curvature as follows (cf. table 1).

The slope parameter adds an additional sensitivity to the calculation of contour
curvature, which was observed in the comparisons of
this study. Therefore,
tangential curvature should be preferred as a curvature measure describing changes
in aspect. Unlike contour curvature, which has a weak but consistent relation to
proﬁle curvature (Evans and Cox 1999, pp 35–38),
tangential curvature is
orthogonal to proﬁle curvature. Therefore, tangential curvature should especially
be preferred when classifying form elements using two curvature components

(Dikau 1989), as the classiﬁed variables should be uncorrelated (Weibel and
deLotto 1988).

It has been shown that the quadratic models EVANS and SHARY (see table 2)
can be used to model geomorphometric elements (ridges, slopes, valleys: ﬁgure 6)
and basic hillslope units. Higher-order polynomials, which produce non-uniform
curvature for the analysis window, can represent special landform features with a
more complex structure (ﬁgure 7). However, we consider the detection of complex
landforms as a higher-scale problem in landform analysis, that cannot be solved in
a local neighborhood approach (Schmidt and Dikau 1999). Given spatial resolution
and surface measurement errors, using higher-order interpolation functions could
therefore lead to incorrect interpretations of surface features. The semantic model
implied by quadratic functions considers a homogeneously curved surface. A local
surface representation derived from these functions is therefore more useful to (a)
consistently decribe local surface curvature, and to (b) model a terrain surface by
basic land elements.

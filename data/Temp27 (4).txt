Abstract

Scientific  inquiry  often  requires  analysis  of  multiple  spa‐

tio‐temporal datasets, ranging in type and size, using com‐

plex  multi‐step  processes  demanding  an  understanding  of 

GIS theory and software. Cumulative spatial impact layers 

(CSIL)  is  a  GIS‐based  tool  that  summarizes  spatio‐tempo‐

ral  datasets  based  on  overlapping  features  and  attributes. 

Leveraging a recursive quadtree method, and applying mul‐

tiple additive frameworks, the CSIL tool allows users to ana‐

lyze raster and vector datasets by calculating data, record, or 

attribute density. Providing an efficient and robust method 

for  summarizing  disparate,  multi‐format,  multi‐source  geo‐

spatial data, CSIL addresses the need for a new integration 

approach and resulting geospatial product. The built‐in flex‐

ibility of the CSIL tool allows users to answer a range of spa‐

tially  driven  questions.  Example  applications  are  provided 

in this article to illustrate the versatility and variety of uses 

for this CSIL tool and method. Use cases include addressing 

regulatory decision‐making needs, economic modeling, and 

resource  management.  Performance  reviews  for  each  use 

case are also presented, demonstrating how CSIL provides 

a  more  efficient  and  robust  approach  to  assess  a  range  of 

multivariate spatial data for a variety of uses.

Questions posed for scientific inquiry increasingly require performing an analysis leveraging multiple, disparate, 

large, and/or multi‐format spatio‐temporal datasets. Presently, the synthesis of these data requires the execution 

of potentially complex, multi‐step processes that demand time and an understanding of GIS theory and software. 

Businesses and research organizations continue to expand the size and type of data being acquired, which is pre‐

dicted to reach 44 zettabytes by 2020 (International Data Corporation, 2014). Simultaneously, challenges related 

to the processing, analysis, and visualization of this data are also increasing (Chen & Zhang, 2014). However, cur‐

rent GIS solutions are generally constrained to specific, often singular data types and formats.

Methods for summarizing multi‐format, multi‐source spatio‐temporal data depend on data type and size. 

Furthermore,  correctly  evaluating  and  visualizing  geospatial  data  is  critical  when  identifying  trends  and  en‐

suring  accurate  and  effective  communication  of  results.  Frequently,  topological  relationships  including  data 

density and overlay methods, along with weighted and additive models, have been used to integrate spatio‐

temporal  data  to  answer  questions  such  as  the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change,  resource  management, 

or risk assessment (e.g., Al‐Buloshi, Al‐Hatrushi, & Charabi, 2014; Chen & Zhang, 2014; Rapaport & Snickars, 

1999;  Shahrabi  &  Pelot,  2007).  Many  of  these  GIS  methods  are  limited  by  the  specific  spatial  data  models 

they  can  utilize.  With  big  data,  one  option  to  increase  efficiency  and  reduce  processing  time  is  the  use  of 

quadtrees,  which  are  linear‐space  structures  that  provide  a  framework  for  sorting  spatial  data  over  a  given 

extent (Goodrich & Tamassia, 2009).

In  this  article  we  describe  the  cumulative  spatial  impact  layers  (CSIL)  tool,  which  utilizes  quadtree  logic  to 

overcome  common  and  increasingly  important  barriers  to  the  efficient  synthesis  of  spatio‐temporal  data.  The 

GIS‐based CSIL approach (Bauer et al., 2015), turned tool, processes and summarizes disparate data based on the 

topological relationships among datasets, records within multiple datasets, or numerical attributes. The product 

of this approach provides end users with a detailed assessment of the density and spatio‐temporal relationships 

among data. The approach is flexible and thus applicable for a wide variety of applications. Ultimately, the CSIL 

tool facilitates the fast and complex processing, analysis, and visualization of geospatial and big data based on 

spatial density or a common quantifiable attribute.

2.1 | Topological relationships and spatial data models

Implicit  relationships  among  spatial  data  models  include  overlap  or  intersect  (Shekhar,  Evans,  Kang,  &  Mohan, 

2011) and are defined as the topological relationship among two or more objects' parts (i.e., boundaries or inte‐

riors) that coincide in two or more locations (Egenhofer, 1989). These techniques make up the core functionality 

within GIS, often applied as a way to integrate multiple layers into one (Pullar, 1991), or isolate the locations of data 

intersections (Al‐Buloshi et al., 2014; Evans & Myers, 1990; Rapaport & Snickars, 1999; Shahrabi & Pelot, 2007).

Although  current  GIS  and  spatial  analysis  tools  allow  users  to  extract  information  and  evaluate  topological 

relationships among datasets, many are limited by the spatial data models they can analyze. Since many current 

GIS  tools  only  handle  one  spatial  data  model  at  a  time,  users  may  be  required  to  convert  between  vector  and 

raster formats to use their data. Computational solutions should be able to process raster and vector data simul‐

taneously; however, analyzing topological relationships over vector and raster data currently requires multi‐step 

processing and knowledge of the available and appropriate analytical methods and tools. Several factors critical 

for deciding which analysis options are most appropriate include: the geographic extent of the datasets, area of 

interest, size of the data files being processed (i.e., raster resolution or number of attributes and records within a 

vector dataset), number of datasets being processed, or data format and type.

2.2 | Big data, data, and spatial analytics

Big data can be characterized with the distinctive four Vs: volume, velocity, variety, and value (Villars, Olofson, & 

Eastwood, 2011) and increasingly is leveraged to enhance efficiency, productivity, and innovation for a range of 

needs. Due to the amount of data, variety of scales and resolutions, and interpretation of results, the traditional 

data  exploration  and  processing  steps  used  for  spatio‐temporal  data  encounter  difficulties.  This  is  particularly 

pertinent when evaluating criteria such as the latent structure of the data or visualizing relationships among vari‐

ables (Camacho, 2014; Zhou, Fu, & Yang, 2016).

Another challenge associated with performing analytics on big datasets is processing time (Kaisler, Armour, 

Espinosa, & Money, 2013). With information and data sources increasing at an exponential rate, computational 

capabilities to improve information processing are hard‐pressed to keep pace (Chen & Zhang, 2014). This poses 

challenges to real‐time analyses and complex, big data analytics that cannot be solved through existing computing 

methods (Zheng, Wang, Liu, & Sun, 2015). For example, when modeling mass evacuations during multiple disaster 

scenarios for first responders, Koch and Payne (2015) recorded time and computational memory as being limiting 

factors, as their task required the fast modeling and processing of datasets.

One computational method ideal for dealing with the sorting and parsing of big datasets is quadtrees (Samet, 

1990). Quadtrees are employed to partition and sort two‐dimensional data efficiently and are commonly used in 

computer graphics to speed up the drawing of complex scenes (Goodrich & Tamassia, 2009). Quadtrees also have 

a long history within large‐scale processing tasks in the computer gaming world, particularly when used as part of 

real‐time occlusion culling (Moller & Haines, 1999) and adaptive level‐of‐detail algorithms (Ulrich, 2000).

For GIS applications, quadtree logic was first utilized to resolve space and size efficiency challenges for large 

spatial dataset processing (Chen & Tobler, 1986). Since then, quadtrees have been utilized for other needs—for 

example, quadtree spatial spectra (Chen & Peuquet, 1985) and compressed quadtrees (Har‐Peled, 2011). For big 

data analytics and GIS, quadtree logic has been employed to address other challenges, including uncertainty rep‐

resentation and quantification (Bauer & Rose, 2015), visualization, exploratory data analysis, and contending with 

data heterogeneity (Katal, Mohammad, & Goudar, 2013). The integration of quadtrees with the core functional‐

ities of commercial GIS software has the potential to enhance users' understanding of latent data structures and 

relationships, while also improving processing times.

The CSIL approach and tool were designed to address best practice for GIS, process and summarize disparate and 

sometimes big data (particularly when representing multivariate relationships), and provide a more panoptic, real‐

world  representation.  The  CSIL  tool  operates  using  robust  logic  and  a  user‐friendly  interface,  enabling  users  to 

efficiently process, analyze, and visualize multivariate data. The following sections describe the framework of the 

approach and how it has since been transformed into a novel GIS tool through the use of several illustrative use cases.

3.1 | Approach

The CSIL approach is a systematic workflow (Bauer et al., 2015). The first step in this workflow requires a user 

to  “Identify  Key  Sectors,”  where  a  user  defines  a  summary  grouping  for  all  input  data  variables—economic, 

social, etc. (Figure 1a). The next step is to “Find & Gather Local Data,” where users collect geospatial data rep‐

resenting their key sectors, in either vector or raster formats. The next step in the approach is “Process Data,” 

which  includes  ensuring  that  all  geospatial  data  is  in  the  same  spatial  reference  system  (SRS),  querying  and 

removing unsuitable data, and—if a temporal extent is needed—querying the data based on date. Once pro‐

cessed, the last step in the CSIL workflow is to “Analyze Data & Create CSIL.” In this step, data are summarized

by spatial overlap and (if applicable) common numerical attributes shared among the processed data. The end 

result is a CSIL output multivariate vector grid, which contains summarized attributes where cells with higher 

values are indicative of areas of more data overlap or greater attribute values. In addition, each grid cell main‐

tains and provides end users with attribute information from all the input data resources.

3.2 | Tool

Manually implementing the approach can be time‐consuming. Thus, the CSIL tool optimizes the CSIL workflow 

and approach into a GIS‐based tool. The CSIL tool applies GIS logic to automate the processing, querying, and 

summarization of data, optimize the handling of big datasets and multivariate, multi‐source data, while maintaining

spatial accuracy and underlying attribute information. The tool workflow is illustrated in Figure 1b. The structure 

of  the  CSIL  tool  offers  flexibility,  and  the  algorithms  implemented  include  a  quadtree  structure  (a  time‐saving 

technique applied to increase the capability for handling big data needs).

The CSIL tool was developed using the open‐source programming language Python (version 2.7) (Van Rossum, 

2001) and is available as a script‐based desktop tool (Figure 2) via the CSIL ArcToolbox for Esri's ArcGIS platform 

(version 10.3+) (Esri, 2018a). The user interface has eight tool parameters: “Type of CSIL Analysis,” “Input Folder 

or File Geodatabase,” “Spatial Reference System,” “Start Date,” “End Date,” “Output CSIL,” “Output Extent,” and 

“Output Grid Cell Size.” The CSIL tool automates the complex multi‐step CSIL approach into user‐friendly dialog 

windows with an additional help tile (Figure 2), striving to ensure that GIS and non‐GIS users with access to ArcGIS 

can download and run the CSIL ArcToolbox and associated tools with ease.

The CSIL tool's first parameter “Type of CSIL Analysis” requires users to select a method to spatially summarize 

data. There are three built‐in options: (a) “Create a Spatial‐based CSIL (summarize data presence)”; (b) “Create a 

Spatial‐based CSIL (summarize data record density)”; and (c) “Create an Attribute‐based CSIL (summarize data by 

numerical attribute)” (Figures 1b and 3).

“Create  a  Spatial‐based  CSIL  (summarize  data  presence)”  quantifies  the  number  of  input  spatial  datasets 

(Figure 3B) that overlap within each grid cell over a spatial extent (Figure 3A). Each dataset is represented in each 

cell by a 1 if present, or a 0 if absent. “Create a Spatial‐based CSIL (summarize data record density)” counts the 

total number of records per input spatial dataset that overlap within each grid cell over a spatial extent (Figure 3B). 

“Create  an  Attribute‐based  CSIL  (summarize  data  by  numerical  attribute)”  sums  up  the  values  from  a  common 

numerical attribute (i.e., x) shared among input spatial datasets that overlap within each grid cell over a spatial 

extent (Figure 3B). Regardless of the type of analysis selected, the output CSIL layer preserves fields representing 

each input dataset and the associated attributes. For example, if “Create a Spatial‐based CSIL (summarize data 

presence)” is selected, the output CSIL layer will contain a field per input dataset with values of 1 or 0.

The CSIL tool was designed to streamline data management processes, recognize input data structure, handle 

common processing steps, and provide defined outputs to promote spatial management. Rather than having the

user input each individual dataset, the tool requires the user to provide an input folder path to an existing “Input 

Folder or Geodatabase,” which contains all input data (Figures 1b and 2). The tool then searches this folder path 

location, and all subsequent folders and geodatabases for spatial data, including shapefiles, feature classes, ras‐

ters, and feature raster datasets, summarized using one of the CSIL analytical methods. Furthermore, information 

on how the datasets were organized is recorded and used in future steps when summarizing input datasets into 

the output CSIL spatial layer.

After finding all spatial data in the “Input Folder or Geodatabase,” if the user has chosen “Create an Attribute‐

based CSIL (summarize data by numerical attribute)” as the “Type of CSIL Analysis,” the tool will search each attribute 

table of each vector dataset and create a list of all existing numerical fields (e.g., short integer, long integer, float, dou‐

ble) (Figure 1b). A pop‐up window will then prompt the user to select one numerical field per dataset that represents 

the related attributes (e.g., USD, density, rank, x; Figure 3); the common numerical attribute will be the value repre‐

sented in the output CSIL analysis. Datasets with no attribute table (e.g., rasters) are assumed to represent the same 

common numerical attribute. That is, all datasets—regardless of the presence of an attribute table—will be included 

in the analyses and represented in the output CSIL. If this analysis is selected, users should have an understanding of 

what the various values among the data attributes and raster datasets represent and what units they are in.

ROMEO Et al.    |  7

To save time and effort, prevent redundancy, and reduce burden on the user, the CSIL tool is capable of pro‐

cessing both spatial and spatio‐temporal data, including dealing with multiple SRSs and temporally querying data. 

When completed manually, these multi‐step efforts typically require knowledge of GIS and diligent organization, 

but the CSIL tool takes over this responsibility and manages the data “behind the scenes.”

The tool's logic requires all input data to have the same SRS. However, input datasets only need to have a 

defined SRS, as the tool can project all data into a common SRS for the user. Users can define a common SRS 

(Figure 2), or select from a list of SRSs based on those used from all input datasets. The tool will project accord‐

ingly; if an input dataset has an undefined SRS, the dataset will be flagged and not included in the analysis. If a 

datum shift (i.e., geographic transformation) is required, the tool will generate a list of viable datum shifts for the 

user to select from.

Users also have the option of defining an input “Start and End Date Range,” which initiates a search through 

the attribute table of each vector dataset for a date field type and any field name or alias containing the word 

“date.” If a date field is found, the dataset will then be queried based on the defined input date range, which can 

include a day, month, and year. If datasets have no attribute table, or no “date” field is found within the attribute 

table, the datasets are assumed atemporal and will be included in subsequent processing steps.

The CSIL tool outputs a multivariate vector grid, rather than a univariate raster layer, providing more infor‐

mation to the user and more options for visualization. The format of the vector‐grid CSIL output can either be 

a shapefile or a feature class. To create the vector grid, the tool applies a quadtree structure to summarize the 

processed datasets. The size and resolution of the vector grid are based on the user‐defined inputs for “Output 

Extent” and “Output Grid Cell Size.” The “Output Extent” and the “Output Grid Cell Size” parameters represent 

the total spatial extent and the individual grid cell sizes, respectively. If the user forgoes the option to provide the 

“Output Extent” or “Output Grid Cell Size,” the default extent and cell size are derived from the input data pro‐

vided. The default extent is based on the largest extent of the input datasets, and the default cell size is calculated 

using Esri's approach (Esri, 2018a). The units are based on the units of the SRS [e.g., Universal Transverse Mercator 

(UTM) projections are in meters].

To increase the efficiency of the CSIL tool, a quadtree structure is used to determine which point, line seg‐

ment, polygon, and raster cells from the input datasets are sorted into the appropriate vector grid cells based on 

spatial intersect. Attribute information associated with these data sources is apportioned, along with the geome‐

try, to the appropriate vector grid cell. With regard to the CSIL tool, the top quadtree layer encompasses the entire 

vector grid, while the bottom‐most layer matches the dimensions and locations of the vector grid cells (Figure 4). 

Although querying or sorting using a quadtree has a worst‐case performance that matches the layer depth of the 

tree times the number of items [O(Dn)] (Goodrich & Tamassia, 2009), a typical runtime for CSIL is closer to log2(n), 
as D is the smallest power of two that can hold all grid cells within the tree; that is, D ≥ log2[max(width, height)] is 
satisfied. Thus, finding which vector grids overlap with a given piece of geometry should occur in near logarithmic 

For each input dataset, if spatial intersection occurs, a field is added to the output vector grid's attribute table 

representing  the  dataset.  Records  within  the  resulting  field  are  calculated  in  one  of  three  ways,  depending  on 

which “Type of CSIL Analysis” is selected. If “Create a Spatial‐based CSIL (summarize data presence)” is selected, 

the resulting records will equal 1 if present, and 0 if absent. If “Create a Spatial‐based CSIL (summarize data record 

density)” is selected, the resulting records will range from 0 to the maximum number of records per input dataset 

that overlaps a cell. If “Create an Attribute‐based CSIL (summarize data by numerical attribute)” is selected, the 

resulting records will equal the previously selected common numeric attribute field summary for each intersecting 

time.

dataset.

Once all the fields are calculated for each intersecting dataset, the data are summarized into additional fields 

by “Key Sector.” For the purposes of the CSIL tool, “Key Sectors” represent the various subfolders, geodatabases, 

and feature datasets that contain spatial data found while the CSIL tool is searching through the “Input Folder 

or  Geodatabase.”  The  term  “Key  Sector”  derives  from  the  assumption  that  datasets  are  sorted  into  categories

F I G U R E   4  Depiction of quadtree structure and how it efficiently processes the geometric intersection of 
each input dataset with the vector grid through a series of depths

based on common themes prior to running the CSIL tool. For each “Key Sector” a field is added to the vector grid 

attribute table, and each record within the field is summarized to represent all datasets found within said location.

Lastly, a “TOTAL” field is created and calculated, which represents all input datasets that spatially intersect 

vector  grid  cells.  Depending  on  the  “Type  of  CSIL  Analysis”  selected,  the  values  within  the  “TOTAL”  and  “Key 

Sector” fields will represent the number of datasets present, the number of records within each dataset that inter‐

sect, or the summarized common numerical attribute values per vector grid cell. The vector grid CSIL is completed 

once all of the input data are summarized and organized into one data layer, containing information on each input 

dataset, summarized by “Key Sector” and an overall total. Based on the needs of the user, this multivariate output 

can be visualized in numerous ways to better share understandable results.

To further help the user understand what is being represented within the output vector grid CSIL and promote 

data management, each CSIL run generates an informational comma separated value (CSV) file. This CSV file con‐

tains a record of tool parameters, variables used in the analyses, and definitions of which output CSIL layer field 

names correspond to which input spatial datasets.

3.3 | Time‐based performance reviews

Time‐based  performance  reviews  were  completed  to  compare  the  difference  in  running  the  CSIL  tool  with  a 

manual procedure, which paralleled the framework of the tool using ArcGIS (version 10.6) (Esri, 2018a). For testing 

ROMEO Et al.    |  9

purposes, the CSIL tool was run outside ArcMap's user interface using Python scripts that called ArcGIS's arcpy 

package  to  mimic  the  processing  routines  normally  encountered  when  running  within  ArcMap  (Esri,  2018b). 

Moving the script outside of ArcMap allows additional components to be attached to the script to easily produce 

the time metrics, as well as simplifying the automated run process. For each application, the CSIL tool was ex‐

ecuted in an automated fashion 30 times, with a total runtime reported for each entire CSIL procedure. To further 

illustrate the temporal difference between the manual and automated processing, three more iterations were run, 

recording the time for key steps throughout the run. The processing of the intersection between each dataset 

compared to the quadtree would be one such key step.

Manual runs were also performed three times per application using a set protocol (Table 1). From a practical 

standpoint, it would be prohibitively complicated to capture directly the duration of a user manually implementing 

the process that CSIL follows, as the time taken by the user navigating ArcMap's interface would vary wildly based 

on the user's familiarity with Esri's tools, but the time taken will not be instantaneous. Instead, runtimes for sev‐

eral operations, some of which are known bottlenecks, were averaged and multiplied by the number of iterations 

involved. This acts as an approximation of the time it would take to complete each tool's portion of the process 

(e.g., ArcGIS tool “Select by Location”; Esri, 2018a). The approximate time measure for each of ArcMap's tools ob‐

tained through this process is a useful exclusive lower boundary for the time consumed by the overall procedure.

The  time‐based  performance  reviews  were  all  completed  on  the  same  machine,  running  on  a  64‐bit  build  of 

Windows 7 (Service Pack 1). The machine's CPU is an Intel Core i7 with four cores running at a clock speed of 3.40 GHz 

with support for hyperthreading. There was a total of 16.0 GB of physical DDR3‐SDRAM installed and available to 

run processes. All programs and data were stored and executed on the boot hard disk, which has a storage capacity of 

464 GB (273 available) and an access spin speed of 7,200 rev/min with communication over a SATA bus.

This section provides examples of how the CSIL tool has been applied and adapted for three spatially driven as‐

sessments. Each of the assessments showcases one “Type of CSIL Analysis,” applied at different spatial scales and 

resolutions. The first use case (Section 4.1) demonstrates the power of the CSIL approach and tool to provide an 

initial exploration into the relationships among multiple raster and vector datasets, ultimately allowing research‐

ers  to  generate  research  questions  and  associated  hypotheses.  The  second  use  case  (Section  4.2)  provides  an 

example of how the CSIL approach can handle multivariate, multi‐source data from hundreds of disparate sources, 

representing millions of features and attributes to generate a synthesized output that communicates the spatial 

distribution of global features. Lastly, the third use case (Section 4.3) is an example of CSIL's ability to convert all 

datasets into a common SRS and evaluate the attributes of features, providing unique insights into the spatial dis‐

tribution of the values associated with each vector and raster dataset. In addition, this application demonstrates 

the flexibility of the CSIL framework to work with external models and tools. While these use cases are presented 

for specific studies and applications, they more broadly illustrate the power of CSIL to address a wide range of spa‐

tio‐temporal analytical needs and visualizations. In addition, for each use case, a time‐based performance review 

was completed, comparing differences in running the CSIL tool with a manual procedure.

A  total  of  10  environmental  and  8  anthropogenic  earthquake  risk  factors  were  identified  and  represented 

by 18 datasets (Figure 5). For this CSIL application, data were sourced from authoritative, but diverse, resources 

including  the  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA),  Oklahoma  Geological  Survey  (OGS),  Oklahoma  Water 

Resources Board (OWRB), IHS Inc., Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and 

U.S. Census Bureau (USCB). The data used in this rapid data exploration effort with the CSIL approach spanned a

range of formats and types, and included more than 2.3 GB of vector data containing 443,264 features and raster 

data made up of over 3.2 million cells in the CSIL analysis (Table 2).

The “Create a Spatial‐based CSIL (summarize data presence)” analytical method was selected in the CSIL tool 

to explore and identify key spatial trends in the cumulative spatial extent of selected datasets (Figure 5), and spot‐

light where there were more overlapping earthquake risk factors versus less, in one integrated output.

These datasets were processed and summarized using the extent of Oklahoma with a grid‐cell resolution of 
100 miles2. Figure 6 displays the resulting attributes from the output CSIL vector grid, including cumulative spatial 

sums of natural (Figure 6a), anthropogenic (Figure 6b), and all datasets combined (Figure 6c) overlaid with earth‐

quake density (Figure 6d).

The  preliminary  CSIL  results  here  provide  an  example  of  how  this  approach  can  facilitate  the  exploration 

and early analysis of complex, big datasets. Visualizing the cumulative spatial sum of natural and anthropogenic

F I G U R E   6  Maps of attribute information within output CSIL for assessing induced seismicity in Oklahoma. 
Displays number of datasets related to natural (a), anthropogenic (b), all factors (c), and all factors overlain with 
earthquake density (d)

earthquake factors promotes discussion and postulation of more refined research questions. For example, do spa‐

tial trends in all combined factors coincide with earthquake density (Figure 6d), and does this merit further inves‐

tigation? Broader implications of the results may include assessing where data gaps exist and what analytics are 

most appropriate to pursue. Overall, this use case illustrates how CSIL can be used to relatively quickly conduct 

preliminary spatial analyses before more complex analyses are pursued (Vasylkivska & Huerta, 2017).

Due  to  the  difficulty  of  determining  which  specific  combinations  of  factors  have  the  greatest  influence  on 

seismicity in a given area, further analytical approaches are needed to quantitatively assess seismic risk. However, 

for these large, multi‐source, multi‐format, multivariate datasets related to earthquake causal factors, the CSIL 

approach demonstrates an efficient and user‐friendly way to conduct preliminary data exploration and help guide 

future, more comprehensive analyses.

Results  from  the  time‐based  performance  review  show  that  the  manual  runs  were  an  average  of  2.96  min 

faster than the automated runs (Table 3). From the input datasets, the average processing time for the three input 

raster datasets ranged from 33.39 to 52.40 min longer to process in the automated runs, while 11 vector datasets 

were processed from 0.25 s up to 82.72 min faster in the automated runs. The processing time for the remaining 

vector datasets ranged from 9.04 s to 3.33 min faster in the manual runs.

4.2 | Summarizing and visualizing disparate data at the global scale: Identifying the 
global footprint of oil and gas infrastructure

Understanding the global spatial distribution of oil and gas infrastructure is critical to accurately estimate anthro‐

pogenic methane emissions. A recent study by Rose et al. (2018) used data mining, geoinformatics, and big data 

computing capabilities to rapidly assemble and aggregate open‐source, global oil and gas infrastructure (GOGI) 

data. The resulting geodatabase (Sabbatino et al., 2017) integrates millions of attributes and features, spanning 

hundreds  of  datasets  into  one  resource.  However,  exploring  and  evaluating  the  spatial  trends  associated  with 

millions of attributes, spanning a global spatial scale, is a complex big data problem. The “Create a Spatial‐based 

CSIL (summarize record density)” feature was utilized in this study to meet both analytical and visualization goals.

As shown in Figure 7, the GOGI database contains data from 700 local, regional, or global datasets, and con‐

tains data on over 6.3 million spatial features. Prior to this use case, the data were sorted into three key sectors 

made up of 15 input datasets (Rose et al., 2018). Datasets by key factor—including data type, size, and number of 

features associated with each dataset—are listed in Table 4. Figure 7 displays a three‐sector categorization of the 

key sector categories: Production and Extraction, Facilities and Infrastructure, and Transport. For the time‐based 

performance reviews, a fourth key sector of Geology was included, which contains a vector polygon layer repre‐

senting oil and gas basins.

The spatial resolution of the CSIL was set to a 111 km2 (or approximately 1°) area for the onshore and offshore 

areas of all countries (Figure 8). The total number of records (i.e., data record density) ranges from 1 to 6,586 per 

grid cell, with Alberta, Canada containing the highest density values. The output CSIL layer effectively communi‐

cates global data gaps and density of oil and gas infrastructure. The results from this preliminary analysis can then 

be used to better constrain global methane emission estimates from oil and gas infrastructure.

Overall, the total average runtime for the automated runs was 89.70% (20.74 hr) faster than the average man‐

ual runtimes (Table 5). In addition, the average overall amount of time taken to record and summarize all datasets 

for overlaps and intersections was 20.64 hr faster in the automated runs than the manual runs. Out of the 16 data‐

sets (15 aforementioned datasets and a vector polygon layer representing oil and gas basins), 14 were processed 

and summarized 31.50 s to 13.32 hr faster in the automated than the manual version. The two datasets that took 

longer to process with the CSIL relative to the manual approach were the 51,602 points representing mines (aver‐

age of 6.40 s longer) and the 736,776 points representing wells (average of 20.98 min longer).

certainly a concern, studies continue to assess the economic impact that this event had on commercial fisheries 

(McCrea‐Strub et al., 2011; Sumaila et al., 2012), the tourism industry (Ritchie, Crotts, Zehrer, & Volsky, 2014), 

the oil and gas industry (Smith, Smith, & Ashcroft, 2011), and socio‐economic health (Shepard, Valentine, D'Elia, 

Yoskowitz, & Dismukes, 2013). Although the results from this event are still being measured, the lessons learned 

have highlighted the importance of understanding the spatial trajectory and extent of oil spills in conjunction with 

the location of sensitive coastal environments. However, while the physical location of these sensitive resources 

is easy to identify, understanding sensitivity also requires an estimation of their value to the surrounding com‐

munities.  One  way  to  do  this  is  facilitated  through  CSIL's  “Create  an  Attribute‐based  CSIL  (summarize  data  by 

numerical attributes),” which was used to quantify the spatial structure of the economically vulnerable areas in 

the Gulf of Mexico.

Another critical component is the ability to assess how much damage could be caused by a potential oil spill. 

As  such,  the  CSIL  tool  was  adapted  to  work  with  the  outputs  of  NETL's  Blowout  and  Spill  Occurrence  Model 

(BLOSOM)  (Nelson,  Grubesic,  Sim,  Graham,  &  Rose,  2015;  Romeo  et  al.,  2015;  Sim  et  al.,  2015).  This  tailored 

version of the CSIL ArcToolbox was designed to digest and analyze vector outputs from BLOSOM representing 

the oil parcel location, date and time, and physical properties (Figure 9). In addition to adding and summarizing 

the attributes from spatial data on sensitive resources, the CSIL tool also summarizes the oil spill simulation data 

with information on the extent, total amount of oil, days oil was present, and amount of oil after transport and 

weathering, per grid cell.

A hypothetical subsurface blowout was simulated using BLOSOM in the Gulf of Mexico's Mississippi Canyon 

at 28.178°N, −89.166°W from August 4, 2013 to September 30, 2013 (Figure 10a). The output from the simulation 

was large: a total of 510,592 individual oil parcel data points in 218 files for a total of 2.9 GB. Of the output parcels, 
479,128 were in the area of interest, covering a spatial extent of 700,000 km2 (Figure 10a). The area of interest 

included U.S. waters and coastal counties of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.

Four spatio‐temporal raster and vector datasets with different SRSs were used to analyze areas of estimated 

economic cost (Figure 10b); information on the datasets can be found in Table 6. Each layer represented economic 

values for a different industry. A raster layer for commercial fishing was based on a distance analysis to represent 

the distribution of commercial landings across U.S. waters in the Gulf of Mexico (Bauer et al., 2015). Hotel point 

data containing monthly economic room‐based profits for 22,992 hotels were included as a proxy for tourism and 

recreation (Bauer et al., 2015). Monthly oil and gas data for 7,020 platforms from the Bureau of Ocean and Energy 

Management, which contained information on operational costs by depth, were included to represent costs to the 

oil and gas industry (Bauer et al., 2015). Lastly, a coastal counties polygon layer, which included gross domestic 

product (GDP) data, was included in the analysis as a measure of socio‐economic health.

The output vector grid CSIL (Figure 11a) shows the distribution of potential economic vulnerability throughout 
the U.S. waters of the Gulf of Mexico at 3 km2 resolution, with U.S. dollar (USD) estimated amounts ranging from 0 

to over 1 billion. In addition, the output CSIL vector grid was appended with summarized BLOSOM data; the total 

number of days oil was present per grid cell, the total amount of oil in barrels (bbl) that passed through each grid 

cell, and the total amount of oil (bbl) on the final day of the simulation. Figure 11b shows the estimated economic 

vulnerability, overlaid with the summarized information on total amount of oil (bbl).

The automated runs were an average of 21.00 hr faster than the manual runs (Table 7). A projection step was 

included in this use case's performance review, as all four input datasets were projected by the tool into a common 

SRS. With the addition of the projection step, the process as a whole took an average of 8.55 s longer in the au‐

tomated runs. However, all four vector and raster datasets were processed and summarized an average of 97.75% 

(15.36 hr) faster in the automated than the manual runs, clearly indicating the efficiency of the CSIL approach 

over manual methods. A subset of the output BLOSOM data was input to the tool when running the time tests. 

Of the BLOSOM output data tested, the automated runs processed, summarized, and added information from the 

BLOSOM results into the multivariate CSIL output 65.02% (5.63 hr) faster than the manual estimation.

The applications demonstrated in this article highlight that CSIL is a relevant solution to scientific questions that 

require the management, evaluation, and visualization of multiple disparate spatial datasets. The CSIL tool's ad‐

ditive topological analyses quantify where and when input datasets intersect and overlap, exploring relationships 

among both raster and vector datasets. Combining traditional time‐saving methods with GIS expertise and data‐

driven approaches, the CSIL tool efficiently summarizes multiple disparate and sometimes large datasets. The use 

cases also help illustrate how this CSIL approach and tool can streamline and facilitate more efficient geospatial 

science‐driven exploration of multivariate, multi‐source datasets, particularly in this era of big data and streaming 

data. Finally, information in the resulting multivariate CSIL vector grid ensures preservation of the input attribute 

information: intersections of each input dataset that satisfies the tool's criteria, datasets summarized by key sec‐

tor, and overall summaries of the total combined information. This integrated vector grid also offers the ability 

to generalize or anonymize the data depending on the size of the vector grid cell selected, affording users better 

ability to utilize potentially sensitive data resources in combination with more open resources to serve a myriad 

of end‐user needs.

First, Section 4.1 demonstrated the effectiveness of using the CSIL tool for exploratory data analysis in quan‐

tifying the spatial presence of 18 datasets representing factors relating to induced seismicity. This use case ap‐

plied  the  “Create  a  Spatial‐based  CSIL  (summarize  data  presence  and  overlap)”  analysis  method  to  explore  the 

spatial intersection of raster and vector datasets to expedite and drive future science‐based discovery and more

advanced analytics (e.g., Vasylkivska & Huerta, 2017). In this example, CSIL was used at the state scale to conduct 

rapid preliminary evaluation of spatial trends of datasets representing environmental and anthropogenic risk fac‐
tors associated with induced seismicity at a resolution of 100 miles2. As shown in Figure 6, the presence/absence 

CSIL provides insight on the overlapping nature of the 15 vector datasets containing 443,264 attributes and the 

over 3.2 million grid cells among the three raster datasets. The output CSIL layer's attributes contain additional 

information on where each input dataset exists, and what other factors they correspond to, offering insights and 

identifying  potential  trends  associated  with  the  density  and  topological  relationships  among  vector  and  raster 

data. Preliminary analyses with CSIL, which uses reproducible methods and produces transparent results, offer 

users an iterative approach to explore the data trends for a range of applications. Given the multivariate nature of 

spatial data and the scales at which they are evaluated, spatial patterns found through CSIL analysis might other‐

wise not have been discovered, or would have required significantly more time and investigation.

Second, Section 4.2 illustrated how researchers can utilize “Create a Spatial‐based CSIL (summarize data re‐

cord density)” to identify the global spatial distribution of publicly available oil and gas infrastructure data. As seen 

in Figure 7, it was nearly impossible to visually comprehend the distribution of the over 6.2 million spatial data 

records. All of the datasets were processed and summarized using the record density CSIL method, which neatly 
counted the number of data records present within each 111 km2 grid cell, spanning the entire world (Figure 8). In 

this use case, the CSIL approach illustrates how to improve communication and analysis of overlapping data from 

multiple format types in a more efficient and time‐effective method. This approach is particularly useful when 

working with large datasets containing a high volume of records, such as a dataset of the world's oil and gas wells. 

This use case also illustrates how CSIL‐driven outputs can be leveraged to identify information gaps and spatial 

data trends for a range of end‐user needs. Finally, this application demonstrates how CSIL can be used to obfus‐

cate proprietary data by decreasing the spatial scale and resolution of data, and creating a derived layer that does 
not contain any restricted attributes or details. In this use case, one of the input datasets is a 25 km2 record density 

CSIL representing over 5.1 million wells from a proprietary wells dataset (IHS, 2015; Rose, Romeo, & Bauer, n.d.; 

Sabbatino et al., 2017).

Third, Section 4.3 used the “Create an Attribute‐based CSIL (summarize data by numerical attribute)” analysis 

method to calculate, summarize, and visualize economic values associated with each grid cell. In this specific use 

case, the economic cost of overlapping attributes was tallied relative to oil spill vulnerability. Alternatively, this 

use case could be used to provide counts (either by number or economic value) for a range of applications. In this 

example, the CSIL method first projected all input datasets into a common SRS, then read through each dataset's 

attributes. User input was integrated to summarize selected unique numeric fields from vector and raster inputs 

for  each  grid  cell.  Economic  values  calculated  for  each  cell  in  the  CSIL  layer  comprised  commercial  economic 

fishing values, platform costs, monthly room‐based hotel profits, and monthly GDP by coastal county. “Create an 

Attribute‐based CSIL (summarize data by numerical attribute)” provided a convenient option for users that have 

both vector and raster datasets containing uniquely named numeric fields to summarize their data into a common 

output. Furthermore, this case study demonstrated the flexibility of the CSIL tool's logic in its ability to incorpo‐

rate external tools, in this case BLOSOM (Figure 9).

Results from the time‐based performance reviews found that using the CSIL tool (automated runs) was faster 

for two out of the three use‐case scenarios (Tables 3, 5, and 7). Use cases 4.2 and 4.3 were an average of 87.99% 

faster through the CSIL tool than the manual estimation runs, saving an average of 20.87 hr. Use case 4.2, which 

analyzed 649.74 MB of vector data representing oil and gas infrastructure containing over 6.2 million attributes, 
was summarized at a global scale into a 25 km2 CSIL. Use case 4.3 projected 37.18 MB of raster and vector eco‐

nomic data and summarized the 30,093 economic attributes for three vector datasets and the 147,574 cells in 
the raster dataset into a 3 km2 CSIL ranging over the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which included coverage of all coastal 

counties. Though the projection step took an average of 8.55 s longer in the automated runs, this difference could 

be attributed to several factors: the protocol for the manual runs (Table 1) does not follow the exact logic of the 

ROMEO Et al.    |  25

tool; the manual run's projection step only consisted of the average time it took to run the ArcGIS “Project” tool on 

all of the datasets, which for this application was an average of 2.04 s (Esri, 2018a); and in addition, the automated 

run for this step consists of checking all the SRSs and compiling lists of potential datum shifts during the projection 

process, and running the projection tool, which took an average of 10.59 s for this application. These critical steps 

ensure that spatial accuracy is maintained and the data is properly managed throughout the tool process. Time 

saved with the CSIL tool for use case 4.3 also included processing BLOSOM outputs, information from which was 

included in the output CSIL layer. The BLOSOM add‐in with the CSIL tool saved an average of 5.63 hr, which was 

65.02% faster than the average manual runtimes. The operations where the automated CSIL tool runs saved the 

most time (93.77% faster) for use cases 4.2 and 4.3 were the processing and summarizing of data overlaps. These 

operations, which sorted and recorded topological intersections between a vector grid polygon and the input vec‐

tor and raster datasets, took the most time to complete in comparison with the data processing. This comprised 

projecting the data into a common SRS and building the vector grid, summarizing the output data, and writing out 

the metadata.

The  CSIL  tool  was  an  average  of  1.66%  (2.96  min)  slower  than  the  manual  estimation  in  use  case  4.1.  This 

slower performance in the automated versus the manual run might be attributed to several factors. First, although 

the protocol for the manual runs (Table 2) was set based on the overall tools framework, it does not follow the 

exact logic of the tool. For example, the manual estimation uses the ArcGIS “Create a Fishnet” tool (Esri, 2018a) 

to create a vector grid to record intersects cell by cell, rather than using a quadtree to sort the spatial intersects. 

In addition, the manual time estimation is based on the ArcMap tool runtimes only, and does not account for the 

amount  of  time  the  user  takes  to  add  the  data  and  input  the  parameters.  Therefore,  as  previously  mentioned, 

the manual estimations should be considered exclusive lower boundaries for the time consumed by this process. 

Lastly, during the third manual run, while processing the over 2.3 GB of data, the computer and ArcMap had to be 

restarted, which notably sped up the processing. This differs from the automated runs, which were run for each 

application without clearing any caches.

The  CSIL  tool  is  built  for  both  inexperienced  and  advanced  users.  As  previously  mentioned,  spatial  data  is 

constantly being created. For many, grasping the breadth and depth of that data is no small task, especially given 

the speed at which data collection can occur. Datasets are commonly housed in large databases and managed by 

teams of employees. These data are also increasingly provided through web services and other real‐time mecha‐

nisms, making the ability to ingest and utilize those data rapidly in a semi‐ or fully automated workflow critical to 

end users for a range of needs. For the less experienced user, rather than having to learn an array of GIS tools and 

techniques, CSIL simplifies the learning curve, as this one tool does the job of many. It also ensures accuracy for 

key actions, such as SRS projections, that can introduce critical errors into merged datasets when conducted via 

manual workflows. As discussed in this article, the CSIL tool finds all the geospatial data in a given folder, projects 

data into the same SRS, and queries data by date. The tool then works simultaneously with raster and vector data, 

and summarizes all of the data into one easy‐to‐understand multivariate vector grid that can be customized to 

enhance communication and understanding. Furthermore, this tool employs the same setup steps and uniform 

requirements for all three analytical methods, ensuring workflows and results are repeatable and easy for the user 

to understand and implement. The use cases and associated results illustrate the ways that CSIL can be used to 

perform a variety of spatial analytics.

Maps are more than atlases, they are vessels that provide information to many audiences. That said, the CSIL 

tool is one way to map complex data by transforming it into valuable geospatial intelligence for scientific deci‐

sion‐making. The CSIL tool compiles massive amounts of information into a consumable format, which can then 

be used by scientists and stakeholders to advise policy and make better‐informed choices. For example, from a 

policy  perspective,  the  CSIL  tool  can  provide  valuable  information  geared  towards  educating  policy  decisions. 

If  a  policy‐maker  or  analyst  needed  to  quickly  understand  what  the  current  state  of  their  spatial  data  was  in 

terms of density, the CSIL tool can be leveraged to perform that analysis. Moreover, the CSIL tool makes it so 

ROMEO Et al.26  |    

that individuals of all knowledge levels can intuitively assess their data. In this way, data‐collection efforts can 

be targeted towards data‐sparse areas, which ultimately supports more robust and informed decision‐making. In 

sum, the CSIL tool provides advanced spatial solutions in a quick and efficient manner to support timely, or even 

automated, decision‐making.

To ensure CSIL continues to serve as a novel and capable method to answer many scientific questions requiring 

the  spatio‐temporal  analyses  of  multivariate  datasets,  additional  development  and  improvements  are  planned. 

This includes work to integrate uncertainty analysis, a weighting schema, and increasing tool availability. The tool 

also offers opportunities for integration into a range of ever‐increasing semi‐automated to automated data syn‐

thesis and visualization workflows and processes.

In  addition,  to  help  quantify  attribute  and  data  uncertainty,  NETL's  Variable  Grid  Method  (VGM)  (Bauer  & 

Rose, 2015) will be integrated with CSIL, such that the CSIL tool will not only output a summarized output vector 

grid, but also a VGM layer to help users better understand uncertainty within the input datasets and the overall 

spatial analysis.

The  CSIL  structure  currently  summarizes  data  based  on  spatial  overlap  and  by  attributes,  which  quantifies 

essential information for the user. A dynamic weighting method will be supported by future versions, which will 

give users the option of applying weights to input datasets to output multiple output scenarios. These weights can 

reflect many features important in the analysis, including user preference and value.

Lastly, there are plans to develop an open‐source and standalone version of the CSIL tool. The logic of this 

version will rely on publicly available Python or C++ modules. These future versions of the CSIL tool have been 

made available via the Department of Energy (DOE)'s Energy Data eXchange (EDX) (https ://edx.netl.doe.gov/) for 

download and use (Romeo, Wingo, Nelson, Bauer, & Rose, 2019).

Originally designed as an approach to measure the potential impacts of offshore oil spills, the CSIL tool is now an 

additive spatio‐temporal analytical solution that streamlines the processing, management, analysis, and visuali‐

zation of disparate spatial data. As shown in the time‐based performance review, CSIL is a time‐saving solution, 

especially when working with multiple disparate datasets. The CSIL tool's logic was built to maintain data accuracy 

while  managing  the  potential  for  user‐introduced  uncertainty.  The  comprehensive  design  allows  users  to  pro‐

cess and evaluate raster and vector data simultaneously, and the multivariate vector grid output enables further 

analyses and a multitude of visualization options. The CSIL tool and related literature are publicly available via the 

DOE's EDX (https ://edx.netl.doe.gov/) for download and use (Romeo et al., 2019).

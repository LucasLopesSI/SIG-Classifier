As part of the International Cartographic Conferences held
every other year, there is a major international exhibition of
maps and cartographic products. In 2017 the conference
was held in Washington, D.C. The space allocated to each
ICA member country and affiliate member is limited so
only a selection of those submitted for our national contri-
bution can be included. The United Kingdom’s contribution
to this year’s exhibition is detailed below.

A. PRINTED MAPS

1. An Historical Map of Winchester
Scale: 1:2500
Dimensions of the map sheet: 890 × 620 mm
Authors: Martin Biddle and Derek Keene, with F.G. Alds-

Date published: October 2016

The Historical Map of Winchester (Figure 1) is the product
of 40 years’ research into the history and archaeology of
Winchester, UK. The purpose is to recreate the townscape
in 1800 before industrialization and transport changed it,
and to show the sites of major medieval buildings, surviving
and lost. It was compiled from surveyors’ and early OS maps,
adding buildings known to be there in 1800 and removing
those added later. Archaeological
information was also
added. The map’s reverse carries an explanatory gazetteer
of the city’s major sites. It will form the principal map of
an historical atlas of the city.

The Maps from the past series serves to bring to the public
attention selected former products of the Ordnance Survey
and to inspire further interest and research. Each map is a fac-
simile reprint with an accompanying essay that explains the
significance of the map. The sixth map in this series is
Sheet 142 of the Seventh Edition One-Inch Ordnance
Survey, published in 1949, which was a pilot version sent
out for consultation and consequently very few original
copies survive (Figure 4). The original sheet was scanned at
600 ppi and digitally restored using Adobe Photoshop
CS5. Sheet layout and design was undertaken using Adobe
Illustrator CS5.

Published by: (This version) Visit Scotland
Date published: May 2016

This map (Figure 5) was created for use in publicity material
and as a large-format map in exhibitions. This version was
created for VisitScotland exhibition material and has been
used in different forms: a hill-shaded version (as displayed);
a contoured/layer-coloured version; and a flat colour version.
The map was created primarily from OS Open Data, pro-
cessed in ArcGIS Desktop and Adobe Illustrator. Back-
ground hill-shading was commissioned as original hand-
airbrushed artwork based on OS Open Data contours, and
then processed and adjusted in Adobe Photoshop. Various
‘overlay’ data have also been created for individual customers.

The Union Flag and the Thames meandering through London
are possibly the most potent symbols of Britishness. These twin

anniversary of Geographers’ A–Z Map Company in 2016

to see how much, or how little, London has changed from
the outbreak of World War II to the present day.

This ‘interactive’ map is designed to help children earn where
the major cities and towns of the UK are located (Figure 14).
The laminated sheet map covers the whole of the UK at a

the place names have been removed and instead replaced
with large, blank text boxes where the county, city, and
town names can be written in. This helps to teach children
where in the country they live and also where they are in
relation to other cities. A ‘you are here’ sticker is included.
The map can be wiped clean; therefore it can be re-used. A
full
list of names which fit correctly on the map is also
included to make things a little easier. Teacher’s notes are
included showing the names in their correct locations.

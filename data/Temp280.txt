ABSTRACT
The Equal Earth map projection is a new equal-area pseudocylind-
rical projection for world maps. It is inspired by the widely used
Robinson projection, but unlike the Robinson projection, retains
the relative size of areas. The projection equations are simple to
implement and fast to evaluate. Continental outlines are shown in
a visually pleasing and balanced way.

Introduction

A wave of news stories that ran in late March 2017 motivated the creation of the Equal
Earth map projection. Boston Public Schools announced the switch to the Gall-Peters
projection for all classroom maps showing the entire world (Boston Public Schools 2017).
The media reporting by major national and international news outlets, such as The
Guardian (Walters 2017), The Huﬃngton Post (Workneh 2017), National Public Radio
(Dwyer 2017) or Newsweek (Williams 2017),
largely focused on these all-too-familiar
themes: the Mercator projection is bad for world maps because it grossly enlarges the
high-latitude regions at the expense of the tropics (true); nowadays, the Mercator
projection is still the standard for making world maps (false1); and only maps using
the equal-area Gall-Peters projection can right this wrong (false) (Sriskandarajah 2003,
Vujakovic 2003, Monmonier 2004).

The reaction among cartographers to this announcement, and to others like it in
years past, was predictable: frustration (Vujakovic 2003, Monmonier 2004, Crowe 2017,
Giaimo 2017, Mahnken 2017). It is noteworthy that most of the news stories did not
publish comments from professional cartographers. Our message – that Gall-Peters is
not the only equal-area projection – was not getting through.

We searched for alternative equal-area map projections for world maps, but could not
ﬁnd any that met all our aesthetic criteria. Hence the idea was born to create a new
projection that would have more ‘eye appeal’ compared to existing equal-area projec-
tions and to give it the catchy name Equal Earth.

The next sections detail the rationale of our aesthetic criteria, present the Equal Earth
projection, and the approach and mathematical details of the development of the Equal
Earth projection. The ﬁnal section compares the Equal Earth projection to similar
projections. An Appendix mathematically proves its equal-area property.

Aesthetic criteria

The ﬁrst step in developing the Equal Earth projection for world maps was deciding on
its basic characteristics. To create a world map with an appearance familiar to as many
people as possible, it must have an equatorial aspect and north-up orientation. We
rejected developing another equal-area cylindrical projection, such as the Gall-Peters.
Transforming the spherical Earth to ﬁt in a rectangle introduces excessive shape distor-
tions. In the case of Gall-Peters, the continents in mid-latitude and tropical areas are
highly elongated on the north–south axis. Conversely, the pole lines that stretch across
the entire width of the map severely elongate polar regions in the east–west direction
(Figure 1).

We also rejected the concept of an equal-area projection that depicts the poles as
points, such as the Mollweide and sinusoidal projections. On these projections, the
meridians that steeply converge towards the poles present a practical problem for
cartographers. Land areas are pinched on the horizontal axis at high latitudes, which
limits the number of map labels that can be placed there (Figure 1). Aesthetic preference
was another factor. Recent research by Šavrič et al. (2015) indicates that map-readers
prefer projections with straight pole lines over those with protruding pole points. The
same study also found a clear preference for pole lines among professionals in carto-
graphy and GIS, while for general map-readers no clear preference for the representa-
tion of poles was found.

Map-readers also prefer projections with meridians that do not excessively bulge
outwards as do the meridians on the sinusoidal or many projections with straight pole
lines, such as the Eckert VI, McBryde and McBryde-Thomas ﬂat-polar series, Putniņš P4ʹ
and P6ʹ, and Wagner IV (same as Putniņš P2ʹ) projections (Šavrič et al. 2015).

Figure 1. The Equal Earth projection (lower left) and other projections with short pole lines strike a
balance between pole-point projections, such as the sinusoidal and Mollweide, and cylindrical
projections, such as the Gall-Peters. (All projections are equal-area.)

We decided that the overall shape of the graticule should resemble the one created
by the Robinson projection, because it is preferred by many map-readers (Šavrič et al.
2015) and widely used by cartographers (Monmonier 2004, p. 128, Kessler, pers. comm.,
October 2014 and April 20182). The Robinson (1974) projection meets all of our criteria:
it is a pseudocylindrical projection with pole lines and meridians that do not excessively
bulge outwards, has regularly spaced meridians, and a height-to-width ratio close to 1:2.
However, it is not an equal-area projection.

Equal Earth

Equal Earth (Figure 2) has an overall shape resembling that of the Robinson projection
(Figure 6). The meridians of Equal Earth are equally spaced and do not excessively curve
outwards; they instead loosely approximate elliptical arcs that mimic the overall appear-
ance of a globe. The height-to-width aspect ratio of 1:2.05458 is very close to the natural
ratio of a sphere, and pole lines are 0.59247 times the length of the equator. Its graticule
results in a subjectively pleasing appearance of continental land masses.
The equations for the Equal Earth projection for a unit sphere are

In Equation (1), x and y are the projected coordinates, λ and ϕ are the longitude and the
latitude, respectively, θ is a parametric latitude, and A1 to A4 are polynomial coeﬃcients
deﬁned as A1 ¼ 1:340264, A2 ¼ (cid:3)0:081106, A3 ¼ 0:000893, and A4 ¼ 0:003796.

For projecting geographic coordinates on an ellipsoid, such as WGS 1984, we suggest
transforming geographic latitudes to authalic latitudes (Snyder 1987, p. 16) before
projecting with the spherical Equal Earth projection.

To convert Cartesian coordinates back to geographic coordinates, the Newton–
Raphson method is used to ﬁnd the parametric latitude θ from the y equation; the

latitude ϕ is computed by inverting the equation for the parametric latitude θ; the
longitude λ is computed by inverting the x equation.

Development of the Equal Earth projection

The development of the Equal Earth projection consisted of two steps. We ﬁrst graphi-
cally designed the projection with a custom-made tool for combining two existing
projections. This visual approach allowed us to ﬁnd a subjectively pleasing appearance
of the graticule and continental land masses. The second step consisted in developing
equations. We identiﬁed a set of conditions that determined the structure of the
resulting equations, and then developed a polynomial model for the vertical distribution
of parallels using parametric latitudes θ, an approach similar to Wagner’s Umbeziﬀern
transformation (Wagner 1949).

Graphical design

The development of the Equal Earth projection started by blending various pairs of
existing equal-area projections with Flex Projector (Jenny et al. 2008, 2010). The projec-
tions resulting from Flex Projector’s Cartesian coordinate blending are not equal-area
(Jenny and Patterson 2013), but the convenient user interface allowed us to identify
potential source projections. We then further explored source projections with a tech-
nique that Strebe (2017, 2018)) introduced recently. This technique consists of a combi-
nation of (1) a forward projection from a sphere to Cartesian space, (2) a scaling of the
resulting map in Cartesian space, (3) an inverse projection back to spherical coordinates
(usually using the inverse of the ﬁrst projection), (4) a second forward projection to
Cartesian space, and (5) a second scaling to compensate for shrinking introduced by the
ﬁrst scaling. The major novelty of this method is that if the two source projections are
equal-area, the resulting combined projection is also equal-area. The relative weight of
the two projections in the ﬁnal projection is adjusted by the value (between 0 and 1) of
the ﬁrst scale factor.

Figure 3 shows the tool that we developed to combine pairs of existing projections
with Strebe’s technique. The graphical user interface allows the user to select the
projections involved (for our purpose the ﬁrst forward projection and the inverse

projection are identical) and the ﬁrst scale factor for Strebe’s technique (the second scale
factor is determined programmatically). The height-to-width ratio can also be adjusted
by an area-preserving aﬃne transformation that scales x coordinates by a user-deﬁned
stretch factor, and divides y coordinates by the same factor. We added the pseudocy-
lindrical projections that we found promising when blending projections with Flex
Projector, and experimented extensively with diﬀerent combinations and values for the
two scale factors, taking the visual criteria into account that we describe in the preced-
ing section.

We decided to use the Putniņš P4ʹ projection (Putniņš 1934) for the ﬁrst forward
projection and the inverse projection, and the Eckert IV (Eckert 1906) projection for the
second forward projection (Figure 4). The value of the scale factor applied to the
Cartesian coordinates resulting from the ﬁrst forward projection is 0.87. Selecting an
appropriate amount of ‘equal-area stretch factor’ for the ﬁnal aﬃne transformation was a
critical consideration (Figure 5). A value of 0.97 results in a compact Earth shape but with
excessively elongated continents (north to south). With a value of 1.07, the continents
look better but the entire Earth is too wide. An acceptable compromise was found
at 1.02.

projections.

While the transformation technique by Strebe is a rigorous mathematical model, the
two forward projections and the inverse projection result in relatively complex mathe-
matical equations. In addition, the Eckert IV projection, which we use as the second

deemed necessary to develop simpler and compact equations for the Equal Earth
projection.

Conditions for equations

When developing equations for the Equal Earth projection, we took the following four
considerations into account.

Condition 1: Equal-area. The equal-area condition for any projection on the sphere

is (after Snyder 1987, p. 28):

@x
@λ

(cid:2)

@y
@ϕ

(cid:3)

@x
@ϕ

(cid:2)

@y
@λ

¼ R2 cos ϕ

In Equation (2) and the following equations, x and y are the projected coordinates, λ and
ϕ are longitude and latitude, respectively, and R is the radius of the sphere.

Condition 2: Straight parallels. The pseudocylindrical graticule has straight parallels
that are unequally spaced. This means that y coordinates solely depend on the latitude
ϕ and are independent of the longitude λ (Snyder 1985, p. 37; Canters 2002, p. 141,
Werenskiold 1945). In Equation (3), fy ϕð Þ is a function depending on the latitude ϕ.

y ¼ R (cid:2) fy ϕð Þ !

¼ 0

@y
@λ

Condition 3: Regularly distributed meridians. Meridians are equally spaced along
parallels, which means that x coordinates are a linear function of longitude λ (Snyder
1985, p. 37; Canters 2002, p. 139). In Equation (4), fx ϕð Þ is a function depending on the
latitude ϕ:

x ¼ R (cid:2) λ (cid:2) fx ϕð Þ

Condition 4: Bilateral symmetry. The graticule is symmetric relative to the horizontal
x-axis and the vertical y-axis.

Development of equations for Equal Earth

From conditions (1), (2), and (3), one arrives at the following three general equations for
0 ϕð Þ is the derivative of fy ϕð Þ (see also
equal-area pseudocylindrical projections, where fy

From conditions (2), (3), and (4), one can approximate the spacing between parallels
with a polynomial using only odd powers of latitude ϕ (Snyder 1985, p. 121; Canters
2002, p. 138–141). The least squares adjustment is used to develop a polynomial
expression of fy ϕð Þ. Šavrič et al. (2011) provide details for a similar derivation using
least squares adjustment. The relative distances of parallels from the equator are
calculated for every degree using the projection equations of Strebe’s technique with
the parameters discussed above. Those values are then used as a basis in the least
squares adjustment. Equation (6) is the resulting polynomial equation for y coordinates,
where A1 to A4 are polynomial coeﬃcients.

(cid:4)

fy ϕð Þ ¼ ϕ (cid:2) A1 þ A2 (cid:2) ϕ2 þ A3 (cid:2) ϕ6 þ A4 (cid:2) ϕ8

(6)

To avoid representing poles as points (for details see Snyder 1985, p. 124), latitudes in
Equation (6) are renumbered to parametric latitudes θ. We use the approach applied by
Wagner for his Umbeziﬀern transformation (Wagner 1931, 1932, 1941, 1949, 1962, 1982,
for his P4ʹ projection (Putniņš 1934, Snyder
Canters 2002) and by Putniņš
1993): sin θ ¼ m (cid:2) sin ϕ, where m is a factor between 0 and 1 (see Šavrič and Jenny
(2014) for a recent detailed description of Wagner’s transformation method).

The spacing between parallels is approximated with a new function dependent on
(cid:3)
the parametric latitude θ: fy ϕð Þ ¼ fy θð Þ ¼ θ (cid:2) A1 þ A2 (cid:2) θ2 þ A3 (cid:2) θ6 þ A4 (cid:2) θ8
. Polynomial
coeﬃcients are recalculated using the same relative distances and the least squares
adjustment approach as above. This changes the equal-area condition in Equation (5) to

The ﬁnal equations for the unit sphere are given in Equation (1).

Evaluation

The Robinson and Equal Earth projections share a similar outer shape (Figure 6). Upon close
inspection, however, the way that they diﬀer becomes apparent. The Equal Earth with a
height-to-width ratio of 1:2.05 is slightly wider than the Robinson at 1:1.97. On the Equal
Earth, the continents in tropical and mid-latitude areas are more elongated (north to south)
and polar areas are more ﬂattened. This is a consequence of Equal Earth being equal-area
in contrast to the Robinson that moderately exaggerates high-latitude areas.

Figure 7. The Equal Earth compared to similar equal-area pseudocylindrical projections.

Equal Earth shares similarities with the Eckert IV and Wagner IV, both of which are
also equal-area pseudocylindrical projections (Figure 7). Equal Earth is an intermediate
form. Unlike the Eckert IV that has a rounded shape, Equal Earth has pointed corners
where the pole lines and lateral meridians meet, as do the Wagner IV and Robinson
projections. On the other hand, Equal Earth has lateral meridians closer to Eckert IV and
Robinson than those on Wagner IV that bulge outwards.

Other equal-area pseudocylindrical projections with even greater lateral bulging
include the Putniņš P4ʹ and Eckert VI (Figure 7). On these projections, the orientation
of land areas close to their steeply inclined lateral meridians is highly skewed, and users
look with disfavour on the aesthetics of highly bulging projections (Šavrič et al. 2015).
The Putniņš P4ʹ and Eckert VI nevertheless oﬀer one potential beneﬁt. Their shorter pole
lines give Antarctica a more compact form that better matches its actual shape.

Table 1 shows distortion indices of the Equal Earth projection, the Gall-Peters projec-
tion, and commonly used pseudocylindrical equal-area projections with pole lines. Scale
and angular distortion indices for the Equal Earth projection compare favourably with
distortion indices of similar pseudocylindrical projections, and they outperform the
indices for the Gall-Peters projection.

Conclusion

Equal Earth is a possible solution for Boston Public Schools and other organizations
wanting world maps that show all countries at their true relative sizes. As professional
cartographers, though, we know that equal-area projections are not the panacea that
these organizations might think. For example, continental shapes suﬀer. And there are
the many compromise projections (such as the Robinson projection) that are not quite
equal-area but still highly suitable for making world maps. Nevertheless, when an equal-
area map must be used, we oﬀer the Equal Earth projection as an alternative to the Gall-
Peters and other cylindrical and pseudocylindrical equal-area projections. Its key features
are its resemblance to the popular Robinson projection and continents with a visually
pleasing appearance similar to those found on a globe.

Notes

1. For example, Monmonier (2004, p. 127) found that none of the 12 atlases at his local
bookstores used the Mercator projection (with the exception of a single time-zone map). As
for web maps, the Mercator projection is almost exclusively used (Battersby et al. 2014), but
these maps are not designed to visualize the entire globe.

2. Fritz C. Kessler, Pennsylvania State University, and Daniel R. Strebe, Mapthematics Inc.,
counted the number of projections in 11 English-language atlases and 1 Russian atlas
published between 2000 and 2011. The Robinson was the most frequent projection.

Appendix 1. Proof of equivalence

This appendix proves that the Equal Earth projection preserves the relative size of areas. To prove
it, we need to show the equivalence of Equation (2) (after Snyder 1987, p. 28). First, we compute
partial derivatives of x and y coordinate functions starting with the partial derivatives of the y
coordinate with respect to latitude ϕ. Because the y coordinate is a function of the parametric
latitude θ and the parametric latitude is a function of latitude ϕ, the chain rule is used to compute
the derivative of this composition:
@ϕ . A partial derivative of the y coordinate with respect
to the parametric latitude θ is derived from Equation (1):

@ϕ ¼ @y
@y

@θ (cid:2) @θ

(cid:3)

@y
@θ

¼ R (cid:2) A1 þ 3 (cid:2) A2 (cid:2) θ2 þ θ6 (cid:2) 7 (cid:2) A3 þ 9 (cid:2) A4 (cid:2) θ2

(cid:3)

(cid:4)

Similarly, the partial derivative of the parametric latitude θ with respect to latitude ϕ in

Equation (1) is

Next, we ﬁnd the partial derivative of the y coordinate function with respect to the longitude λ.
Because the y coordinate function is independent of longitude λ, the derivative equals 0, that is,
@y
@λ ¼ 0, and we do not need to compute the partial derivative of the x coordinate function with
respect to latitude ϕ. Regardless of the @x
@ϕ derivative, the following product of two partial
derivatives will always be 0:

@y
@λ

¼ 0 !

@x
@ϕ

(cid:2)

@y
@λ

¼ 0

Finally, we require the partial derivative of the x coordinate function with respect to longitude

λ. From Equation (1), the derivative is

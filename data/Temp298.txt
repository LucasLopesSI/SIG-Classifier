Forest ﬁres are widely recognized as one of the most critical events in global change.
Successful ﬁre management depends on effective ﬁre prevention, detection, and pre-
suppression, having an adequate ﬁre suppression capability, and consideration of ﬁre
ecology relationships. Geographical information systems (GIS) provide tools to cre-
ate, transform, and combine georeferenced variables. In Portugal, as in many other
countries, it is mandatory that all the municipalities produce forest ﬁre risk maps on
an annual basis, following the rules of the Portuguese Forest Authority, a governmental
association. This article presents the results of a research project aimed at producing for-
est ﬁre risk maps in a GIS open source environment in Portugal. The requirements of an
open source application are better quality, higher reliability, more ﬂexibility, lower cost,
and an end to predatory vendor lock-in. Three different open source desktop GIS soft-
ware projects were evaluated: Quantum GIS (QGIS), generalitat valenciana, Sistema
d’Informacio Geograﬁca, and Kosmo. Taking into account the skills and experience
of the authors, the main advantage of QGIS relies on the easiness and quickness in
developing new plug-ins, using Python language. Therefore, this project was developed
in QGIS platform and the interface was created in Python. This application incorpo-
rates seven procedures under a single toolbar. The production of the forest ﬁre risk map
comprises several steps and the production of several maps: probability, susceptibil-
ity, hazard, vulnerability, economic value, potential loss, and ﬁnally the forest ﬁre risk
map. The forest ﬁre risk map comprises ﬁve classes: very low risk (dark green), low
risk (green), medium risk (yellow), high risk (orange), and very high risk (red). This
application was tested in three different municipal governments of the Norwest zone of
Portugal. This application has the advantages of grouping in a unique toolbar all the
procedures needed to produce forest ﬁre risk maps and is free for the institution/user.
Beyond being an open source application, this application may be faster and easier
when compared with the GIS proprietary solutions that usually comprise several steps
and the use of different software extensions. This work presents several contributions
for the area of the GIS open source applications to forest ﬁre risk management.

Introduction

A forest ﬁre is deﬁned as any wildﬁre or prescribed ﬁre that is burning in forested areas,
grass, or alpine/tundra vegetation (Merrill and Alexander 1987). Forest ﬁres are widely

recognized as one of the most critical events in global change, particularly for their effects
in land-cover alterations and atmospheric chemistry. Fire and climate/weather are inti-
mately linked (Johnson 1992, Swetnam 1993), which means that the ﬁre regime will
respond rapidly to changes in climate. The season of the year at which ﬁre occurs is one
of the determinants of the successional trajectories on which ecosystems embark after ﬁre.
Furthermore, it may affect ﬁre intensity through differences in surface and crown fuel
moisture contents. Fire type refers to crown, surface, and ground ﬁres, which are largely
controlled by ﬁre intensity and fuel characteristics (structure, load, and moisture). Fire
severity is a description of the depth of burn into the surface soil organic layers and
therefore another important controlling factor of post-ﬁre ecosystem structure and func-
tion through direct impacts on underground plant root and reproductive tissues, soil seed
bank, and forest ﬂoor microbial populations (Flannigan et al. 2003). There are numerous
other factors such as ignition agents, topography, vegetation, landscape fragmentation, and
ﬁre management activities that could inﬂuence the ﬁre activity in a region. The agent of
ignition can be lightning or ignition can be caused by a wide variety of human activities.
Topography, slope, and orientation can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence ﬁre behavior (Van Wagner
1977). Vegetation can also play an important role as aspects of fuel amount, continuity,
moisture, arrangement, and structure are key determinants in ﬁre occurrence and spread.

Portugal, like many other countries, suffers from forest ﬁres. The high frequency at
which forest ﬁres occur in recent years reinforces the need for a better understanding of
forest ﬁre risks, given the importance of sustaining forest resources. The management of
these disasters is of importance to both government authorities and the public. The ﬁre
management activity involves the strategic integration of several factors such as knowl-
edge of ﬁre regimes; probable ﬁre effects; value-at-risk; level of forest protection required;
cost of ﬁre-related activities and prescribed ﬁre technology into multiple-use planning;
decision-making; and day-to-day activities to accomplish stated resource management
objectives. Successful ﬁre management depends on effective ﬁre prevention, detection,
and presuppression, having an adequate ﬁre suppression capability, and consideration of
ﬁre ecology relationships (Merrill and Alexander 1987). Geographical information sys-
tems (GIS) provide tools to create, transform, and combine georeferenced variables. Every
analysis of geographical data with GIS preserves the spatial dimension of variables being
processed, because all transformations are performed cartographically. Therefore, GIS ori-
ented toward ﬁre risk mapping may portray the geographical location of those areas where
risk factors are most severe. Fire protection programs may then be spatially and temporally
oriented to the areas labeled as having high risk (Deng et al. 2007). Since ﬁre risk is a
spatial and temporal process, it should be addressed both spatially and temporally. Several
GIS applications have been developed in the last decade to improve management of ﬁre
risk (Chuvieco et al. 2010). A GIS can spatially integrate several hazard variables, such as
vegetation, topography, climatology, and ﬁre history, which can cover the whole study area.
The use of GIS is quite obvious in this regard, since these tools are ideal to manage spa-
tial information, providing adequate spatial processing and visualization of results. For this
reason, several previous studies on ﬁre risk estimation have been based on GIS (Yool et al.
1985, Chuvieco and Congalton 1989, Chou 1992, Abhineet et al. 1996, Chuvieco and Salas
1996, Castro and Chuvieco 1998, Vasconcelos et al. 2001, Nourbakhsh et al. 2006). Most
of these models are locally oriented and cover areas at different resolutions. The grid size is
typically less than 100 m. However, 1 km and 10 km grids were also employed (Chuvieco
et al. 2010, Bisquert et al. 2011). Most of these models were developed in a proprietary

GIS software. Within this environmental context, the interest of having better tools for ﬁre
prevention and assessment should be emphasized. A GIS application based on open source
software may be faster and easier than GIS proprietary solutions, as will be described in this
article.

The development of free and open source software has experienced a boost over the
past few years. In the GIS domain, the widespread use of free and open source software
(FOSS) is apparent as well. This rise in popularity of free GIS tools can be measured
using four indicators: the large number of projects started in the last years; the increasing
ﬁnancial support by governmental organizations for the foundation of FOSS GIS projects;
the high download rates of free desktop GIS software; and ﬁnally, the increasing number
of use cases of open source GIS software for the geospatial database PostGIS (Steiniger
and Bocher 2009).

A couple of terms, such as ‘proprietary,’ ‘free,’ and ‘general public license (GPL),’
are often used with respect to open source software. In 2007 Stallman notes: ‘When we
call software “free,” we mean that it respects the users’ essential freedoms: the freedom
to run it, to study and change it, and to redistribute copies with or without changes. This
is a matter of freedom, not price, so think of “free speech,” not of “free beer” ’ (Stallman
2007). For this reason, the opposite domain to ‘free software’ is not ‘commercial soft-
ware,’ where ‘commercial’ indicates that the software is sold or used to make a living
or beneﬁt. The opposite of ‘free software’ is ‘proprietary software,’ where ‘proprietary’
indicates ownership (Steiniger and Bocher 2009).

Often the terms ‘open source’ and ‘free’ software are used synonymously. However,
the term ‘open source’ describes that on the one hand source code is accessible, and on the
other hand the source code can be studied. Even so, it does not encompass the freedom of
modiﬁcation and redistribution; therefore, the term ‘free’ is more appropriate to describe
software that fulﬁlls the above-mentioned four conditions (Steiniger and Bocher 2009).
Software can be certiﬁed by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) as being ‘open source’ (OSI
2011).

The open source GIS community has also been represented since 2006 by the Open
Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). Driven by the need for a public point of contact
within and from outside the FOS GIS community, this organization was founded out of
several FOS GIS user communities and projects in Chicago (USA) in February 2006. More
information on free and open source GIS software projects may be found in Steiniger and
Bocher (2009).

In Portugal, as in many other countries, it is mandatory that all the municipalities pro-
duce forest ﬁre risk maps on an annual basis following the rules of the Portuguese Forest
Authority (AFN – Autoridade Florestal Nacional), a governmental association. These rules
are published in technical guide for forest ﬁres management for municipalities (DFCI
2008). The forest ﬁre risk assessment model that is proposed in this article is based on the
rules published in this technical guide (DFCI 2008) published for the Portuguese Forest
Authority (Figure 1). Other features were created, such as triangulated irregular network
(TIN) and aspect analysis, not speciﬁed in the technical guide, but that could be an asset to
future applications of this tool.

The main objective of this work was creating an open source GIS application to pro-
duce forest ﬁre risk maps for Portuguese municipalities. The risk factors and the criteria to
integrate risk factors were already ﬁxed in the technical guide published for the Portuguese
Forest Authority (DFCI 2008).

2. Methodology
2.1. Open source desktop GIS software selection

A desktop GIS is a mapping software that is installed on and runs on a personal computer
and allows users to display, query, update, and analyze data about geographic locations
and the information linked to those locations (ESRI 2008). Steiniger and Bocher (2009)
provide an overview of major free desktop GIS projects and several possible evaluation
criteria. The evaluation criteria include application focus; user level; supported operating
systems; development platform; and software license. Several desktop GIS projects were
analyzed and compared, such as GRASS, Quantum GIS (QGIS), UDig, gvSIG, Kosmo,
and JUMP/OpenJUMP, among others. Based on the characteristics of the analyzed soft-
ware projects and taking into account the objectives of the project to be carried out, three
different open source desktop GIS software projects were evaluated under the scope of
this study: QGIS (QGIS 2011), generalitat valenciana, Sistema d’Informacio Geograﬁca
(gvSIG) (gvSIG 2011), and Kosmo (Kosmo 2011).

(cid:129) QGIS. The QGIS project started in 2002 with Gary Sherman, and it is an ofﬁcial
project of OSGeo. The original aim was to provide an easy to use and fast geographic
data viewer for Linux-based systems (Hugentobler 2008). The QGIS project evolved
the idea emerged to use QGIS as a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for GRASS
itself (Steiniger and Bocher 2009). QGIS is licensed under the GNU GPL and it runs
on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows. The QGIS is developed in C++ program-
ming language and is complemented with extensions – plug-ins (in Python). These
plug-ins represent advantages regarding speed and effectiveness on developing new
features. In the QGIS version 1.6 ‘Copiápo,’ the symbology has some improvements
relating to the old versions, such as better support for creating and selecting gradi-
ents and the new graduated classiﬁcation, which consists in grouping classes of a
speciﬁc attribute using a single symbol, where the classiﬁcation is deﬁned by the
color intensity.

(cid:129) gvSIG. The gvSIG software was started in 2004 and it was developed by the
Conselleria d´Infraestructures I Transports of Valencia Community to replace
software of similar functionality as ESRI’s (Redlands, California) ArcView in

municipal authorities, since the regional government aims to switch all systems to
a Linux-based computer infrastructure (gvSIG 2011). As QGIS, gvSIG is licensed
under the GNU GPL and it is a project of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).
The programming language for the development of gvSIG is JAVA. gvSIG also
has extensions, such as Sextante (GRASS), which are also developed in JAVA. The
gvSIG is integrated with a geographic database PostGresSQL/PostGIS, MySQL,
and Oracle Spatial, and it is divided into three platforms: Desktop, Portable,
and Mobile. This software supports OGC standards such as WMS, WCS, WFS,
and KML.

(cid:129) Kosmo. The last evaluated software was Kosmo. The software project was started
in 2005 by the Spanish company SAIG and focuses on Spanish users that need
functionality similar to that provided by ESRI’s ArcView (3.x). The original JUMP
software has undergone a partial redesign to form what is now called Kosmo. Kosmo
provides additional functionality that incorporates raster analysis functions and geo-
processing tools. Kosmo was the ﬁrst free GIS cooperative platform, and it is also
distributed under the GNU GPL. This software presents four versions: Kosmo Server
(vectorial and raster cartography server), Kosmo Desktop (GIS software with asso-
ciated geographic analysis tools), Kosmo Web Client (cartographic browser that
connects with services based on OGC standards), and Kosmo Mobile (a GIS soft-
ware for mobile devices). Kosmo is interfaced with a geographic database, for
instance, PostGresSQL/PostGIS; MySQL; and server software, such as GeoServer
and Deegree, to publish data from any major spatial data source (such as PostGIS
and MySQL) using open standards. In terms of publishing on the Internet, Kosmo
is probably the better option. The programming language for the development of
Kosmo is JAVA.

Table 1 presents the main characteristics of the three selected open source desktop
GIS projects with respect to desktop GIS functionality. In terms of requirements/needs,
the three compared software projects have the required functionalities. Despite several
advantages and weaknesses not mentioned, QGIS presents several strengths:

(cid:129) Allows overlapping vector and raster data in different formats and projections

without the need to convert to an internal format.

(cid:129) Allows for creating, editing, and exporting spatial data.
(cid:129) Has a friendly interface.
(cid:129) Performs spatial analysis using the fTools plug-in for shapeﬁles or the GRASS

plug-ins for other formats and allows for publishing maps on the Internet.

For this speciﬁc application and taking into account the skills and experience of the
authors, the main advantage of QGIS relies on the easiness and quickness in develop-
ing new plug-ins, using Python language (Python 2011). Additionally, QGIS has its own
application programming interface (API) (QGIS API) with functionalities and programs
to develop new features, and a new developer can easily ﬁnd tutorials and online ofﬁcial
documentation to develop new plug-ins in QGIS.

For these reasons, the software chosen to develop this application was QGIS.

2.2. Programming language

Python is a powerful high-level programming language. It is also an interpreted language,
since it uses an interpreter to read and interpret directly the source code. Python is object
oriented, easy to use and understand, quick, and efﬁcient in several applications. This pro-
gramming language is, frequently, compared with other languages such as Tcl, Perl, Ruby,
Scheme, or JAVA. Python can be integrated with objects COM, .NET, and CORBA. One
of its advantages relies on the development of extensions and modules in C++ or C lan-
guage which, afterward, can be integrated in Python. Python is cross-platform and it can
be used in systems such as Windows, Linux/Unix, OS/2, and Mac, among others. It is
a friendly and easy language to learn due to the documentation and tutorials provided by
the online community (Python 2011). The Python implementation is under an open source
license administrated by the Python Software Foundation (Python 2011). Python language
combines a clear and concise syntax with resources of standard libraries and modules or
frameworks already developed. One of the main objectives of Python was to increase the
user productivity. With this language it is not necessary predeclaring the variables, since
the block control is made by indentation and offers high-level types such as strings, lists,
and tuples, among others. The possibility of developing extensions or plug-ins with this
language was crucial in this project.

2.2.1. Plug-in development

Based on the architectural structure to develop plug-ins in QGIS (QGIS 2011), the ﬁles
and structure were organized, as shown in Table 2.

The developed plug-ins comprise 19 classes: one class for the general toolbar where
all the buttons are named; nine classes (Ui_name.py) that are integrated with Gui mod-
ule; and other group of nine classes (Name.py) that are integrated with Core module. The
Toolbar class allows for creating the application buttons through the Core module classes
and GUI module classes. These classes allow building the feature graphic interfaces. The
code development contains all the scripts, commands, and connections that the plug-ins
needed. The described classes and components connections are shown in Figures 2 and 3.
Afterward, all the plug-ins were tested in order to verify if they work correctly. These tests
can be performed during the plug-in development. Finally, the plug-ins can be published in
QGIS repository.

2.2.2. Application programming interface (API)
An API is a set of routines and standards that can be used and reused in several projects. It is
a set of functions that allows for building applications. In general, an API is an interface

that is behind everything. A human that uses an application does not notice the presence
of an API. An API deﬁnes the most adequate way to use the services of a certain pro-
gram. There are several APIs for Windows systems, ﬁle systems, database systems, and
networking systems.

Trolltech’s Qt (http://doc.qt.nokia.com/) represents a standard framework used for
high-performance applications. This framework contains an API, which is used for appli-
cation development due to its complex graphic structure (GUI), and it is absolutely object
oriented. Qt API was started in 1996 and, since then, it is used in several applications
such as Google Earth, Adobe Photoshop Elements, and Skype. It is supported by several
platforms, Microsoft Windows, Unix/X11, Mac OS X, and Linux, and it is distributed in
two editions, namely Qt Commercial Editions used by proprietary software and Qt Open
Source Edition used under the license GNU GPL for free software. For plug-ins creation,
this library presents two APIs: a high-level API for extensions to Qt itself and a low-level

API for extensions of Qt applications. Qt API has some modules such as QtCore, QtGui,
QtNetwork, QtOpenGL, and QtMultimedia, among others. In this project QtCore and
QtGui were used. QAction, QDialog, QFileInfo, QFile, and QProcess are some examples
of API classes used in this project.

The QGIS API is composed of four modules: QGIS core library, QGIS GUI library,
QGIS analysis library, and Map Composer. In this project, classes of the two ﬁrst mod-
ules were used. The ﬁrst one is constituted by all GIS basic features. Some examples
are QgsCoordinateTransform, QgsMapLayer, QgsVector, and QgsRasterLayer. The sec-
ond module links the ﬁrst module with the graphical interface and then links the result
with the desktop.

PyQt4 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download) is a library or
a set of tools that allows the development of GUI and Core applications. With these applica-
tions, the user can interact with digital devices through graphic elements such as icons and
menus. This interaction can be done using a mouse or a keyboard to allow the manipulation
of the symbols, also called widgets. These tools are available in libraries. QtGui module,
one of the modules of PyQt4, was used in this project and has the necessary graphic com-
ponents and their classes that include buttons, windows, state bars, toolbars, and colors,
among others. PyQt4 contains, besides QtGui, other modules composed of classes written
in Python, such as QtCore, QtNetwork, QtXml, QtSvg, QtOpengl, and QtSql and rep-
resents a fusion between Python programming language and Qt Library. PyQt4 runs in
Windows, UNIX, and Mac. This package has two licenses according to the user option,
GNU GPL, and commercial license. Besides QtGui, this project also used QtCore, which
allows the user to manipulate time, ﬁles, and directory variables. This module controls the
action simulations of the application. The other modules are described here: QtNetwork
contains classes used in network programming; QtXml contains classes that manipulate
XML ﬁles; QtSvg provides classes with the SVG ﬁles; QtOpengl is used for graphical inter-
pretation in two and three dimensions using the OpenGL and QtSql, which provides classes
that connect to databases. The ﬁrst API described, Qt API and PyQt4 API are independent
of the GIS chosen tools, QGIS, whereas the QGIS API is part of the QGIS software. Other
libraries were used, such as Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) which contains a
GDAL/OpenGIS Simple Features Reference Implementation (OGR) API: the GdalTools is
a set of programs that allows for manipulating raster formats. In this application, two com-
mands of the GdalTools were used: GRID feature and Rasterize feature development. The
OGR Simple Feature Library was used to manipulate vector ﬁles. The numpy library was
used to perform mathematical operations with raster ﬁles; the sys module provides a num-
ber of functions and variables that were used to manipulate different parts of the Python
runtime environment; the os module provides a uniﬁed interface to a number of operating
functions; the re module provides a set of regular expressions and facilities; and the scipy
library was also used in the mathematical operations. The scipy is integrated with numpy
to improve the manipulation of mathematical operations. Some APIs, as QGIS API, do not
have the functions and commands needed for this speciﬁc application. Therefore, the inte-
gration of different APIs allows to improve the application performance and the results.
Figure 4 shows the application architecture and the relationship between the classes and
modules.

icons are also in this ﬁle and are compiled in the resources ﬁle. This application, devel-
oped through QGIS plug-ins, incorporates seven procedures under a single toolbar: TIN
Creation, GRID, Terrain Analysis, Probability Map, Hazard Map, Risk Map, and Rasterize
(Figure 5). Each button was developed based on other commands or plug-ins. Each one
has a window with several options, such as menus, labels, edition windows, combo boxes,
and simple buttons, such as Ok, Close, and Help, among others, that help the user to access
input and output directories. Figure 6 – left presents the graphical interface of Risk Map
feature.

Figure 6. Graphical interface of Risk Map feature (left) and Risk Map help button (right).

The Help button opens a window where the users get information on the features of the
program, and their input, output, ﬁelds, and functions. This button should be used when
the user wants more information on any feature. Figure 6 – right presents the Risk Map
Help button.

All the input and output ﬁles were referred in each feature description. A workﬂow is
shown in Figure 7. According to the feature type, the input or output information is saved in
a vector ﬁle (shapeﬁle format) or in a raster ﬁle (tif format). Figure 7 presents a workﬂow of
the sequential steps showing how the user interacts with the tool, with the input and output

ﬁles, and the relationship between the procedures developed, according to the technical
guide for forest ﬁres management for municipalities (DFCI 2008). The hazard variables
required in this application are Digital Elevation Model (DEM) slope map, aspect map,
burned areas map, CORINE Land Cover (CLC), and road network map. There are other
variables that can be incorporated into Risk Map creation in the future.

3.1.1. TIN Creation
The ﬁrst feature, TIN Creation, allows for a TIN generation based on Delaunay triangu-
lation (Barber et al. 1996). This instruction allows for generating a TIN from a set of
irregularly distributed points (shapeﬁle). This feature is composed of two ﬁelds (Figure 8
– left). The term ‘ﬁelds’ refers to the place, in a GUI, where data can be entered. The ﬁrst
ﬁeld is the input directory. The user can access the input ﬁle from two different ways: from
a directory deﬁned by the user or by selecting the existing layer in the desktop. It is manda-
tory that the ﬁles are in vector format. The second ﬁeld is deﬁned by the output directory.
The result is another vector ﬁle.

The TIN feature described is not used in this application (DFCI 2008). However, it
was already developed and incorporated in this application and can be used in the future
by other users/institutions or in a next version of the technical guide for forest ﬁres
management for the Portuguese municipalities.

3.1.2. GRID
The GRID feature allows for a grid generation considering as input a vector ﬁle and it
is composed of ﬁve ﬁelds. In this case, the input ﬁle is the elevation information (vector
ﬁle) and deﬁnes the ﬁrst ﬁeld. This conversion involves the pixel size deﬁnition in the
second and third ﬁelds. The pixel size must be the same in all raster ﬁles in this project.
This is an important issue because it will be necessary to perform several mathematical
operations between raster ﬁles. In this work the pixel size deﬁned was 25 m, according to
the Portuguese Forestry Authority rules. The next ﬁeld is deﬁned by the elevation attribute
of the vector ﬁle and is automatically ﬁlled when the ﬁrst ﬁeld is deﬁned. The last ﬁeld
is the output ﬁle (raster ﬁle). In the code developed for this feature (GRID.py), the extent
of input ﬁeld, x minimum, x maximum, y minimum, and y maximum were necessary to
deﬁne the cell size. These values can be acquired with a GDAL/OGR library command
(http://www.gdal.org/ogr/). OGR is used for vector ﬁles and GDAL for raster ﬁles. The
input ﬁle is a vector, so it was used as the command for OGR library. Besides this option,

Figure 8. TIN (left) and Hazard Map (right) interfaces developed.

Downloaded by [University of Saskatchewan Library] at 15:28 17 November 2012 International Journal of Geographical Information Science

13

there is an OGR API that allows the manipulation of the vector ﬁles also with the GetExtent
command. In this case, the result is a tuple and it was used in the resolution calculation of
input ﬁle, (cid:2)X and (cid:2)Y . Pixel size (m) was related to the ﬁle extent in number of rows and
number of columns as follows:

Rows = (cid:2)Y /25; Columns = (cid:2)X /25

(1)

3.1.3. Terrain Analysis
Terrain information is necessary to create Hazard and Risk Maps. The Terrain Analysis
icon allows for generating the Slope and Aspect Maps. Slope is the rate of maximum
change in z-value from each cell. The use of a z-factor is essential for correct slope cal-
culations when the surface z units are expressed in units different from the ground (x, y)
units. For percentage rise, the range is from 0 to near inﬁnity. A ﬂat surface is 0%, a 45◦
surface is 100%, and as the surface becomes more vertical, the percentage rise becomes
considerably larger. Aspect is the direction of the maximum rate of change in the z-value
from each cell in a raster surface. Aspect is expressed in positive degrees from 0◦ to 360◦,
measured clockwise from north. Cells in the input raster of zero slope – for example, ﬂat –
are assigned an aspect of −1. This feature is composed of three ﬁelds. The input ﬁle,
deﬁned in ﬁrst ﬁeld, is the raster ﬁle generated by the GRID icon. In the second ﬁeld, there
is a combo box that allows the user to choose between Slope or Aspect Map. Lastly, the
third ﬁeld (output ﬁle), is also a raster ﬁle. There is also a check box that allows generat-
ing a classiﬁed slope or aspect map with ﬁve classes according to the Portuguese Forest
Authority rules (DFCI 2008), where each one has an associated color. These colors are in
a gradient palette, typically used for Slope and Aspect Maps, which is an option for the
user. If the user wants to choose the number of classes, it has to be done manually. But,
in this case, the map is represented in grey scale in the desktop due to the limitations of
QGIS in terms of visualization. The classiﬁcation into ﬁve classes (color and intervals)
is based on the rules published in the technical guide for the Portuguese Forest Authority
(DFCI 2008), which describes the forest ﬁre risk cartography methodology. The Slope Map
and Aspect Map classes are presented in Figure 9. The Aspect feature is not used in this
application, but the classes are deﬁned in the technical guide (DFCI 2008). Nevertheless,
such as the TIN feature, it was already incorporated into this application and can be later
used.

3.1.4. Probability Map

The Probability Map feature gives the Probability Map that will be used in Hazard Map
generation. This command was built to make an addition between several raster ﬁles.
This procedure used a shapeﬁle with burnt areas data. This ﬁle can be obtained in AFN
ofﬁcial web page (http://www.afn.min-agricultura.pt/). The Probability Map creation is
separated into a manual component and a computational component, the last one being the
Probability Map feature help. The manual component lies in separating all the years into
different shapeﬁles and adding a column with the value 1 to each attribute table. Therefore,
the burnt areas are classiﬁed with value 1. Then, the user needs to convert all the shapeﬁles
into raster ﬁles with the Rasterize feature. After that, the set of shapeﬁles is added to the
Probability Map feature as a list through Add button. The button Empty Raster allows the
creation of a raster ﬁle with a matrix ﬁlled with 0s. This matrix is used when there are no
ﬁre occurrences in a year, and so it can be added to the list. The button Remove allows
the removal of any ﬁle from the list. The input and output ﬁelds are identical to the other
features.

3.1.5. Hazard Map

According to Merrill and Alexander (1987), the ﬁre hazard describes the potential ﬁre
behavior without regard to the state of weather-inﬂuenced fuel moisture content, and/or
resistance to ﬁreguard construction for a given fuel type. This may be expressed in either
the absolute or comparative sense. Such an assessment is based on physical fuel char-
acteristics (e.g., fuel arrangement, fuel load, condition of herbaceous vegetation, and the
presence of ladder fuels). The Hazard Map represents the probability of occurrence of sev-
eral destructive phenomena in a certain time period. The forecast of forest ﬁre risks can be
achieved with the use of maps that allow preventing the cause. Hazard Maps are a tool to
evaluate this phenomenon. According to the following equation, Hazard Maps are a result
of the mathematical product of Probability and Susceptibility Maps.

Hazard Map = Probability Map × Susceptibility Map

(2)

The Susceptibility Map contains the Slope Map and the land-cover information – CLC.
The nomenclature of the Susceptibility Map is indicated in the following equation, which
consists of the mathematical product of a numerical slope and a numeric (weight factor)
land-cover value (see Table 4):

Susceptibility Map = Slope Map × CLC

(3)

The Slope Map can be generated by Terrain Analysis feature and the CLC is available
online for Portugal. However, the CLC can be in vector or raster format. If it is in vector
format, the user has to convert to raster through the Rasterize feature. In this procedure, the
initial extent values must be inserted, the correct attribute and the values must be veriﬁed,
to ensure they are integers. Otherwise, a column must be created with the integer values.
So, the three input ﬁles of Hazard Map feature are the Probability Map, the Slope Map, and
CLC Map. This feature comprises four ﬁelds, where the last one deﬁned the output direc-
tory, as shown in Figure 8 – right. The Reclassify button allows creating a classiﬁed map
according to AFN rules. This command comprises two ﬁelds, namely the input ﬁle (Hazard

15

Map) and the output ﬁle (new classiﬁed map). The method used in the classiﬁcation was
the quantiles method. The color gradient is present in Figure 9.

In the code developed for this feature (Hazard.py), the mquantiles function of scipy
(scientiﬁc tools for Python) was used. The scipy library together with the numpy library,
which deals with arrays, allows for the manipulation of numbers and operations in a quick
and easy way.

3.1.6. Risk Map

The risk should be understood as the sum (or integral) of probabilities of events times
their corresponding costs. In order to complement the Hazard Map information on ﬁres
phenomenon, a forest ﬁre risk map was also created. A Risk Map allows the evaluation of
the potential loss in a certain hazard zone. According to AFN rules, the forest ﬁre risk map
is created multiplying the Hazard Map by the Potential Loss Map. The last one is created
through the mathematical product of Vulnerability Map and the Economic Value Map.

The Vulnerability Map contains the values which represent the damage level of an
element at risk and varies between 0 and 1. These values need to be added by the user to a
shapeﬁle that contains the land use.

The Economic Value Map contains the price, in euros, of the land for each pixel. This
economic value allows for evaluating the money needed to recover the lost elements. These
economic values and the vulnerability values are given by the local authorities and are
public, such as CAOF (commission for monitoring of forest operations) tables, Gabinete
de Planeamento e Política Agro-Alimentar (GPPAA) (accounts of the culture of vegetables)
tables, government procurement, and decree-laws.

As shown in Figure 6 – left, there are three input ﬁles in this feature: the Hazard Map
created in Hazard feature, the Potential Loss Map, and the Road Network Map (a shapeﬁle
with road information, which can be obtained from local authorities). The ﬁrst input ﬁle
was the unclassiﬁed Hazard Map already created in last feature. The second one, Potential
Loss Map, was manipulated by the user. First, to calculate the vulnerability values, the CLC
shapeﬁle converted to a raster ﬁle was used with the potential damage as an attribute ﬁeld
and it was inserted in the second input ﬁeld. Forest ﬁre risk zoning requires integration
of natural (topography) and anthropogenic factors, such as roads and settlements. So, the
third input ﬁle is a Road Network Map which is manipulated like the CLC ﬁle. The result
of forest ﬁre risk map is generated by multiplying the three raster ﬁles described. The
Reclassify button is identical to Hazard Map button and the color gradient used in the Risk
Map is the same used for the Hazard Map and is presented in Figure 10. The result is a
raster ﬁle.

3.1.7. Rasterize feature

This feature was created to convert vector ﬁles into raster ﬁles. This procedure is necessary
in several operations. The Rasterize feature is composed of eight ﬁelds and considers as
input a vector ﬁle which can be accessed through a directory or selected in a combo box.
The second ﬁeld allows to deﬁne the pixel size, which is 25 m according to AFN rules,
but can be changed by the user. The next ﬁeld selects the attribute to generate the raster
vector. If the values in that attribute column are deﬁned as a string, the user has to change
them to integer values. The next four ﬁelds deﬁne the ﬁle extent (x minimum, x maximum,
y minimum, and y maximum), which, in the project, must be the quoted point ﬁle extent.
The last ﬁeld is the output ﬁeld (raster ﬁle).

3.2. Forest ﬁre risk model: Portuguese case

The methodology described in the previous sections was applied to three municipalities
of the Norwest of Portugal – Santa Maria da Feira, Trofa, and Oliveira de Azeméis.
In these municipalities, as in all the Portuguese municipalities, the forest ﬁre risk maps
were produced according to the Portuguese Forestry Authority rules and mainly devel-
oped in GIS proprietary solutions. The application developed in this work allowed to
create, through a unique toolbar and using open source software, several thematic maps
(Probability, Susceptibility, Hazard, Vulnerability) that can be used to produce the forest
ﬁre risk map. In this article, the results obtained for the Santa Maria da Feira municipality
will be presented.

3.2.1. Portuguese Forestry Authority
The Portuguese Forestry Authority objective is the forest and associated areas protection
and preservation, encouraging the Portuguese forest resources development. The main
targets of the Portuguese Forestry Authority are the protection against forest ﬁres, the
forest policy, and the forest management and protection. All the procedures described
in this article are based on Portuguese Forestry Authority technical and methodological
guides.

The evaluation of the forest ﬁre risk cartography reinforces the need to clarify the con-
cepts that determine the risk model adopted by Portuguese Forestry Authority, intending
to establish a common basis for working production of these maps, and presents some
benchmarks and common sources of information, which could achieve greater uniformity
of results (not despite the natural and expected scale effects). This cartography is created
in a municipality base, not allowing inter-municipality comparisons or generalizations for
regional units. Finally, it is also important to alert to the differences between the Hazard
Map (usually and incorrectly called Risk Map) and the Risk Map. Figure 1 presents the risk
model adopted by the Portuguese Forestry Authority with the several steps. This model is
used for all the Portuguese municipalities independently.

3.2.2. Hazard Map

As already stated in Section 3.1.5, hazard evaluation comprises probability and suscepti-
bility. It is evaluated in time and space, through ﬁre occurrence historic data, and through
natural conditions in a certain zone, respectively.

The Probability Map incorporates the information on the number of ﬁres that occurred
in the last 15 years for each pixel. After, an annual average is calculated, in percentage, for
each pixel. The probability is expressed as an annual average percentage, which means ‘in
this pixel, there will be a probability average annual of x% that a ﬁre occurs.’ The following
equation was used to calculate this annual probability for each pixel:

(f × 100)
(cid:3)

(4)

where f represents the number of ﬁre occurrences for each pixel, which is calculated as a
sum of the ﬁres considered in the time series and (cid:3) represents the number of years of the
time series. The number of ﬁre occurrences for each pixel (f ) is multiplied by 100 and the
decimal part is ignored (in order to use integer values in the GIS analysis). Afterward, the
raster is reclassiﬁed in order to give the same value (to 0) to the pixels that never burned or
just burned once. This operation allows for eliminating fortuitous cases.

The susceptibility values allow to evaluate if each pixel is more or less propitious to
ﬁre occurrence. These values make possible the evaluation of hazard in space, according
to the factors and circumstances in a certain area. As already referred in Section 3.1.5,
the information needed to calculate these values is the Slope Map and CLC. The Slope
Map classes, which are in accordance with the Portuguese Forestry Authority rules (DFCI
2008), are presented in Table 3.

Fuel type is important for characterization of ﬁre behavior, fuel loading, and emission
efﬁciency. Fuel type data can be generated from land-cover/land-use type. In this work, the
land-cover/land-use information was obtained from the CLC. The CLC nomenclature is
organized by classes, with weights that deﬁne the ease of soil burning. The CLC nomencla-
ture is a document and can be obtained with a CLC ﬁle. According to CLC nomenclature,
levels 2 and 3 are agricultural areas and forest and semi-natural areas, respectively. Levels
1, 4, and 5 are artiﬁcial surfaces, wetlands, and waterbodies, respectively. These areas are
not propitious to ﬁre occurrence. The CLC can be used when there is not any more detailed
information. The CLC code values, levels 2 and 3, are used to classify the ﬁre occurrence
susceptibility. Table 4 presents the CLC classes and the correspondent weight factors and
susceptibility indices.

3.2.3. Risk Map

The Risk Map comprises ﬁve classes, according to Portuguese Forestry Authority rules
(DFCI 2008). The method used was the quantiles method (Wilcox 1997).

The potential loss allows determining which elements must be protected, according to

vulnerability and economic value of each element.

The vulnerability scale comprises ﬁve classes, ranging between 0 and 1. The elements
with value 1 suffer total loss and the elements with value 0 do not suffer any damage
(Table 5).

The economic value is the price, in euros, and can be achieved in public tables. After
loss or destruction of an element, these values allowed for quantifying the investment
needed to recover the element. Table 6 presents the vulnerability value and the economic
value for some elements. Figure 11 presents the maps produced through the GIS open
source application developed.

4. Discussion and conclusions
The Hazard Map, that combines the probability and the susceptibility, represents the poten-
tial of a land for the ﬁre occurrence. This map is particularly indicated for prevention
actions. The Risk Map combines the hazard component with the potential loss component
(vulnerability and economic value) in order to quantify the degree of loss after a ﬁre event.

The forest ﬁre risk model presented in this article provides not only the Risk Map, but
also the Hazard Map. These two maps can be used together in order to better understand
and prevent the ﬁres occurrence. However, this model does not provide the capacity of
modeling future conditions or incorporate different variables. Even so, as an open source
application, it can be modiﬁed by any user that wants to adapt this application to another
case study and incorporate other variables or different weights. Beyond being an open
source application, this application may be faster and easier when compared with the GIS
proprietary solutions that usually comprise several steps and the use of different software
extensions.

In order to compare the performance of the application developed, the forest ﬁre risk
map procedures described in this article were carried out in two different software projects:
in a GIS proprietary software and through the open source tools developed within this
application in QGIS. These procedures were performed in the same environment: same
computer, same CPU (Intel® CoreTM 2 Duo CPU T8300 @ 2.40 GHz (2 CPUs) ∼2.4 GHz),
same memory (3262 MB RAM), and same operating system (Windows VistaTM Home
Premium 6.0). In both cases, a Hazard Map and a Risk Map were created following the
AFN rules (DFCI 2008) and clocked all the procedures (Table 7). Several conclusions can
be drawn by analyzing the results presented in Table 7. The total time recorded does not
include the conversion of the burnt areas to raster. The total value obtained with the pro-
prietary software was 11(cid:4) 3.82(cid:4)(cid:4), better than 23(cid:4) 12.80(cid:4)(cid:4) obtained with this open source tool.
This difference is explained due to the GRID feature developed which takes a long time
to process (around 19 min). This feature was developed based on GdalTools, a set of pro-
grams used in GIS plug-ins. QGIS has a plug-in named Raster that provides these buttons.
GRID is one of them and was used in the application. Without the GRID feature, the total
processing time recorded was 10(cid:4) 4.21(cid:4)(cid:4) in the proprietary solution and 4(cid:4) 9.74(cid:4)(cid:4) with this
application. The main cause of this time reduction is due to the processing time taken in

Probability Map creation. According to Table 7, an expert operator creates a Probability
Map in 6(cid:4) 58.16(cid:4)(cid:4) in the GIS proprietary solutions. Using this open source application, the
time spent was reduced to 2(cid:4) 21.73(cid:4)(cid:4). The main cause for this time reduction is related to
the raster reclassiﬁcation. In the proprietary GIS software, the raster reclassiﬁcation pro-
cedure is done manually ﬁle by ﬁle, and in this open source solution this procedure is
automated.

The performance of this open source solution was also evaluated in the GRID creation,
when the number of quoted points was reduced to 50% of total points (Table 8). The results
presented in Table 8 are very interesting and allow us to conclude that the number of quoted
points used in the GRID creation did not interfere with the time procedure in the GIS
proprietary solutions. Instead, in the open source solution, the time procedure was reduced
to 50% when the number of quoted points used was also reduced to 50%. The GRID

creation was incorporated into this application, but it is not a prerequisite of the Risk Map
model because most of the municipalities have this information (GRID ﬁle) a priori. This
button was performed to complement/improve this application and for the uncommon case
where the GRID is not already available.

This work aims to develop an open source application to create forest risk maps
required for all the Portuguese municipalities. It was not, nor could it be our intention, to
validate or check the accuracy of the generated maps. This procedure should be performed
by the competent authorities (Portuguese Forest Authority).

In future versions of this application, we intend to produce the forest risk maps
according to INSPIRE data speciﬁcations (http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). The INSPIRE
directive aims to create a European Union spatial data infrastructure. The INSPIRE direc-
tive came into force on May 2007 and will be implemented in various stages, with full
implementation only required by 2019.

This application has a great potential of application for other places. It can be directly
used in Portugal and could be easily adapted to the rules of other countries. The code is
open and can be modiﬁed according to the user requirements. Other advantage in publish-
ing the plug-ins and the application code is the possibility of other users to improve this
application (available at (http://www.fc.up.pt/pessoas/amteodor/QGIS/Forest_Fire_Risk.
rar). This is the basic idea of the open source.

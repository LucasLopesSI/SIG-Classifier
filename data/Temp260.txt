How much information is geospatially referenced? Networks
and cognition

Stefan Hahmann* and Dirk Burghardt

Institute for Cartography, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany

(Received 27 June 2012; ﬁnal version received 21 October 2012)

The aim of this article is to provide a basis in evidence for (or against) the much-quoted
assertion that 80% of all information is geospatially referenced. For this purpose, two
approaches are presented that are intended to capture the portion of geospatially ref-
erenced information in user-generated content: a network approach and a cognitive
approach. In the network approach, the German Wikipedia is used as a research cor-
pus. It is considered a network with the articles being nodes and the links being edges.
The Network Degree of Geospatial Reference (NDGR) is introduced as an indicator
to measure the network approach. We deﬁne NDGR as the shortest path between any
Wikipedia article and the closest article within the network that is labeled with coor-
dinates in its headline. An analysis of the German Wikipedia employing this approach
shows that 78% of all articles have a coordinate themselves or are directly linked to at
least one article that has geospatial coordinates. The cognitive approach is manifested
by the categories of geospatial reference (CGR): direct, indirect, and non-geospatial
reference. These are categories that may be distinguished and applied by humans.
An empirical study including 380 participants was conducted. The results of both
approaches are synthesized with the aim to (1) examine correlations between NDGR
and the human conceptualization of geospatial reference and (2) to separate geospatial
from non-geospatial information. From the results of this synthesis, it can be concluded
that 56–59% of the articles within Wikipedia can be considered to be directly or indi-
rectly geospatially referenced. The article thus describes a method to check the validity
of the ‘80%-assertion’ for information corpora that can be modeled using graphs (e.g.,
the World Wide Web, the Semantic Web, and Wikipedia). For the corpus investi-
gated here (Wikipedia), the ‘80%-assertion’ cannot be conﬁrmed, but would need to
be reformulated as a ‘60%-assertion’.

Introduction

This article was motivated by the hype about a ﬁgure that is as frequently quoted as it
is empirically unsupported: ‘80% of all information contains some geospatial reference’.
This ‘geo-assertion’ that occurs in various guises is widely known among members of geo-
science and geo-business communities. Today, it has become so entrenched that it almost
passes for fact. Some of the feedback that we have received from the survey conducted
in preparation of this article showed us that there is a demand within the GIS community

to test this ﬁgure by scientiﬁc means. Hence, almost 30 years after its ﬁrst occurrence, it
is time to reexamine the assertion, even if such a study only touches upon the margins of
classic GIScience research. In any case, such an investigation might still be assigned to
the area of ‘cognition of geographic information’, which has been recognized as one of the
sub-ﬁelds of GIScience (cf. Mark 2003).

Today, it seems to be impossible to doubtlessly ascertain where the assertion originally
occurred. In Hahmann et al. (2011), we have reported that the earliest traceable references
for this piece of ‘geo-folk-wisdom’ go back to the 1980s and originated in Canada/United
States during the rise of GIS. Huxhold (1991, pp. 22–23) cites the assertion from a brochure
of the Municipality of Burnaby, Canada (Municipality of Burnaby 1986) ‘as much as 80%
of all information held by business and government may be geographically referenced’.
We have also collected information on later occurrences of the assertion in scientiﬁc and
non-scientiﬁc publications, for example, ‘as much as 80% of all information held by busi-
ness and government may be geographically referenced’ (Franklin 1992, p. 12), ‘research
shows that approximately 80% of all decisions in the public sector are based on georef-
erenced data’ (Riecken 2001, p. 218), ‘95% is more accurate today, new technology is
partially responsible, including cell phones, GPS devices and electronic toll collectors’
(Perkins 2010), and ‘According to the generally accepted assertion that 80% of all infor-
mation has a reference to space . . . ’ (Fitzke and Greve 2010, p. 735, translated from
German). Numerous further references could easily be listed.

The sources of the 80%-assertion indicate that the ﬁgure applied to municipal and
government data, meaning that the initiators of the claim mainly referred to coordinates,
identiﬁers, and address data. Since its early occurrences, the assertion has been overgen-
eralized and many authors have blindly copied it, even though it has no basis in evidence.
People who know the assertion express a tension between hoping the number is realistic
and doubts as to whether it has been invented to drive the market.

If we further develop the idea Vanessa Lawrence expresses as ‘everything happens
somewhere’ (Lawrence 2009, p. 4), then we may, of course, conclude that 100% would
be the correct answer. Likewise, in Hahmann et al. (2011), we discussed that this applies
almost entirely to information that is stored in a network structure such as the Semantic
Web or the World Wide Web (WWW). That is due to the fact that in these types of networks,
any piece of information – apart from only a few isolated items – is linked to any other in
a giant, single connected component, as Broder et al. (2000) have shown for the WWW.
Hence, given a network where at least some geospatial information is stored, it will be
possible to ﬁnd a path from any item to some piece of geospatial information. These paths
might be regarded as realizations of geospatial reference.

However, by ‘geospatially referenced’ something more restrictive is meant. Thus, what
really matters is to answer the question for which proportion of information the geospatial
component is in any way relevant? Extending the network of knowledge analogy to the
human mind, we may ask: where does human cognition cut off the paths that link arbi-
trary information with geospatial information? There may be items that can be said to be
geospatially referenced per se, such as geographic names. However, a wide range of things,
such as, persons, historic events, companies, cultural artifacts (books, music, movies, art,
etc.), raw materials, food items, or political views only become geospatially referenced
depending on the context where these things are used.

If we want to answer the question of how much information is geospatially referenced,
we need to think about both the numerator and the denominator, that is, we have to deter-
mine how many percent and of what? For the analytical and empirical studies that we
present in this article, we decided to use Wikipedia, as it can be considered a corpus of

domain neutral knowledge. Hecht and Moxley (2009) have used it to evaluate Tobler’s ﬁrst
law of geography.

2. Terms

Before we explain our methods in detail, we want to brieﬂy discuss the terms that we use
in this article.

(1) Geospatial: We consider it important to use the term ‘geospatial’ in contrast to
just ‘spatial’, as the 80%-assertion clearly referred to geospatial information. The
threshold between these two concepts is a matter of scale. See Haggett (2001,
pp. 21–23) for a delineation of the range of scales that is of interest for geographic
science and a discussion of ‘magnitudes of geographic order’.

(2) Information: We are not going to use the word ‘information’ in the sense intro-
duced by Shannon and Weaver’s information theory (Shannon and Weaver 1949).
As discussed by Goodchild (2003), this notion of the word ‘information’ is mainly
concerned with the form and coding of messages, which is only of limited use
for GIScience. Instead, we use Goodchild et al.’s (1999) approach to geographic
information, who regard a tuple <x, y, z, t, U>1 as the primitive element of
geographical information in space-time. This includes that we do not consider
toponyms alone (e.g., ‘Mount Everest’) to be sufﬁcient identiﬁers for positions on
the Earth’s surface, as they need to be converted into a location by a gazetteer ﬁrst
(cf. Goodchild 2003). If geographical information is assessed via this space-time-
attribute tuple approach, single tuples, that is, pieces of geographical information,
may be counted. Moreover, we prefer using the term ‘information’ to using the
term ‘data’, as data chieﬂy refer to numerical information items, which will not be
the main focus of our study. As the z- and the t-components of the mentioned tuple
are not relevant for our approach, they will not be considered further within this
article.

(3) Reference/referenced: There are two meanings of the term ‘reference’, which are
both used in this article: (a) (geospatially) ‘referenced’ in the sense of having
coordinates or being based on exact measurement within a deﬁned (geospatial)
reference system and (b) (geospatial) ‘reference’ in the sense of a general relation
to geospace or geography, which allows a potential transformation into coordinates
at varying levels of granularity. The ﬁrst sense is implied in conjunction with the
network approach and the latter in conjunction with the cognitive approach. Both
approaches will be introduced in the following two sections. In combination with
the 80%-ﬁgure, meanings (a) and (b) can be found (cf. Hahmann et al. 2011).

3. Network approach to geospatial reference
3.1. Related work
Apart from focusing on coordinates, as we do within the network approach, there may be
different ways of analytically capturing the portion of geospatially referenced information
within a corpus of information. In a previous work, the portion of web documents that
contained a US zip code has, for example, been determined (4.5%) by examining a partial
web crawl (McCurley 2001). Furthermore, an analysis of geographic entities (toponyms)
within newspaper articles yielded the result that, on an average, 75% of the investigated
documents contained at least one geographic entity (Cardoso 2011). However, we are not

S. Hahmann and D. Burghardt

going to rely on toponyms within the network approach, since we deem the decisions of the
Wikipedia authors to assign coordinates to an article as a whole to be a stronger indication
of the respective articles being considered geospatial than occurrences of toponyms within
the full text of the article.

The network structure of Wikipedia, which is crucial for the network approach, has
been investigated by Zlati´c et al. (2006), Capocci et al. (2006), and Voss (2005). It has
been shown that the network of Wikipedia articles may be described by the Small-World
model developed by Watts and Strogatz (1998), and Zlati´c et al. (2006) found 4.53 as the
average path length between two arbitrary Wikipedia articles by analyzing the 11 largest
Wikipedias. Furthermore, they have shown that this number does not signiﬁcantly differ
within different language versions of Wikipedia, despite their different evolutionary stages
and – hence – their different sizes. The fact that the main network properties are constant
allows us to deduce that the network approach is mainly independent from the evolutionary
stage as well as from the language version of the examined Wikipedias, as long as the
portion of geospatial articles be approximately equal for each Wikipedia that is analyzed.
However, results of Hecht and Moxley (2009) and Dahinden (2011) show that, in fact,
this portion varies considerably from language version to language version as well as with
regard to different stages of one and the same Wikipedia. We have therefore tested the
impact of a lower coverage of geospatial articles on the network approach by a simulation2
that proved it, however, to be negligible.

3.2. Methodology
In contrast to our suggestion in Hahmann et al. (2011), which was to use and analyze the
Semantic Web, we have decided to focus on Wikipedia and the ‘Wikipedia Article Graph
(WAG)’ (Hecht and Moxley 2009) in this study. This is for three reasons:

(1) Semantic Web data sources are widespread. Hence, in order to be able to run
large-scale analyses with sufﬁcient performance, it would take a signiﬁcant effort
to integrate all these data sources in a local environment. Wikipedia dump ﬁles
are more convenient: they can easily be downloaded and they can be parsed
by existing tools that support extraction of the internal link structure, such as
WikAPIdia (Hecht and Gergle 2010). It would have been possible to use DBpedia
(Bizer et al. 2009), which contains semantically structured information from the
Wikipedia page infoboxes. However, DBpedia lacks article full texts and hence
links between article contents. We think that these links are at least as important as
links between page infobox information items since both types of links may con-
stitute geospatial reference, which makes both of them important for the network
approach to geospatial reference.

(2) In a study, where, as we stated above, the ‘what’ needs to be clearly delineated, it
seems to be a bad idea to use sources that are not really well-closed as would be
the case for the Semantic Web. As its subject is deﬁned more precisely, Wikipedia
differs from the Semantic Web in this regard. By using Wikipedia as a research
corpus, we set the limit for what we study more on the content level and less by
technical constraints as we would if we used the Semantic Web.

(3) We have dismissed the Semantic Web, because we found it difﬁcult to translate
triple entities into something that would be feasible for study participants with
hardly any background knowledge about the Semantic Web, without introducing
biases by this translation.

Though we have diverged from our initial plans with regard to the subject of our ana-
lysis, we have nevertheless adhered to our proposed method of determining the Degree of
Geospatial Reference (cf. Hahmann et al. 2011) implementing it for the ﬁrst time. In order
to distinguish the results of the network approach from those of the cognitive approach,
which will be described later in this article, we use the term Network Degree of Geospatial
Reference (NDGR). NDGR is the indicator to measure the network approach to geospatial
reference. We consider the network approach a model that is capable of analytically captur-
ing the ‘geospatiality’ of information entities. Given a graph with geospatial information
nodes and other nodes that are connected directly or indirectly, NDGR can be determined
using breadth-ﬁrst labeling of the network, as all distances are integers. For our study, we
assign a value of 0 to the NDGR indicator for all articles that use a coordinate template in
their headlines. Figure 1 shows an example of such an article from the German Wikipedia.
We also call these articles geospatial articles.

Values greater than 0 are assigned under the following condition: an article is assigned
a value of 1, if there is at least one link within the full text of this article that connects to
an article with NDGR 0. NDGR 2 is constituted if an article has at least one link pointing
to an article with NDGR 1. A link in the opposite direction – from an NDGR 0 article
to another article – is not sufﬁcient to make that second article NDGR 1. Though these
links may also be considered relevant, we do not examine them in this work for reasons
of simpliﬁcation. Furthermore, we do not use weights, neither based on link counts nor
on link semantics. So the graph model, we have used for the network approach calcula-
tions, can be described as a directed unweighted graph. Figure 2 illustrates the network
approach.

As the average distance between two arbitrary articles within a Wikipedia is 4.53 (as
stated above), we expect the average NDGR to be clearly less than this value, as we do
not seek for all possible connections between two nodes but only for those that connect
non-geospatial articles to their closest geospatial articles.

3.3. Processing

Extracted coordinates from Wikipedia pages are provided by different Wikipedians.
We have used the coordinate dump ﬁle of the German Wikipedia provided by the Wikipedia
user ‘Dispenser’.3 The coordinates of these ﬁles are extracted on a daily basis. The dump
ﬁle contains all coordinates that have been inserted into Wikipedia pages with the help of
coordinate templates. However, the ﬁle does not only contain the headline coordinates, but
also all other occurrences of coordinates within the full text of a Wikipedia page, for exam-
ple, coordinates for the purpose of picture geo-tagging. As we decided to focus exclusively
on coordinates in the headline, we post-processed the original dump ﬁle and tried to omit
all articles without headline coordinates.

From our point of view, this step is essential for the network approach to geospatial
reference, as inserting coordinates in the headline of a Wikipedia page is a conscious deci-
sion by the authors which indicates that these coordinates refer to the page as a whole, thus
making the whole concept (geo)spatial. As the insertion of headline coordinates as well as
of links into Wikipedia pages is of course a result of a cognitive process, the data analyzed
by the network approach cannot be regarded as entirely ‘non-cognitive’.

Besides checking for headline coordinates, we have excluded articles, which contained
coordinates not referring to the earth, such as various pages on lunar craters and maria,
because we wanted to concentrate on geospatial references.

3.4. Results
The complete WAG, which is a result of the WikAPIdia tool, allows computing the NDGR
for each article. Table 1 shows the results of the NDGR calculation for the German
Wikipedia. The portion of geospatial articles is directly reﬂected by NDGR 0. It can be seen
that only NDGR 0 to NDGR 3 are relevant. The 68 NDGR 4 articles are negligible. Articles
that have NDGR higher than 4 do not exist. The cumulative proportions show that NDGR
0 and NDGR 1 amount to 78% of all articles. NDGR 0, NDGR 1, and NDGR 2 make up
as much as 98.4%, which means that this portion of articles is not more than two clicks
away from a page that has geo-coordinates.

Table 2 presents some typical examples of terms with NDGR 0, NDGR 1, and
NDGR 2. We have not included NDGR 3 terms in this table as there were only two
NDGR 3 terms in the whole survey. For this reason, we have also omitted NDGR 3 terms in
some of the following ﬁgures. Note that geographic names are dominant but not exclusive
for NDGR 0. Many of the NDGR 1 entities are either persons or terms that are strongly

associated with geographic entities. Most of the NDGR 2 terms are rather abstract con-
cepts. ‘Neil Young’,4 for example, is an NDGR 1 entity because the corresponding article
links to several places that were related to his life, for example, his birth place Toronto.
‘Career’,5 on the other hand, is an NDGR 2 entity because among others the article links
to the economist Richard Florida,6 who himself is linked with Columbia University.

4. Cognitive approach to geospatial reference
4.1. Related work

While the network approach seems to be appropriate to analytically capture the ‘geospa-
tiality’ of items within a network, it fails to tell us for which portion of information human
cognition considers the geospatial reference as being relevant. For this reason, we also
wanted to apply a cognitive approach and designed an experiment to shed more light
on the question of how humans assess geospatial reference. By employing a cognitive
approach, we align our research to the previous work that also applied cognitive approaches
to geospatial phenomena, for example, Klippel et al. (2008, 2010), Freksa (1992), and
Mark and Egenhofer (1994).

4.2. Categories of geospatial reference

As human cognition relies on categories, they need to be in the focus of the cognitive
approach. Therefore, we have employed categories of geospatial reference (CGR) in our
experiment: direct geospatial reference (DirGR), indirect geospatial reference (IndGR),
and non-geospatial reference (NonGR). These three categories, which are elaborated in the
literature (Bill 2010), may be artiﬁcial for non-experts. However, as their semantic structure
is transparent, everybody is potentially able to interpret them in a non-arbitrary way. Thus,
despite the artiﬁciality of these categories, their interpretation is a cognitive process, which
may also be seen as rating items on a three-point scale (Likert scale) for ‘geospatiality’.

4.3. Experiment setting

Beside the main question, there are two further important issues that we wanted to address
by the setting of our experiment: do results depend on (1) how we ask our participants and
(2) on who we ask? The ﬁrst question arises because biases introduced by the question
method may be assumed, and the second question may be posed because a background of
the participants in the ﬁeld of geo-studies, geo-science, or geo-business may be expected
to affect the results. In order to address these questions, we created two survey groups ‘A’
and ‘B’ that entailed two different formats of the survey questions and also recorded the
geo-background of each participant.

4.3.1. Materials

In total, 1100 article titles have been randomly selected from the German Wikipedia con-
sidering two constraints. (1) The titles should not be ambiguous, such as ‘Bank’,7 as this
might result in an increased answer variance. As the respective pages contain a disam-
biguation hint in their headlines, this constraint was implemented with the help of the
‘is_disambiguation’ ﬁeld, which is an output of the WikAPIdia tool. (2) The articles should
rank among the top 5% of the most frequently accessed Wikipedia pages in 2011. This is
because we assume that this ensures a maximum level of popularity as well as a compa-
rably low portion of unknown terms. Access rates have been determined by analyzing the
page count ﬁles provided by the Wikimedia foundation.8 Any biases potentially introduced
into the survey results by this method are not considered in this article, but could be taken
into account in further research.

We have analyzed the survey results with respect to whether constraint (2) has intro-
duced a bias. No signiﬁcant correlations between the results of the experiment and the
access rates were detected.

All the 1100 selected articles were used to create 11 distinct sets of 100 randomly
selected terms. Based on these sets, 22 online surveys were generated, each set resulting in
a pair of surveys referred to as set ‘A’ and set ‘B’ (cf. also Figure 3a and b).

4.3.2. Procedure

Participants were able to partake in the experiment via an online survey. They were free to
choose when and where to do it. They received a short introduction explaining the context
of the study. In particular, some citations of the 80%-assertion were referred to and it was
mentioned that there is a lack of empirical justiﬁcation in this ﬁeld. The participants were
not given any hint that, in a parallel study (network approach), a special focus was put on
geo-coordinates in the headline of the Wikipedia articles.

survey and (right) set ‘B’ survey. Group A includes the link to the corresponding article and also
a note encouraging participants to use it, if they are unsure. Both the groups display a permanent
link pointing to the given deﬁnition of geospatial reference. There are four possible categories for
each term: DirGR, IndGR, NonGR, and ‘Term unknown’ (U). Note: Two surveys have been kept
online for demonstration: group 1A: http://kartographie.geo.tu-dresden.de/limesurvey/64851/lang-

Furthermore, participants were asked to enter anonymous personal data: (1) back-
ground in the ﬁeld of geo-studies, geo-science, or geo-business yes/no; (2) awareness of
the 80%-geo-assertion before participation yes/no; (3) age; (4) gender, and (5) current
state of being a student yes/no. The task of the participants in the main experiment was
to assign the titles of Wikipedia articles to the three CGR. In case they did not know a
term or were not sure about it, they were asked to select ‘term unknown’. For support, they
were shown a slightly adapted version of the deﬁnition of geospatial reference by Bollmann
(2002)9 prior to the main experiment. It was made clear that there are no right or wrong
ways for categorizing and that it was up to the participants to select criteria for categorizing
themselves. No examples for categorization were given.

The terms in the main part of the experiment were presented in random order to reduce
the inﬂuence of the participants’ exhaustion. Figure 3 shows an example of the ‘term-to-
category assignment task’. Participants with a set ‘A’ survey were shown each term in
combination with the link to the corresponding Wikipedia page. They were encouraged
to follow it, if they felt they needed it to make their decision. Participants with a set ‘B’
survey were shown the same terms; however, they were not given any links and were asked
not to use any external sources such as Google or Wikipedia.

4.3.3. Participants
In order to recruit participants, we posted an announcement on a German geo-news
website.10 Furthermore, we sent e-mail invitations to students, colleagues as well as other
persons, whom the authors of the article know personally. Survey group selection for each
participant was done by a randomized mechanism: all participants were given the same
starting link, which redirected them.

4.4. Hypotheses

Our aim is to combine the results of the network and the cognitive approach in order
to investigate the relationship between them. Our hypotheses are that (1) articles with a
NDGR = 0 are predominantly categorized as DirGR, (2) articles with NDGR > 0 are rarely
categorized as DirGR, but more frequently as IndGR, and (3) with increasing NDGR the
portion of IndGR decisions is reduced in favor of an increasing portion of NonGR deci-
sions. If our results conﬁrm these hypotheses, then the two approaches support each other.
If that is the case, the combination of both approaches is suitable to provide evidence for
the initial geo-assertion though the 80%-ﬁgure might have to be adapted.

4.5. Data of experiment participation

In this Section, the background of the experiment participants is presented. Table 3 shows
how many of the experiment participants had a background in geo-studies, geo-science,
or geo-business and were aware of the 80%-ﬁgure. In the context of this study, it is
remarkable that about 85% of all participants with a geo-background have heard about
the 80%-ﬁgure. However, this might not be fully representative, since people who knew
this ﬁgure were more likely to participate. In general, the study met with a considerable
eagerness among geo-folk to participate. Consequently, the share of geo-background par-
ticipants is rather high. With regard to those participants, who knew the ﬁgure without
having a geo-background themselves (2.6%), we have to concede that their knowledge is a
direct consequence of their acquaintance with the authors of this article.

In total, 380 people participated in the experiment. At the time of participation, 33%
of them were students. The average age was 34.5 years. The portion of female/male
participants was 37%/63%. For reference, we have kept the results of all survey groups
online.11

4.6. Results

For the cognitive approach, we computed for each article the portions of the different CGR
that had been assigned by the participants. Figure 4 shows three example articles with dif-
ferent NDGR. For ‘Cardiff’, 75 participants selected ‘DirGR’, six participants selected
‘IndGR’, two participants selected ‘NonGR’, and three participants selected ‘U’ (term
unknown). This results in 87.2% ‘DirGR’, 7.0% ‘IndGR’, 2.3% ‘NonGR’, and 3.5% ‘U’.
For the analyses, it will be assumed that participants that selected ‘U’ would have selected
any category with the same probability as all other participants, if they had known the term.
Consequently, portions of CGR decisions may be computed relative to the portion of all
not-‘U’ decisions. For the case of the Cardiff example, this results in these adapted por-
tions of CGR: 90.4% ‘DirGR’, 7.2% ‘IndGR’, and 2.4% ‘NonGR’. Complete results for
all articles that were tested in the survey can also be found in the online survey statistics.

5. Synthesis of approaches
5.1. Methodology
In this section, the interplay between the network approach and the cognitive approach will
be discussed. Our main focus is to answer the question to which categories participants
assigned terms with different NDGR. For this purpose, we synthesize the results of the
network approach and the cognitive approach in the following way: we combine the NDGR

of a speciﬁc article and the portion of participants that assigned a speciﬁc CGR to the
title of this article into one two-dimensional value. As there are three CGR portions per
article, three values can be generated per article. Figure 5a shows a plot of the nine values
generated from the three-example articles shown in Figure 4, among others the values of
0/0.87 (NDGR and portion of DirGR for ‘Cardiff’), 1/0.67 (NDGR and portion of IndGR
for ‘Neil Young’), and 2/0.056 (NDGR and portion of NonGR for ‘Career’). Figure 5b–d
visualizes the relationship between the network approach and the cognitive approach for the
values generated from all articles in the form of box-and-whisker plots (cf. Tukey 1977).

In this article, we scale the width of the boxes according to the number of articles rep-
resented by each box. In order to reduce the impact of outliers, we computed robust mean
values as symmetrically trimmed means with a fraction of 0.05 observations deleted from
each end of the distribution (cf. Wilcox 2004, pp. 56–59). Likewise, we used a robust esti-
mator for the calculation of standard deviations. Wilcox (2004, pp. 62–63) discusses the
sample Winsorized variance, which we applied with 0.05 as the amount of Winsorization.
The square root of the sample Winsorized variance was used to estimate standard devi-
ations. For the computation of correlation coefﬁcients, we applied Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient.

Figure 5b shows the relationship between NDGR and DirGR. As expected, there is
a negative correlation (–0.59) between the portion of DirGR per article and the NDGR
of an article. NDGR 0 articles have been categorized by the participants as DirGR with
an average of 90%. This high matching rate shows that the results support each other,
which provides evidence for two things: for human cognition ‘direct geospatial reference’
is available as a category and, secondly, the network approach is a suitable method to mea-
sure geospatial reference. Upper outliers of NDGR 1 might be candidates for articles that
are still lacking a headline coordinate.

Figure 5c shows the relationship between NDGR and IndGR. As can be seen, there is
no linear correlation. Instead, there is a non-linear relationship with a peak at NDGR 1.
The portion of NDGR 0 is low because NDGR 0 articles have mainly been assigned to
DirGR. NDGR greater than 1 show a constant decrease of IndGR portions.

Figure 5d shows the relationship of NDGR and NonGR which is similar to the inverse
relationship between NDGR and DirGR. The higher the NDGR, the higher is the portion
of NonGR, which results in a positive correlation between NDGR and NonGR of 0.59. The
height of the boxes and the length of the whiskers indicate the dispersion of answers. It can
be seen that the height of the NDGR 0 boxes is small for all three categories. From this,
it may be inferred that categorization of NDGR 0 terms is relatively unambiguous. As the
boxes of NDGR 1 and NDGR 2 for the categories IndGR and NonGR are particularly
high, we may conclude that the category of IndGR is rather fuzzy and that the threshold that
delineates IndGR and NonGR is fuzzy, too. In summary, we found that all three hypotheses
that were formulated in Section 4.4 to be conﬁrmed.

Figure 6a shows the results of group A participants in comparison to group B par-
ticipants. Participants in group A were encouraged to gather further information before
making their decisions. Participants in group B were asked not to use any external sources.
As can be seen in Figure 6a, there is a direct impact of the applied method on the
results of the categorization task. Participants that were allowed to inform themselves and
hence had some sort of activated pre-knowledge tended to categorize terms more spatially.
The mean values connected by the orange lines show this for DirGR. Group A results
(solid lines) occur above group B results (dotted lines) for all NDGR. Likewise, the IndGR
mean values (green) of group A are above the corresponding mean values of group B,
except for NDGR 0. The results for NonGR (purple) correspond to the other results as
they show that the portion of participants that decided to choose the ‘non-geospatially
referenced’ category is lower for group A than for group B. Nevertheless, even the fact
that some of the differences between both groups are statistically signiﬁcant is not enough
evidence to conclude that activated pre-knowledge changes the results completely. Beside
the differences in the mean values, we may observe that standard deviations in group A
are generally lower than in group B. From that we can deduce that participants who were
encouraged to take further information into account produced more stable results.

5.3.

Impact of professional background on the categorization results

The results of the participants are compared with regard to their professional background
in Figure 6b. In order to be able to apply the best possible distinction between both groups
of participants, we decided to consider only those with a geo-background and a knowledge
of the 80%-ﬁgure, on the one hand, and those that had neither, on the other hand.

In general, we may notice that

the differences between geo-participants and
non-geo-participants are smaller than the differences between group A and group B par-
ticipants. From this, we may infer that it is less important ‘who’ we ask than ‘how’ we
ask. Furthermore, these results provide evidence that the geo-participants do not gen-
erally consider the tested Wikipedia articles to be more geospatially referenced than
non-geo-participants. Hence, it seems that people with a geo-background do not have a
particularly ‘geospatially inﬂuenced’ worldview. However, some differences between both
groups of participants may be observed: for NDGR 0 articles the non-geo-participants have
less frequently chosen IndDR and more frequently either DirGR or NonGR. This may indi-
cate that, for the non-geo-participants, the category of IndGR is less clear than DirGR and
NonGR. However, this is not conﬁrmed by the results of NDGR 1 and NDGR 2. Apart
from that, the results of NDGR 2 show that the geo-participants have more frequently cho-
sen NonGR. The reason for that may be that the geo-participants have a stronger idea of
what is geospatially referenced and what is not.

5.4. Prediction of CGR portions for the whole German Wikipedia

The research work that we present in this article was triggered by the question how much
information is geospatially referenced. Consequently, we computed a prediction of the por-
tions of DirGR, IndGR, and NonGR for the whole German Wikipedia based on the results
of the network approach and the cognitive approach. Table 4 shows the predicted val-
ues. The mean values of each NDGR-CGR combination are the same as in Figure 4b–d.
We have estimated the standard errors of the mean values according to Wilcox (2004,
p. 63) applying 2σ accuracy. The portions of NDGR for the whole German Wikipedia
are adapted values of Table 1 – we have computed these values relative to all non-
isolated articles (cf. Table 1: NDGR = −1). As NDGR 4 is negligible, we have omitted

it. For each NDGR-CGR combination, the percentage of its NDGR portion and the mean
value/standard error of its CGR portion were multiplied (results in italics). The total por-
tion of each CGR (in bold) is the sum of all mean values of this CGR. The total standard
error of each CGR (in bold) is computed using the Bienaymé formula (cf., e.g., Loève
1977, p. 12). As discussed in Section 4.5, the results of group A have lower standard devia-
tions. Since this indicates more stable decisions of the participants, we have decided to use
these results for the prediction.

The predicted portion for the category of DirGR is 27.0% (±1.1%). For the cate-
gory of IndGR, it is 30.3% (±1.2%). Together both CGR make up a portion of 57.3%
(±1.6%) compared to a portion of 42.7% (±1.4%) for non-geospatially referenced infor-
mation. Despite the comparably low standard errors, ranges rather than point estimations
may be preferred as results. Consequently, we take the 2σ errors as interval estimators to
deduce the following ranges as results: 26–28% DirGR, 29–32% IndGR (DirGR + IndGR:
56–59%), and 41–44% NonGR.

6. Discussion
The drawback of the presented approaches in conjunction with the employed corpus of a
speciﬁc Wikipedia (i.e., an encyclopedia) is that they fail to estimate portions of geospatial
reference when focusing on concrete instances instead of generic concepts. This is because
it is neither possible to infer the categorization of single instances from the categoriza-
tion of concepts nor to estimate the number of instances for most concepts. While, for
example, the generic concept ‘house’ might not be considered to have a direct geospatial
reference per se, a concrete instance of a house, such as the ‘Empire State Building’ or
the ‘White House’, may of course be considered to be directly geospatially referenced.
Furthermore, it is not always possible to estimate how many instances of a concept there
are in total. Moreover, there are concepts that do not have any physical instances at all, such
as ‘philosophy’ or ‘synthpop’. In order to focus on instances, a preferably domain-neutral,
graph-structured corpus of single data entities is required. For this purpose, the Semantic
Web may be suitable.

Furthermore, the network approach presented in this article neither accounts for
the speciﬁc number of links that connect NDGR 1, NDGR 2, or NDGR 3 concepts

S. Hahmann and D. Burghardt

to geospatial concepts nor for different types of links, which may be distinguished in
other corpora than the employed German Wikipedia. However, both factors may be of
importance for human cognition. Consequently, reﬁnements to the network approach
should yield results that are closer to human categorization of geospatial reference.

One suggestion for such a reﬁnement would be the use of weights for NDGR calcula-
tion. These weights can be based on link counts and also on link semantics. In both cases,
we would need to switch the employed graph model from a directed unweighted graph to
a directed weighted graph.

Link counts may easily be integrated as they may be gained by using the WikAPIdia
tool. With regard to the semantics of links, weights would need to be chosen with respect
to different types of links depending on how they constitute geospatial reference. In this
regard, it needs to be considered that there are different kinds of transformations that make
something geospatially referenced, such as address-to-coordinate conversion (geocoding),
the use gazetters, or sensors (e.g. GPS devices). The Semantic Web may be a suitable way to
integrate the semantics of these references, because it explicitly models them. In the ontol-
ogy of DBpedia, there are properties, such as dbo:location, dbo:birthplace, dbo:hometown,
and dbo:premierePlace.12 However, further investigations would be required to deﬁne cri-
teria that might be used to derive weights for different types of links. The large number of
link types would make this an even bigger challenge.

The cognitive approach may also be reﬁned. One such reﬁnement could be realized
by a ‘group-and-rank’ task. Participants could be asked to create groups for terms whose
‘geospatiality’ is perceived as similar. Secondly, they would have to rank these groups. This
would help us to ﬁnd terms that human cognition considers more geospatially referenced
than others. Moreover, it would be possible to analyze for each article how long it took
participants to assign it to a CGR. These data have already been collected in our study. This
aspect might provide additional evidence, especially for the estimation of the uncertainty
of decisions.

As discussed earlier in this article, we do not expect signiﬁcant differences depending
on the Wikipedia language version for the network approach. However, there may be lin-
guistic effects on the conceptualization of the CGR that may have an impact on the results
of the cognitive approach. In this context, Klippel and Montello (2007) show how language
affects the human conceptualization of directions. Consequently, there would be a demand
for a subsequent study employing another language version of Wikipedia.

7. Conclusions and future work
The work we have presented in this article is a contribution to the quantiﬁcation of geospa-
tially referenced information within user-generated content. It may serve as a proxy for the
real situation, which would be much harder to investigate. Moreover, the network approach
may be used to estimate the ‘geospatiality’ of information in the context of semantic or
geospatial web analyses. In summary, it can be said that the synthesis of the two presented
approaches – network approach and cognitive approach – is suitable to estimate the portion
of geospatially referenced items within graph-structured corpora of information.

According to the results of our study, 57% of the information within the German
Wikipedia is geospatially referenced. This total amount of geospatially referenced infor-
mation consists of a 27% share that is categorized by humans as information with direct
geospatial reference and a 30% share that is categorized as information with indirect
geospatial reference.

Although this is below the original estimations of the geo-community, which may have
been biased by their wishes, it is still strong evidence for the relevance of the geospatial

information community. Hence, from the authors’ point of view, the results of this study
do not need to be seen as detrimental to the standing of geoinformation business and geo-
science. It is certainly preferable to refer to a lower number that is supported by a scientiﬁc
investigation than to postulate a higher number that does not seem to be reliable. However,
we also have to bear in mind that these results should not be overgeneralized. The original
assertion referred to municipal and government data and our study might have produced
a higher percentage, if we had investigated this type of data only. In contrast to that, our
results have been gained using Wikipedia (i.e. an encyclopedia), which might be considered
as domain-neutral knowledge. However, it needs to be considered that Wikipedia is a prod-
uct of a rather small number of authors (Ortega et al. 2008). Hence, our method strongly
depends on the work of this minority of Wikipedians. In summary, we have shown that the
very general context-free assertion that 80% of all information is geospatially referenced
may be falsiﬁed.

Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) under the project ‘Mobile map applications based on user gen-
erated content for cartographic communication’ (BU 2605/1-1). We acknowledge the support of
Nicolas Chrisman in tracing the references of the origins of the assertion. We furthermore thank Brent
Hecht, who implemented the WikAPIdia library that we have used to parse the German Wikipedia.
The work of various Wikipedia community members, who have put signiﬁcant effort into producing
the coordinate ﬁles, is highly appreciated. We are grateful to 380 people who participated in our sur-
vey. We sincerely thank Beatrix Weber and ﬁve anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments to
the manuscript and their constructive suggestions.

x, y, z, and t denote coordinates within space–time; U denotes an arbitrary thing or property.

Notes

2. Within this simulation, results were calculated after omitting the headline coordinates from a
random 33% sample of the geospatial articles, which resulted in a lower coverage of geospatial
articles (11.6%), see also Sections 3.2 and 3.4. Because of the dense network structure of the
examined German Wikipedia, the results of this simulation were similar to the results shown
in Table 1.

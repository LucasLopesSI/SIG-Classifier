Abstract. The central problem of a combined analysis of digital terrain models
(DTMs) and other landscape data is determination of a DTM grid size (w)
providing a correct study of relationships between topographic variables and
landscape properties. Generally, an ‘adequate’ w is determined by an expert
estimate, and solutions are largely subjective. We developed an experimental
statistical method to determine an adequate w for DTMs applied to landscape
studies. The method includes the following steps: (a) derivation of a DTM set
using a series of wi, (b) performance of a correlation analysis of data on a landscape
property and a topographic variable estimated with various wi , (c) plotting of
correlation coe(cid:141) cients obtained versus w, and (d) determination of smoothed plot
portions indicating intervals of an adequate w. We applied the method developed
to study the in(cid:143) uence of topography on the spatial distribution of soil moisture
(M) at a micro-scale. We investigated the dependence of M on gradient (G),
horizontal (kh), vertical (kv), and mean (H) landsurface curvatures. For DTM
derivation, we used 13 values of wi from 1 to 7 m. An interval of adequate wi for
M falls between 2.25 and 3.25 m in the given terrain conditions. In absolute
magnitudes, correlation coe(cid:141) cients are largest within this interval; correlation
0.60,
coe(cid:141) cients of M with G, kh, kv and H are Õ
respectively, for w 5 3 m. The results obtained demonstrate that the method actu-
ally works to identify an adequate w at a micro-scale. The method developed
allows estimation of an adequate area of landform which ‘realise’ a topographic
control of landscape properties.

Introduction
In landscape studies the question generally arises: What density of sampling
points should be used to depict adequately the spatial distribution of a landscape
property for a given scale, measurement accuracy, and minimum of samples (Lidov
1949, Kershaw and Looney 1985, Burrough 1993). If one carries out a study with a
regular grid of sampling points, the problem reduces to determination of a grid size.
Success of an investigation depends on the correct solution of this problem.

The problem is connected with determination of a spatial scale of an object,
phenomenon or process under study. This is a critical question because diŒerent
physical laws and landscape processes dominate at diŒerent spatial scales. Extension
of one or other conception or model to all scales can result in invalid description of
actual relationships (Haggett et al. 1965, KlemesÏ 1983, Phillips 1988, De Boer 1992).
An adequate description of a landscape property with a minimum of samples
implies that a grid size corresponds to an area wherein which property values vary
smoothly, or are assumed to have a constant value. These area and grid size will be
denoted the adequate area of a landscape property and the adequate grid size,
respectively (§2). In geomorphic and geological studies with digital terrain models
(DTMs), one can determine an adequate grid size (w) of a DTM from a typical size
of landforms or geological structures concerned (Evans 1972, Florinsky 1996). In
studies of other landscape components (e.g. soils, plants) and landscape processes
(e.g. lateral movement of substances in soils) determination of an adequate grid size
is less trivial. This is due to large spatial variability of landscape properties (Kershaw
and Looney 1985, Oliver and Webster 1986, Burrough 1993 ). In many cases, adequate
areas are not correlated with ‘basic’ landscape units, such as stow and facies (Phillips
1988 ). In addition, a landscape property can oŒer several adequate areas connected
with diŒerent natural processes (Sitnikov 1978, 1980, Kershaw and Looney 1985 )
(§2 ). There are some closely related methods to determine adequate areas in soils
(Oliver and Webster 1986), plant (Kershaw and Looney 1985 ), hydrogeological
(Sitnikov 1978, 1980 ), hydrological (Wood et al. 1988) studies. In these methods, an
indicator of an adequate area is a smoothed portion of a plot describing a dependence
of a property or its statistical parameter on area or grid size used for measurements
of the property. Principles of these methods are detailed in §2.

The problem can be further complicated if one has to analyse data on two or
more landscape properties in combination, or to predict one attribute through an
analysis of another. This is because diŒerent landscape properties can be marked by
diŒerent adequate areas (Phillips 1988 ). Besides, a priori existing relationships
between two landscape properties ( justi(cid:142) ed theoretically or observed in other land-
scapes) can be manifested at only certain adequate areas of these properties (Phillips
1988 ). For instance, it is well known that a watertable can look like a generalised
landsurface. This regularity may be observed by an analysis of data on a watertable
and a digital elevation model (DEM) with some w omitting relatively small topo-
graphic elements. However, one can (cid:142) nd, at best, low correlation of the watertable
with the topography using rather detailed or rather generalised DEM (Thompson
and Moore 1996). Therefore, one may establish invalid statistical regularities
(e.g. conservative correlation coe(cid:141) cients), incorrect predictions and conclusions for
a priori related landscape properties, although one uses high-quality data on these
properties. This problem is typical on an analysis of data marked by diŒerent
resolutions and incongruent grids (Lidov 1949, Band and Moore 1995). However,
the problem cannot be solved merely using data with like resolution and grid.

DTMs can be de(cid:142) ned as digital representations of variables relating to a topo-
graphic surface, namely: DEMs, digital models of gradient (G), aspect (A), horizontal
(kh ), vertical (kv ) and mean (H) landsurface curvatures, speci(cid:142) c catchment area (CA),
topographic index (T I) and some others (table 1) (Burrough 1986, Shary 1995).
DTMs are commonly used in landscape studies since quantitative topographic
characteristics are connected with some natural processes going on in a landscape
and in(cid:143) uencing its development (Moore et al. 1991, Shary et al. 1991, Florinsky

1998 ). Determination of a grid size is required in a combined analysis of DTMs and
data on other landscape components (Moore et al. 1993, Quinn et al. 1995, Florinsky
and Kuryakova 1996 ). Statistical characteristics of DTMs and the generalisation
level of maps of topographic variables essentially depend on w (Evans 1980, Band
and Moore 1995, Thompson and Moore 1996). Determination of w is generally
solved by expert estimation (Anderson and Burt 1980, Moore et al. 1993) and so,
solutions can be subjective. Besides, arbitrary choice of w can result in incorrect
results and artefacts. For example, Speight (1980) did not (cid:142) nd a relationship between
soil moisture and kh because in his study it was too small (Anderson and Burt 1980 ).
Sinai et al. (1981) did not observe a correlation between soil salinisation and H.
They explained the failure by w being too great and an incorrect choice of the study
scale. In hydrological modelling based on T I, the average depth of the watertable
decreases and the overland run-oŒincreases when w increases (Wolock and Price
1994 ). The use of T I calculated with w 5 4 m can result in the correct prediction of
the watertable depth, while totally invalid prediction can be obtained using T I
calculated with w 5 16 m (Thompson and Moore 1996 ). Furthermore, slopes of
DTM-based hydrographs essentially depend on w (Da Ros and Borga 1997).

Therefore, a correct choice of w is one of the main problems of DTM-based
landscape investigations. However, the development of a method for an impartial
determination of an adequate w remains an open question. In this paper, we present
an experimental statistical method for the determination of an adequate w.
Possibilities of the method proposed are exempli(cid:142) ed by the topographic in(cid:143) uence
on the spatial distribution of sur(cid:142) cial soil moisture at a micro-scale.

2. Theory

We propose an experimental statistical method for determination of an
adequate w. The method is largely based on some principles of a conception of
(representative) elementary volume used in mass transfer description, in particular,
in hydrogeological studies (e.g. Sitnikov 1978, 1980 ). Some principles of this concep-
tion can be applied to solve a wide range of two-dimensional problems of geosciences
if one switches from elementary volume to (representative) elementary area (e.g. Wood
et al. 1988 ).

Assume that a response ((cid:142) gure 1(a)) describes the variation in the value of some
landscape property (e.g. a rock property) with the volume or area for which the
property is observed (Sitnikov 1978, 1980). Within the interval 1 the large extent of
variability of property values can be a result of some pronounced spatial heterogen-
eity, for example, pore eŒects. Property values smoothly vary from the volume or
. Then another distinct spatial heterogeneity (e.g. macro-cracks) leads
area V
to abrupt variations of property values within the interval 3. Again, property values
smoothly vary from the volume or area V

3
By the elementary volume or area we mean a minimum volume or area where
a property is independent of heterogeneities, that is, the property values vary
smoothly, or have a small variability (Sitnikov 1978, 1980). For instance, V
and V
3
are elementary volumes or areas for the given abstract property ((cid:142) gure 1(a)).
Therefore, in some natural conditions for a landscape property one can distinguish
a set of elementary volumes or areas connected with several intervals of smoothed
relationships between property values and volume or area. Sometimes, intervals of
smoothed variation of a landscape property cannot be found due to individual
factors of natural processes as well as measurement errors (Sitnikov 1978, 1980).

An elementary volume or area can also depend on time through temporal
variability of landscape properties ((cid:142) gure 1(b)) (Sitnikov 1978, 1980). In addition, an
elementary volume or area of some property can depend on speci(cid:142) c natural condi-
tions. If a terrain includes heterogeneous patches, then a landscape property can be
characterised by diŒerent elementary volumes or areas within adjacent patches. For
example, assume that a terrain consists of three heterogeneous patches A, B and C.
Assume that dependencies of property values on volume or area are smooth within
intervals 1, 2 and 3 in patches A, B and C, correspondingly ((cid:142) gure 1(c)). Therefore,
in patches A, B and C,
a property has elementary volumes or areas V
respectively. If one can (cid:142) nd borders between the patches, it is desirable to study this
property separately within each of the patches. However, one can observe the interval
4 wherein property values have low variability within all three patches ((cid:142) gure 1(c)).
. It can be used as the common
The elementary volume or area of this interval is V
elementary volume or area for the overall terrain (Sitnikov 1978, 1980, Kershaw and
Looney 1985 ).

volumes or areas wherein property values smoothly vary, or have a constant value.
Value variability can be ignored if it is not exceeded by investigation accuracy
(Sitnikov 1980). For example, intervals 2 and 4 are adequate intervals of volumes
or areas for the abstract landscape property discussed above ((cid:142) gure 1(a)). Adequate
intervals of volumes or areas should be used for observations of landscape properties.
Otherwise, one can obtain non-reproducible and poorly interpretable results due to
large and unpredictable variability of property values within inadequate intervals of
volumes or areas.

By the adequate volume or area we mean a volume or an area belonging to an
adequate interval of volumes or areas (Sitnikov 1978, 1980). By the adequate grid
size we mean a grid size corresponding to an adequate area. With the Kotelnikov
f (x, y) with border frequen-
theorem (Korn and Korn 1968 ), a continuous function f 5
cies Fx 5 Fy 5 1/s can be uniquely determined by its values with sampling step s/2
where s is the smallest planimetric size of elements of the surface f 5
f (x, y) of interest
to a user. Therefore, if s2 is the adequate area of a landscape property, then s/2 is
the adequate grid size relating to s2 and providing adequate description of this
property.

An adequate grid size can be de(cid:142) ned by (a) measurement of a landscape property
at grid nodes using diŒerent grid sizes, and (b) plotting values measured against grid
sizes (similarly to (cid:142) gure 1(a)). Smoothed portions of this plot will indicate intervals
of adequate grid sizes (Sitnikov 1980). On determination of the adequate grid size,
one can readily evaluate a related adequate area of a landscape property (see above).
In a combined analysis of two landscape properties and in a prediction of one
property by an analysis of the other property, one should work in an adequate
interval of areas, which is common to both properties. Values of both properties are
constant or smoothly vary within this interval, by de(cid:142) nition of the adequate interval
(see above). Therefore, correlation coe(cid:141) cients between values of two properties can
also smoothly vary within the common adequate interval. At the same time, one can
observe large variability of correlation between two properties within adjacent inad-
equate intervals marked by large variability of property values. So, to determine a
common adequate interval of areas and grid sizes providing an adequate combined
study of two properties, one should (a) analyse the correlation between these proper-
ties observed with diŒerent grid sizes, and (b) plot correlation coe(cid:141) cients obtained
versus grid sizes. A smoothed portion of this plot can indicate an interval of adequate
grid sizes and hence an adequate interval of areas which is common to both landscape
properties.

By the adequate w we mean the adequate grid size if a topographic variable
described as a DTM is one of two landscape properties under study. The adequate
area corresponding to the adequate w determines a typical size of landforms providing
a topographic control of a landscape property concerned. To de(cid:142) ne the adequate w
one should carry out the following procedures:

E To derive a set of DTMs using a series of wi;
E To perform a correlation analysis of data on a landscape property and a

topographic variable estimated with various wi;

E To plot correlation coe(cid:141) cients between the landscape property and the

topographic variable versus wi;

E To determine smoothed portions of the plot obtained which indicate intervals

of adequate wi.

There are three main variants for implementation of the method proposed

depending to formats of initial data:

1. DEM and data on landscape property are obtained using coincident square
grids with grid size of w. One can then derive a set of digital models of a
topographic variable concerned from the DEM by accessible methods (Evans
1980, Quinn et al. 1995) using grid sizes of w, 2w, 3w,
..., nw where n is an
integer. Then one should analyse a correlation between the landscape property
and the topographic variable using samples with grid sizes of w, 2w, 3w, ..., nw.
2. DEM and data on landscape property are obtained using distinct grids and
then interpolated (Watson 1992) to a common square grid with a grid size
of w. Further steps are the same as in the (cid:142) rst variant.

3. DEM and data on landscape property are obtained using distinct grids, and
spatial interpolation of data on landscape property is undesirable or impossible
(e.g. landscape data are collected along a transect or a contour—§4). One
should (a) produce several DEMs with diŒerent wi by interpolation (Watson
(b) derive a topographic variable concerned from these DEMs,
1992 ),
(c) interpolate values of the topographic variable calculated with diŒerent wi
for points in which the landscape property was observed, and (d ) analyse a
correlation between the landscape property and the topographic variable
calculated with diŒerent wi.

From the viewpoint of minimisation of interpolation errors (Watson 1992), the
(cid:142) rst variant of the method of implementation is the best since interpolation is not
used. Next is the third variant in which one should interpolate only DTMs. The
second variant including interpolation of both DTMs and data on landscape property
may result in the greatest frequency of interpolation errors. In this study, we used
the third variant of
implementation of the method due to the format of initial
data (§4 ).

DiŒerent topographic variables can be connected with landscape processes of
diŒerent scales (Anderson and Burt 1980, Florinsky and Kuryakova 1996). Thus, a
landscape property can be ‘controlled’ by diŒerent topographic attributes at diŒerent
adequate areas. Therefore, diŒerent topographic variables can oŒer diŒerent adequate
wi suited for each landscape property. In landscape studies, particularly in the
determination of a regression equation for dependence of a landscape property on
topographic variables, it is desirable to (cid:142) nd the ‘main’ interval of an adequate w
common to all topographic variables under consideration. Obviously, it makes sense
to perform a regression analysis only with an adequate w of this interval.

3. Study site

The study site is located at the centre of the East European Plain, to the south
of the Moscow Region, Russia, near the City of Pushchino ((cid:142) gure 2). It is a zone of
a temperate continental climate with warm summers and prolonged cold winters.
January and July average temperatures are Õ 10ß C and 18.6ß C, correspondingly.
Precipitation is about 640 mm per year, of which 350–450 mm are rainfall.

The site is situated on the soddy and partially forested landslide macroslope of
the valley of the Oka River. Elevations are about 130 m above sea level. The
macroslope is characterised by an average gradient of 10ß and a northerly aspect.
Middle Carboniferous fractured and karsti(cid:142) ed limestone lie at a depth of about 6 m.

Quaternary loams cover them. Groundwater lies at a depth of about 6 m (Lyubashin
and Lisitsin 1981).

The study site measures about 58 by 77 m and includes a part of a north-striking
gully; variation in altitude is about 15 m ((cid:142) gure 3(b)). The soil complex includes grey

forest soils on crests and slopes, and meadow hydromorphi c soils in the valley
bottom. Vegetation cover consists of birches and herbs on crests, hazels and common
horsetails on slopes, and nettles in the valley bottom. There is signi(cid:142) cant diversity
of topographic variables and moistening of the soil cover within a small area of the
study site.

4. Materials and methods

We obtained an irregular DEM of the study site by a tacheometric survey with
a tacheometer TaN. The irregular DEM consists of 374 points ((cid:142) gure 3(a)). It is
constructed in a relative Cartesian co-ordinate system and in a local elevation system.
We used the minimal value of the landsurface elevation within the study site as the
local datum ((cid:142) gure 3(b)).

To estimate sur(cid:142) cial soil moisture (M) we carried out a soil survey on 20 June
1990. Precipitation was about 60 mm from 1–20 June 1990 in Pushchino and
suburb. There was drizzling rain (about 2 mm) on the eve of the soil survey. To
prevent a signi(cid:142) cant in(cid:143) uence of evaporation on M we performed the soil survey in
the morning within one hour at the air temperature of 20–22ß C. The soil survey
included sampling at 62 points (all included in the irregular DEM) which are located
along the 4.25 m contour ((cid:142) gure 3(c)). These points are rather evenly distributed
along the contour with a distance ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 m. To the west side of the
gully, three larger distances correspond to two tree-falls and a track ((cid:142) gure 3(c)). We
took three soil samples at each of the 62 points at a depth of about 0.1 m (altogether,
there were 186 samples). We evaluated M for each of these samples by weighing pre-
and post-drying samples on an analytical damper balance ADV-200. Drying of
samples was carried out by a drying box 2V-151 for 12 hours at 100ß C (Arinushkina
1962 ). To reduce in(cid:143) uence of random deviations of M values, we used the arithmetic
mean of M for the three samples collected in each of 62 points as net values of M
((cid:142) gure 4).

We carried out soil sampling along one contour to eliminate apparent in(cid:143) uence
of elevation (h) on M from consideration. Obviously, actual in(cid:143) uence of h on M
observed in mountainous regions due to the altitudinal zonality cannot occur within
the study site. G, A, kh, kv, H, and CA are responsible for physical mechanisms of
distribution and redistribution of moisture in landscapes (table 1). Dependence of
M on h observed in plain landscapes is in fact a result of the in(cid:143) uence of CA on M.

This is because h is not responsible in itself for physical mechanisms of gravity-
driven moisture movement (table 1). However, h is taken into account in the
calculation of CA in a hidden form (Quinn et al. 1995 ).

We chose the contour of 4.25 m because (a) it passes over the main landforms
within the site: two crests, slopes, and the gully bottom ((cid:142) gure 3(b) and (c)), and (b)
it is suitable for the soil survey because higher elevation slopes are too steep. Notice
that although we used distinct grids for the soil and topographic surveys, in the
general case it is desirable to use identical grids (ideally, square grids) for these
purposes.

Using the Delaunay triangulation and a piecewise smooth interpolation (Watson
1992 ) of the irregular DEM, we produced 13 square-gridded DEMs with the follow-
ing wi (in brackets are numbers of points in regular DEMs): 1 m (3312), 1.5 m (1421 ),
2 m (742), 2.5 m (461), 3 m (301), 3.5 m (202), 4 m (152), 4.5 m (110), 5 m (85), 5.5 m
(63), 6 m (48), 6.5 m (35), and 7 m (31). We decided on this range of w from the
following reasons. To estimate local topographic variables one has to calculate the
(cid:142) rst and the second derivaties of elevation (Evans 1980, Shary 1991, 1995). These
calculations increase errors of DEM compilation and interpolation (Giles and
Franklin 1996). Our experience and preliminary testing of the irregular DEM of the
study site ((cid:142) gure 3(a) and (b)) suggest that these errors can be ignored, in this case,
when w> 1 m. Considering the size of the study site, w 5 7 m is the maximum w
which can be used to derive local topographic variables. Dw 5 0.5 m was of interest,
and its use allowed us to determine the adequate w for the study study (§5).

Digital models of G, kh, kv and H were derived from all 13 regular DEMs by the
method of Evans (1980 ) ((cid:142) gure 5). Altogether, we produced 52 regular DTMs. Then
we used the Delaunay triangulation and a piecewise smooth interpolation (Watson
1992 ) of these 52 regular DTMs to determine values of G, kh , kv and H corresponding
to planimetric co-ordinate s of the 62 points on the 4.25 m contour.

To determine an adequate w and to estimate the dependence of M on topographic
variables we carried out a linear multiple correlation analysis of M with G, kh , kv
and H calculated for the 13 values of wi. 62-point samples were used for DTMs
with w 5 1,
..., 5 m, 59-point samples for DTMs with w 5 5.5 and 6.5 m, 56-point
samples for DTMs with w 5 6 m, and 53-point samples for DTMs with w 5 7 m
( border eŒects were omitted ). With the method proposed (§2), we presented the
dependence of correlation coe(cid:141) cients on w in the form of plots for G, kh , kv and H.
To describe an eŒect of topography on the distribution of M, the ‘best’ combination
of topographic variables was chosen by the stepwise linear regression (Aivazyan
et al. 1985). We used the 62-point samples corresponding to the two adequate wi
determined (§5 ) for regression analysis.

We did not study the in(cid:143) uence of A on M since the study site is located (a) on
a macroscope with a uniform northerly aspect, and (b) in forest where sunlight is
diŒused by trees. Therefore, we can consider A as a background (cid:142) xed value in the
study site, although the dependence of M on A is generally apparent (Zakharov
1940 ). In addition, we did not study the in(cid:143) uence of CA on M since we did not
perform the tacheometric survey for a gully head and derivation of CA from DEMs
without data on catchment heads can lead to invalid results.

We applied the software Landlord 2.0 (Florinsky et al. 1995) for the irregular
DEM interpolation, topographic variables’ calculation and mapping ((cid:142) gures 3 and 5).
Correlation and regression analyses were carried out with Statgraphics 2.6.

5. Results and discussion

Results of the correlation analysis are presented in table 2. Figure 6 gives plots
of correlation coe(cid:141) cients between M and G, kh, kv and H versus w. As expected,
these plots include some portions of smoothed variation of correlation coe(cid:141) cients
with w as well as some portions of large variability of this relationship ((cid:142) gure 6). All
four plots present two main portions: the left portion ( between w 5 1 m and w$4 m)
with relatively smoothed variations, and the right portion ( between w$4 m and w 5
7 m) with pronounced (cid:143) uctuations. With the method developed (§2), using smoothed
portions of the plots obtained as indicators of adequate intervals of w we can
distinguish:

E The adequate interval W

for H, kv and kh ranging between w$2.25 and

E The adequate interval W

for G, H, kv and kh, ranging between w$2.25 and

w$4 m, and

w$3.25 m.

Figure 6. Correlation between sur(cid:142) cial soil moisture and topographic variables versus w.

W

is the ‘main’ adequate interval of w because all correlations peak there (except
‘spurious’ correlations of M with G for w 5 4.5 and 6 m— see explanation below).
For example, for w 5 3 m correlation coe(cid:141) cients of M with G, kh , kv and H are
Õ 0.28, Õ 0.52, Õ 0.50 and Õ 0.60, respectively (table 2).

Generally, these results conform to established data on the topographic control
of soil moisture. Indeed, as G increases, velocity of water (cid:143) ow and slope area increase,
so the rainfall received per unit area and its in(cid:142) ltration decrease, while the runoŒ
and evaporation area increase, and hence soil moisture decreases (Zakharov 1940 ).
In addition, the soil moisture and the lateral intrasoil (cid:143) ow of the saturated zone
increase when kh < 0 (areas of (cid:143) ow convergence) and decrease when kh > 0 (areas of
(cid:143) ow divergence) (Kirkby and Chorley 1967). Besides, kh in(cid:143) uences hydrological
processes within unsaturated rocks: streamlines diverge when kh > 0 and converge
when kh < 0 (Zaslavsky and Rogowski 1969). Saturation zones and source areas of
overland (cid:143) ow correlate with landforms where both kh and kv have negative values
(areas of (cid:143) ow convergence and relative declaration, correspondingly) owing to
increased soil moistening (Wood et al. 1990, Feranec et al. 1991). It is reasonable
that we observed the strongest correlation between M and H: H is a half-sum of kh
and kv, that is, H presents kh and kv with equal weights (table 1). Therefore, H can
be more a representative topographic attribute than kh and kv in relation to descrip-
tion of landscape processes. The high linear correlation (Õ 0.9) of M with H was
observed by Sinai et al. (1981) in the arid climate and the (cid:143) at topography of Israel
deserts. These authors suggested that this dependence is the result of topographic
control on the intrasoil lateral water movement rather than the redistribution of
overland water (cid:143) ows by microtopograph y since the latest process is not typical for
the landscape concerned. Correlation coe(cid:141) cients relevant to adequate wi (table 2)
testify that M depends on landsurface curvatures largely than G within the study
site. So, M is controlled predominantly by convergence and relative deceleration of
overland and intrasoil water (cid:143) ows.

Intervals of inadequate wi diŒer greatly in appearance from adequate intervals
of wi: there are drastic variations of the dependence of correlation coe(cid:141) cients on
w ((cid:142) gure 6). Besides, within the inadequate interval of wi (between w$4 m and
w 5 7 m) correlations of M with kh and H are much lower than within the main
adequate interval ((cid:142) gure 6 and table 2). Moreover, within this inadequate interval

of wi we observe positive correlations between M and G, and not just (cid:143) uctuations
of the associated plot ((cid:142) gure 6 and table 2). This is the evident artefact caused by
the use of an inadequate w. Indeed, the moisture of the soil cover decreases when G
increases (see above). So, if there is a dependence of M on G in the given conditions
and scale, correlation coe(cid:141) cients between M and G can take only negative values,
as we found for w 5 1–3.5 m (table 2 and (cid:142) gure 6). This demonstrate s the importance
of the correct determination of w to the validity of an investigation. In addition, this
is a pictorial example of how one may obtain invalid conclusions using statistics
only, without realisation of the physical expression of topographic variables and
relationships between topography and landscape processes.

Results of the regression analysis are presented in table 3. We obtained regression
equations for two adequate w 5 2.5 m and 3 m. In both cases, G and H entered the
equations as independent variables. We suppose that kh and kv did not enter the equa-
tions since H presents these topographic attributes with equal weights (table 1). The
regression equations describe 45% and 39% of variability in M for w 5 2.5 m and
w 5 3 m, respectively (table 3). These R2 values are not high. Possibly, this is because
we did not analyse the dependence of M on CA eŒecting essentially the spatial
distribution of soil moisture (Zakharov 1940, Speight 1980). CA describes quantitat-
ively the three-dimensional position of a point on a slope (slope length describes a
position of a point on a slope for a two-dimensional case). We did not use CA data
since derivation of CA from DEMs without data on catchment heads can lead to
invalid results (§4).

One may use regression equations (table 3) in DTM-based predictive mapping
of M using associated adequate wi. Data on M can be useful, for instance, in
predicting the evaporation from the soil surface (Camillo and Gurney 1986 ) and
modelling the soil water balance (Bruckler and Witono 1989). Predictive mapping
of M using DTM-based regression equations can be valuable, in particular, in
forested terrains where other techniques of M evaluating (e.g. radar survey, Bruckler
and Witono 1989) are complicated to apply.

The method developed allows one to estimate not only adequate wi, but an
adequate area of landforms ‘realising’ a topographic control of landscape properties
as well. From the relation between an adequate area and an adequate grid size (§2 ),
the adequate area of landforms controlling M lie in the range from 20 to 40 m2
within the study site. Notice that the adequate w$3 m is close to w 5 4 m providing
a correct prediction of the watertable depth using T I (Thompson and Moore 1996 ).
This can indicate that the topographic control of some soil-hydrological processes
occurs on landforms with the adequate area ranging between 36 and 64 m2 in

subboreal regions. Therefore, 3–4 m may be suitable values of the adequate w for
DTM-based soil and hydrological studies in these climatic conditions.

Notice that one should use the adequate wi found with caution in soil moisture
studies in other terrains and at other scales because the study site is too small.
However, the results obtained demonstrate that the method actually works to identify
adequate wi, at least at a micro-scale. We suppose that the method can be used in
other types and sizes of terrains without fundamental problems. Some di(cid:141) culties
can arise if a large study area includes some heterogeneous patches, which may be
marked by dissimilar relations between topography and a landscape property. In
this case, it is desirable to apply the method to each patch separately and to determine
adequate wi for each patch.

A weakness of the method proposed is subjectivity of the partititon of the
correlation coe(cid:141) cient curves into adequate and inadequate (smooth and variable)
intervals. This is because these curves have no clear-cut ‘boundaries’ between adjacent
intervals. This weakness can be (cid:142) xed using some thresholds for an increment or a
decrement of a function describing a dependence of correlation coe(cid:141) cients on w.
The other bottleneck of the method is the choice of the minimum w and Dw.
Analysing the plots obtained ((cid:142) gure 6), it is not di(cid:141) cult to see that if we used Dw 5
1 m, we would not (cid:142) nd (cid:143) uctuations of the dependence of correlation coe(cid:141) cients on
w within the right inadequate interval of wi (between w$4 m and w 5 7 m). Using
Dw 5 1 m, these (cid:143) uctuations cannot be found with the minimum w of both 1 m and
1.5 m (although these plots would diŒer noticeably from one another). Based on the
results obtained, we suppose that for a minimum w one should use w such that
DTM errors caused by calculation of elevation derivatives (§4) can be ignored. Dw
should be less than a half of the minimum w.

It is conceivable that plots of correlation coe(cid:141) cients between a landscape property
and topographic attributes versus w may include smoothed portions, but correlations
may be very low in absolute magnitude. This result may demonstrate that while the
landscape property is in(cid:143) uenced by landforms with typical sizes related to intervals
of adequate wi, this is a slight dependence.

In this work, we used a linear correlation analysis (§4). However, it is more likely
that actual relatinships between topography and other landscape components have
a non-linear character. Besides, statistical distributions of topographic variables are
slightly diŒerent from normality (Evans 1980 ). Therefore, it can be more correct not
to work with coe(cid:141) cients but with indices of correlation (Aivazyan et al. 1985 ).

We did not study a dependence of the adequate wi on time (§2) because we have
no data on the dynamics of M within the study site. This is a subject of further
investigations.

6. Conclusions

1. We developed an experimental statistical method to determine adequate wi for
digital terrain modelling in landscape studies. The method includes the following
steps: (a) derive a set of DTMs using a series of wi, (b) perform a correlation analysis
of data on a landscape property and a topographic variable estimated with various
wi, (c) plot correlation coe(cid:141) cients obtained versus w, and (d ) determine smoothed
plot portions indicating intervals of adequate wi.

2. With the method developed, the interval of adequate wi for M falls in the
range between 2.25 and 3.25 m in the study site. In absolute magnitudes, correlation

coe(cid:141) cients peak within this interval. In particular, correlation coe(cid:141) cients of M with
G, kh, kv and H are Õ 0.28, Õ 0.52, Õ 0.50 and Õ 0.60, correspondingly, for w 5 3 m.
3. The method developed allows one to estimate an adequate area of landforms
landscape properties. The adequate area of

‘realising’ a topographic control of
landforms controlling M lie in the range from 20 to 40 m2 within the study site.

4. The results obtained demonstrate that the method actually works to identify
adequate wi, at least at a micro-scale, and may improve impartiality of DTM-based
landscape investigations.

The growing body of knowledge on modeling land use systems points to epistemic
uncertainty as one of the challenging obstacles in development and application of agent-
based models (ABMs). To decrease outcome uncertainty, sensitivity analysis (SA) is
performed as part of model verification and validation. Oftentimes, however, it is
inadequately addressed, partly because of the lack of tools and techniques that focus on
an explicit evaluation of ABM dynamics. The nonlinear processes, inherent in such
models, necessitate longitudinal SA with time path investigation of input–output relation-
ships of endogenous variables. In response to the outlined deficiencies, this study
investigates the potential of time-dependent global sensitivity analysis (time-GSA) in
examining the dynamics of outcome uncertainty of a simple ABM of land use change.
Specifically, we apply first and total order sensitivity indices to decompose variance of
output landscape fragmentation, apportioned to model inputs for multiple time steps and
multiple realizations of the ABM. We focus the analysis on selected complex systems
characteristics including preference uncertainty, path dependence, access to information,
and magnitude of interactions and feedbacks. We conclude that the factor sensitivity
measures vary significantly during model execution. Consequently, a static snapshot of
ABM sensitivity, taken at the end of the simulation, is inadequate when deciding on factor
prioritization and reduction. Assuming that ABM dynamics is a result of factor interac-
tion, we observe a distinct time lag of nonlinearity, which unfolds after the formation of
the seeds of development. Therefore, we argue for further application of time-GSA in
ABM as one of the visual quantitative techniques contributing to evaluation of ABM
nonlinearity.

Introduction

The complexity of land use systems (LUS) originates from interplay of many elements and
elemental drivers (Claessens et al. 2009) that form a network of reciprocal relationships
resulting in nonlinearities, path dependence, and feedbacks across scale, time, and space
(Verburg 2006, Liu et al. 2007, Bennett and McGinnis 2008, Parker et al. 2008). LUS
complexity imposes a number of challenges to long-term policy making and spatial knowl-
edge discovery. At the same time we recognize the pressing issues of unsustainable growth,
which is a consequence of poorly managed land. To address these challenges, we often

employ agent-based models (ABMs), in which LUS actors like humans, organizations, and
institutions are modeled using individual entities that interact with each other and change
their common land use through direct and indirect impact (Parker et al. 2003, Bousquet and
Le Page 2004, Matthews et al. 2007).

ABMs are inevitably prone to epistemic sources of uncertainty reflecting our poor
knowledge of the processes and data describing the system (Helton and Burmaster 1996,
Saltelli et al. 1999). This uncertainty imposes one of the major obstacles in developing fully
functional models. As Verburg (2006) and others point out, feedbacks in land use change
systems cause strong model dependence on initial conditions, which calls for novel techni-
ques of sensitivity analysis (SA), tailored to exploration of many possible land use trajec-
tories (Oreskes et al. 1994, Manson 2001, Brown et al. 2005).

The application of SA to ABM verification and validation is not new (Becu et al. 2003,
An et al. 2005, Castella et al. 2005, Brown and Robinson 2006, Burke et al. 2006, Li and Liu
2007, Schluter and Pahl-Wostl 2007, Brown et al. 2008, Mosler and Martens 2008, Topping
et al. 2010). Oftentimes, however, it is inadequately addressed, partly because of the lack of
tools and techniques that focus on an explicit evaluation of ABM dynamics (Parker et al.
2003, Richiardi et al. 2006). Apart from explaining empirical regularities, complex systems
models should allow for identifying the most important mechanisms of change that are hard
to observe in the field (Brugnach 2005, Verburg et al. 2006, Brugnach et al., 2008, Irwin
et al. 2009). Consequently, the nonlinear processes, inherent in LUS models, necessitate
longitudinal SA with time path investigation of input–output relationships of endogenous
variables (Parker et al. 2003).

In response to the outlined deficiencies in SA as practiced in land use ABMs, we propose
to use time-dependent global sensitivity analysis (time-GSA), in the form of time series of
sensitivity indices. Our approach borrows from research on GSA undertaken by Saltelli and
colleagues (Saltelli et al. 1999, 2000, Crosetto and Tarantola 2001, Gomez-Delgado and
Tarantola 2006, Lilburne and Tarantola 2009). Traditionally, SA has been performed by
evaluating the changes in final model results because of input perturbations. Contrary to this
common approach, time-GSA opens possibilities to address a new kind of questions: What
are the dynamics of model sensitivity to input factor variability? To what extent does the
model behave nonlinearly? Are there any regions in the time series of sensitivities where a
particular input variable dominates the others? Which input parameters contribute toward
model stability? What combinations of thresholds make the model switch from one regime
to another? Consequently, the major advantage of time-GSA, as presented in this study, is the
possibility of examining parameter sensitivity throughout model execution as opposed to
‘final time step’ testing.

In the following sections, we report on variance-based time-GSA of a simple ABM of
residential land use. We focus the analysis on selected complex systems characteristics
including: (a) preference variability related to three landscape attributes, (b) spatial path
dependence (Manson 2001, Brown et al. 2005), (c) magnitude of interactions defined by
agent population size, (d) access to information, represented by the size of the sample of
developable locations known to agents, and (e) the magnitude of agent–environment
feedbacks.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes the founda-
tions of variance-based GSA. Section 3 outlines the ABM model used in this study. What
follows is a description of spatial data sets and experiments designed to compare and contrast
the impact of input perturbations on the dynamics of the generated land use pattern. In the
final section we summarize the results of time-GSA and conclude the article by discussing
future research challenges.

2. Variance-based global sensitivity analysis

Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) studies the variability of model outputs because of a broad
range of simultaneous perturbations in the whole set of uncertain input factors, which are
examined independently and in combinations (Campolongo et al. 2000). GSA derives from
numerical predictive modeling and experimental science and has been used in conjunction
with equation-based models in the aspatial context (Saltelli et al. 2000, Saisana et al. 2005,
Ziehn and Tomlin 2009, Varella et al. 2010) as well as GIS-based applications (Crosetto
et al. 2000, Tarantola et al. 2002, Gomez-Delgado and Tarantola 2006, Lilburne and
Tarantola 2009).

Various GSA approaches have been proposed and evaluated (Campolongo et al. 2000).
Here we utilize variance-based GSA, which obviates the assumptions of linearity inherent in
regression-based approaches that are ill-suited for dynamic complex system modeling
(Manson 2007). Variance-based GSA decomposes the variance (V) of model output appor-
tioned to changes in k model inputs that are represented singly (Vi) and in combinations with an
increasing level of dimensionality (Saisana et al. 2005, Gomez-Delgado and Tarantola 2006):

V ¼ P
i

Vi þ P

Vij þ P

i<j

i<j<m

Vijm þ (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) þ V12...k

For example, Vij represents the sensitivity of model output Y to the interaction between
inputs Xi and Xj; Vijm is the share in the overall sensitivity of the model explained by the
interaction among Xi, Xj, and Xm, and so forth. Such defined variance is further used to
calculate first-order (Si) and total-effect (STi) indices for every input parameter i (where
i = 1, . . ., k):

(cid:4)
½
V ðY Þ

¼ Si þ Sij þ Sim þ Sijm þ (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) þ Sij...k

(3)

Si quantifies a fractional contribution of an uncertain factor i to V taken independently
from the other k - 1 factors. STi is used to find the overall contribution of a given input i
including its interaction with other inputs (Homma and Saltelli 1996). VX(cid:3)i½EXiðY jX(cid:3)iÞ(cid:4)
stands for the total contribution of conditional variance of Y because of all non-i inputs so
that STi includes first-order and higher order terms that involve factor i (Saisana et al. 2005).
To calculate Si and STi we will use extended Sobol estimation procedure described in
Saltelli (2002) and Lilburne and Tarantola (2009), which is available in SimLab (http://
simlab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). As we focus on time-variant GSA, we will compute normalized Si
and STi for every time step of model execution, effectively creating a time series of output
variance sensitivity. The interpretation of the pairs of indices (Si, STi) is summarized in Table 1.

2.1. Experimental procedure

To explore the land use ABM with time-GSA based on Sobol experimental design, the
following steps are performed for any given computational experiment (Saisana et al. 2005,

form of landscape pattern metrics.

3. Agent-based model of residential land use change

The ABM presented in this research (Figure 1) is a simplified implementation of a real estate
development process as outlined in Barrett and Blair (1988), focusing on site suitability
assessment and investment decisions. The ABM is a discrete time stochastic model of
decentralized decision making, composed of a cellular space (landscape) and developer

agents, who are the major driving force of land use change. Three landscape attribute maps
are utilized in agent decision process: land value representing the economic characteristics
of the local property market, scenic (natural) beauty symbolizing the natural amenities of the
area under consideration, and accessibility to already developed locations measured as
Euclidean distance (Brown et al. 2005, Ligmann-Zielinska 2009). The agents are equipped
with preferences for the three landscape attributes. They make their decisions using an ideal
point aggregation function (outlined below), followed by ordered choice heuristics
(Benenson and Torrens 2004). In case of conflict over a piece of land, a simple rank-based
bidding is employed to assign the parcel to one of the competing agents.

3.1. Agent decision process

Each agent enters the landscape at the beginning of the simulation, draws a sample of
developable locations, and evaluates them using an ideal point (IP) decision rule (Hwang
and Yoon 1981, Malczewski 1999):

(1) For every standardized landscape attribute map, an agent finds the best and the worst

values within the lattice, which are respectively called an ideal and a nadir

(2) The agent calculates gains and losses for the attributes:

A_ gainxy ¼ Axy (cid:3) A^

A_lossxy ¼ Axy (cid:3) A(cid:5)

where

A_ gainxy is a gain for attribute A at location xy
Aˆ is the nadir within the whole attribute A layer
A_lossxy is a loss for attribute A at location xy
A* is the ideal within the whole attribute A layer
Axy is the value of attribute A at location xy

(3) The agent calculates the separations from ideals and nadirs:

S(cid:5)
dxy ¼

wdA · A_lossxy

(cid:3)2

S^dxy ¼

wdA · A_ gainxy

!0:5

(cid:5)2

where

wdA is developer agent’s d preference (weight) for attribute A
S(cid:5)
dxy is the separation from ideal for agent d at location xy
S^dxy is the separation from nadir for agent d at location xy
(4) Finally, agent d calculates the utility (Udxy) of location xy:

Udxy ¼

S^dxy
S^dxy þ S(cid:5)
dxy

(4)

Applying IP for site utility calculation allows for an explicit representation of reference
frames (ideals and nadirs) in decision making, which is consistent with the theory of choice
psychology (Tversky and Kahneman 1981). The IP decision rule belongs to the category of
multi-attribute utility techniques and, unlike weighted linear combination, does not require
the evaluation attributes to be independent.

Based on the utilities, the agent compiles an investment set by ordering the sampled sites
from the best one to the worst one. Starting from the highest scoring site, the agent picks the
desired (demanded) number of sites and creates a pending investment plan. When a site is
selected by more than one developer agent, a rank-based bidding rule is invoked, in which
the site of conflict is assigned to an agent who ranked the site the highest. When this is the
case, the other competing agents lose the site from their investment plans. To compensate for
their missing demands, these agents revisit their investment sets and choose additional sites
to update their investment plans. This process continues until all conflicts are resolved and
all demands are allocated to sites, which are then converted to developed land.

3.2. Agent–environment feedback
Agents’ decisions cause a number of reciprocal changes in the environment (Verburg 2006).
The ABM presented in this study emulates such feedback using a cellular automata-based
approach (Manson 2001). First and foremost, the land use undergoes change because of the
conversion of an undeveloped area to a developed one. Moreover, two decision attributes,
namely, land value and scenic beauty, are updated as a result of property development.
Specifically, the development has a positive impact on land value and a negative impact on
scenic beauty. The explicit feedbacks are represented as a ratio of change in the nearest
neighborhood of every developed cell.

The land value is increased using the following formula:

Vnðt þ 1Þ ¼ VnðtÞ þ IlvVp; "n 2 Np

(5)

where V is the land value attribute, p is a developed parcel, and n is the neighboring cell of p.
Therefore, with every time step passed, every n, located in the neighborhood of p, increases
its land value by a fraction Ilv of p’s land value. In this study, we assume that Np is a 3 · 3
Moore neighborhood, and Ilv is in the range [0.0, 1.0]. If the updated land value exceeds 1.0,
we set it to 1.0, which is the maximum possible score for all of the standardized attribute
maps. Increasing Ilv enhances the positive effect that the development has on the land value
of adjacent locations. Observe that the new value is directly influenced by the development.
Moreover, for n with more than one adjacent p, its land value increases by Ilv of each adjacent
p, symbolizing a cumulative effect of neighborhood development.

Similar to land value, scenic beauty is also updated within the neighborhood of s:

Bnðt þ 1Þ ¼ BnðtÞ (cid:3) DsbBp; "n 2 Np

(6)

where B is the scenic beauty attribute. Therefore, with every time step passed, every n,
located in the neighborhood of p, decreases its scenic beauty score by a fraction Dsb of p’s

1835

scenic beauty. We assume that Dsb is in the range [0.0, 1.0]. If the updated scenic beauty falls
below 0.0, we set it to 0.0, which is the minimum possible score for all of the standardized
layers of this model. Obviously, increasing Dsb intensifies the negative impact of develop-
ment on scenic beauty of adjacent locations. Every n with more than one adjacent p
decreases its beauty by a fraction Dsb of each bordering p, symbolizing a cumulative effect
of the whole neighboring development.

We assume for simplicity that the feedback coefficients are constant over time. In reality, it
would be more appropriate to introduce attenuating feedbacks, represented as exponential decay
functions, in which Ilv and Dsb decrease with time that passed since the development took place.

4. Landscape and input parameter values

The purpose of this study is to illustrate the utility of time-GSA using 11 computational
experiments. To gain full control over experimentation, we employ a highly stylized
environment composed of 14,641 cells (121 · 121) and initialized with two landscape
attribute maps depicted in Figure 2.

Preferred locations are represented by darker shades. Consequently, the land value layer
scores highest in the center of the map, whereas the scenic beauty is composed of hot spot
and cold spot value clusters. To reduce exogenous path dependence, the input land use map
is set to undeveloped for every cell in the lattice. The model is executed for 70 time steps,
which is a compromise between the computational cost of simulations and the minimal
length of model execution that provides a representative time series of land use dynamics.
Finally, the ABM generates constant development of 40 cells per time step, which amounts
to 2800 developed cells (19.12%) at the end of model execution.

4.1.

Input factor probability distributions

Our major objective is to assess land use pattern sensitivity because of input parameter
variation and sample size variation (Richiardi et al. 2006). In all experiments, also referred to
as scenarios, we use seven independent input factors (k = 7): number of developer agents
(Anum), preference (weight) for land value (Wlv), preference for scenic beauty (Wsb), pre-
ference for accessibility (Wa), the fraction of developable land known to agents – sample size
(Ss), neighborhood decrease in scenic beauty (Dsb), and neighborhood increase in land value
(Ilv). Table 2 lists the probability density functions (PDFs) reflecting the variable input

factors for every scenario. It should be stressed that the PDFs are critical to defining model
behavior, as the variances introduced into the PDFs reflect the magnitudes of variability
associated with a particular input.

We start from establishing a base case scenario, which represents a point of departure for
the consecutive experiments. For all continuous factors we assume a normal distribution. In
the majority of cases, we set the standard deviation of a factor to half of the mean value to
impose a moderate fluctuation around the mean. Below we describe the PDFs in more detail.
The base case preference allocation for landscape attributes is set to a third of unity and
reflects equal preferences for all three characteristics. When one preference dominates the others,
we increase the average value of the weight leaving the standard deviation unchanged.
Preliminary experimentation with Dsb and Ilv showed that these two factors can have a huge
impact on model behavior. In particular, when Dsb . 0.1 or Ilv . 0.1 the model immediately
converges to equilibrium calculated as landscape pattern metrics. Therefore, in the consecutive
experiments, we established 0.1 as the boundary condition for the normal PDFs of Dsb and Ilv.
Population size (number of agents) is defined using the discrete non-uniform distribution
presented in Table 2. The following constant
is assumed for every time step:
Anum · demand_per_agent = 40. In other words, when the number of agents increases, the
demand for land per agent proportionally decreases, so that the developed area per time step
remains constant. Furthermore, we assume that, for a particular ABM execution, all agents are

1837

homogeneous in preferences. Thus the variability of preferences is studied among alternate
development histories (model runs) rather than among agents. Although we acknowledge that
such an assumption is a considerable simplification of a real LUS, we needed to reduce model
dimensionality to trace the causality of the patterning.

To determine the necessary number of MC runs for the Sobol sample input generation
procedure, we use the following formula (SimLab http://simlab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/):
(2k + 2)2(4+j), where j (cid:6) 0 (Sobol 2001). Because our model is computationally demanding,
taking over 10 min on Dell Precision T5400 Intel Xeon 3.16 GHz processor, we decided to
set j = 1, which amounts to 512 ABM executions per scenario.

The following operational questions were used as the basis for experimental design (Table 2):

Experiments 2 and 3: What is the impact of variable preferences for landscape char-

acteristics on outcome development pattern?

Experiments 4 and 5: What are the implications of agent–agent feedbacks on land use

clustering?

Experiments 6 and 7: How does an increase (decrease) in agent–landscape feedback
intensity influence the spatial outcome? Will the changes in feedback intensity result
in a gradual modification of the pattern or will they cause an abrupt change?

Experiments 8 and 9: Assuming a constant amount of development, to what extent does

the number of homogeneous agents influence output variability?

Experiments 10 and 11: How does agent’s access to opportunities (information) shape

land use morphology?

Observe that we not only compare the distribution of outcome patterns, referred to as
uncertainty analysis (UA), but we also analyze the influence of input factors on output
variance. Through time-GSA, we try to infer which factors play the major role in obtaining a
particular output distribution.

5. Experiments and results

The primary results of ABM simulations are binary land use maps of developed and
undeveloped locations for every time step of each model execution. Figure 3 shows selected
development frequency maps, calculated using the mean development per cell among all
model executions of a given experiment. Observe a considerable variability in the spatial
distribution of land development among scenarios.

Using two-dimensional array of output values, where each cell in the landscape is a
separate outcome variable, may be computationally intractable (Lilburne and Tarantola
2009). Therefore, in place of spatial layers, we use fragmentation statistics as the represen-
tative summaries of patterns.

5.1. Selecting fragmentation statistics for time-GSA analysis

To summarize the patterns, we calculated the following fragmentation statistics (McGarigal
and Marks 1995): largest patch index (LPI), patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Euclidean
nearest neighbor distance (ENN), and aggregation index (AI). From the computed spatial
measures, ENN was dropped from post-processing analysis because of null values for some
maps, in which the development clustered into one big patch (hence no neighbors). From the
remaining statistics, we selected AI, PD, and LPI based on the linear correlation coefficient
(0.1 , |r| , 0.8 for all pairs of the selected statistics). LPI is measured as the percentage of the

landscape occupied by the largest patch of developed land and is therefore dependent on the
absolute area of development in any given time step. Therefore, we further normalized the LPI
values so that they reflect the fraction of the developed area occupied by the largest patch,
rather than the fraction of the total area under investigation. In this respect, we obtained a
measure of clustering relative to the current development and diminished the impact of linear
constant growth. We call this measure largest patch of developed area index (LPDI).

5.2. Sensitivity estimation errors
The accuracy of Si and STi depends on the number of model executions (Crosetto and
Tarantola 2001). Values of indices below zero usually indicate approximation errors because
of a small MC sample. When these errors are minor (e.g., 10–15%) we can assume that the
factors they represent are unimportant and their Si or STi can be reset to zero (Saltelli et al.
2008). Table 3 summarizes the highest errors obtained from k input factors for all 11
experiments. The errors were measured as values of Si or STi that fall below zero, normal-
ized to 100%. Notice that, for Experiments 2 and 7, the fragmentation statistics considerably
exceed the 15% threshold. We consequently decided to repeat these two experiments using a
larger MC sample of 1024 runs. These extended simulations improved Si and STi values for
AI and LPDI. The PD statistics, however, maintained low accuracy (Table 3). To confirm
that sensitivity estimation errors can noticeably affect the quality of time-GSA results, we
compared the time series of normalized Si values for PD calculated for Experiment 7
(Figure 4). Observe that both plots differ in the relative importance of factors over time.
Therefore, we decided to exclude PD from further analysis.

5.3. Uncertainty plots of land use fragmentation statistics
To establish output PDFs, we summarized AI and LPDI using (m, 1s) pairs for every time
step of model execution, rendered as time series of output uncertainty (Figure 5).

Figure 4. Time series of the first-order sensitivity index of PD fragmentation statistics calculated for
Experiment 7 (feedbacks: low beauty, high value).

The AI statistic demonstrates a fairly consistent behavior with a general trend of a short-
time change in value (increase or drop, depending on experiment), followed by a long time
period of relative stability with m . 40%. Not surprisingly, the highest AI correlates with
high importance assigned to land value either directly (Wlv, Experiment 2) or indirectly (high
Ilv and low Dsb, Experiment 7). In both cases, the average AI scores are high because of the
concentric spatial distribution of this layer (Figure 2) which has a tendency to build one big
cluster. Observe that high Ilv and low Dsb (Experiment 7) result in the lowest variance of AI
(smallest s) suggesting that this configuration of feedbacks ensures a high level of aggrega-
tion every time.

The behavior of LPDI differs from AI. First, it is much more variable with its 1s-band of
,30% as opposed to AI where 1s-band = 20% or less. Second, the time of convergence to
equilibrium for LPDI is longer than for AI. For example, Experiments 1 and 2 exhibit the
convergence period of ,30 time steps for LPDI and ,10 for AI. The Natural Beauty Weight
experiment (3) is the least variable. Its 1s-band is the narrowest owing to the overwhelming
impact of the polycentric nature of the natural beauty layer (Figure 2).

Moreover, all but one experiments exhibit an interesting behavior related to the relative
size of the largest developed patch. After three to five time steps the model reaches the
maximum LPDI value, then drops and maintains an almost steady value throughout the rest
of the simulation. For instance, in Experiment 11 LPDI starts around ,50%, then quickly
goes up to ,60% and, after t = 4, falls and stabilizes around 40%.

(Continued).

Finally, we should point to Experiments 2, 3, and 7 that exhibit distinct LPDI time series.
Both the Land Value Weight experiment and the Natural Beauty Weight experiment are
directly dependent on the preference assigned to their respective attribute maps, with high
LPDI for the concentric land value layer and low LPDI for the dispersed and polycentric
clumps of high scenic beauty. Similar to AI, Experiment 7 demonstrates higher LPDI values
because of the dominating impact of Ilv relative to Dsb, which strengthens the influence of the
land value layer on the resulting development.

5.4. Significance of different input uncertainties on landscape fragmentation
To test the significance of different conceptions of input factor PDFs, we performed one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) for AI and LPDI among all experiments for selected time

steps (1, 3, 5, 10, and every 10th afterward). Table 4 shows selected ANOVA results for t = 3,
t = 20, and t = 70.

For LPDI, the P-values are less than 0.0001 in both cases, indicating significant differences
among the experiments. Moreover, based on the time series of differences (Figure 6), the
largest difference at each tick decreases rapidly from over 25% at t = 1 to ,17% at t = 3,
followed by an increase to 30% at step 20 and then a slight decline. After step 5, however, its
variation is small. We can therefore conclude that after the initial short period of time, the
largest difference of AI for all 11 experiments becomes stable.

Similar to AI, LPDI P-values score less than 0.0001 in ANOVA, suggesting a significant
impact of various PDF definitions of input factors on the relative size of the largest patch of
developed area (Table 4). More importantly, based on the time series in Figure 6, the largest
difference at each time step has an increasing trend with the peak at the end of the simulation.
In summary, Figure 6 confirms the distinctive character of time step 30 as a point of gradual
regime change, after which most of the experiments converge to equilibrium (Figure 5).

With high Si we look for the important input factors that, if fixed independently, would
substantially reduce the variance of AI and LPDI. The plots suggest a considerable variability in
Si among scenarios, which is quite surprising given the relatively stable uncertainty plots in
Figure 5. In the vast majority of cases preference for scenic beauty (Wsb) is the most influential
input factor for both fragmentation statistics, followed by Wlv and Dsb. The significance of Wsb
on AI and LPDI is not surprising given the fact that the natural beauty layer drives the
magnitude of patchiness in the area. In Experiments 7, 2, 3, and 5, Ss becomes a moderately
influential factor, especially at the beginning of the simulation. These four factors constitute the
leverage points of clustered landscape configuration. The role of the other factors in fragmenta-
tion statistics variability is almost negligible, especially given the small values of STi.

Similar to the uncertainty plots in Figure 5, Scenarios 2, 3, and 7 diverge the most from
the base case for both Si and STi of AI. Consider the most influential factors for Experiments

7 and 3. Clearly, in the former experiment, Ss is the factor that, taken singly, causes the
majority of AI variance, as opposed to Dsb in Experiment 3. By investigating STi, we can
observe that Dsb and Ss are still the most sensitive factors for these experiments, suggesting
strong nonlinear relationships between these variables (Table 1).

Using the sum of first-order sensitivity indices, we can assess to what extent the ABM
behaves in an additive manner. The portion of output variance that cannot be explained by
individual factors is drawn in white in Figures 7a and 8a. The width of this band reflects the
fraction of interactions that affect output variance. Interestingly, factors interactivity differs
between AI and LPDI, indicating that we should be cautious in selecting spatial metrics, as
one fragmentation statistic is not enough to thoroughly describe pattern dynamics.

Given the PDFs used in the experiments, the ABM is more additive than expected and the
interactions among its parameters are not substantial. For AI, the sum of first-order effects
exceeds 70% for most of the scenarios, occasionally dropping to 60%. The major trend in the
intensity of interactions among the inputs is that the model starts as an additive one and
becomes more nonlinear later. Based on the total-effect indices, we can also observe that factor
interactivity introduces some level of stability in the relative significance among inputs (STi of
AI in Experiments 1, 4, and 6). Moreover, the importance of factor interactivity becomes more
evident for scenarios that are impacted by the availability of highly scoring opportunities
located in the neighborhood of already developed sites (Scenario 1, 4, and 11).

Comparing the uncertainty plots of AI with its sensitivity graphs leads to an interesting
correlation. Whenever the value of AI stabilizes, the input factors become more interdepen-
dent. This behavior is representative of a dynamic equilibrium at the macro-level (Richiardi
et al. 2006), in which disparate factor combinations contribute toward ABM outcome
stability during different time periods.

When considering the LPDI statistic, the sum of its first-order indices changes rather
haphazardly. Observe that, apart from Experiments 2, 3, and 7, the variance of LPDI seems
to be shaped by the individual factors rather than their combinations, as the sum of first-order
indices maintains 100% value most of the time. The interaction among inputs (Wlv, Wsb, and
Dsb) is more evident in experiments with divergent importance assigned to the attribute maps
(Scenarios 2, 3, 7).

Furthermore, observe that the factor which defines a particular scenario is not necessarily
the most significant one in shaping the behavior uncertainty of this scenario. For example,
Experiment 7 has a high value assigned to Ilv, and yet the sensitivity for AI of the tested
uncertainty in this factor is negligible. In fact, the most significant factor here is Ss,
suggesting that the high value of AI in this scenario (Figure 5) is mostly dictated by agents’
access to information about development opportunities. This behavior can be easily
explained. If the average value of a particular input is high, such a factor has in consequence
an overwhelming impact on model outcome dynamics to the point that the ABM becomes
insensitive to the variability associated with this factor. Therefore, the influence of this factor
on model outcomes is substantial but steady. This has a profound consequence on the input
definition of a given experiment. Strictly speaking, a factor that controls a particular scenario
can be essentially set to a relatively high fixed value yielding a similar model behavior as the
one outlined above.

Given the time-GSA plots of most AIs and some LPDIs, we can observe that the model
behaves more nonlinearly after t = 30. We hypothesize that the small interaction among
factors in the first time steps can be explained by spatial path dependence. The initial
decisions of agents are based on randomly drawn samples of developable locations.
Hence, the very first developed sites produce the seeds of growth that later glues to the
existing patches. Other significant input variables are less influential. Not surprisingly then,
the first few time steps are dominated by variations in Ss. The converse also supports the
existence of spatial path dependence. With high Ss in Experiment 10, agents become more
consistent in their choices of initial developments, reducing the role of Ss variability in
outcome sensitivity.

Is there anything that can be learned from the homogeneous population? Based on the
negligible impact of the magnitude of Anum, we postulate that ABMs with multiple homo-
geneous agents can be substituted with the system dynamics approach employing one
‘averaged’ actor. Moreover, significant changes in population size (Scenarios 8 and 9)
increase factor interactivity. We hypothesize that this trend would be more pronounced
with heterogeneous agents.

6. Concluding observations
The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of time-dependent variance-based GSA
in examining the dynamics of outcome uncertainty of a simple ABM of land use change. To
achieve this objective we experimented with different configurations of uncertainties of a
fixed number of input variables. We summarized output uncertainties with descriptive
statistics and compared them with time series of first-order and total-effect sensitivity
indices.

We have found that time-GSA allows for exploration of model behavior which would be
hard to observe using other approaches. The sole analysis of outcome uncertainty, exempli-
fied in PDFs of selected fragmentation statistics, does not reveal the dynamics of model
sensitivity to various input factors. We would be unable to estimate how uncertainties in
different factors contribute individually and in interactions toward the stability of ABM
outcome fragmentation over time. Based on the presented research, we argue that it is
difficult to assess the nonlinearity of ABM without a thorough sensitivity analysis. ABM
has been proclaimed to be complex and nonlinear, but little is reported to prove that the
internal mechanisms of such models behave truly nonlinearly. As Phillips (2003) and
Manson (2007) point out, not all complexity is nonlinear, and not all nonlinearity is complex.
Going one step further, we propose different types of ABM nonlinearity: from functional
(model definition), through factorial (input and output distribution), to behavioral (the nature
and magnitude of interactions during model execution). As demonstrated here, time-GSA is
particularly suitable for the latter case.

We conclude that the factor sensitivity measures vary significantly during model execu-
tion. Assuming that ABM dynamics is a result of factor interaction, we observe a distinct
time lag of nonlinearity, which unfolds after the formation of the seeds of development.
Consequently, a static snapshot of ABM sensitivity, taken at the end of the simulation, is
inadequate when deciding on factor prioritization and reduction.

What should be done in the future? Considering that land use ABM is particularly
suitable for studying the impact of human behavior on landscape configurations, a con-
current research project is undertaken to examine the effects of agent heterogeneity on land
use dynamics. Finally, there is a clear need for better approximation methods of sensitivity
indices. As shown in Section 5.2, the Monte Carlo technique applied here requires a large
number of model executions. For empirical ABMs, which require longer computation time,
large samples of simulations become prohibitive.

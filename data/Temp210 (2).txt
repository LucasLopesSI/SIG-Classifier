Abstract. Queries expressed in verbal language often involve a mixture of uncer-
tainties in the outcomes of events that are governed by chance and in the meaning
of linguistic terms. This study exempli(cid:142) es how probability and fuzzy sets can
work together to deal with such queries in the spatial domain. It involves site
selection on the basis of accessibility (travel time) estimates and per-pixel probabil-
ities of land cover change derived from remotely sensed imagery. Relationships
between probabilities and fuzzy sets were established on the basis of a linguistic
probability quali(cid:142) er ( high probability) and the expectation of a membership
function de(cid:142) ned on stochastic travel time. Fuzzy query processing was compared
with crisp processing to emphasise the diŒerence between grade and probability
of membership. Fuzzy set theory is used to deal with the vague meanings
of linguistic terms. The fuzzy query response contained more information than
the crisp response, namely the degree to which individual locations matched
the selection criteria. This illustrates the gain in expressive power provided by
combining probability and fuzzy sets.

Introduction
Both probabilistic methods and methods based on fuzzy set theory are currently
being used to deal with uncertainty in the classi(cid:142) cation of remotely sensed imagery
(e.g. Canters 1997, Eastman 1997, Foody 1997, Gorte and Stein 1998 ). Yet, the
distinction between probability of class membership and degree of membership in a
fuzzy class appears to be an object of confusion in the geo-information and remote
sensing community. For example, Foody and Trodd (1993: 343; emphasis added )
stated that probabilities derived from maximum likelihood classi(cid:142) cation and fuzzy
membership functions from fuzzy c-means classi(cid:142) cation are ‘... measures of the
...’. They continued by saying that
strength of membership to ‘‘discrete classes’’
‘... both approaches imply partial class membership ...
’ (emphasis added ). These
statements are not only erroneous, but they are also contradictory. Fuzzy c-means
classi(cid:142) cation allows partial class membership, but discrete classes do not have partial
members. Similar examples of confusion can be found in works on the unmixing of
coarse pixel signatures (e.g. Schowengerdt 1996, Bastin 1997 ).

In general, confusion arises because there is a tendency to interpret posterior
probabilities of a classi(cid:142) cation as analogous to class assignment function parameters
(Manton et al. 1994 ). They are not analogous though. The probabilistic classi(cid:142) ers

implemented in most commercially available image processing systems assume that
an element is a member of only one crisp class, i.e. a class that sharply distinguishes
between members and non-members. Classi(cid:142) cation uncertainty lies in the inability
to identify the class to which the element belongs. The posterior probabilities of a
classi(cid:142) cation are estimates of the likelihood of full membership in each class and not
the grade of membership in these classes (Manton et al. 1994 ). Usually, membership
is assigned to the class with the highest likelihood. Thus, the class assignment
function takes the value one for this class and zero for all other classes. Fuzzy
classi(cid:142) cation, on the other hand, is based on the concept of fuzzy sets (Zadeh 1965 ).
In the fuzzy set model, the class assignment function attributes to each element a
grade of membership in the real interval [0, 1] for every de(cid:142) ned set. This grade of
membership corresponds to the degree to which the element is similar to the concept
or prototype represented by that set. Accordingly, fuzzy sets enable representation
of imprecisely de(cid:142) ned classes such as vague concepts expressed in verbal language.
The relationship between the theories of probability and fuzzy sets is a matter of
much controversy among scientists (e.g. Laviolette et al. 1995, Nguyen 1997 ). In
clarifying the diŒerence between probability and degree of class membership to
geographers, Fisher (1994, 1996 ) referred to two forms of viewshed regions that can
be derived from a digital elevation model. The probable viewshed represented uncer-
tainty about the existence of a direct line of sight between observer and location;
the fuzzy viewshed indicated the degree to which any potentially visible target would
be discernible. Although the example elucidated diŒerences in concepts, the work
did not demonstrate the combined use of both approaches. It has been claimed that
such a combination may signi(cid:142) cantly improve the modelling of human knowledge
(e.g. Zadeh 1995, Nguyen 1997 ).

The objective of this paper is to exemplify how probability and fuzzy sets can
work together to handle imprecisely formulated queries on uncertain spatial data.
The example involves site selection on the basis of accessibility estimates and per-
pixel probabilities of land cover change. The latter were derived from classi(cid:142) ed
remotely sensed imagery. Relationships between probabilities and fuzzy sets are
established using the concepts of fuzzy probability quali(cid:142) ers (Wallsten et al. 1986 )
and expectation of membership functions de(cid:142) ned on stochastic variables (Zadeh
1968, Kandel 1986 ).

2. The example query

Geographical information systems (GIS) are frequently used for site selection
purposes. For example, Cadwell et al. (1995 ) used a GIS to select optimal sites for
planting seedlings of big sagebrush in order to restore shrub cover in burned areas.
Other applications are described in Hendrix and Buckley (1992 ), Fleischer et al.
(1998 ) and Wright et al. (1998 ). Although in the latter two articles reference is made
to data currency and accuracy as required for successful data integration, none of
the listed papers deals explicitly with the issue of uncertainty in site selection.

This study is concerned with such uncertainty, both in spatial input data and in
selection criteria. A query was submitted to a spatial database of a study area,
approximately 110 km2 in extent, centred on the village of Alora in Malaga province,
southern Spain (see (cid:142) gure 1). The area is within the Betic Cordillera, the westernmost
of the European Alpine mountain ranges, and includes part of the drainage basin of
the river Guadalhorce. Elevation varies between 80 and 735 m above sea level. The

an experiment requiring a surface area of less than 900 m2.

Query: Show locations that with high probability have lost forest cover over the

period 1984 to 1995 and that are easily accessible from a major road.

This query is illustrative of problems that involve a mixture of uncertainties in
the outcomes of events that are governed by chance and in the meaning of subjective

362

concepts. These problems frequently occur when dealing with concepts expressed in
verbal language.

De Bruin and Gorte (in press) analysed Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery
acquired in 1984 and 1995 to identify land cover changes within the study area by
post-classi(cid:142) cation comparison. Post-classi(cid:142) cation comparison means that the images
are classi(cid:142) ed separately and then overlaid to determine changes at the pixel level
(Singh 1989 ). For the purpose of the present study the original 10 land cover classes
were rearranged into forest cover (comprising open coniferous forest and thickly
wooded land ) and non-forest cover (the other eight classes). Figure 1 shows loss
of forest cover according to a comparison of the 1984 and 1995 classi(cid:142) cations in
which each pixel was assigned to the class having maximum posterior probability.
Obviously, such a comparison disregards any uncertainty in the individual classi(cid:142) ca-
tions. Therefore, De Bruin and Gorte (in press) proposed to make use of the posterior
probabilities of class membership in a post-classi(cid:142) cation comparison. Under the
assumption of independence, a pixel’s conditional probability of forest loss, given its
spectral vectors xt1

(1984 ) and xt2

(1995 ), can be calculated as
) 5 P(forest |xt1
, xt2

) P(non-forest |xt2

),

P( loss of forest cover |xt1

(1)

where P(a| b) denotes the probability of a conditional on b. A grid in which these
probabilities are represented at 30 m spatial resolution served as the main constituent
of the queried database. Each cell of this grid meets the surface area requirement of
an experimental site. It is implicitly assumed that forest loss either occurred or did
not occur at the cell level, i.e. partial loss of forest cover is not considered.

Apart from being concerned with stochastic uncertainty about the occurrence of
forest loss, the above query contains two imprecise selection criteria. These are high
probability and easily accessible. In order to handle these terms in a structured way
the query was divided into two sub-queries that are addressed in §3.1 and §3.2.
Section 3.3 explains how the results of the sub-queries were combined to produce
the complete response.

3. Query processing

3.1. Fuzzily quali(cid:142) ed probability of forest loss

The phrase ‘locations that with high probability have lost forest cover’ contains
a linguistic expression. What should be understood by the term high probability? In
an eŒort to introduce numerical conversions of probability terms, Mosteller and
Youtz (1990 ) provided measures of central tendency for 52 probability terms (among
which high probability). Using a direct translation, as suggested in that work, one
could set a threshold, for example P 5 0.85, which if exceeded implies membership
in the set of desired locations x. The corresponding membership function, mA (x),
would then be de(cid:142) ned as

mA(x) 5 G

otherwise

, xt2

)> 0.85

(2)

(see (cid:142) gure 2(b)), where A denotes the set of grid cells x having high probability of
forest loss.

CliŒ(1990 ) and Wallsten and Budescu (1990 ) questioned the desirability of such
a quanti(cid:142) cation of probabilistic expressions because, among other things, it disreg-
ards the inherent fuzziness of these concepts. Wallsten et al. (1986 ) showed that the

Querying probabilistic land cover data

meanings of probability terms can be represented by means of fuzzy membership
functions over the [0, 1] probability interval. These functions take the value zero
for probabilities not at all in the vague concept represented by the term, one for
probabilities that are perfect exemplars of the concept, and intermediate values
otherwise. Membership functions for the same term may diŒer substantially over
people (Wallsten et al. 1986 ) and depend upon context and communication direction
(Wallsten and Budescu 1995 ). In this study, a function similar to the one used by
Klir and Yuan (1995, 223 ) for the term very likely was adopted

(see (cid:142) gure 2(a)).

For each grid cell the degree of membership in the set of desired locations was
determined by applying equation (3) to the conditional probabilities of forest loss.
To compare this procedure with a crisp set approach, the calculations were also
performed using equation (2). The probability threshold for crisp membership
(P 5 0.85 ) corresponds approximately to the crossover point of the fuzzy membership
function. The crossover point is the point at which the membership grade in a fuzzy
set is 0.5 (Kandel 1986 ).

3.2. Easy accessibility

The accessibility of a location can be expressed as the time cost of reaching that
location from a major road. To calculate this cost the COSTDISTANCE function
of ARC/INFOâ
(ESRI 1994 ) was used. It assigns to each cell in a grid the cost of
reaching a source cell via the least-accumulative-cost path across an impedance
surface. The latter de(cid:142) nes the impedance to move planimetrically through each grid
cell. As will be explained below, the calculation required multiple impedance grids
that were derived from a digitised topographic map (Servicio Geogra´(cid:142) co del Eje´rcito
1995 ) and slope data. A set of grid cells covered by major roads constituted the
source cells.

The time required to reach a location may (cid:143) uctuate stochastically as a result of
weather-induced road conditions. On the basis of some experience in the area, it
was assumed that during the experiment the average travel speed on minor roads is
normally distributed with mean 5 30 km hÕ 1 and standard deviation 5 6.5 km hÕ 1.
The probability distribution over the speed range [10.5, 49.5] km hÕ 1 was discretised

364

into 13 intervals of equal width. The probability of each interval was assigned to its
midpoint (see table 1). It was assumed that the same conditions apply to all minor
roads. OŒthe road the average speed was taken to vary according to slope steepness:
tan b)) ( km hÕ 1), where b is the slope angle. Slope angle data were

derived from a digital elevation model provided by the Servicio Geogra´(cid:142) co del
Eje´rcito, Madrid.

By taking the inverse of average speed, 13 impedance grids were prepared, each
with regard to a diŒerent travel speed on minor roads. Where there is no bridge, the
river Guadalhorce imposed a barrier in the accessibility calculations. For simplicity,
fences and other obstructions were ignored. Subsequent COSTDISTANCE calcula-
tions resulted in 13 grids that were assigned the probabilities from table 1. This set
of grids rendered a spatial representation of the probability distribution of local least
time cost from major roads, p(tx).

Easy accessibility is a fuzzy concept that for the purpose of this study was de(cid:142) ned

subjectively by the membership function

(see (cid:142) gure 3(a)). Note that mB(tx)
is de(cid:142) ned on a stochastic variable. If Z is a

expectation of a fuzzy membership function mB(Z) is

Zadeh (1968 ) equalled E [mB(Z)] to the probability of a fuzzy event, but the cor-
rectness of such an interpretation of (5) is questionable (see Toth 1992 ). Given the
discrete probability distribution p(tx) of local least time cost from major roads, the
expectation of membership equation (5) at location x was calculated as

E[mB(x)] 5

mB(tx ) p(tx ),

tx ×Tx
where T x denotes the universal set of travel times at that location and mB(tx ) is
de(cid:142) ned in (4). Figure 4 illustrates the above procedure. Rounded rectangles represent
processing steps, normal rectangles represent data sets and arrows represent data
(cid:143) ow.

To compare this procedure with a crisp set (D) approach, the calculations were
repeated by setting a membership threshold at the crossover point (tx 5 15 min) of
function (3) (see (cid:142) gure 3(b)). Subsequently, all locations having E [mB(x)]> 0.5 were
assigned full membership in D.

3.3. Combination of the sub-query results

The procedures described in §3.1 and §3.2 result in two fuzzy sets. The (cid:142) rst,
denoted A, represents locations that, with high probability, have lost forest cover
over the period 1984 to 1995. The second, B, represents locations that are expected

4.1. Highly probable loss of forest cover

Figure 5 shows locations that with high probability have lost forest cover over
the period 1984 to 1995 according to crisp selection ((cid:142) gure 5 (a)) and fuzzy selection
((cid:142) gure 5(b)) using membership functions (2) and (3) respectively. The grids are
displayed at 50 m spatial resolution to allow a better representation of grey shades.
When (cid:142) gure 5(a) is compared with (cid:142) gures 1 and 5 (b) it can be seen that a shift of
the threshold value in membership function (2) may yield quite diŒerent results. Yet,

the threshold (P 5 0.85 ) was set more or less arbitrarily. This crisp selection criterion
discriminated sharply between members and non-members. In either case it did not
matter whether the probability of forest loss was near or far oŒthe threshold value.
Fuzzy selection, on the other hand, resulted in a grid representing the degree to

membership in the fuzzy set of easily accessible locations. Where there are no

proximate minor roads (e.g. 5 km north-northwest of Alora), travel time from major
roads is assumed to be completely determinate, i.e. not subject to random variation.
Consequently, uncertainty about the ease of accessibility is entirely attributable to
the fuzzy de(cid:142) nition of the concept (4). Otherwise, the uncertainty expressed in the
expected memberships is due both to (cid:143) uctuation of average speed on minor roads
(table 1) and to fuzziness of the event (see (cid:142) gure 6 ).

The eŒect of the barrier imposed by the river Guadalhorce is most prominent in
the upper-left corner of (cid:142) gure 6(b), where expected membership grades decrease
sharply from one to zero. This illustrates that crisp transitions are preserved when
using a fuzzy set representation. To save space, the results obtained by thresholding
the expectations of the crisp membership grades are not shown here.

4.3. Complete query result

Figure 7 visualises the intersection according to equation (6) of the fuzzy sets
represented in (cid:142) gures 5(b) and 6(b). It is displayed at 50 m spatial resolution to allow
a better representation of grey shades. Although at the original resolution the number
of grid cells having non-zero membership exceeds 3000, there are only a few with
membership grades close to one. These represent the locations that most closely
match the vague concepts included in the query.

4.4. Fuzzy selection versus crisp selection

In the end a location will either be selected or rejected for conducting an
experiment. A de(cid:142) nite decision in this respect will probably be preceded by (cid:142) eld
inspection. Selection of candidate sites that are to be checked in the (cid:142) eld could be
based on the degree to which they meet formulated preferences.

A strong a-cut of a fuzzy set, denoted a+F, is a crisp set that contains all elements
whose membership grades in F exceed the given value of a. For example, 0+F, is the
set that contains all elements having nonzero membership grade in F, i.e. the support
of F. The cardinality of a strong a-cut, denoted | a+F|, speci(cid:142) es the number of
elements in a+F. Table 2 lists cardinalities for diŒerent strong a-cuts of the sets
constructed by fuzzy (F ) and crisp (C ) processing of the query. In the crisp query
response the cardinality of a+C is invariant for a × [0, 1 ), because membership
grades can only take the value zero or one. Within class variability is not expressed
in the membership grades. In order to (cid:142) nd preferred locations it would be necessary
to evaluate P(loss of forest cover) and P(tx < 15 min.) for the selected cells, assuming
that the criterion tx < 15 min. is appropriate. This could be achieved in a decision-
analytical way after assigning a utility value, if a site were selected, to each of the
four possible compound events involving forest loss and travel time. Preferred sites
would be those having highest expected utility ( Von Winterfeldt and Edwards 1986 ).
However, this approach would involve additional processing steps that have not
been addressed in the query.

The fuzzy query response, on the other hand, provides membership grades that
express the degree to which the selection criteria are met. Sub-selection of preferred

sites would just be a matter of choosing an appropriate a-cut. This approach takes
advantage of the fact that subjective preferences had already been formulated in the
membership functions for the vague concepts high probability and easily accessible.
Rather than immediately forcing these concepts into crisp approximations, fuzzy set
theory allowed to preserve their imprecise meanings until the (cid:142) nal step preceding
crisp action.

5. Concluding remarks

The example query demonstrated that fuzzy membership grades and probabilities
of class membership can be combined to handle imprecisely formulated queries on
uncertain spatial data. Query processing using fuzzy membership functions was
compared with crisp processing to emphasise the diŒerence between the two measures
of uncertainty. In both cases, loss of forest cover was considered a crisp event at the
cell level, with a given probability of occurrence. The diŒerence was in the de(cid:142) nitions
of the concepts high probability and easy accessibility.

Using crisp membership functions, the imprecise quali(cid:142) er high probability was
replaced by a probability threshold and easy accessibility was considered a crisp
event. Consequently, the intrinsic uncertainty contained in these terms was ignored
in the query response. On the contrary, fuzzy set theory made it possible to deal
with the vague meanings of these terms throughout query processing, but at the
expense of having to construct fuzzy membership functions. Numerous methods exist
for constructing membership functions on the basis of subjective judgement (e.g.
Wallsten et al. 1986, Klir and Yuan 1995, Ch. 10 and the references therein). Although
these methods require more information than is needed for constructing crisp mem-
bership functions, this is amply compensated by the extra sensitivity in data analysis
(Burrough and McDonnell 1998 ).

In the example, the combination of fuzzy membership grades and probabilities
enabled processing of (1) the fuzzily quali(cid:142) ed probability of a crisp event, and (2)
membership in a fuzzy set de(cid:142) ned on a stochastic variable. As a result, the fuzzy
query response contained more information than the crisp response, namely the
degree to which individual locations match the selection criteria. These degrees can
be used to sub-select the most preferred sites from the complete set of selected
locations. This illustrates the gain in expressive power provided by fuzzy set theory
(e.g. Zadeh 1995 ).

An additional advantage of fuzzy membership functions is that they are less
sensitive to small data errors near critical class boundaries (Heuvelink and Burrough
1993 ). In like manner, fuzzy membership functions may do more justice to computed
variables that depend on many assumptions. An example of such a variable was the
travel time from major roads. Although not demonstrated in this paper, a change in
the assumptions used to calculate travel time will result in a change in the support
of the set of easily accessible locations. If easy accessibility is de(cid:142) ned by a crisp
threshold on travel time, a number of locations will completely reverse set member-
ship, even after only a slight shift in the assumptions. The change in degree of
membership will be less pronounced, however, if easy accessibility is de(cid:142) ned by a
fuzzy membership function.

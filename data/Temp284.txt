ABSTRACT
Urban multiple land use change (LUC) modelling enables the
realistic simulation of LUC processes in complex urban systems;
however, such modelling suﬀers from technical challenges posed
by complicated transition rules and high spatial heterogeneity
when predicting the LUC of a highly developed area. Tree-based
methods are powerful tools for addressing this task, but their
predictive capabilities need further examination. This study inte-
grates tree-based methods and cellular automata to simulate
multiple LUC processes in the Greater Tokyo Area. We examine
the predictive capability of 4 tree-based models – bagged trees,
random forests, extremely randomised trees (ERT) and bagged
gradient boosting decision trees (bagged GBDT) – on transition
probability prediction for 18 land use transitions derived from 8
land use types. We compare the predictive power of a tree-based
model with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and among themselves.
The results show that tree-based models generally perform better
than MLP, and ERT signiﬁcantly outperforms the three other tree-
based models. The outstanding predictive performance of ERT
demonstrates the advantages of introducing bagging ensemble
and a high degree of randomisation into transition probability

we found the strongest explanatory powers of neighbourhood
characteristics for all
land use transitions; however, the size of
the impacts depends on the neighbourhood land use type and
the neighbourhood size. Furthermore, socio-economic and policy
factors play important roles in transitions ending with high-rise
buildings and transitions related to industrial areas.

1. Introduction

Urban land use change (LUC) modelling is an eﬀective approach to understanding urban
phenomena and providing supporting evidence for urban planners. Although a wide
variety of LUC models were developed and utilised in previous studies, the majority of
these studies only focused on the modelling of urbanisation/urban expansion/urban
growth/urban sprawl (e.g. Wang and Mountrakis 2011, Al-Sharif and Pradhan 2015,

Berberoğlu et al. 2016). The previous studies simpliﬁed the urban dynamics into a plain
binary transition process from non-built-up to built-up lands. The modelling of binary
transitions is insuﬃcient to reﬂect real-world LUC processes, and it cannot support the
analyses of urban phenomena such as urban renewal and urban decay. To address these
issues, multiple LUC modelling, which enables the consideration of the transitions
between various natural and built-up lands, is required.

Certain studies used multiple LUC modelling in urban areas. Most previous studies
have focused on transitions from natural land use types to built-up types (e.g. Li and Yeh
2002, Camacho Olmedo et al. 2013, Tayyebi and Pijanowski 2014). However, there is a
growing number of studies that model the transitions among built-up types to expand
the coverage of transition types (Almeida et al. 2003, 2008, García et al. 2012, White et al.
2012, Zheng et al. 2015). In addition, previous studies mainly focused on fast developing
urban areas such as Adana in Turkey (Berberoğlu et al. 2016), Guangzhou (Chen et al.
2014) and Shenzhen (Chen et al. 2016) in China. Thus, limited work is available for highly
developed areas with characteristics signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of fast developing
areas (e.g. vast built-up areas, slow urban growth, land shortage problems and intensive
redevelopment activities). These characteristics could lead to a distinct LUC process, but
there is little evidence of LUC work focused on developed cities in the literature.

This study contributes to the literature by providing a detailed analysis of LUC
modelling in highly developed areas using data for the Greater Tokyo Area in Japan.
To provide a realistic simulation of the complex urban system, we consider 18 land use
transitions derived from 8 land use types, with a focus on the transitions between
diﬀerent built-up land types.

The lack of multiple LUC modelling in a highly developed urban system may be
largely due to the following diﬃculties: (1) Compared with a fast-developing urban
system, a highly developed urban system has no dominating driving forces, such as
demands imposed by rapid economic growth or urban expansion plans, that can largely
explain the LUC process. Instead, both driving forces and spatial patterns are relatively
more diverse, which could impose a great challenge in the analysis of the relationship
between driving factors and LUC (Irwin and Geoghegan 2001). (2) The complex transi-
tion rule sets require larger and sophisticated spatial variable sets and an eﬀective
modelling framework that can handle high-dimensional data sets (Li and Yeh 2002).
(3) Finally, there is a lack of previous knowledge on the explanatory power of spatial
variables for diﬀerent land use transitions.

We use cellular automata (CA) as a prevalent bottom-up LUC modelling method used
in the related literature (Santé et al. 2010). CA provides a transparent description of the
LUC process without a complex mathematical language (Deadman et al. 1993, Clarke
et al. 1997) but may perform poorly when applied to complex problems (Aburas et al.
2016). The integration of a statistical learning method and the CA model is a widely
adopted approach to overcome this weakness (Mozumder et al. 2016). Statistical learn-
ing methods are used to produce the transition probability given certain constraints by
turning the problem into a classiﬁcation task, and CA is used to simulate the spatial
patterns of land use transitions.

A variety of statistical learning methods, including logistic regression (LR) (Munshi
et al. 2014), neural networks (NN) (Li and Yeh 2001), support vector machine (Yang et al.
2008), decision tree (DT) (Li and Yeh 2004) and multi-criteria evaluation (Camacho

Olmedo et al. 2013), have been used to analyse LUC in the literature. The predictive
ability and interpretability are two major model selection criteria; however, in practice, it
is rare for a method to perform well under both criteria. LR and NN are the two most
prevalent methods; LR yields easily interpretable results but is not capable of handling
complex or large-scale problems because of the linear design (Li and Yeh 2002), whereas
NN has a strong predictive ability and non-linear design but is barely interpretable
(Pijanowski et al. 2002, Guan et al. 2005). DT is also a non-linear model similar to NN
but does not possess as remarkable a predictive ability as NN, and its interpretation is
not as straightforward as LR, which may explain the relatively small number of applica-
tions in LUC modelling (e.g. Li and Yeh 2004, Tayyebi and Pijanowski 2014, Al-Sharif and
Pradhan 2015).

According to statistical studies, the predictive performance of DT can be improved by
incorporating ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, thereby yielding a
variety of tree-based ensemble algorithms that have been proven to be competitive
with NN. These tree-based ensemble methods may be a solution to the dilemma
concerning predictive ability and interpretability. This possibility can be identiﬁed by
answering two questions: (1) Do tree-based methods perform better than strong pre-
dictors, such as NN? (2) Among the various tree-based methods, with their respective
distinct designs, which method is the most suitable for LUC modelling and why?
Although a few studies used tree-based methods and reported satisfactory predictive
performances (Li et al. 2014, 2015, Kamusoko and Gamba 2015), the two questions
remain unanswered because of the selective application and a lack of a systematic
evaluation in these studies.

To fully explore the potential of tree-based methods, this study combines a CA model
and 4 tree-based models (bagged trees (BT), random forest (RF), extremely randomised trees
(ERT) and bagged gradient boosting decision trees (bagged GBDT)) to simulate the LUC in
the Greater Tokyo Area from 2009 to 2014. We compare the predictive performances of the
tree-based models between themselves and with the results obtained under the NN
method by using both the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC)
curve and the area under the precision-recall (AUC-PR) curve. In addition, with the variable
importance evaluation embedded in tree-based algorithms, we provide an interpretation of
the eﬀects of diﬀerent driving factors. The ﬁndings of this study provide insights and
evidence regarding model selection and LUC in a highly developed urban system.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the statistical
tools and the CA model. Section 3 describes the study area, data and variables. Section 4
presents the results of the simulation and an evaluation of the tree-based models.
Section 5 discusses the models’ performances and the driving factors of LUC. Section
6 concludes the paper.

2. Methodology

2.1. Transition probability modelling

2.1.1. Tree-based algorithms
DT is an inductive classiﬁcation method in the form of an inverted tree structure. This
method recursively partitions the learning data using a set of ‘if-then’ rules and seeks to

G. DU ET AL.

obtain the ‘best’ split at each step. DT contains internal nodes that would be further split
and leaf nodes that would not, therein connecting them with branches, which represent
conjunctions of variables. The recursion is completed once the subset at a node has the
same class label or when some pre-set stopping rules are met.

We use the CART (classiﬁcation and regression tree) algorithm (Breiman et al. 1984) to
construct the DT models. CART uses the Gini impurity as the metric to measure the
quality of a split, which is deﬁned as

IGðtÞ ¼

pði tÞð1 (cid:2) pði

j

jtÞÞ ¼ 1 (cid:2)

pðijtÞ2

(1)

Xc

i¼1

Xc

i¼1

where IG denotes the Gini impurity at a particular node t, p(i|t) is the proportion of the
observations that belong to class i for node t and c is the number of classes for node t.
Intuitively, the Gini impurity can be understood as a criterion to minimise the probability
of misclassiﬁcation. CART selects the split rule that maximises the Gini impurity at the
child node of t as the best split rule.

Due to its classiﬁcation criteria, DT is intrinsically sensitive to the input data structure;
hence, the results obtained using DT are unstable and prone to over-ﬁtting (Caruana
and Niculescu-Mizil 2006). On the other hand, practical algorithms are based on heuristic
algorithms, such as greedy algorithms, where locally optimal decisions are made at each
node, and cannot guarantee that globally optimal decisions will be returned (Ben-Gal
et al. 2014). These two issues represent variance (the error from the sensitivity to
changes in a data set) and bias (the error from incorrect model hypothesis) problems
and are usually addressed using boosting or bagging.

The boosted tree method was developed to achieve bias reductions by incrementally
building an ensemble by learning each new instance to emphasise the training instances
previously mis-classiﬁed (Quinlan et al. 1996). This study uses a typical algorithm, GBDT,
which constructs additive regression models by sequentially ﬁtting single DT models to
minimise the current pseudo-residuals by least squares at each iteration (Friedman
2002). GBDT is well recognised for its outstanding predictive power, but is so vulnerable
to noise that its predictions are sometimes not even competitive to single DT when the
noise is high (Opitz and Maclin 1999). On the other hand, bagging aims to improve the
accuracy through variance reduction (Breiman 1996). BT forms multiple versions of DT
models by repetitively ﬁtting them to subsample sets drawn from bootstrap sampling
(random sampling with replacement), and then,
it aggregates their predictions by
averaging.

RF (Breiman 2001) is a widely applied learning algorithm in various ﬁelds. This
method is an enhanced version of the standard BT method, with additional randomness
imposed at the split selection step. It also trains multiple CART models from bootstrap
replicas of the samples, but it derives the optimal split by searching a random subset of
candidate variables at each node. RF generally outperforms the standard BT method and
is more robust than boosting trees with respect to noise (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil
2006).

In ERT or ET (extra-trees) (Geurts et al. 2006), the randomisation is extended com-
pared with RF in that both the variable and the cut point are selected at random when
splitting a node. This method is based on the rationale that the extreme randomisation

of the cut point and variable combined with ensemble schemes should be able to
further reduce the model’s dependence on the data structure and hence improve the
model’s generalisation performance. The standard ERT algorithm published by Geurts
et al. (2006) uses the whole learning sample rather than a bootstrap replica to grow trees
to compensate for the accuracy loss caused by randomness. However, we discard this
change to further increase the randomness of the algorithm to provide a matched
comparison with the results obtained using BT and RF.

To mitigate the impact of noise produced by the irrelevant variables, we performed
variable selection using the variable importance evaluation embedded in those tree-
based learning algorithms. The evaluation is based on the idea that the relative rank (i.e.
depth) of a variable used as an internal node explains the relative importance of the
variable. The importance score of a variable is deﬁned as the normalised total reduction
of the Gini
impurity produced by that particular variable. We sorted the obtained
variable importance in descending order, calculated the accumulation and selected
the variables within 95% of the total accumulation.

We also performed hyperparameters optimisation using a grid search method to
avoid over-ﬁtting and improve the model’s performance. The hyperparameters of DT
include the tree depth, minimum samples in a leaf node, minimum samples for a split
and minimum impurity for a split. In addition to these basic hyperparameters, we further
tuned the tree numbers and bootstrap sampling ratio for RF and ERT and the tree
numbers and learning rate for GBDT.

2.1.2. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
MLP is a basic feed-forward NN and consists of one input layer, one or more hidden
layers and one output layer. These layers are fully connected by a set of weights, which
are learned and updated by the back-propagation algorithm. MLP’s ability to learn and
generalise depends on its architecture (number of hidden layers and nodes) and on the
hyperparameters (learning rate, etc.).

In this study, we use cross-entropy as the loss function, ReLU (rectiﬁed linear unit) as
the activation function and the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm as the optimiser
to train the model. A set of hyperparameters was tuned in the training process to
achieve the optimal generalisation performance, including the number of hidden layers,
learning rate, training epoch, mini-batch size, momentum,
learning rate decay, L2
regularisation and dropout ratio. In addition, each mini-batch was speciﬁcally designed
to have the same ratio between samples with changed or unchanged state of land use
over time as the original data set, while training.

2.1.3. Bootstrap sampling and aggregating
The dilemmas of spatial autocorrelation and sample representativeness are tricky issues
in spatial modelling (Hirzel and Guisan 2002, Munroe et al. 2004). Previous studies
usually adopted either random sampling which can well represent the population (Xie
et al. 2005, Huang et al. 2009, Chen et al. 2014), or stratiﬁed random sampling which
seeks to achieve a balance between spatial autocorrelation and sample representative-
ness (Arsanjani et al. 2013, Mozumder et al. 2016). However, these methods may still lead
to a poor representative sample when applied to the multiple LUC problem, in which
the spatial heterogeneity tends to be much higher than in typical cases of binary LUC.

G. DU ET AL.

We use an approach based on the idea of bagging, which seeks to reduce the
sampling error by incorporating the whole spatial data set into the model training in
an ensemble approach. The procedure is as follows: (1) use bootstrap sampling to
repetitively split the whole sample set into a training set and a holdout set at a ratio
of 0.35:0.65, (2) learn a basic predictor on the training set and subsequently obtain
the prediction of the holdout set at each iteration and (3) aggregate the predictions
of the holdout set by performing averaging when the iteration is ﬁnished. The
standard bagging method is used to address the disadvantages of DT algorithms.
This approach has a similar procedure as the bagging method but possesses the
advantages of being able to reduce the possible sampling error using bootstrap
sampling and aggregating.

In practice, we use DT, GBDT and MLP as the basic predictors and obtain bagged DT,
bagged GBDT and bagged MLP models. Since RF and ERT are already bagging ensem-
bles of DT, we directly use them to implement the bootstrap sampling and aggregating
approach rather than wrapping them into other bagging schemes. Finally, ﬁve models
(DT, RF, ERT, bagged GBDT and bagged MLP) were developed for the transition prob-
ability prediction.

2.2. CA model

The CA model used in this study is based on the well-developed CA model
DINAMICA (Soares-Filho et al. 2002), which has been widely applied in ecological
and urban LUC modelling (e.g. Almeida et al. 2003, Pérez-Vega et al. 2012, Rossetti
et al. 2013). DINAMICA deﬁnes two main vicinity-based transitional functions, expan-
der and patcher, to simulate the land use patch dynamics in a stochastic multi-step
approach. The expander function is dedicated to the expansion or contraction of the
previous patches of a certain land use class, and the patcher function is designed to
generate new patches. The two processes are merged using the following
calculation:

Qij ¼ r (cid:3) expander þ s (cid:3) patcher

(2)

where Qij is the total number of transitions from land use class i to j; r and s are the
percentages performed by the expander and patcher functions, respectively; and
r + s = 1. The patch size is drawn from a log-normal distribution, and the patch shape
or compactness is determined by a parameter named isometry.

In this study, the simulation was iterated over the modelling period on a yearly
basis. The total number of transitions is determined by a simple operation of cross-
tabulation based on initial and ﬁnal
land use maps and is then assigned to each
iteration in an average-based manner. The simulated map is updated by each itera-
tion according to the results obtained by the expander and patcher functions. Both
functions use a stochastic selection mechanism to select seeds (the centre cell of a
transition patch), which prioritise high transition probabilities over low transition
probabilities with a certain degree of randomness, where the randomness strength
can be adjusted.

We performed some modiﬁcations to the expander function to adapt it to the LUC

problem of this study. The modiﬁed expander function is deﬁned as

(3)

where PðijÞðxyÞ denotes the transition probability from land use class i to j, t denotes a
pre-set threshold, and nj denotes the number of cells of land use class j occurring in a
3 × 3 window.

The expander function can be regarded as a penalty mechanism on cells that have
relatively few neighbours of land use j. The penalty here is speciﬁcally designed to be
lighter than that in the original expander function by taking the square of the original
coeﬃcient nj/4 and establishing a safe zone based on a pre-set threshold. The rationale
behind this penalty abatement is that (1) the impact of neighbouring land use has
already been controlled in the transition probability prediction by employing land use
enrichment factors and (2) misclassiﬁcation mainly occurs at cells with low certainty (low
transition probability) rather than cells with high certainty (high transition probability)
according to previous studies (Gong et al. 2015, Li et al. 2015).

2.3. Validation

2.3.1. Validation of statistical learning models
We use the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the precision-recall (PR)
curve, speciﬁcally the corresponding areas under the curves (AUC-ROC and AUC-PR), to
evaluate the predictive performances of the tree-based learning methods. Both metrics
are calculated based on confusion matrix.

ROC is a well-documented model assessment tool. It depicts the trade-oﬀ between
the false-positive rate (FPR) and the true-positive rate (TPR) with varying thresholds, and
the AUC-ROC is used as a quantitative measure for assessing the classiﬁcation perfor-
mance. Speciﬁcally, an AUC-ROC value of 0.5 is the random baseline, and values below
0.5 indicate a systematically incorrect model (Jansen and Veldkamp 2012). ROC is
frequently used to evaluate the quality of the transition probability (Pontius and
Schneider 2001). However, while ROC describes the performance of both negative and
positive classes, which correspond to unchanged and changed areas in the context of
LUC modelling, the main interest is usually the simulation performance of changed areas
(Pérez-Vega et al. 2012, Gong et al. 2015). Moreover, AUC-ROC can present an overly
optimistic view of an algorithm’s performance if the data are highly imbalanced (Davis
and Goadrich 2006).

Hence, we use AUC-PR to address the above-mentioned problems. AUC-PR is a
sequence of precision and recall values with varying thresholds. It provides a more
speciﬁc assessment of a model’s ability to predict changed areas and exclude the
inﬂuence of data imbalance. We note that although AUC-ROC and AUC-PR are closely
related, the algorithms that optimise AUC-ROC are not guaranteed to optimise AUC-PR
(Davis and Goadrich 2006).

2.3.2. Validation of CA simulation
We perform both cell-to-cell and vicinity-based assessments to evaluate the simulation
quality using the overall accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa statistics for the cell-to-cell

Downloaded by [RMIT University Library] at 18:12 06 December 2017 8

G. DU ET AL.

assessment and fuzzy Kappa statistics for the vicinity-based assessment. We use the fuzzy
Kappa over other metrics (e.g. the multi-resolution ﬁtting procedure (Costanza 1989) and
the fuzzy similarity (Hagen 2003)) because of its intrinsic connection to classic Kappa, which
enables comparison between the cell-to-cell and vicinity-based performances.

The classic Kappa statistics describe the agreement between two observation cate-
gories by excluding the agreement due to chance (Bennett et al. 2013) and is deﬁned as
K ¼ p0 (cid:2) pe
1 (cid:2) pe

(4)

where p0 is the relative observed agreement and pe is the hypothetical probability of
chance agreement. In terms of the implication of the magnitude of the Kappa coeﬃ-
cient, a value above 0.8 represents a strong agreement between two maps, a value
between 0.6 and 0.8 represents a somewhat strong agreement, a value between 0.4 and
0.6 represents a moderate agreement and a value below 0.4 represents a weak agree-
ment (Landis and Koch 1977).

Fuzzy Kappa has the same rationale as classic Kappa, but it introduces fuzzy set
theory to account for the category similarity and neighbourhood similarity by attributing
some degree of agreement to similar land use categories (e.g. low-density and high-
density low-rise buildings) at corresponding locations or in a neighbourhood. We only
consider the neighbourhood similarity in this study because the category similarity may
exaggerate the performance of a simulation. A Gaussian distance decay function is used
to specify the agreement level with respect to distance within a neighbourhood. In
addition, we use a two-way similarity approach recommended by Hagen (2003) to avoid
over-estimation caused by the overpowering inﬂuence of the similarity between neigh-
bourhoods. This approach would signiﬁcantly reduce the degree of agreement if the
centre cells of two maps do not belong to the same category. For a more detailed
demonstration and mathematical description of fuzzy Kappa and the two-way similarity,
refer to Hagen (2003).

2.4. Model framework

Figure 1 shows the model framework. The multiple LUC modelling is disaggregated by
the initial land use classes and then divided into several sub-tasks with an identical land
use class within each sub-task. These sub-tasks are separately performed with the
integrated model. The outputs are aggregated to produce the ﬁnal land use map at
the end of the process.

Cells with a certain land use class could undergo diﬀerent transitions, leading to a
multi-classiﬁcation problem in statistical
learning, for which Tayyebi and Pijanowski
(2014) provided a detailed discussion. The One-versus-Rest (OvR) approach, which trains
a single predictor per class, with the samples of that class as positive samples and all
other samples as negative samples, is used to address this issue. However, the OvR
approach has a shortcoming in that it may aggravate the data imbalance problem (i.e.
observations of some classes are signiﬁcantly fewer in number than those of other
classes). To avoid this problem, we use a class weight adjustment, which assigns higher
weights to minority classes according to their proportions and hence ensures that
minority classes obtain greater focus by the predictor.

Figure 1. Modelling framework used in this study.

Four tree-based learning methods are used to achieve the transition probability
prediction, but only the method with the highest predictive performance would be
used to produce the transition probability maps for further simulation.

Given that the CA model can only simulate one transition at a time, the already
disaggregated multiple LUC processes are further divided into binary transitions. The
binary transitions are separately simulated by the CA model, and then, the simulation
results are aggregated. To resolve conﬂicting locations that may be identiﬁed during the
aggregation process, we (1) remove the contenders that are not selected as seeds in the
corresponding expander or patcher simulating process and (2) select the survivor with
the highest transition probability.

3. Implementation

3.1. Study area and land use data

The study area is the Greater Tokyo Area in Japan, which is a highly developed
metropolitan area. This area consists of Tokyo city and its three surrounding prefectures;
the area is approximately 18,500 km2 and contains a population of approximately 38
million. This area is the second largest single metropolitan area in the world in terms of
built-up or urban function landmass, approximately 8500 km2. The Greater Tokyo Area
experienced rapid LUC until the 1980s; subsequently, the change rate decreased dra-
matically after the asset bubble burst. The LUC rate has remained low since then.

We use ﬁnely classiﬁed land use maps of 2009 and 2014 from a geographical project
of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation of Japan. The land use maps
have a resolution of 100 × 100 m, which is acceptable for a large-scale study. We
aggregated the 18 land use classes in the original land use maps into 10 classes by
merging similar categories. The 10 land use classes are agriculture, forest, vacant land,
institutional/recreational/leisure (IRL) lands, industrial area, low-density low-rise build-
ings, high-density low-rise buildings, high-rise buildings, water body and restricted area

(see Figure 2). We exclude restricted area and water body from consideration, and are
left with 8 land use classes for analysis. In the Greater Tokyo Area, high-rise building
areas are mainly located in the central area, which is surrounded by high-density and
low-rise building areas. Low-density and low-rise building areas, agriculture and forest
are scattered across the non-central area.

Of the various possible land use transitions that could occur from the 8 land use types,
we excluded transition categories with a frequency of less than 1% of the total number of
transitions. The remaining 18 transitions are summarised in Tables 1 and 2. LU transitions

seem to be rare events, as most transition frequencies do not exceed 5%, yielding a highly
imbalanced data set (i.e. the unchanged land use class has far more observations than the
changed land use class). Typical urban phenomena are reﬂected in the land use transitions.
For instance, transitions from agriculture/forests to low-density and low-rise buildings
reﬂect urban expansion, transition from low-rise buildings to high-rise buildings reﬂects
urban renewal and transition from IRL to forests reﬂects urban decay.

3.2. Driving factors of LUC

We constructed a variable set with approximately 100 dimensions. The variables can be
categorised into neighbourhood land use enrichment, accessibility, physical factors and
socio-economic and policy factors (see Table 3). The spatial data were collected from the
Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation of Japan, OpenStreetMap and the
SRTM3 (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 3) database.

The land use enrichment factor is a measure developed by Verburg et al. (2004) and
extended by Liao et al. (2016) to characterise the over- or under-representation of land
use types in a neighbourhood. This measure is deﬁned as

Fl;d;i ¼ nl;d;i=nd;i
Nl=N

(5)

where Fl;d;i is the enrichment of neighbourhood d of location i with land use type l, nl;d;i
is the number of cells of land use type l in the neighbourhood d of the centre cell i, nd;i is
the total number of cells in neighbourhood d, Nl is the number of cells with land use
type l and N is the total number of cells in the map. We calculated the enrichment
factors in Moore neighbourhoods of varying sizes with radii of 1, 3, 7, 20 and 55 cells to
capture the characteristics of both small and large neighbourhoods.

We also considered a variety of socio-economic and policy factors which have been
demonstrated to play important roles in LUC modelling (Guan et al. 2005, Puertas et al.
2014, Xu et al. 2016). The socio-economic factors include population density, land prices,

GDP, ﬂoor area ratio (FAR) and administrative district dummies, and the policy factors include
development planning and LU zoning. Land prices were interpolated from a vector map with
a sequence of survey locations and land price data using the ordinary Kriging method. FAR
represents the free population capacity characterising a building in an area and is calcu-
lated as the diﬀerence between the permitted maximum FAR and the current FAR.

The Greater Tokyo Area is composed of various areas, from central capital area to
more remote suburbs that vary greatly in city orientation, development level and
demographic characteristics. This study uses the variation in socio-economic factors to
capture the spatial variation within the Greater Tokyo Area; administrative district dummy
and development planning are used to control for the diﬀerence in city orientation, GDP
and land price reﬂect the variation in development level and population density helps to
control varying demographic characteristics.

3.3. Programming environment

The whole modelling process was implemented in Python.
In addition to the basic
scientiﬁc computation libraries of Numpy, Pandas and Scipy, Arcpy (ESRI Inc.), Pykrige
(Murphy 2014) and Pysal (Rey and Anselin 2010) were used for the geographical data
processing and spatial analysis, Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011) was used to develop
the tree-based models, Tensorﬂow (Abadi et al. 2016) was used to develop the tree-
based models and Tensorﬂow (Pedregosa et al. 2011) was used to develop the MLP
models. The full implementation in Python yields an eﬃcient workﬂow and allows for
great ﬂexibility in making modiﬁcations to the methods developed in previous studies
for adapting to speciﬁc LUC modelling problems.

4. Results

4.1. Assessment of transition probability prediction models

The application and examination of various statistical methods are the main focus of this
study. We provide (1) a comparison of diﬀerent statistical learning algorithms as basic
predictors of the transition probability and (2) the combination of these algorithms with
the bootstrap sampling and aggregating approach. In the calibration stage, the data set
is split into a training set and a test set at a ratio of 0.8:0.2. All models were built upon
the training set and evaluated on the test set. The training and test sets retain the same
ratio of samples, with unchanged or changed states of land use over time, as the raw
data set. This avoids an over-estimated model performance due to the data imbalance.
DT, GBDT and MLP were used as basic predictors and were trained on the same sub-
sample, at a proportion of 35%. The outputs were binarised to calculate the AUC-PR and
AUC-ROC curves. Table 4 summarises the results.

Overall, the AUC-ROC curves of all the models are above 0.5, conﬁrming the validity
of these models. DT has substantially lower AUC-ROC curves than MLP but exhibits a

better performance than MLP with respect to AUC-PR. Given that the PR curve and ROC
curve share a mutual index of TPR (recall) and diﬀer in the use of precision and FPR, the
possible reasons for this result are that DT tends to sacriﬁce overall accuracy to achieve
high precision, whereas MLP better focuses on overall accuracy, and/or that DT is more
eﬀective in resolving the data imbalance problem. These tendencies should be asso-
ciated with the diﬀerent objective functions and optimisation strategies; however, an
explicit mathematical explanation is beyond the scope of this study. The predictive
performance of DT is greatly improved when using boosting, especially in terms of
AUC-ROC. GBDT outperforms MLP on both metrics, but its performance seems to be
problem speciﬁc, i.e. in a few cases, such as transitions beginning from IRL, the AUC-PR
of GBDT is lower than those of DT. The possible large amount of noise in these problems
may be responsible for this phenomenon.

Next, we combined the basic predictors with bagging-based ensemble methods.
Table 5 shows substantial improvements in the prediction metrics for the basic pre-
dictors when integrated with bagging-based methods. From DT to BT, the average and
standard deviation of AUC-ROC over various transition problems improved from
0.64 ± 0.07 to 0.91 ± 0.06, and those of AUC-PR changed from 0.32 ± 0.15 to
0.57 ± 0.18. Integrating GBDT with a bagging algorithm does not induce as signiﬁcant
of improvements as does integrating DT with a bagging algorithm; the bagged GBDT
achieves AUC-ROC of 0.92 ± 0.06 and AUC-PR of 0.58 ± 0.24, which are similar to those
obtained under BT. This result demonstrates that the advantage of GBDT over DT could
be cancelled out when being incorporated into a bagging scheme.

The three bagging ensemble models of DT, BT and RF achieve similar performances,
whereas ERT signiﬁcantly outperforms them, with AUC-ROC of 0.95 (± 0.04) and AUC-PR
of 0.63 (± 0.22). This result indicates that the randomisation mechanism of the bagging-
based algorithm may aﬀect the performance of the transition probability prediction, but
the impact depends on the speciﬁcs of the randomisation type. Compared with BT,
which does not incorporate any randomisation in the modelling process, RF introduces a
certain degree of randomisation by randomly selecting variables for splits to reduce the
model’s reliance on a speciﬁc explanatory variable set; however, this randomisation
method does not seem to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on improving the predictive perfor-
mance. On the other hand, ERT further incorporates randomisation in the cut-point
selection, which is approximately equivalent to the random determination of the transi-
tion rules for each basic predictor. This particular randomisation method helps ERT to
achieve the highest predictive performance, which highlights the eﬀectiveness of the
random determination of transition rules for representing the stochastic process of LUC.

4.2. Assessment of CA simulation

The land use simulation by the expander and patcher functions is a stochastic process,
which implies diﬀerent outputs for each simulation. We ran the simulation with the
same conﬁguration 10 times and obtained the ﬁnal results by plurality voting. Table 6
presents the assessments of the simulation results.

Overall, the Kappa coeﬃcients ranged 0.41–0.92, which indicates a large variation
among the transition types. According to the implication of the magnitude of the Kappa
coeﬃcient (Landis and Koch 1977), the modelling of transitions between forest, agricul-
ture and low-density and low-rise buildings and of transitions from industrial to vacant
land and IRL only achieves moderate agreement; the modelling of transitions beginning

from vacant land, transitions from IRL to high-rise buildings and transitions from
industrial to low-density and low-rise buildings achieves strong agreement.

Fuzzy Kappa explores the possibility that the land use simulation may successfully
locate an approximate position of LUC but fail to predict the state of the exact cell. The
coeﬃcients increase by 0.01–0.12 from Kappa to fuzzy Kappa with a neighbourhood size
of 3 × 3 for land use transitions. In particular, transitions beginning from forest and
transitions from vacant land to industrial areas show the largest increase, approximately
0.1. Although the misclassiﬁcation of exact cells is common when using the expander
and patcher functions, these diﬀerences are sometimes large enough to imply the
incapability of transition probability models to distinguish the sophisticated variations
characterising these particular transitions.

Figure 3 shows a comparison of the simulated and actual maps as well as an enlarged
map of the central urban area. Figure 4 presents the visualisation of simulation errors.
According to Figure 4, incorrectly estimated cells are mainly distributed in the central
and northwest parts of Greater Tokyo Area and have very sparse spatial distributions.
Error type 2 is the case in which the model fails to predict the future change in land use
types, and this error occurs in approximately 2/3 of all cells with any error. Error type 3 is
the case in which the model successfully predicts the future change in land use but fails
to predict the correct destination, and this error occurs in approximately 3% of all cells
with any error. The large diﬀerence in the number of cells with error type 2 and error
type 3 indicates that predicting the occurrence of LUC is more diﬃcult than predicting
the type of transition.

5. Discussion

5.1. Decomposition of ERT model

Our results indicate that using the ERT algorithm to enhance DT and address the
spatial sampling problem has proven to be an eﬀective approach; however, the
rationale for what we observe as the results need further interpretation. ERT and
other bagging ensemble models would reduce two sources of variance: the variance
inherent to the DT algorithm and the variance arising from the sampling. For

simplicity, the former is denoted as DT enhancement, and the latter is denoted as
sampling correction.

To decompose the variance reduction process, we used the ERT models as basic
predictors and trained the bagged ERT models using the bootstrap sampling and
aggregating approach. These bagged ERT models were compared with single DT and
single ERT models, which were trained on a sub-sample to calculate the variance
reductions. It is presumed that the variance reductions from the single DT to single
ERT models are accounted for by DT enhancement, and the variance reductions from
the single ERT to bagged ERT models are accounted for by sampling correction.

In Table 7, the ﬁrst step (from single DT to single ERT) and the second step (from
single ERT to bagged ERT) present diﬀerent trends with respect to the three metrics. The
ﬁrst step signiﬁcantly reduces the total error; the second step also reduces the total error
but much less. The total error decrease is supposed to equal the reduction in the
variance, as theoretically bagging algorithms only address error variance. Therefore,
the results indicate that both DT enhancement and sampling correction have reduced
the variance of the transition probability prediction. Overall, the contribution of the DT
algorithm enhancement is much higher. Combining the results of AUC-ROC and AUC-PR,
we can see that both metrics signiﬁcantly increase through two steps; the proportional
increase extents of both metrics by DT enhancement are similar, whereas with respect to

sampling correction, the proportional increase extent of AUC-PR is larger than that of
AUC-ROC. This result may imply diﬀerent eﬀects of DT enhancement and sampling
correction in the variance reduction based on the diﬀerent characteristics of the ROC
and PR curves. DT enhancement improves the performance of both positive (changed
cells) and negative classes (unchanged cells) with no preference, whereas sampling
correction mainly focuses on improving the positive class (changed cells).

5.2. Driving factors of LUC

Tree-based learning algorithms provide not only high-quality transition probability
prediction but also insights into the complex urban dynamics. Using the variable
importance evaluation, we examine the explanatory powers of various driving factors.
We consider ﬁve driving factor categories: neighbourhood eﬀect, accessibility, physical
factors, socio-economic factors and policy. To address the diﬀerent inﬂuences of the end
land use of a speciﬁc transition and other land use types, we further divide the
neighbourhood eﬀect into main and auxiliary neighbourhood eﬀects, which account
for the neighbourhood enrichment of end land use type and other land use types,
respectively. The average importance score of variables that belong to the same cate-
gory of driving factor is calculated to represent the average importance of the driving
factor. Figure 5 presents the results.

Figure 5. Results of variable importance evaluation for driving factors of land use change process.

The main neighbourhood eﬀect is the strongest explanatory factor, but its explana-
tory factor varies signiﬁcantly with transition type.
In contrast, the impacts of the
auxiliary neighbourhood characteristics are relatively small but consistent over transition
type. Accessibility and physical factors, which are commonly used in LUC modelling
studies, have modest explanatory powers. Socio-economic and policy factors are rela-
tively less important but may play critical roles in certain land use transition processes
such as land use transitions from certain sources to high-rise buildings (see T7, T11, T15
and T16 in Figure 5). This ﬁnding is plausible given that high-rise buildings are mainly

high-grade residential or commercial buildings, and LUC occurs when the new land use
type is able to provide greater value, especially economic value in a free market (Zheng
et al. 2015). On the other hand, transitions related to industrial areas are heavily
constrained by policy factors, particularly the land use zoning policy (see T8 and T12
in Figure 5). This result may be because industrial areas are subject to relatively strict
government regulations due to their environmental

contrast, transitions between forests, agriculture and low-density and low-rise buildings

and low-rise buildings; this indicates relatively soft regulations of these behaviours.

impact and social concerns.

We further explore the main and auxiliary neighbourhood eﬀects by examining the
importance scores of land use enrichment variables with varying neighbourhood size
(see Figure 6). In general, the importance scores of the main neighbourhood eﬀect
decrease with the neighbourhood size, whereas the importance scores of the auxiliary
neighbourhood eﬀect increase with the neighbourhood size. This result may reﬂect the
distinct rationale behind the main and auxiliary neighbourhood eﬀects; the former
follows the expanding rule whereby a nearby neighbourhood has a greater impact,
whereas the latter represents the inﬂuence of more general characteristics of the local
area.

5.3. Varying modelling performances

Tables 5 and 6 show a signiﬁcant modelling performance variation among diﬀerent
types of land use transition. Such variation may result from variations in the degree of
spatial autocorrelation and/or variations in the land use transition characteristics. For
instance, in our results, the transition to IRL mainly occurs around the harbour. Hence
this transition has the highest spatial autocorrelation compared to the other two

transitions beginning from industrial areas that occur in more dispersed areas, and this
transition exhibits a higher modelling performance.

We provide two examples in which speciﬁc characteristics of a transition lead to
signiﬁcantly high or low performances. Usually, LUC modelling should consider the two
processes: discarding the functionality of the current land use and accepting the
functionality of a new usage. However, transitions from vacant land to other land uses
only consider the latter process, because although vacant land has certain economical
value depending on factors such as location and ownership, it has almost no industrial
or ecological contribution.

This particular characteristic may lead to a relatively simple and straightforward
transition rule that can be more easily addressed by statistical models and produce
the exceptionally high modelling performances. On the contrary, the modelling of
transitions between forest, agriculture and low-density and low-rise buildings achieves
relatively poor performances compared to the other transitions because these land use
types are mainly privately owned; low-density and low-rise buildings mainly consist of
residential buildings, and more than half of the forest areas in Japan are privately
owned. Therefore, individual decision-making seems to play an important role in deter-
mining the transition rules between the three land use types, and its absence in the LUC
modelling could undermine the predictive performances.

6. Concluding remarks

This study used an integrated approach based on a tree-based model and a CA model to
simulate multiple LUC processes in the Greater Tokyo Area, focusing on the application
of tree-based methods and the interpretation of the urban dynamics. We used 4 tree-
based models (BT, RF, ERT and bagged GBDT) to predict the transition probability of LUC
processes and compared the predictive performances of these methods with MLP and
among themselves. All the tree-based models outperformed NN, and among them, ERT
showed the best predictive performance in this multiple LUC modelling task. The results
indicate that bagging provides a greater performance improvement for DT than boost-
ing, and the introduction of randomisation into the bagging algorithm improves the
predictive performance. The results of this study indicate that the integration of tree-
based methods and CA is an eﬀective approach for multiple LUC modelling.

In addition to the outstanding predictive ability, tree-based models also provide insights
into the driving factors of LUC processes and help us to understand the complex urban
dynamics. In terms of this study, the land use neighbourhood characteristics have the
strongest impact on LUC in the target area, but their explanatory powers in various LUC
processes vary. Moreover, the impact depends on the neighbourhood land use type and the
neighbourhood size; the neighbourhood eﬀect of end land use generally decreases with the
neighbourhood size, whereas the neighbourhood eﬀects of other land uses generally
increase with the neighbourhood size. The signiﬁcant inﬂuence of a large neighbourhood
was reported in previous studies (Hagoort et al. 2008, Van Vliet et al. 2013), and the ﬁndings
of this study further elucidated the additional details of the relationship between the
strength of the neighbourhood eﬀect, the neighbourhood size and the land use type. We
also found that socio-economic factors, particularly land prices, have a strong inﬂuence on
the transitions from various land use types to high-rise buildings, indicating their important

roles in urban redevelopment. Furthermore, land use zoning policies act as strong con-
straints on the LUCs associated with industrial areas but have little inﬂuence on the changes
between forests, agricultural lands and low-density and low-rise buildings.

The approach developed in this study, which combined the predicted transition
probability and driving factor analysis, can provide comprehensive evidence for gener-
ating detailed and eﬀective zoning legislation for various urban land use types in
metropolitan. In addition, the approach can be used to generate the multiple land use
maps, which are useful inputs for various environmental modelling tasks, such as air
pollution modelling and carbon footprint analysis, where the diﬀerentiation of natural
land use and various built-up types is essential.

There are several limitations that can be improved upon in future studies. To provide
reliable land use forecasts, the forecasting ability of the integrated model needs to be
veriﬁed, as this study does not provide one due to data limitations.
In addition,
incorporation of individual decisions would enhance the predictive performances of
the approach, especially when estimating the transitions between forest, agriculture
and low-density and low-rise buildings. In future studies, we recommend combining
current model with agent-based modelling (Matthews et al. 2007), which is a common
approach to modelling the interaction between individual-related factors and LUC.

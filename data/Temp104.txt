Editorial Preface

p. 157 UKCC National Report to ICA 2011-Special Issue August 2011

Every 4 years, the International Cartographic Association
(ICA) meets for its General Assembly. In 2011, this is
held in Paris, France. As part of the work of the ICA, each
member country provides a report
to the General
Assembly that describes and documents cartographic
developments in the 4 years since the previous General
Assembly. The National Cartographic Committee for the
UK has published the UK report as an issue of The
Cartographic Journal since 2004 and it has proven to be
both an excellent vehicle for the report and been very well
received. It not only showcases the cartographic work in
the UK but presents it in a format that illustrates the
importance that we attach to academic and commercial
cartography.

For this national report, we are once again indebted to
David Forrest for commissioning and collating the material.
This time he has been ably assisted by Assistant Journal Editor
Alexander Kent and Steve Chilton, Chair of the Society of
Cartographers. The report provides a window on the state of
cartography in the UK including contributions from Ordnance
Survey and a range of
invited essays on contemporary
cartographic themes. It also includes shorter contributions
from academic and commercial organisations. My thanks to
David and his team for putting this issue together to add to the
previous reports published in The Cartographic Journal.

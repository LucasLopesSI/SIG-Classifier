An Assessment of the Accuracy of
Triangulated Irregular Networks (TINs)
and Lattices in ARC/INFO

Kai Wang and Chor-Pang Lo

Abstract
This paper evaluates the accuracy of triangulated irregular networks (TINs) and
lattices in ARC/INFO. The results of an empirical comparison of the two models
over two selected topographic sites are presented. Both vector and raster data were
used to build the models. Three pairs of models were constructed based on 1,600,
4,000, and 9,000 sample points for the study area of the State Botanical Garden of
Athens, Georgia, and 400, 800, and 1,600 sample points for the study area of Lake
Lucerne of Wisconsin. The two models were assessed based on the same number of
input sample points. Overall, TINs performed better than lattices. The quality of
lattices decreased more dramatically than that of TINs when the number of sample
points used for the construction of the models decreased. With an increase in the
number of sample points used, the difference in performance between the two
models decreased. The results of the evaluation directly depend on the comparison
criteria and modeling algorithms. The evaluation is slightly sensitive to test indices
used and the distribution of test points. The spatial pattern of residuals on spot
heights was quite different from that on randomly selected test points. Users
should choose models carefully based on the purpose of their application, the
accuracy required, and the computer resources that are available.

Introduction

Due to the dominant role of topography in many natural processes, terrain models,
especially digital terrain models, are widely used to approximate terrain surfaces
(Moore et al 1994, p 7). Digital terrain models provide generalized surfaces with which
terrain information can be depicted and utilized more efficiently. Digital terrain model
(DTM) is a general concept including all terrain models in digital formats and

involving not only heights and elevations but other geographical elements and natural
features, such as rivers, ridge lines, etc (Petrie 1990, p 3).

There are at least three methods which can be used to record elevation data in
digital form: contours, regular grids (e.g. DEMs), and irregular networks (e.g. TINs),
among which DEMs and TINs are the most popular. A DEM represents a surface as a
matrix of equally-spaced sample points of elevations. There are two approaches to
determine the elevation (Z value) of a location between sample points (ESRI 1991):

(1) The Z value is interpolated using adjacent sample points. This method is used by
lattices in ARC/INFO. A lattice represents a surface using an array of equally-
spaced sample points (called ‘‘mesh points’’) that are referenced to a common
origin and have a constant sample distance in two orthogonal directions.

(2) Each sample point is treated as a cell. All locations within the cell are assumed to
have the same Z value as the sample point located in the center of the cell. The
resultant surface is called a grid in ARC/INFO.

Both lattices and grids use the same data model. The only difference lies in the
interpolation methods. A lattice represents topography as a continuous surface whereas
a grid represents topography as a discrete surface in which elevations are the same
within each cell. No conversion between lattice and grid is required. A TIN depicts a
surface as a set of non-overlapping contiguous triangular facets of irregular sizes and
shapes. The triangles are usually built based on the Delaunay triangulation criterion so
that when three points are joined to make a triangle, the circle passing through all three
vertices of that triangle will not encompass any of the other data points. All sample
points are connected with their nearest neighbors to form triangles so that potential
numerical precision problems (especially in long thin triangles) can be largely
prevented.

The lattice uses the raster data model. In this model, no storage is required for
recording the planimetric coordinates of each sample point. The coordinates of sample
points are known based on the distance between sample points and the origin, which is
at the lower-left corner of the minimum bounding rectangle enclosing all of the lattice
mesh points (ESRI 1991). The distance defines the resolution of a lattice. A TIN utilizes
the vector topological data model. TINs require much more storage space per point
than do lattices since all three coordinates (XYZ) and the topology must be explicitly
stored. The X- and Y-coordinates and Z values of the nodes of each triangle and the
topology of nodes, edges and triangles are encoded in a set of tables. According to ESRI
(1991, p 2–17), 68 bytes are needed for TINs to store each sample point as compared to
only 4 bytes for lattices.

The advantages of regular-gridded data models include the simplicity of the data
structure and ease of computation for surface analysis. In addition, there are many
acceptable data sources, such as satellite imagery, for raster data modeling. The fixed
sample distance (resolution) often represents a disadvantage of the raster model
because:

(1) A large amount of data redundancy occurs in gentle terrain.
(2) Raster data models are inefficient in capturing significant line and point features,
such as peaks, ridges and valleys compared with vector-based data models.

To represent
those features, an increase in resolution is necessary, which is
accomplished at the expense of increasing storage space. The advantages of TINs
include variable resolutions and an increased capability of capturing significant terrain
features. However, a TIN is a more complex data structure. Much more storage is
needed for encoding the geographic coordinates and topology. One important
difference between TINs and lattices is that TINs can take the original sample points
as their vertices of triangles to build the models, whereas the mesh points of lattices are
often resampled.

TINs may contain many more surface-specific points in high relief areas, such as
peaks, pits, saddle points, and points along streams and ridges. Lattices extract samples
from regularly spaced points which are independent of surface features. The above fact
led Peucker (1972) to claim that ‘surface-specific points have a higher information
content than surface-random points.’ Unfortunately, there is no easy way to compare
the ‘information content’.

Comparisons of terrain models have previously been performed by Mark (1975a)
and Kumler (1994). Each study used different criteria in their comparison. Mark
(1975a) compared grids and TINs based on digitization time and computer storage. He
compared the two models mainly with reference to the problem of estimating three
topographic parameters (i.e. local relief, mean slope, and hypsometric integral) over six
topographic samples of 7 by 7 km squares each selected from 1:50,000-scale
topographic maps. The local relief was measured as the difference between the highest
and lowest elevations within an area. The mean slope was defined by:

tan (cid:11) (cid:136) I(cid:133)N=L(cid:134)=0:6366

where N is the number of intersections between a set of traverse lines of the contours in
an area, L is the total length of the traverse lines, and I is the contour interval in the
same units as L.

Hypsometric integral (HI) was expressed as:

HI (cid:136)

a(cid:133)h(cid:134)dh

(cid:133)1

0

h (cid:136)

z (cid:255) zmin
zmax (cid:255) zmin

where a(h) is the relative area above a relative height (h). The relative height (h) is
defined by:

where z is the actual elevation and zmax and zmin are the highest and lowest elevations,
respectively (see Mark 1975b, p 167–73 for details). He discovered that ‘for all three
parameters,
it appears that a given level of precision can be obtained with less
digitization time and computer storage space using surface-specific points in place of
regular grids. The contrast is much more dramatic for local relief than it is from the
other two parameters’ (Mark 1975a, p 187). He estimated that a grid would take 55.4
times as long to digitize and 47.2 times as much storage space as a comparably accurate
TIN. Based on the above findings, Mark (1975a, p 187 ) pointed out that ‘the triangular
data sets were found to produce better results than the regular grids, even though the
latter averaged more than twice as many points.’

Kumler (1994) assessed the efficiencies of TINs and DEMs according to storage
space and accuracy. With the same storage, TINs contained one-tenth to one-third as
many points as corresponding DEMs. In a super TIN, only the X-, Y- and Z-
coordinates of points are stored and the topologies of the TIN are not stored. Kumler
compared the two models over a wide variety of surfaces. Twenty-five study areas in
a series of different physiographic provinces of the U.S. were used in his comparison.
He carefully examined many factors which might affect the results of the comparison.
For example, to prevent potential biases, he used three types of test points: DLG spot
heights, Jiggled Grid, and dispersed points. Since spot heights tend to be situated at
special places, such as peaks and intersections of significant cultural features, he
concluded that the appropriateness of using spot heights as test points was suspect.
The Jiggled Grid test points comprised a coarse regular array of points extracted from
contour lines. There are two problems with Jiggled Grid test points. First, there is a
relatively high probability that the test points coincide with TIN vertices since TINs
take original sample points as their vertices. This approach favors TINs in the
comparison when the TINs are constructed from contour data, even though the
contours have smoothed the landscape. Second, they are selected in such a way that
all points are regularly distributed along the horizontal direction. This ‘planar
alignment’ of test points may not be appropriate for the comparison to the extent that
there are perodicities in the arrangement of terrain features (Kumler 1994, p 14).
These two problems prompted Kumler to create another set of dispersed test points
by randomly selecting points from topographic maps. Based on the results of these
comparisons, Kumler (1994, p 39) concluded that ‘the contour-based TINs developed
here are not more efficient than gridded DEMs at modeling terrain found in the
United States.’

Many authors (e.g. Lee 1991, Kumler 1994, Wood 1996) have noted that
comparing terrain models with different structures and model sizes is somewhat
difficult and establishing a definite supremacy between gridded DEMs and TINs is
usually impossible because the different data structures and/or model sizes have
different information content (Lee 1991). The accuracy of models is apparently affected
by the number of sample points used to build the models. Generally, the more points
used, the more accurate the model should be. Thus, in this paper, the two models to be
compared, TINs and lattices, were built using the same number of sample points. One
reason for doing this is that simply increasing the storage space of a model without
improving modeling algorithms and interpolation methods will not change the
accuracy of the model. For example, X- and Y-coordinates of mesh points in a lattice
can be explicitly encoded. The change in the coding method increases the storage space
of the lattice, but it will not increase the accuracy of the lattice. In this sense, the
accuracy of a model is independent of the storage space of the model. The accuracy
(more specifically vertical accuracy) of a model was determined by the deviation
between the model and the original data set using test points.

The objectives of this paper are to: (1) assess the relative accuracies of lattices and
TINs, (2) quantify the difference in performance for different sets of test points, and
(3) to examine the effect of different test points on the estimation of accuracy of the
two models. Findings from this research will help users to choose the appropriate
digital
terrain model based on considerations of accuracy, storage space, and
processing time.

2 Description of Study Areas and Data Sources

Two study areas were selected for the comparison. Study Area I is located at the State
Botanical Garden, Athens, Georgia and its vicinity (Figure 1). This study area covered
4.44 km2 with elevations ranging from 164 m to 220 m. The elevation data included
both contour lines (5-foot contour interval) and spot heights. These data were digitized
from a 1:2,400-scale topographic map of the area (using ARC/INFO version 6.0). This
study area exemplified the moderate relief typical of humid mesothermal forest
environments dominated by fluvial processes.

Study Area II covers the same area as the Lake Lucerne, WI 7.5 minute
topographic map quadrangle (Figure 2). A USGS DEM covering the area was used for
building these models. To reduce the data size of the tested DEM, a matrix of 67 rows
by 66 columns was clipped from the center of the original DEM file with an area of 4
km2 (similar to that of Study Area I). This area avoided lakes and contained

interpolation. These methods compute the output mesh point value from the values
of the four nearest input mesh points using inverse distance algorithms (ESRI 1991, p
2–22). The LINEAR and QUINTIC interpolators can be used to construct TIN surface
models. The LINEAR interpolator was chosen for this study because it is more similar
to the bilinear interpolator in that they both are local interpolators and it represents
topography as a non-smooth and continuous surface. The LINEAR interpolator fits a
plane of the form Z=a1 + a2X + a3Y to each triangle in a TIN. To minimize the
impact of different methods of interpolation (LINEAR interpolator for TINs and

two models. The number ranges from 400 points (equivalent to 100 m grid resolution)
to 9,000 points (equivalent to 20 m resolution).

For Study Area I, lattice and TIN models were constructed using 1,600, 4,000, and
9,000 points. A series of experiments were performed to create the models of the
specified sizes. The CREATETIN command with the COVER and POINT options in
the ARC/INFO TIN module was used to construct TINs with elevations from both
contour lines and spot heights. The size of the TINs was controlled by specifying
certain weed and proximal tolerances. The lattices of different sizes were built
separately using contour lines and spot heights with the LINEGRID and POINTGRID

The three types of test points used in Kumler’s (1994) study were adopted in Study

Area I with a few modifications (Figure 1):

(1) Spot Heights (SH): Thirty spot heights were randomly selected from the 149 spot
heights in Study Area I. These 30 spot heights were withheld for test purposes to
prevent possible biases. These test points were not used to build TINs or lattices.
(2) Extracted Points (EP): Thirty such points were randomly selected from contour

lines.

(3) Dispersed Points (DP): Thirty dispersed points were chosen by randomly dropping
a pencil on the topographic map. The elevations of these test points were
interpolated from the nearest contour lines or spot heights using the inverse
distance method (Lam 1983).

For Study Area II, the grid points in the USGS DEM (67*66 = 4,422 points) were
used as test points. The elevation differences for all the grid points were computed for
the two models. Test points selected from the topographic map could not be used for
this evaluation because of the difference between the topographic map and the DEM as
well as errors associated with USGS 30 m DEMs (Allder et al 1983, Carter 1989).

To study the spatial patterns of the residuals (by subtracting the true Z values from
the predicted Z values of the test points), weighting matrices of distances between test
test points were calculated using the

spatial patterns of the residuals of Study Area II were not examined because of the
limitation of computer capability, i.e. it is difficult to calculate the distances between
4,422 points and to compute spatial autocorrelation coefficients with a matrix of 4,422
by 4,422 using a PC or small workstation.

The elevations of test points were measured using the TINSPOT (LINEAR
method) and LATTICESPOT (bilinear method) commands in the appropriate ARC/

in SAS and Quattro Pro.

4 Results and Discussion

As stated above, the accuracy of a model was defined by the deviation between the
modeled surface and the surface described by the original contour maps or DEM. The
smaller the discrepancy, the more accurate is the model.

The two summary statistics reported in Table 1 were calculated using all 90 test
points for Study Area I and 4,422 grid points for Study Area II. The mean absolute
residual is the average value of all absolute residuals. The absolute residuals are used to
avoid the offset of positive and negative values (Lee 1991). The Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) is defined as:

X

RMSE (cid:136) (cid:137)

(cid:133)ei (cid:255) e(cid:134)2=n(cid:138)1

2

(cid:133)4(cid:134)

where ei is the residual at location i, (cid:22)e is the mean of all the residuals, and n is the
number of observations.

The results summarized in Table 1 show:

(1) The accuracy of both models measured in terms of mean absolute residuals and

RMSEs increased with an increase in the number of input sample points.

(2) TINs performed consistently better than lattices of the same sizes.

To examine the differences between the two models and within the two models,
Wilcoxon two-sample tests were conducted (Table 2). The tests indicated that the
difference between the 4000-point TIN and the 4000-point lattice and that between the
1,600-point TIN and the 1,600-point lattice in Study Area I are significantly different at
the 99 percent level of confidence. A similar conclusion can be applied to the
differences between the two models of all three sizes in Study Area II. However, the
difference between the 9,000-point TIN and the 9,000-point lattice in Study Area I was
not significant. These results suggest that: (1) TINs produce superior results compared
to lattices when a small number of sample points are used; and (2) the differences

between the two models become small and the two models can compete against each
other when the density of the input data increases.

When comparing the same models with different sizes for Study Area I, the 9,000-
point and 4,000-point lattices are significantly better than the 1,600-point lattice. In
addition, the 9,000-point TIN is significantly superior to both the 4,000- and 1,600-
point TINs. Meanwhile, for Study Area II, the differences between TINs and the same
size lattices are all significant, thus confirming that TINs are better than lattices when a
similar number of sample points are used. Finally, the differences among all three
lattices are statistically significant while those among all three TINs are statistically
insignificant. This result shows that the quality of lattices decreases more rapidly than
that of TINs as sample size decreases.

The quality of models is affected by the modeling algorithms and distribution of
input data as well as the quantity of input data. Li (1994) showed that the quality of
DEMs can be improved by adding surface specific points in the creation of DEMs.
Carrara et al (1997) showed that Intergraph’s MGE Terrain Modeler can produce
much better TINs than ARC/INFO’s ArcTin when surface specific points inferred
from contour lines are utilized.

More detailed breakdowns of the errors calculated for the different test points are
reported in Table 3 to show the effect of the choice of test points on the evaluation
results. These results confirm that TINs outperformed the lattices in all but two of the
cases. The 4,000 sample point lattice performed slightly better than the same sized TIN

when the dispersed test points and mean absolute residual were utilized for the
evaluation, and the 1,600 sample point lattice performed better than the equivalent
TIN when the RMSE and dispersed points were used for the evaluation.

Comparing the quality of TINs of different sizes using the same types of test points
(e.g. errors for the 1,600-point TIN on SH versus errors on 4,000- and 9,000-point TINs
on SH) showed that the quality of the TINs increased with increasing numbers of
sample points. The lattice results were less consistent. For example, the RMSEs
computed with spot heights and extracted points for the 1,600 point lattice were
smaller than those computed for the 4,000 point lattice. Several authors have illustrated
that using one or two global measures to compare models is dangerous (e.g. Lee 1991,
Lee et al 1992, Kumler 1994, Wood 1996). Each measure has its limitations. For
example, one large error in a model would greatly increase the RMSE and invalidate
the model. This study shows that the comparisons conducted here are slightly sensitive
to the test indices used (e.g. mean absolute residual and RMSE) and the distribution of
test points. Table 3 also shows that in most cases, the errors on spot heights are smaller
than those on both extracted points and dispersed points because the variations of
terrain surfaces around spot heights are smaller than those around extracted points and
dispersed points in Study Area I.

For a variable with a regular spatial pattern, spatial autocorrelation occurs when
the values of the variable at a set of locations depend on values of the same variable at
other locations (Odland 1987). Moran’s Index is often used to evaluate the spatial
pattern of the residuals as follows:

j(cid:136)1 Wij

where W is the weighting matrix, E is the vector of residuals, and E0 is the transposed
matrix of E (Clark and Hosking 1986, p 393). The value of Moran’s I usually varies
from (cid:255)1 to 1 with (cid:255)1 indicating strongly negative autocorrelation (systematic
distribution), 0 indicating no autocorrelation (random distribution), and 1 indicating
strongly positive autocorrelation (clustered distribution).

Moran’s index values were calculated separately for each of the three types of test
points in Study Area I (Table 4). The results demonstrate that the spatial pattern of
residuals using spot heights is quite different from that using either extracted points or
dispersed points. The null hypothesis that spatial autocorrelation is displayed by the
residuals was rejected based on Z tests for the extracted and dispersed points. Hence,
the results for extracted points and dispersed points were all randomly distributed. The
Z tests on the Moran’s indices of spot heights failed to reject the null hypothesis,
indicating that the spatial pattern of residuals of spot heights on both the TINs and
lattices were clustered. Thus, users should be careful when using spot heights
exclusively as test points. Most statistical tests are based on random sampling theory
that requires that all points in a population should have the same chance of being
measured and tested. Points that are all located at specific locations (e.g. peaks) are not
suited to accuracy assessments (Li 1991, p 1339). The use of test points which are not
distributed randomly across the landscape of interest may invalidate the testing results.
Good test points should be both very accurate and randomly distributed.

Wilcoxon two-sample tests were also conducted to examine the effect of different
test points on the accuracy estimates (Table 5). These results indicate that residuals
using spot heights as test points do behave differently from those using extracted points
and dispersed points at a 90 percent level of confidence. Meanwhile, the difference in
residuals between extracted and dispersed points is negligible.

A closer examination of the distribution of spot height test points in Figure 1
showed that spot heights are often located at local extremes, such as peaks and pits,
and along roads. Thus, those spot heights only represent very limited portions of the
surface and the appropriateness of using the spot heights as the only test points is in
doubt. The dispersed points are randomly selected and distributed across the whole
study area. Of the three sets of test points used for Study Area I, the dispersed points
may possess the highest reliability for testing purposes. The evaluations of the residuals
using both spatial autocorrelation analysis and the Wilcoxon two-sample test results
indicate that there is no significant difference between extracted and dispersed points
although the extracted points may lie on the same elevation planes. Thus, the
evaluation using extracted points and dispersed points as test points may give more
reliable results than that based on spot heights. Since errors on extracted and dispersed
points are randomly distributed, it can be concluded that the two models performed
nearly equally well on different terrain surfaces in the two study areas.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, three sizes of TINs and lattices were constructed over two study areas to
compare the vertical accuracy of the two models. Overall, TINs were found to be more
accurate than lattices with the same number of points. The higher accuracy of TINs is

largely due to the fact that TINs honor and use the original data points to form the
vertices of the triangles (Petrie 1990). When the sample size increased, the accuracy of
the two models generally increased and the differences between TINs and lattices
decreased. The difference between the two models was insignificant when the densities
of sample points were very high (e.g. 9,000 points in Study Area I).

Users need to be careful about selecting test points to compare models. The
residuals of spot heights behaved quite differently from those of the randomly selected
test points, even though those spot heights have higher accuracy. In this study, the
errors of the two models were randomly distributed spatially when randomly selected
test points were used. Based on these findings, one can view the accuracy issue in light
of the computer processing time and disk space of the computer platform used to build
the terrain models. It is quite difficult to compare models with different structures and
sizes that have different information contents without any bias. The results of the
evaluation directly depend on the criteria employed, modeling algorithms, test indices
used, and distribution of test points.

The authors are grateful to Dr J Thill and Dr L Usery for their constructive comments
and Dr Y Xie for supplying DEM data for this study. They are also appreciative of the
comments and suggestions made by two anonymous reviewers and Professor John
Wilson on an earlier draft that helped to improve the final paper.

During World War II, between September 1943 and April 1944, temporary Royal Engineers officers W. B. R. King and F. W.
Shotton remotely generated water supply maps at a scale of 1 : 50 000 for coastal areas of northern France eastward from the
Cherbourg peninsula to Calais: the first series of British groundwater development potential maps. These maps guided drilling
of at least 30 boreholes, needed to supply water to British installations in Normandy following the Allied landings that
commenced on D-Day, 6 June 1944: part of the infrastructure necessary to facilitate the ensuing mobile campaign.
Additionally, between April and September 1944, Shotton and King assisted by the Cambridge academic Maurice Black
similarly compiled maps but 1 : 250 000 in scale for northern France eastwards from Brittany into Belgium. These guided
emplacement of at least 20 Royal Engineer boreholes in Belgium during late 1944 and early 1945, part of the infrastructure for
the final advance of Allied troops into Germany. Between November 1944 and May 1945, maps also at 1 : 250 000 and of
similar but developing style were prepared for much of northern Germany by W. R. Williams and J. R. Foster-Smith, also
temporary Royal Engineers officers but of the Inter-Service Topographical Department, easing the pressure of work on
Shotton and his colleagues generated by campaign momentum. One of these maps guided emplacement of the few British
boreholes sited in western Germany by May 1945, as the war in Europe came to an end. Overall, British military maps were
innovations distinct in style from water supply maps compiled for contemporary German or US forces. They helped to pioneer
British hydrogeological mapping, which has developed extensively post-war but under entirely civilian auspices.

INTRODUCTION

This paper complements one recently published in The
Cartographic Journal (Rose, 2009) that examined water
supply maps for Belgium and northern France compiled by
British, German and American military geologists during
World War I. It extends analysis to World War II: to the
range of water supply maps for these and adjacent regions
innovatively compiled at different scales and in different
styles by geologist W. B. R. King and his prote´ge´ F. W.
Shotton, ﬁnally assisted by M. Black, and to maps prepared
by geologists of the Inter-Service Topographical Department
that extended coverage eastwards into Germany. These
wartime maps were mostly prepared under conditions of
great secrecy. They are scarcely mentioned in Clough’s
(1952) authoritative account of British Army maps and
survey of World War II, but the expertise developed to create
them helped lay a foundation for the rapid development of

British non-military hydrogeology post-war. Maps from the
two World Wars thus provide support for the contention that
military need has been a positive driver to the development of
the modern day, and now mature, science of hydrogeology

during the Great War (Rose, 2004a, 2009) were soon
demobilized. Preparation of water supply maps for use by
British armed forces duly ceased. However, on 3 September
1939, major war broke out
again. A new British
Expeditionary Force was quickly sent to northern France.
To provide expertise on water supply, it was accompanied
by the geologist who had undertaken this role in World War
I: William Bernard Robinson King (1889–1963).

W. B. R. King and F. W. Shotton: drivers of innovation
Demobilized in 1919, ‘Bill’ King had returned brieﬂy to a
post at the Geological Survey of Great Britain before
appointment in 1920 as a demonstrator and assistant to the
Woodwardian Professor of Geology at the University of
Cambridge. He became a fellow of Jesus College in 1920,
and of Magdalene College in 1922. While at Cambridge, he
published papers in academic journals based on his war
work in France, Survey work in Wales, Palaeozoic
stratigraphy and palaeontology, and Quaternary sedimen-
tary geology (Shotton, 1963; Rose, 2004b).

In 1931, he moved to the University of London to
become Professor of Geology at University College. More
followed, mostly on Palaeozoic or
research papers
Quaternary themes, but one on Chalk hydrogeology. His
teaching embraced nearly all the physical geology and
geography, part of the economic geology, the stratigraphy,
and the advanced geological mapping classes provided for
students in the geology department.

However, following the outbreak of World War II, King
(Figure 1) was called up from the Army Ofﬁcers Emergency
Reserve and appointed to a Regular Army Emergency
Commission in the Royal Engineers, as a second lieutenant
from 13 September 1939, but ‘war substantive captain’
from 13 December, and ‘temporary major’ from 26 August
1940 (Rose and Hughes, 1993a; Rose and Rosenbaum,
1993, 1998). In France, as a ‘local major’ with the British
Expeditionary Force, during the winter and spring of
1939/1940, he worked on a variety of problems such as the
siting of airﬁelds, the provision of stone and gravel as
construction materials, and water supply. In 1940, he
earned a Military Cross for bravery in convoying high
explosive from Boulogne to Bailleul and the British strong
point
evacuation from Dunkirk.
Seemingly, he made no new water supply maps for printing
during this period.

at Cassel, before

On return to England, King was attached to Northern
Command for a year, and then from 1941 to 1943 to
General Headquarters Home Forces, from which developed
Headquarters 21st Army Group. There he assisted planning
for the invasion of Normandy by initiating a variety of
studies, notably those into potential water supply, ground
trafﬁcability, availability of construction materials, and the
nature of beach sediments. Most importantly, he inﬂuenced
the decision to invade via the Calvados coast rather than the
Cotentin Peninsula south of Cherbourg because the
geological conditions were more favourable for
rapid
construction of temporary airﬁelds: deemed essential to
provide air superiority over the battleﬁeld (Rose and
Pareyn, 1995, 1998, 2003; Rose et al., 2006; Rose,
2008b). However, in October 1943, he was promoted to
the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and released from military

King was succeeded as the Staff Ofﬁcer (Geology) at

Frederick William Shotton (1906–1990)
Rosenbaum, 1993; Coope, 1994; Rose and Clatworthy,
2008a). ‘Fred’ Shotton (Figure 2) had been awarded a
scholarship to Sidney Sussex College in the University of
Cambridge in 1924, and achieved a distinguished academic
record. For ‘Part I’ of his BA degree, he read Natural
Science: Geology, Mineralogy and Chemistry, and achieved
ﬁrst class honours and the Wiltshire Prize. For ‘Part II’, he
read Natural Science: Geology, again being awarded ﬁrst
class honours, and (like Bill King in 1912) the Harkness
Scholarship.

Following graduation, Shotton was soon (in 1929)
appointed an assistant
in the
lecturer
University of Birmingham, and in 1930 promoted to the
grade of lecturer. In 1936, he moved to a more prestigious
lectureship, at the University of Cambridge.

in geology

While an undergraduate at Cambridge, Shotton had been
among those taught by Bill King, notably skills
in
geological mapping. King recognized in Shotton someone
suitable to assist him as a military geologist, should war
again break out. As World War II loomed, King had joined

also advised on other matters, such as road construction
materials, and sites for the rapid construction of temporary
airﬁelds.

Shotton remained in post until Italian and German forces
in North Africa ﬁnally capitulated, in Tunisia, in May 1943.
Allied troops from North Africa subsequently waged the
Sicilian Campaign of July–August 1943, and initiated the
Italian Campaign in September (Dear and Foot, 1995). But
in September, Shotton was recalled from the Middle East,
and the Sicilian and Italian Campaigns were supported
throughout by another British military geologist deployed
in a similar role: Captain (later Major) J. V. Stephens (Rose
and Clatworthy, 2007b). By October, Shotton was back in
the UK. There he succeeded his former mentor Bill King at
Headquarters 21st Army Group, as a ‘temporary major’
from 7 January 1944, developing studies that King had
initiated (Rose and Rosenbaum, 1993, 1998; Rose and
Pareyn, 2003; Rose et al., 2006), including the preparation
of water supply maps at a scale of 1 : 50 000 for northern
France. In this, as described by Rose et al. (2006) and
Robins et al. (2007), they were able to make use of medium
as well as small scale geological maps already reprinted by
the Geographical Section, General Staff (Figure 3), for a
part of Europe whose geology had long been generally well
known (Figure 4).

Water supply maps of the Cotentin Peninsula: a resource warning
Groundwater development potential (‘prospect’) maps, in
style a development of the Ground Water Inventory Maps
of the Ground Water Provinces of the United States (King,
1951), were prepared as tracing overlays to ﬁt correspond-
ing 1 : 50 000 topographical maps. Effort was concentrated
along the coastal area from Cap de la Hague on the north-
west tip of the Cotentin (Cherbourg) Peninsula, eastwards
through Bayeux and Caen to Le Havre and beyond to
Calais (Figure 5). This 250 km long stretch of coast
comprises extensive low lying beach and dune areas as well
as cliffs, eroded in the west into rocks of the Armorican
Massif and in the east into the Mesozoic sediments which
form the north-western margin of the Paris Basin.

The bedrock geology of the Amorican Massif comprises
strong crystalline basement (cf. Figure 4): largely granites,
schists and ‘grits’ (highly indurated medium to coarse-
grained sandstones) of very ancient (Precambrian and
Palaeozoic) age, all of which have a low porosity and
potentially poor groundwater yield. The overlying Paris
Basin sequence,
initiated by Triassic sandstones and
conglomerates, is of much younger and weaker sedimentary
rocks: largely sandstones and limestones which are more
porous or at least more permeable and so form potential
aquifers, alternating with impermeable clays. Basin sedi-
ments young and dip regionally at a few degrees to the east,
the Triassic being succeeded by a much thicker sequence of
Jurassic marls, clays and especially limestones,
in turn
succeeded from Le Havre and the Seine estuary north-
eastwards by Cretaceous sands and clays overlain by a thick
sequence of Chalk, interrupted by an inlier near Boulogne
where older strata are exposed in the core of a local
anticline. Most of the bedrock in northern France bears a
thin Quaternary cover: raised beach deposits intermittently
along coastal margins, alluvium in river valleys, and an

Commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers.
Initially, he was assigned to assist King in making ground
investigations for anti-aircraft gun sites in Nottinghamshire.
In May 1941, however, Shotton embarked for service in
the southern Mediterranean region, as the geologist at
General Headquarters of the British Middle East forces.
Based in Egypt, at Cairo, he served under the Director of
Works, Major-General E. C. (later Sir Eustace) Tickell,
being promoted to the ranks of ‘war substantive lieutenant’
and ‘temporary captain’ on 1 November 1941. His status
was that of a Captain (Electrical and Mechanical), since
there was no established post for a geologist as such (Rose
and Rosenbaum, 1993, 1998). His responsibility was for
guiding British military geological activities in North Africa
and the Middle East. He dealt mainly with provision of
groundwater supplies for army camps and the technical
direction of three Royal Engineers well-drilling units, but

German military geologists in order to maximize water
supply from relatively meagre groundwater resources (Rose,
2005, 2008a; Robins and Rose, 2005).

Sheet 5E/2 Beaumont-Hague (Figure 6) covers the
north-west tip of the Peninsula. Apart from the coastal
dunes (for which no groundwater information is provided),
three rock types are mapped: slates, hard sandstones and
granite. For each of these, information concerning likely
groundwater conditions is written within the map itself. For
slates, the annotation records ‘Wells will have poor yields.
Springs probably numerous, but with very small yields.
Liable to fail in droughts’. Two areas of hard sandstone are
shown, one small (‘too small to support large springs’) and
the other much larger (with hachured area annotated ‘Best
springs of this area along this zone’). The main granite area
is annotated ‘Shallow wells expected to yield a few hundred
gallons per diem. Springs only small yield. Streams probably
very small ﬂow during droughts’. Since much of the map is
occupied by sea, this space is used to record two further
sentences of regional signiﬁcance: ‘None of this [land] area
is suitable for the sinking of deep boreholes for water. The
streams which rise in the zone marked [by hachure] are
expected to be the most reliable during droughts’.

Sheet 5E/4 Les Pieux (Figure 7) lies immediately south
of the Beaumont-Hague sheet (cf. Figure 5). The same four
rock units occur as on the northern sheet, as now made
clear by means of a key (showing from top to bottom
‘sandstones, slates, granite, dunes’). However, no ground-
water information is embedded in the map itself: wording
on the map refers only to rock type, slightly amplifying the
description provided by the key. All the groundwater data
are grouped together as a series of notes, in large font, in
the otherwise blank (marine) area to the top left of the
map.

Sheet 6E/1 Cherbourg depicts the region immediately
east of the Beaumont-Hague map (cf. Figure 5) and in
similar style: water supply data are embedded in the map.
These comprise three statements: ‘Hard sandstones and
slates – Small springs of doubtful yield in summer. Shallow
wells with small yields’; ‘Slates and granite – Shallow wells
with small yields. Surface streams small but numerous’;
‘Sands and pebble beds – Surface water rather scarce.
Shallow wells with fair yields’. A line of springs is shown,
but only two rock units are mapped: ‘sand lands’ and ‘slates,
granite, etc., impermeable’, and like the Les Pieux rather
than Beaumont-Hague sheet, these are indicated by a key in
the offshore blank space of the map. There are no associated
notes. Sheet 6E/3&4 Valognes immediately to the south
(cf. Figure 5) follows exactly the same style as this map, but
fen
the key distinguishes ﬁve rock units: dune sands,
deposits, clay lands, sand lands, and ‘slates, granite, etc.,
impermeable’ (Rose, 2008c, Figure 5). Sheet 6E/5 La
Haye du Puits, further to the south, follows the same style
as the Valognes sheet except that, being an area almost
entirely inland, there is insufﬁcient blank space for a key
within the map area – and no key is provided.

All these maps thus depict the major rock types, record
likely yields from shallow wells and streams according to
rock type, and make varying but effective use of the space
within the frame of the map sheet to summarize informa-
tion. Little of the ﬁve maps indicates any region where

extensive blanket of loess over much of the remaining
terrain.

A series of 25 water supply trace maps1 (Figure 5) was
completed between September 1943 and April 1944 (Rose
et al., 2006, Table 3). Of these, 10 maps covering the east
of the region (from Fe´camp, north of Le Havre, to Calais)
and ﬁve covering the Cotentin Peninsula to the far west
were printed in September 1943 and so were presumably
generated by Bill King,
in the early phases of invasion
planning, before Fred Shotton’s return to the UK from
North Africa in that month. Marginal data show that only
150 copies of each map were printed – possibly either
because it was already clear by that time that they would not
be of major use, or because as ‘secret’ documents the early
print run was constrained so as to minimize the risk of
security breach. The other 10 maps were printed in March
and April 1944, and authorship is speciﬁcally attributed to
‘Major F. W. Shotton RE’. The print run was slightly
higher: typically 250 copies. These maps covered the region
which embraced the ﬁve beaches actually used for the D-
Day landings on 6 June 1944.

The Cotentin Peninsula bedrock is mostly Armorican
basement, and the ﬁve water supply maps of this area are
therefore the simplest in the series. To the west, similar rock
types on the Channel Islands, then occupied by German
troops, had necessitated intensive long-term study by

The Armorican Massif from the Cotentin Peninsula of Normandy westwards across Brittany is shown (by dark colour) to comprise largely old

water could be obtained by drilling deep wells for ground-
water abstraction. However, as a group, they were highly
innovative from a British perspective in at
four
respects. First, the scale of 1 : 50 000 was more detailed
than any British hydrogeological mapping of World War I
(which, apart from six tracing overlays at 1 : 40 000 to show
water table contours within Chalk, was otherwise at scales
of 1 : 100 000 and 1 : 250 000) (Rose, 2009). Second,
these were the ﬁrst British maps published to depict
potential groundwater conditions in a basement region:
British hydrogeological mapping of World War I was
conﬁned to regions underlain by near-surface sedimentary

bedrock of Mesozoic or Cenozoic age. Third, the set of 25
constitutes the ﬁrst series of groundwater development
potential maps ever to be prepared by British hydrogeol-
ogists: the few ‘prospect’ maps from World War I (Rose,
2009) were isolated examples rather than a coherent series.
Fourth, they were printed as tracing overlays for use with
topographical maps, rather than as an overprint directly
onto a simpliﬁed base map as typical for all British and other
water supply maps, except the six water table contour
traces, during World War I (Rose, 2009).

In showing so clearly that the Cotentin Peninsula would
not yield the signiﬁcant amounts of water from wells and

unfavourable ground given by Bill King’s map of earlier
1943 (Rose et al., 2006, Figures 9–11). This showed that
the Peninsula would not generally yield sites suitable for the
rapid construction of temporary airﬁelds. They thus helped
to conﬁrm the choice of Calvados as a more suitable region
for the invasion bridgehead.

Water supply maps of the Calvados region: a satisfactory guide to
resource use
To the east of
the Cotentin Peninsula, progressively
younger sedimentary rocks of the Paris Basin occur along
the coast: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous in age, with
increasing width of outcrop. The Calvados plateau region of
Normandy centred on Caen and Bayeux is underlain
principally by Middle Jurassic limestones and intervening
clays (bright blue on Figure 4), and the city of Caen has
beneﬁted since 1890 from a water supply drawn from the
local aquifers. Of these, the main two in the bedrock
beneath the city are in Bathonian and predominantly
Bajocian limestones, respectively upper and lower lime-
stones separated by an intervening clay sequence (Robins
et al., 2007, Figure 3).

Of the 10 water supply maps for the Calvados region, all
compiled by Fred Shotton in 1944 (cf. Figure 5), the maps
used most intensively for the siting of British military
boreholes depict largely these Middle Jurassic limestones
and clays. Six shallow boreholes were drilled into

Quaternary alluvium adjacent to the River Drome, near

boreholes have been indicated on a subsequent map extract
by Robins et al. (2007, Figure 4). Nine boreholes were
drilled to tap the similar aquifers in the area immediately to
the south, covered by map sheet 7F/1 Caen. This map has
also been illustrated by Rose et al. (2006, Figure 16), and
the site locations of
subsequently
indicated on a map extract by Robins et al. (2007,

(6E/6) area west of Creully, within the region of a map
illustrated by Rose (2008b, Figure 12) and Rose and
Clatworthy (2008a, Figure 11), and two in the Troarn
area (7F/2) east of Caen (a map hitherto undescribed, but
illustrated here: Figure 8). Only one borehole was drilled
south of the area covered by water supply maps at scale of
1 : 50 000: at Versainville (on topographical sheet 7F/6).

its nine boreholes

The Troarn map (Figure 8) (cf. Figure 5) depicts an area
where limestone (of Mid Jurassic age) occurs in the west of
the region, dipping gently east beneath a thick sequence of
clays (of Late Jurassic age). The clays are weak rocks which
have been eroded by rivers to form lowlands, now largely

covered by superﬁcial deposits of alluvium and marsh. In
the bedrock sequence, the clays are followed by a thin
limestone (of latest Jurassic age) overlain by a ‘Greensand’
which is succeeded by Chalk (both rocks of Cretaceous
age). Unlike maps of the Cotentin Peninsula, but consistent
with other maps for the Calvados region (as illustrated by
Rose et al., 2006; Robins et al., 2007), this map is
accompanied by a key drawn in the sheet margin. Like the
Creully, Caen and Isigny maps which also depict regions
including Mid Jurassic limestones, the Troarn map uses
contours to indicate the depth to the base of the limestone
sequence, as a guide to the area favouring drilling sites and
the likely maximum depths for boreholes. Military bore-
holes were indeed put down into the Jurassic limestone
within this region at Amfre´ville and Ouistreham (Table 1).
However, the terrain was marginal to the assault landing
areas and the sites of main base installations subsequently
developed by Allied troops. It therefore necessitated fewer
boreholes than the Creully, Caen and Isigny map areas.

The maps in this set thus maintained the 1 : 50 000 scale
for British water supply maps pioneered in the previous
year, but added a further innovation: depiction of a
sedimentary sequence that contained more than one
potential bedrock aquifer, in rocks of Jurassic age. British
water supply maps of World War I had focused on regions
underlain principally by sedimentary bedrock of Cretaceous
or Tertiary age (Rose, 2009), and focused also on the depth

north, the limestone is split underground by a thick clay series, and water occurs mainly in the upper limestone above this clay. The base of the lime-
stone is 45–65 m above the contoured surface’. A note in the right margin of the map explains the signiﬁcance of the adjacent line: ‘Fault line

to the main water table in both these sequences/regions.
However, the technique of showing contours for the base
of the main aquifer, to indicate maximum potential drilling
depths (Figure 8), was a technique already pioneered in
World War I (Rose, 2009, Figure 15), if not at the same
detailed scale.

Boreholes drilled in Normandy: water supply infrastructure for
advancing troops

of a bridgehead inland, the Calvados region was trans-
formed into the Rear Maintenance Area for

operations. Water had to be provided to all hospitals,
prisoner-of-war camps, convalescent depots, Navy, Army
and Air Force Institute rest and recreation centres, laundries
and other establishments needing copious supplies. Teams
for well drilling were therefore soon deployed by the Allies,
to supplement water obtainable from civilian wells and local
streams, rivers or canals. In the Anglo-Canadian (‘British’)
sector of operations, centred initially on the Bayeux to Caen
region, No. 8 Boring Platoon Royal Engineers was

deployed within Line of Communication Troops during the
build-up phase which began ﬁve days after the initial assault.
It was quickly supported by No. 6 Boring Platoon. The
Shotton Archive now preserved in the Lapworth Museum
of Geology at Birmingham reveals more of the activities of
these units (which were initially known as ‘Sections’ rather
than ‘Platoons’) than those of American or Canadian
drilling teams.

Their drilling results (Table 1) generally matched the
prognoses made on the water supply maps except for the
better yields that were found at the western margin of
the Bathonian ‘oolitic’ limestones (Robins et al., 2007).
Considering the circumstances under which the drilling
took place and the broad scale of the overlays, their
contribution to the success of
the operation seems
indisputable. An ofﬁcial military geological appraisal3
carried
that
post-war
‘Geological
intelligence on groundwater supply as given
on the Water Supply traces is sound and very useful and,
where an area is covered by traces to a scale of 1 : 50 000,
well-boring sections can operate with little or no geological
supervision’. One of these supposedly temporary military
boreholes was still providing water, but for local civilian
use, 50 years later (Rioult et al., 1994; Rose and Pareyn,
2003).

Figure 11. Carte ge´ologique internationale de l’Europe, feuille 24 (CIV), scale 1 : 1 500 000, published in Berlin by Dietrich Reimer, about
1898. Colouring as for Figure 4. The brown (Palaeozoic) rocks of the Ardennes Massif form a distinctive feature in the south-west corner of
the map. North of the Ardennes, the Belgian towns of Bruxelles [Brussels], Anvers [Antwerp] and Gand [Ghent] lie upon rocks of Cenozoic
age. South of the Ardennes, the eastern margin of the Paris Basin reveals Jurassic (blue) and Cretaceous (green) rocks younging westwards

(Figure 9, and Rose et al., 2006, Table 4). These covered
the whole of northern France from south-eastern Brittany
eastward into the Low Countries, towards Germany and
thus the enemy’s heartland. They were printed later than
the maps at 1 : 50 000, evidently to assist planning of a
subsequent phase of operations: the Allied advance inland
from the coastal region of Normandy once the base of
operations had been established. Seemingly, there was
insufﬁcient time to prepare overlays at 1 : 50 000 for so
large an area. Moreover, Allied troops were expected to
advance rapidly, without the need for base installations en
route that would necessitate copious supplies of potable

water and so require precise siting of boreholes rather than
merely general
information on surface and groundwater
conditions. Map scales of 1 : 50 000 and 1 : 250 000 were
those most widely adopted for Allied topographical use in
northern Europe (Clough, 1952), so water supply traces
were prepared correspondingly.

According to marginal data, the 1 : 250 000 water supply
maps were produced by the Engineer Section of the
Intelligence Division,
Supreme Headquarters Allied
Expeditionary Force, and printed by Map Reproduction
Sections of the Royal Engineers. The four earliest and most
westerly sheets (4, 7, 14 and 15) were compiled ‘in

conjunction with Major F. W. Shotton RE’ and printed
between April (and probably earlier for the two undated
maps, 7 and 14) and June 1944; the next six sheets (1, 2, 3,
5, 8 and 16) ‘in conjunction with Professor W. B. R. King,
O.B.E., M.C., of Cambridge University’ and printed in
August; and the three ﬁnal sheets in conjunction with King
plus ‘Doctor M. Black, Cambridge University’ jointly (6
and 17) or with Black alone (9), and all printed in
September.

After the breakout of the Allied armies from Normandy,
Shotton found the rapid advance eastward to Paris and the
River Seine in August 1944 generated more geological tasks
than he could cope with alone in the time available5. It
seems that King came to his technical support, although
then a civilian based in the University of Cambridge rather
than, like Shotton, a uniformed ofﬁcer deployed in the

theatre of operations. For the three ﬁnal maps in the series,
it seems too that King himself needed assistance to meet the
urgent requirement for map preparation – and that this was
provided at Cambridge by his geological colleague Dr
Maurice Black.

Yorkshire. Other pre-war papers on Yorkshire Jurassic
sediments were soon contributed to the Proceedings of
the Yorkshire Geological Society and of the Geologists’
Association of London. Pre-war Black also initiated studies
on the genesis and composition of carbonate rocks, and
contributed to the major revision of a standard textbook on
sedimentary petrology (Hatch et al., 1938). He had no
known hydrogeological or military training (other than
wartime service in the ‘Home Guard’ at Cambridge), but
Kennedy (2006, p. 108) has noted that as regards his
standing as a geologist, ‘those who knew him were deeply
impressed and inspired by his scholarship, and his judgment
and his advice were widely sought’.

Water supply maps of northern France: small scale for wide coverage
Ten of the 13 water supply maps covered northern France,
one (sheet 14; cf. Figure 9) essentially part of
the
Armorican Massif that dominates Brittany and western
Normandy (Figure 4), the other nine much of the Paris
Basin to the east (Figures 4 and 11). They thus treat mostly
with a region of predominantly Mesozoic sediments with
gentle inward dip, whose largest area of outcrop is of Upper
Cretaceous Chalk.

Only four maps from this set have so far been illustrated
or described, all of western areas: sheets 1 (Rose et al.,

Table 2. Key to water supply map illustrated as Figure 12
(Auxerre), unnumbered left symbol column ﬁrst, top to
bottom

1. Clayey sands of the Solance. Very impermeable. Many surface
ponds. Unsuitable for boreholes except near margin where
underlying permeable formation may give yield.
2. Mainly sands in north. Some shallow ponds held up by hardpan
formation. Mainly limestone with thin loam cover in south. Little
surface water except main streams. Most villages and farms supplied
by dug wells of limited yield. Suitable for boreholes, but will need
lining in sand area (further notes on sheet 15).
3. Paris Clay Group. Not suitable for boreholes except in marginal
area where Chalk is at no great depth. Boreholes will need lining
into Chalk.
4. Chalk. Areas where thick clay cover occurs on the plateau are
indicated on the map. Generally good for boreholes, especially in
the valleys where over 3000 gallons per hour [13.6 m3/h] may be
expected. Surface clay beds hold up water in ponds on plateaux.
These areas not so good for boreholes. Little running water except
in main rivers.
5. Marly Chalk similar to above, but with less certainty of getting
good results from boreholes.
6. Sands below the Chalk, passing northwards into a zone of
alternating sands and clays. In suitable places yields of 3000 g.p.h.
[13.6 m3/h] or more may be expected from boreholes.
7. Lower zone of alternating sands and clays. Sands should yield
good results from boreholes in favourable sites, particularly along
the north-west margin where they can be reached though the clayey
basal beds of the Chalk. Strainers and casing would be needed. The
alternating sands and clay may be expected to give yields of the
order of 1000 g.p.h. [4.5 m3/h] from boreholes.
8. Rubbly limestones. Little surface water except main rivers. Part
marked as (a) [left of symbol] will probably give good results from
boreholes, part (b) [right of symbol] much more doubtful. Each
site must be carefully selected.
9. Clays generally unsuitable for boreholes, unless underlying
limestone is within 50 feet [15 m] of surface.
[Additional note] The thick alluvium of the main rivers should yield
much water from the gravel beds with water level not more than
twenty feet [6 m] from the surface.

2006, Figure 20), 4 (Robins et al., 2007, Figure 9), 7
(Rose et al., 2006, Figure 19) and 14 (Rose, 2008c,
Figure 6), three with assistance from Shotton and one with
assistance from King. Since the land area covered by King’s
map (sheet 1: the Boulogne coastal region) was small, it is
not a very extensive example of his handiwork. Moreover,
the three sheets prepared by Shotton were among the four
earliest in the series, before the mapping style had been fully
established. Two (Rose et al., 2006, Figure 19, and Robins
et al., 2007, Figure 9) show far longer paragraphs of
information written on the map surface than is typical of
later maps
(where such annotations may be equally
numerous, but are typically much briefer), and they tend
to have briefer descriptions in the key. One (Robins et al.,
2007, Figure 9) experiments with use of boxed marginal
notes to amplify data on the map surface. Another (Rose,
2008c, Figure 6) has but a single, brief annotation on the
map surface. We therefore illustrate here three sheets from
more easterly areas of northern France that provide
examples of later and slightly different maps, and that
indicate the nature of the output both of Bill King and of
his colleague Maurice Black.

The Auxerre sheet (Figure 12 and Table 2, cf. Figure 9)
illustrates a map trace prepared with assistance credited
solely to King. Nine rock units are depicted on the map, the
bedrock (a south-east part of the Paris Basin, slightly south
and west of that shown on Figure 11) younging from
south-east to north-west. Clays and limestones (of Jurassic
age) are succeeded by alternating sands and clays, sands and
then chalk (all Cretaceous), followed by ‘Paris Clay’ and
overlying sands (Cenozoic). Superﬁcial deposits include a
large area of clayey sands, and regions annotated as covered
by ‘thick alluvium’. The key to the map (Table 2)
distinguishes those rocks and so regions which are suitable

Table 3. Key to water supply map illustrated as Figure 13
(Epinal), unnumbered symbols in right margin, top to
bottom

1. Thick alluvium – good water from gravel beds within 30 feet
[9 m] of the surface in most places.
2. Alternations of clays and sands. Good water may be expected
from some of the sand-beds, but in general not suitable for deep
boreholes. Plenty of surface water, springs and ponds.
3. Limestone areas – generally little surface water except in main
streams. Part marked (a) [left of symbol] generally unsuitable for
boreholes, although shallow bores in dry valleys may give yields.
Part marked (b) [right of symbol] may give good yields with deeper
boreholes, particularly in dry valleys. All plateau areas should be
avoided.
4. Clay areas – generally plenty of surface water. In part marked (a)
[left of symbol] boreholes will strike underlying limestone at depths
of over 150 feet [45 m], yields will be poor, and quality may be
bad. Not suitable for boreholes. In parts marked as (b) [right of
symbol] underlying limestones are within 150 feet [45 m] of the
valley floors and may be expected to give good yields. The water
will rise in the tubes and may flow at the surface – lining tubes
necessary.
5. Sandstone areas, where there is sufficient thickness of sandstone
boreholes should yield large supplies of good water. At the western
margin, and beneath the overlying limestone, boreholes yield well,
but the water is liable to be mineralized. The surface ponds are
probably held up by superficial ‘hard pan’.
6. Sandstone with underlying granite too near the surface to justify
boring.
7. Granites and slates. Surface water, not suitable for boreholes.

the potential maximum groundwater yield from wells
drilled with the military equipment then in service; notes
rocks/regions where boreholes will need lining (and so
require suitable casing to be provided); and brieﬂy
comments on water supplies likely to be available from
surface sources.

The Epinal sheet (Figure 13 and Table 3, cf. Figure 9),
prepared with assistance from King and Black jointly,
depicts the region east of the Auxerre sheet. The style of
map is
similar, although only seven rock units are
distinguished, but differs in that a cross-section is provided.
Rock units as shown on the two maps correspond broadly
but not precisely across the north–south sheet boundary
region, a discrepancy that may be explained as a difference
in precision between geological base maps rather than a
change in hydrogeological interpretation. A ‘granite and
slate’ basement crops out at the eastern margin of the map,
but the dominant outcrops are of (Triassic through Jurassic
to Lower Cretaceous) sediments which dip and young
broadly to the north-west – a sequence closer to the Paris
Basin margin and so generally older than that shown on the
Auxerre sheet. Essentially, the same categories of borehole
information are provided on the two sheets but, for Epinal,
more data to guide borehole drilling are shown by
annotation of the map area itself rather than only by
description in the key: a consequence of the more varied,
basin margin, pattern of geological outcrop.

The Chalons-Nancy sheet (Figure 14 and Table 4, cf.
Figure 9) has preparation assistance credited solely to Black.
It depicts the region immediately to the north of the Epinal
map, with offset slightly to the west, as a trace to ﬁt a
different (and so not precisely adjoining) topographical base
map series. The sequence shown is again of seven rock
units, predominantly Mesozoic sediments forming the
eastern margin of the Paris Basin (the south-west corner
of Figure 11). Slates (of Palaeozoic age) crop out at the
north-east edge of the sheet, but the widest outcrops are
of westward-dipping and younging (Jurassic) clays and
limestones, succeeded by (Cretaceous) marl and clay and
ﬁnally Chalk – overlain in the south-west by (Quaternary)
alluvium within a major river valley.

There are numerous annotations on the face of the map.
For example, successively eastwards from the left margin:
‘Dry Chalk country: springs and surface streams conﬁned to
the main valleys – boreholes in dry valleys are the most
useful source of underground water’; ‘Along this line [the
base of the Chalk] abundant springs issue from Greensand
at the base of the White Chalk’; and ‘Marl and clay country
with abundant surface streams and ponds – unsuitable for
boreholes’. Near the top centre of the map, an inscription
meandering east then south reads: ‘Boreholes sunk near the
line of this inscription are likely to yield fair quantities of
good water from calcareous sandstones’. South of this, the
map is annotated: ‘Grey or blue shale country with surface
streams. Good water may be expected at depths of 250 to
400 feet. Shallow borings unlikely to yield except along the
eastern margin and in the ﬂoor of the [River] Moselle
valley’. To the east, a ﬂexed inscription reads: ‘Belt of water
seepage and springs approximately along this line. Borings
slightly west of this line of springs are likely to give good
water from thin bed of sandstone’.

Although this map is by Maurice Black alone, the style is
generally consistent with that developed by or in association
with Bill King (e.g. Figures 12 and 13) – and the sheet lies
between the two sheets (north and south) where Black
assisted King, and key units common to the Chalons-Nancy
sheet were deﬁned. However, again there are slight
discrepancies
in geological detail and map ornament
between adjacent sheets.

The maps of France in this set thus generally follow the
style of mapping pioneered for the region at 1 : 50 000 over
the previous year, but are innovative in their 1 : 250 000
scale. British geologists produced only one water supply
map at this scale for northern France during World War I: a
map showing only contours to the base of a major chalk
aquifer, to guide drilling depths (Rose, 2009, Figure 15).
The 1944 maps provide a greatly extended geographic
coverage, depict a much greater variety of geology, and
signiﬁcantly adapt the 1 : 50 000 ‘prospect’ trace map style.
Allied troops advanced so rapidly across the Cretaceous
areas of northern France that only two British boreholes
were emplaced there, near Brionne, just outside the area
covered by the 1 : 50 000 water supply maps (within
topographical sheet 8F2 of Figure 5). Both boreholes were

Table 4. Key to water supply map illustrated as Figure 14 (Chalons-Nancy), unnumbered symbols in bottom margin, left to right, top row

ﬁrst

1. Alluvium: shallow boreholes into gravel will give supplies of water, which may need sterilization.
2. White Chalk: no surface water except in main rivers. Supplies best obtained by drilling in floors of dry valleys.
3. Limestone not recommended for drilling except where marked as at (b) [top right of symbol] where water may be obtained from limestone
underground or as at (c) [bottom right of symbol] where water-bearing red sandstone may be reached by drilling through the limestone.
4. Clay and Shale: streams and ponds the main source of water. Boreholes sunk into the underlying limestones will probably fail to yield
except in areas marked as at b [right of symbol]. Two exceptions to this rule are indicated on the map; they are:

(i) near the northern edge of the map a layer of sandstone or sandy limestone is found within the grey or blue shales to the south of the
line indicated. This carries good water, but plunges underground towards the south, so that boreholes through the blue clay will reach
water at progressively deeper levels the further south of this line they are;

(ii) near the eastern edge of the map is another bed of sandstone which separates the blue from red clays. This carries good water &

plunges underground westward, so that boreholes through the blue clay will reach water at deeper levels the further west they are of the
line drawn on the map. This sandstone is not found east of this line.

5. Sandstone, usually red, or red mottled with yellow, green, or white. Suitable for drilling and give good supplies.
6. Limestone and marl in thin alternating layers. Boreholes will probably yield small supplies only. Both well and spring waters are liable to need
sterilization.
7. Slate: surface water only, and unsuitable for drilling.

within the scope of Shotton’s 1 : 250 000 sheet 7 Rouen-
Paris (Rose et al., 2006, Figure 19) (undated, but almost
certainly generated about the same time as the adjacent
sheet 4 Havre-Amiens, in April 1944). Prospects for water
were calculated as problematical in the Upper Chalk (Rose
and Pareyn, 1998), and to make certain of obtaining a
sufﬁcient yield it was determined to drill 500 feet (152 m)
or more into the Lower Chalk (Cenomanian). The ﬁrst hole
was abandoned as crooked at 300 feet (91 m), and the
(115 m) due to
second was abandoned at 377 feet
operational moves. Both wells were virtually dry. The value
of 1 : 250 000 maps as guides to siting British boreholes
was therefore never put to signiﬁcant operational test in
France, only to the north-east, in Belgium.

Water supply maps of Belgium: an innovation since World War I
The Namur-Luxembourg sheet (Figure 15 and Table 5, cf.
Figure 9), the second example of a map with preparation
assistance credited to both King and Black, displays
the region immediately north of the Chalons-Nancy sheet

– which it overlaps and with which it is geologically
consistent. It is dominated by part of the Ardennes: a massif
of (Palaeozoic: largely Devonian) ‘folded slates, limestones
and hard sandstones’ (cf. Figure 11), and thus differs
signiﬁcantly from the Paris Basin maps
illustrated as
Figures 12–14. Eleven rock units are distinguished. The
main region is clearly shown as providing some surface
water: ‘not suitable for boreholes’ (although the word ‘not’
is omitted in the key: presumably by drafting error), but
with ‘strong springs from some of the limestone bands’ (in
the overlying Carboniferous) to the north. Much of this
plateau region lies in Belgium, but it extends across the
French border and also into Luxembourg. Sands and loam,
partly above (Cretaceous) Chalk, fringe the plateau to the
north-west. To the south of the sheet, the massif is overlain
by a Mesozoic sequence, seen to young from red (Triassic)
sandstones westwards through (Jurassic) clays and lime-
stones to (Cretaceous) Chalk in the south-west corner of
the map. The map key again provides an appraisal of each of
the units mapped in terms of suitability for new boreholes
to provide water supplies.

the bottom right corner of the map, compilation was ‘in conjunction with Doctor M. Black, Cambridge University’. Courtesy Lapworth
Museum of Geology

The Brussels-Lie`ge sheet (Figure 16 and Table 6, cf.
Figure 9), compiled by King alone, shows the adjacent
region to the north (which it overlaps with geological
consistency). Two cross-sections (along lines of section
drawn north–south and NNE–SSW on the map) show how
the strongly folded (Palaeozoic) ‘slates’ of the Ardennes
Massif are overlain by (Cretaceous) ‘greensand’ and Chalk,
in turn overlain by a thick sequence of
(Cenozoic)
alternating clays and sands, the post-Palaeozoic sediments
all with regional dip to the north. Including marine
in the extreme
(estuarine) alluvium, which crops out
north-west corner of the map, this map sheet is unusual
in distinguishing (and also numbering) as many as 14 rock
units – most of them in Upper Cretaceous or in Cenozoic
strata. Bill King’s experience of Belgian hydrogeology
gained from service in World War I would have facilitated
this ﬁne distinction of hydrogeological units – for the

region of Belgium in which most British boreholes were
eventually drilled.

The ‘Note’ shown beneath the cross-sections reads:
‘Over much of the area covered by the alternating sands &
clays it is found that water rises on reaching a sand-bed &
often ﬂows at the surface. The quality however is sometimes
poor. Yields of approx. 1000 to 2000 g.p.h. [4.5 to

experienced in sinking through the alternations of sands &

strainers and lining tubes must be used’.

succeeded by (Cretaceous) marly and white chalk, in turn
overlain by (Cenozoic) clays and sands, fringed along the
coast by a broad strip of superﬁcial coastal sands and clays,
and ﬁnally a thin strip of dune sands. In total, only 10 units
are mapped in this part of Belgium.

There are numerous annotations on the map itself,
referring to rock type, water occurrence or water quality.
Thus eastwards from the left margin examples read: ‘Marly
Chalk. No deﬁnite water table. Little surface water except in
main streams.’; ‘Chalk under thin cover of loam or sand.
Coal mines pump much water.’; ‘Zone of artesian wells’;
‘Approximate line north of which the Chalk is not likely to
yield well’; ‘Clay subsoil – small springs from sands forming
hills’; and in the map centre ‘Some water from ﬁne sands at
depth of 200 to 400 feet below sea level. Surface loams
yield some 100 g.p.d. from shallow wells. Smaller surface
streams likely to dry up in summer’.

The Namur-Luxembourg map by King and Black depicts
an area primarily of basement rocks at 1 : 250 000 scale, and
as such is an innovation for British military geologists
preceded only by Shotton’s map earlier in 1944 of the
Rennes area of Brittany (Rose, 2008c, Figure 6). This
largely illustrated part of the Armorican Massif at the
opposite, western margin of the Paris Basin. For Belgium,
the map set as a whole is an innovation without precedent.
British military water supply maps prepared by Bill King in
World War I covered almost the whole of Belgium, but at
scale of 1 : 100 000 and without showing any features of
geology as such (e.g. Rose, 2009, Figure 8). Similarly,
King’s maps at 1 : 250 000 (Rose, 2009, Figures 10 and
12) were not explicitly geological, and conﬁned to the
British area of operations in the north of the country. The

France was therefore entirely new for Belgium – although
the two northern sheets prepared by King alone were of
areas he knew well from his service in World War I.

Boreholes drilled in Belgium: water supply infrastructure for
continuing advance
Tanks of 21st Army Group swept across northern France
and reached Antwerp in Belgium on 4 September, so
they captured the port’s extensive dock
quickly that
(Dear and Foot,
installations and lock system intact
1995). However, not until victory was achieved in the
Battle for the Scheldt Estuary, in November, could Allied
ships gain access to the docks. The Scheldt was progres-
sively cleared of German troops, and ﬁnally mines by 26
November. Two days later, the ﬁrst supply convoy arrived,
bringing about a revolution in the Allies’ supply situation.
Thereafter, 21st Army Group could be supplied through
Antwerp rather
than overland from Normandy. Base
installations were duly established in Belgium in preparation
for crossing the River Rhine, the last natural obstacle
barring an advance into Germany. This campaign was

scheduled to begin in the spring, when the adverse weather
conditions of winter ameliorated. The programme of
drilling in Normandy was therefore concluded, and Royal
Engineers Boring Platoon No. 8,
followed later (very
brieﬂy) by Platoon No. 6, was deployed over 300 km to
the north-east, to northern Belgium. Reports2 now in the
Lapworth Museum of Geology record that the platoons
drilled at least 21 boreholes there to abstract groundwater
(Table 8), within the areas covered by map sheets 2 and 3 of
map series GSGS 4042 (Figures 16 and 17).

In the westernmost region, one hole was drilled in
West Flanders: no. 33 about 25 km SSE of Ostend
(Figures 9 and 17)
[English, French and Flemish
spellings for Belgian place names are variously used in
British military maps and reports]. Further to the east,
nos. 41 and 45 were drilled in East Flanders, 45 at the city
of Ghent and 41 for a prisoner-of-war camp some 30 km
further south. All these holes were sited on clays (unit 6a of
Table 7), the region annotated on the map as ‘Some water
from ﬁne sands at depth of 200 to 400 feet [c. 60 to
120 m] below sea level’.

72

The Cartographic Journal

The remaining 18 holes lay further to the east: nine
effectively within a 40 km wide corridor north from
Brussels to Antwerp, six at Antwerp itself, and three at
Brasschaet about 10 km NNE of Antwerp (cf. Figures 9
and 16). The 10 boreholes 36, 48, 52–54, and 56–60 were
all sited on sands (unit 2 of Table 6), but no. 36 close to
the boundary with clays, and the Antwerp holes close both
to the River Scheldt and the clay boundary. This sand area
as a whole is annotated on the map face ‘Some good water
in this area’. The three boreholes 37–39 were also sited on
‘sands’ (unit 3 of Table 6). Borehole 42 seems to have been
sited on clay (unit 8 of Table 6), but the log in a summary
report2 records mostly sand. The other four boreholes
(nos. 40, 43, 44 and 47) were all sited on alternating clays
and sands (unit 9 of Table 6). The summary report2 and/or
borehole completion reports note that
the holes at
Thildonck (43 and 47) were to supply a general hospital,
that at Boort Meerbeck (44) was for a tyre retreading
factory, the Antwerp holes (48, 53, 54, 58–60) were to
supply a tank washing facility, and those at Vilvoorde (37–
39), Kraai (41) and Boschkant (42) were for prisoner-of-
war camps.

All these boreholes were thus drilled into Cenozoic sands
and clays. Most holes were lined with 12 in. [y0.3 m]

suitable for boreholes.
2. Sands overlying slates. Springs at junctions – not suitable for
boreholes.
3. Chalk; in south-west in France little loam cover – in north in
Belgium generally thick loam cover. Boreholes generally yield well
in the dry valleys.
4. Marly Chalk. Yield from boreholes not so reliable as in the white
chalk.
5. Alternations of sands and clays, some of the sands yield well but
difficulty from running sand – strainers and lining tubes needed,
generally not very suitable for boreholes.
6. Clays: surface water abundant, part marked (b) [right of symbol]
boreholes will reach the underlying limestones and may be expected
to give good yields, part marked (a) [left of symbol] not suitable.
7. Limestone areas (South of map) – little surface water, good
springs frequent along northern margin of area, part marked (a)
[left of symbol] generally unsuitable for deep boreholes – part
marked (b) [right of symbol] deep boreholes may yield well.

9. Slates, hard limestones and hard sandstones. The steeply folded
strata forming the ARDENNES are [not] suitable for boreholes –
generally ample surface water and small springs. The limestones of
the northern Ardennes give rise to numerous very large springs,
many of which are impounded for distribution to Central and
Western Belgium.
10. Limestone and marl in alternating layers. Boreholes will
probably yield small supplies only. Both well and spring waters are
liable to need sterilization.

Palaeozoic ‘slate’).

Boreholes numbered 34 and 35 seemingly missing from
the list (Table 8) had been drilled in Normandy by No. 6
Boring Platoon RE before redeployment of this unit, like
No. 8 Boring Platoon before it, to Belgium (Table 1).
There is no record in the summary report2 for a borehole
46, possibly planned but not drilled, or omitted or mis-
numbered in error.

From Table 8, it is evident that several sites in Belgium
required more than one borehole in an attempt to achieve
an adequate water supply. This may be a reﬂection of map
scale. King (1951, p. 115) noted that although water supply
maps at a scale of 1 : 250 000 were useful for general
planning, for ‘those who had the responsibility of actually
providing the water for the troops, maps on the scale of
1/50,000 or thereabouts were more useful’ – but unlike
Normandy, there had not been the imperative (and so

1. Marine alluvium – any water obtained from the sandy strata is
liable to be saline or of poor quality.
2. Sands in the north of the sheet. These yield water which is
generally very hard and ferruginous and often unusable. Large areas
of peat occur within swampy hollows, water from which is of poor
quality. In this area certain dunes and old river gravels yield much
better quality water. It will be necessary to obtain expert advice
before sinking shallow boreholes to tap this good surface water
area. As a whole, unsuitable for deep boreholes.
3. Sands of the areas south and east of Brussels. Much good water is
obtained from drainage galleries. Springs of good water in many of
the valleys. The southern part, where sands overlie slates, not very
suitable for boreholes. In the northern part, numerous good
boreholes exist either into the lower part of the sands or into the
underlying Chalk. Casing and strainers would be needed.
4. Clay on high ground, resting on sands of 3. Conditions suitable
for boreholes, which will need lining and strainers.
5. Clay on high ground resting on fine sands with Chalk at depth.
Area generally suitable for boreholes.
6. Fine sands and marls with Chalk at depth. Suitable for boreholes,
but holes will need lining to depth of Chalk.
7. Mainly clays with Chalk at depth. Suitable for boreholes, but
holes will need lining to Chalk.
8. Clay areas, some good water is obtained from boreholes through
the clay to the underlying sands, except in the area west and south
of Brussels where underlying sands are very fine or non-existent.
9. Alternating clays and sands. Small supplies may be expected from
the sand-beds but generally better yields will be obtained from the
Chalk at depth. Quality of water may be poor.
10. Chalk, seldom exposed at surface, which is formed of thick loam
cover. Much water obtained from drainage galleries. Selected sites
along northern edge suitable for boreholes. Yield over 3000 g.p.h.
[13.6 m3/h]. Southern areas generally not suitable.
11. Marly Chalk, suitable for boreholes in selected places but results
difficult to predict.
12. Chalk on high ground, shales, etc., in valleys. Mostly not
suitable for boreholes. Probably considerable volumes of water
pumped from coal mines.
13. Sands on the higher ground with slates and limestones in the
valleys. Some spring water and water from wells to the base of
sands. Not suitable in general for boreholes.
14. Slates and hard limestones of the Ardennes. Strong springs
locally from the limestones. Small springs and some surface peaty
swamps. On the slaty plateau areas unsuitable for boreholes.

Ghent), unnumbered symbols in right margin, from top
down

1. Coastal sand dunes yield good water with ‘well-points’ or large
diameter shallow wells.
2. Fen and coastal clays and sands. Water almost everywhere bad or
saline. Much of area can be flooded with sea water.
3. Sands at various geological levels. In the north-east the water is
generally either saline, very hard, or ferruginous. In general it is not
worthwhile to sink boreholes. The deeper seated water is uniformly
of poor or bad quality.
4. Sandy clays. Water obtained from underlying sands generally
saline.
5. Sands. Where forming hills and ridges give rise to many small
springs of good water. In the main area south of Brussels good
water is obtained from drainage galleries driven near river level.
Yield from boreholes in this area probably small. Some good results
may be obtained north of Brussels.
6. Clays in the north. These may be 400 feet [122 m] thick. Water
from the fine sand beneath rises to slightly above sea level in
boreholes, but much trouble from sand entering the bores if
pumped at more than 250 g.p.h. [1.13 m3/h]. Gravel pack filters
are the most satisfactory, mud or water flush sinking best in part
marked as (a) [left of symbol]. Boreholes into Chalk yield good
water and near the southern margin many excellent artesian flows
from numerous bores. The large waterworks for the industrial
towns are situated on this line.
7. White Chalk area. Little surface water except in main streams,
but suitable for boreholes, especially in dry valleys. Yields of
3000 g.p.h. [13.6 m3/h] expected.
8. Marly Chalk. Streams spring fed. The marly nature of the Chalk
makes the result of boreholes less certain than in the White Chalk.
9. Old sandstones and slates exposed in the valleys beneath the
Chalk – not suitable for boreholes.
10. Slates and sandstones – not suitable for boreholes.

commitment of time and manpower) to prepare such maps
for Belgium.

It may also be a reﬂection of military operating
procedures. Normal practice was for location of base
installations to be determined primarily by military con-
straints (such as road or rail access, ground conditions, pre-
existing structures, or location of other units). Advice on
water supply would then be sought from the geologist staff
ofﬁcer at Headquarters 21st Army Group (Major Shotton),
or (from January 1945) a supporting geologist serving with
the Group as a Deputy Assistant Director of Works (Major
D. R. A. Ponsford RE: pre-war an experienced exploration
geologist, post-war a District Geologist with the ‘British’
Geological Survey) (Rose and Pareyn, 2003; Rose, 2008b;
Rose
and Clatworthy, 2008a, b). Moreover, until
December 1944, No. 8 Boring Platoon RE, which drilled
most of the British boreholes in Belgium, was commanded
by an ofﬁcer who was himself a former professional
geologist: Lieutenant A. K. Pringle RE (pre-war an
experienced exploration geologist, post-war Professor of
Applied Geology at Strathclyde University) (Rose and
Pareyn, 2003). Both military geologist expertise and,
presumably, local knowledge, would have been available
to guide the choice of individual well sites – and for most
Royal Engineer boreholes, Shotton examined soil and rock
samples obtained during drilling, and collated details of well
logs and test pumping data as the drilling programme
progressed.

To extend coverage eastwards and so aid planning for the
continuing Allied advance, the Geological Section of the
Inter-Service Topographical Department (ISTD) prepared
nine maps6 illustrating potential groundwater conditions
(Figure 18) as transparent overlays for use with sheets of
the then current 1 : 250 000 topographical map series
(GSGS

remembers that these ‘were all done by [Lieutenant, later
Captain, J. R.] Foster-Smith and [Lieutenant, later Captain
W. R.] Williams in the huts’ which were temporarily erected
for ISTD use close to Mansﬁeld College, Oxford (as
illustrated by Rose, 2008d). Marginal data afﬁrm that all
these maps were prepared by the ‘Geological Section

W. R. Williams and J. R. Foster-Smith: help to ease pressure of work
According to details recorded on his proposal form7 for
election to fellowship of the Geological Society of London,
William Rees Williams (Figure 19) was born on 4 August

Water Supply Maps for North-west Europe: World War II

75

James Robert Foster-Smith was his younger assistant:
born 30 January 1916. His form9 proposing election to
fellowship of the Geological Society gives his profession also
as ‘mining geologist’ (and Lieutenant RE), and supporting
qualiﬁcations as ‘Student [of the] Institute of Mining and
Metallurgy’ and ‘Associate Royal Geological Society of
Cornwall’. Signatures on his form reveal that he was
proposed for fellowship by three of his contemporary
colleagues in the ISTD Geological Section: Captain W. R.
Williams RE, Geoffrey Bond RAF and C. M. G. Bolton
(Williams was presumably a ‘local captain’ at this time, since
his promotion to ‘temporary captain’ was not published
until later. It was common in wartime for ofﬁcial paperwork
to lag behind promotion events). Foster-Smith had been a
student at
the Camborne School of Mines until war
interrupted his studies, having gained some coal mining
experience before beginning his course (Rose, 2008d;
Ludford et al., 2009).

The contemporary issues of The Army List record that
Foster-Smith was also granted a Regular Army Emergency
Commission in the Royal Engineers, as a second lieutenant
from 26 October 1940, war substantive lieutenant from 26
April 1942, and temporary captain from 4 October 1945.
He wrote a
letter dated 17 October 1988 which
accompanies some photographs of Gibraltar now preserved
in the Royal Engineers Library at Chatham10 in which he
records: ‘I was a subaltern in the 170 and 178 Tunnelling
Companies [Royal Engineers] from 1940 to 1943, serving
ﬁrst in the Dover area and later in Gibraltar and Plymouth’.
According to the ISTD Geological Section history8, he was
attached to the Section from 29 December 1944 (as the
tenth in a succession of 19 geoscientists to serve with the
unit), at almost 29 years of age. He served until 4 March
1946, thus completing about 14 months of service – a time
exceeded by only
and

a mining geologist rather than hydrogeologist.

Ludford et al. (2009) quote from a letter11 dated 30
November 1944 in which Fred Shotton records that he had
just visited the Geological Section ISTD, which ‘is now
engaged on water supply overlays for northern Germany – a
job which I had to turn down as it would have involved a
month of research work to the exclusion of everything else’.
Since Shotton thus visited ISTD in Oxford in the month in
which the ﬁrst map in the set was completed, his inﬂuence
was clearly signiﬁcant.

Water supply maps for north-west Germany: the end of the campaign
On these nine maps, rock units as depicted on geological
maps were again grouped together on the basis of their
likely water-bearing properties. There are differences in
presentational style between sheets that presumably reﬂect
differences in time of preparation and the quality of the
primary geological map data, as well as differences in
regional geology and base map authorship. In terms of
geology (Figure 11), the North German Plain is ﬂoored
mostly by thick superﬁcial deposits: gravels, sands and clays
of relatively recent (Quaternary) age. In contrast, the
upland areas to the south reveal a much more complex
pattern of outcrop, of much older and stronger rocks. Each
map is illustrated by one or two geological cross-sections.

1901; had graduated from the University of Wales (Cardiff)
with a BSc degree in mining; and by 1942 was working as a
mining geologist for Frantino Gold Mines Limited from a
South American address, in Columbia. His form records
that he was then also an Associate of the Institute of Mining
and Metallurgy, and a Member of the South Wales Institute
of Engineers. His profession before joining the army was
recorded as ‘economic geologist’ in an unpublished history
of the Geological Section ISTD8 (Rose and Clatworthy,
2007a, 2008b).

second lieutenant

The contemporary issues of The Army List record that
Williams was granted a Regular Army Emergency
in the Royal
Commission as
Engineers on 5 February 1943, promoted war substantive
lieutenant six months later, on 5 August, and promoted to
the rank of temporary captain on 17 July 1945. According
to the history of the Geological Section ISTD8, he was
attached to the unit from 18 July 1944 (as the eighth in a
succession of 19 geoscientists to serve with the Section), at
almost 43 years of age. He served until 25 May 1946 (only
three other geologists continuing until June, when the
completed about
Section was disbanded),
22 months of service – a time exceeded by only two other
members
(Rose and Clatworthy, 2008b, Table 1). It
therefore appears that he was an experienced professional
mining geologist whose qualities were evidently of long-
term value to the Section at the time when he was tasked
with compilation of the water supply maps of Germany.

and
Clatworthy, 2007a, Figure 9) and L52 Kassel (Figure 20)
were drawn ﬁrst,
in November and December 1944
respectively (Rose and Clatworthy, 2007a, Table 4). They
use black ink only, and thus follow the style of the earlier
maps described above. Three hundred copies were printed
of each map (indicated by ‘3’ in marginal printing data – an
indication explained by Rose et al., 2006). Like the earlier
maps, of France and Belgium, they illustrate terrain which
features mostly pre-Quaternary bedrock, and in which
potential groundwater occurrence is strongly controlled by
rock type. On the Kassel sheet, as indicated by the cross-
section,
the pattern of outcrop reﬂects primarily the
geological structure of the region: the rock units have been
extensively folded, and in the west especially, faulted, before
uplift and erosion to produce a rugged topography. The

the key
map distinguishes 12 hydrogeological units,
(Table 9) summarizing both characteristic rock types and
potential groundwater abundance.

The other seven maps were drawn later, and feature
regions of North Germany typically of low relief and with
thick Quaternary sediments overlying Tertiary or Mesozoic
strata, with a main water table at relatively shallow depth.
These maps (e.g. Figure 21, and Rose and Clatworthy,
2007a, Figure 10) all use black ink for basic data, but green
ink to indicate areas of poor water quality. The print run
was increased to 350 copies for maps printed between
January and April 1945, but reduced to 250 for those
printed in May, as the war in Europe came to an end.

Innovative use of green ink in the later maps indicates
that groundwater quality as well as quantity had become a
matter of military concern, but overall these traces are

consistent with the general style of groundwater mapping
for military purposes pioneered by Bill King and Fred
Shotton earlier in the North-west European Campaign.
Particular features of the Kiel map, the last map to be
printed in this series and therefore during the war in
Europe, are that the primary data sources are speciﬁed; the
scale and
section is more detailed in both vertical

continuation to signiﬁcant depth below sea level; and
information on the main map is ampliﬁed by data provided
by two additional maps at smaller scale. These were based
on a pre-war publication by Professor Karl Beurlen. During
the war, he was also to serve as a military geologist, but for
the German Army (Ha¨usler, 1995).

1. Loam, clays and sandy silt. Local and immediate supplies can be
obtained from rivers, but it will need treatment. Springs from
adjacent rock formation frequently discharge in and above the
alluvial deposits of the river valleys. Shallow wells or boreholes may
yield abundant water.
2. Other superficial deposits, including sands, gravel, boulder clay
and a fine yellowish grey loam (loess). Wells and borings which pass
through the sands and gravels below the level of the adjacent
streams and rivers should yield large quantities of water. The loess is
usually permeable and dry, but springs may rise at its base. High
level gravels are frequently dry.
3. Quartz sands and lignite shales. As these are found on valley sides
and bottoms the sands are likely to yield water at shallow depths,
lower parts may be waterlogged.
4. Impure limestone, marls, sandy marls and sands. Where these
rocks are exposed, boreholes are likely to give satisfactory yields,
porosity and water bearing properties vary from place to place:
where they lie beneath superficial deposits, especially at low levels
they give large supplies at slight depth, as around Senne. Springs are
numerous and widespread.
5. Marl and clay above, sandstones in the middle, clay, limestone
and limy sandstone below. Several useful water bearing beds
(especially sandstone and limestone) interbedded with impermeable
clays. Numerous springs where beds are fractured.
6. At top limestones, marls in upper and lower layers, overlying
sandy limestone; in the middle, dark clays and at bottom dark clays
with some interbedded limestones. Limestone beds are water
bearing but may be patchy.
7. Interbedded sandstone, clays and marl with salt, and some
dolomite; in the lower part limestone with some marls. Powerful
springs where these rocks lie on 8; for example one such spring
supplies the tower of Pyrmont with 120 cu. m/hour. The upper
beds have numerous springs of good water as well as those which
are saline or mineralized. Water flows largely by means of crevices.
8. Marls, clays, with thick sandstones especially in the lower part.
Abundant water in the lower sandstones, locally under artesian
conditions. Water flows largely by means of crevices.
9. Dolomites passing down to marls with salt, conglomerates and
sandstones below. Some faults. Sandstones and conglomerates
associated with the dolomites and limestones contain a fair amount
of water; those associated with the lower part usually carry little
water owing to presence of clays. Saline water is in many areas
derived from the marls. Water flows largely by means of crevices.
10. Limestones with some sandstones and shales; folded, faulted
and fractured. Limestones contain large quantities of water but
groundwater supplies depend on boreholes striking fissures and
cavities. As some of this water is derived directly from the surface by
open fissures it may be polluted.
11. Shales, slates and interbedded sandstone; folded, faulted and
fractured. These rocks are largely compact and impermeable, but
fissures, faults and cracks are likely to give adequate supplies to wells
and boreholes which intersect them; these should be sited in the
valleys and not higher than 50 feet [15 m] above the stream level.
12. Tough basalt. Small supplies where the rocks have crevices.
Note:
1. The information on this sheet has been generalized; more
detailed data are available for small areas.
2. Each sheet of this series must be considered separately, as
variation in water bearing capacities of the rocks often necessitates
re-grouping.

Boreholes for groundwater abstraction drilled in Germany: the end of
the war
According to the summary report2 in the Lapworth
Museum, seven boreholes, numbered 49, 50, 51, 55, 61,
62 and 63 in continuance of those summarized on Table 8,
were drilled in Germany, in a region near the Dutch border
and close to the east bank of the Rhine. Nos. 49 and 62
were at Haldern (6 km east of Rees: Figure 9) for a
‘displaced persons’ (i.e. refugee) camp; 50 and 61 at
Hamminkeln (7 km north of Wesel) for a similar camp, 51
at Empel (4 km north of Rees) for a prisoner-of-war camp,
55 at Dornick (about 5 km south-west of Emmerich), and
63 at Marwick (north of Haldern, for another ‘displaced
persons’ camp).

The unit responsible for drilling borehole 49 is not
speciﬁed in the report2, but since all the other boreholes in
this closely adjacent group are credited there to No. 6
Boring Platoon RE, it seems probable that this unit drilled
all seven holes. No. 6 Boring Platoon was drilling in
Normandy until at least November 1944 (Table 1). It was
subsequently brieﬂy operational in Belgium by about March
1945 (Table 8), and must have re-deployed to Germany
shortly thereafter, since by May 1945 it was assisting
Second Canadian Drilling Company to put down the
borehole at Dornick (no. 55), and boreholes 61 and 62
were emplaced in May–June 1945 as the Allies consolidated
their 8 May victory in Europe.

These boreholes thus form a cluster within part of
the main valley of the Rhine, less than 10 km from the
eastern bank of the river, sited at the western margin of
the L52 Du¨sseldorf water
and
Clatworthy, 2007a, Figure 10 and Table 5). All are sited
on superﬁcial deposits: silts, sands and gravels associated
with the river. Of the nine maps in total, only this one
was used to site British boreholes before the end of the
war, and because of
its very generalized depiction of
superﬁcial deposits, its use would have been for general
guidance rather than detailed planning. Precise sites would
have been chosen for military rather than speciﬁc hydro-
geological reasons. As a set, these maps may have been
useful to guide operational planning, but the war was over
before they were needed to guide siting of signiﬁcant
numbers of boreholes.

OTHER MILITARY WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS IN
WARTIME EUROPE

The water
supply maps generated by British military
geologists for France, Belgium and Germany seem to be a
development of mapping pioneered by Bill King rather than
of mapping in other theatres of military operations, British,
German or American.

British
Until 1935, groundwater resources in the UK had been
studied ‘in a piecemeal fashion as the need arose; national
coordination did not exist’ (Downing, 2004). However,
from 1935, the ‘British’ Geological Survey was made
responsible for the recording and assessment of under-
ground water. Studies made only a modest start pre-war,
although soon generating wider overviews of underground
water supply in England and Wales (Edmunds, 1941;
Bailey, 1944), but outbreak of war focused attention on the
need to provide water supplies for new airﬁelds, military
camps and factories. Between 1940 and the end of the war
in Europe, reports were prepared ‘on 305 sites for the Air
Ministry, 252 sites for the War Department, 163 sites for
the Ministry of Works and 15 for the Admiralty, besides
many others for various public and private undertakings’
(Bailey, 1952, p. 246; Rose, 2004a, p. 171). Included in
this work was the ‘provision of maps showing prospects of
underground water throughout the whole region of the
Army’s Southern Command’. Twenty geologists with seven
assistants (out of a total Survey staff of only about 50)
generated groundwater information considered essential to
the war effort. This was published within a series of 47

Wartime Pamphlets, based on quarter-inch-to-one-mile
[1 : 253 440] Geological Survey maps. The pamphlets were
issued in parts, 107 in total but only 93 before the end of
the war in Europe. By this time, 16 pamphlets comprising
in total 48 parts dealt with groundwater. The most
outstanding pamphlet (Woodland, 1943–1946) was com-
pleted only after the war had ended. This concluded by
summarizing details of the geology, groundwater levels and
chemical quality of the groundwater in southern East
Anglia by means of a series of maps, but maps even then
only of small size and medium scale (,1 : 250 000). King
and Shotton are known to have worked in close association
with the Geological Survey (Rose, 2004a), King notably
with the hydrogeologist Stevenson Buchan (Wilson, 1985;
Gray and Mather, 2004), but they developed military water
supply maps which are innovative by reason of
their
relatively large and metric scale,
relatively early date,
widespread coverage, and overlay ‘prospect’ map style.

The ISTD used geologists

to generate simpliﬁed
geological maps for parts of Europe other than Germany,
and especially for parts of the Far East, in which water
supply information was depicted – but only as one of several

1. Peat covering broad areas of 2 and 3. Thickness up to 15 ft
[4.5 m]. Surface water in the peat and peaty soil is likely to be
brackish, ferruginous, and in some situations may be polluted.
2. Valley Alluvium top soil of loam, humous loam, peaty soil, clays
and sand; covered in parts with sand dunes and overlying silty sands
and clay with sand and gravel below. Thickness may vary from 5–
30 ft [1.5–9.0 m]. Ground water near the surface.
3. Marshland – ‘Wattenschlick’ clays, clay loam, sands, marine sands
and silt locally, overlying peat. Thickness up to 40 ft [12.5 m].
Probably local small supplies of water which are likely to be saline,
especially near the coast (see also diagram A).
4. Other superficial deposits. Chiefly boulder clay and boulder marl,
gravel and sand with large areas of blown sand. The thickness of
these deposits varies greatly up to about 600 ft [180 m] and
possibly even more locally. Springs and shallow wells in the upper
parts. Artesian water may be found by deep boring in the sands and
gravels below boulder clay and marls; but no locations are specified
(see also diagram A).
5. Tertiary gently undulating very thick sands and clays, sealed by
beds of clay in the upper parts. Locally artesian and generally sub-
artesian water is available, but quantity is variable. Water bearing
beds are not always present, (see diagram B). When water bearing
beds are present, there is usually an abundance of good water, as in
sheets to the south of this area (sheets M54, K54 and L54).
6. Conglomerate, shale and limestone; possibly with beds of
gypsum, anhydrite, salt, etc., locally. These beds usually give rise to
local saline water conditions.
Note 1. In beds 1–5 drilling speeds would be up to 50 ft [16 m]
per day. In bed 6 speed would be up to 10–15 ft [3.0–4.5 m] per
day. These speeds are based on the performance of the Army
Percussion Drill.
Note 2. Treatment for iron salts may be necessary where water is
derived from beds 1 to 4.
Note 3. In marshland areas (3) the marshland mainly overlies
Diluvium, but locally, especially near rivers, it will be found
overlying river alluvium and intercalated with it.

notes (p. 26) that ‘Prior to ‘D’ Day there was limited
association [with the Royal Engineers Branch of 21st Army
Group], principally due to security reasons. After ‘D’ Day
sporadic contact was maintained until November 1944
when Major Shotton [Staff Ofﬁcer (Geology) to Chief
Engineer] visited the Section in connection with some
overlay traces for water supply that the Section was to
undertake’. These were the water supply maps generated for
Germany, which therefore follow the style of such maps
generated by King and Shotton for France and Belgium
rather than ISTD geotechnical mapping styles in general.

German
The importance of water supply to the German armed
forces during World War I is evident from the emphasis
given to this topic in many publications post-war that are
based on wartime experience, e.g. textbooks by Wilser
(1921), Wasmund (1937), Kranz (1938), Mordziol (1938)
and Bu¨low et al. (1938). Wilser (1921) included a brief
section on the use of ‘water supply’ maps, and Bu¨low et al.
(1938), based on Sonne (1935), provided more extensive
illustration and description of geological and thematic maps
such as
supply (cf.
Figures 22 and 23). These maps therefore represent best

those featuring aspects of water

The Cartographic Journal

Among other maps of the same part of the ‘Heringen’
Collection (Hadden, 2008), within the National Archives
and Records Administration at College Park, MD, USA, are
examples of several specialist ‘water supply’ maps prepared
at scale of 1 : 25 000 for parts of France.12 One map
(Figure 24) plots borehole positions and ground electrical
conductivity. This indicates groundwater salinity, the lower
the resistance, the more saline the water (i.e. the greater the
conductance, which is the reciprocal of resistance). Values
would normally be expected to increase away from the
coast. The French company Schlumberger developed the
technique in the 1920s and it was commercially available
before the war. The map lacks a key with indication of
depth to which the contours apply, so was presumably
originally accompanied by an explanatory report. Another
map (Figure 25) plots borehole positions and contours at
5 m intervals. These seem to be broadly consistent with
contours for the base of the local ‘Chalk Marl’ aquifer,
plotted at 25 m intervals on the British map at 1 : 250 000
for this region prepared during World War I (cf. Rose,
2009, Figures 1 and 15), but again there is no key.

Water resource maps at various scales13 were prepared by
German military geologists for regions which included the
including
Soviet Union (notably borderland areas,
Ukraine), Baltic States, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Italy
(including Sicily and Sardinia), Greece, North Africa
(Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt), Saudi Arabia
and Palestine as well as Germany, The Netherlands, France
and Belgium.

Among the range of small-scale German ‘planning’ maps
is a geological map of Belgium14 (Figure 26) in which a
coloured key distinguishes 15 rock units as present,
principally according to stratigraphic age: Quaternary (top
in key), Tertiary (Pliocene, Miocene, Oligocene,
unit
Eocene, Paleocene), Mesozoic
Jurassic,
Triassic) and Palaeozoic (Carboniferous coal measures/
limestone, Devonian, Silurian, Cambrian) groups, plus
igneous rocks (bottom unit of key). Beneath this, a table
provides a summary of key ground conditions associated
with each of the 15 units. Nine columns give numbers from
1 to 136 that relate to extensive adjacent notes. The ﬁrst
column indicates notes on the water-bearing properties of
the rocks, the penultimate column notes on water supply.
This complex compendium is the only German map
indicating features of water
supply within north-west
Europe that is preserved among the documents in the
Shotton Archive in the Lapworth Museum of Geology.
Fred Shotton thus knew of its existence, but whether he
obtained the map during the war or only at its end is
unknown (the map is undated). We know of no evidence
that British military geologists were inﬂuenced by German
military maps in their preparation of water supply maps for
France, Belgium or Germany – only geological maps
published locally pre-war. Allied geologists potentially had
access to at least some of the German pre-war publications
cited above, so should have been aware of the principles of
German geotechnical mapping. However, so far as we
know, German water supply maps for north-west Europe
came into Allied hands only with the capture of the
Heringen Collection at the end of the war (Rose and Willig,
2004; Hadden, 2008).

practice as derived from World War I (cf. Rose, 2009), and
the benchmark for initial German mapping in World War
II.

Water supply studies overall formed a smaller percentage
of German military geologist tasks in World War II relative
to World War I, a consequence of the greater geographic
range and greater mobility of operations (Rose et al.,
2000). Nevertheless, World War I mapping skills formed
the basis for development of a wide range of water supply
maps by German military geologists during 1939–1945, as
outlined by Willig (2003). Recent
in The
Cartographic Journal provide some examples, of maps at
scales of 1 : 50 000, 1 : 100 000 and 1 : 250 000 remotely
prepared in 1940 for the invasion of southern England
(Rose and Willig, 2004, Figures 8–12), and at scales of
1 : 10 000, 1 : 25 000 and 1 : 50 000, with the beneﬁt of
ﬁeld observations, to help sustain the German occupation
of the Channel Islands 1940–1945 (Rose, 2005, Figures 3,
4, 8–12, 20 and 21).

American
During World War II, American forces were supported
from June 1942 by the Military Geology Unit (MGU) of
the US Geological Survey – the USA having entered the
War in December 1941. The initial MGU roster included
only 10 geologists, a typist and an illustrator, but this group
grew to peak of about 100 in 1945 (Terman, 1998). The
total wartime roster of 157 personnel comprised 114
professionals (88 geologists, 11 soil scientists, six biblio-
graphers, ﬁve engineers, three editors and one forester) plus
43 support staff (illustrators, typists, photographers and
reviewers). MGU completed 313 studies (including 140
major terrain folios, 42 other major special reports and 131
minor studies) which in total contained about 5000 maps,
4000 photographs and ﬁgures, 2500 large tables and 140
terrain diagrams. The folios, produced at an average rate of
one per week, usually by a team of three to eight scientists,
were largely compiled from such scientiﬁc journals, books,
maps and photographs as were readily accessible in the area
of Washington, DC, USA – the primary base of the MGU.
Regional
folios typically contained a section on water
supply, illustrated by small-scale maps.

information on wells and springs. An attempt is made to
evaluate the potential ground-water resources, and to
indicate the most promising sources of supply’. The two
water supply maps contained in the study were both in
black-and-white rather than colour. One (a general map)
distinguished highly permeable deposits, fairly permeable
rocks, poorly permeable rocks and impermeable rocks by
ornament, this simple distinction ampliﬁed by data in an
accompanying table. The second map indicated springs and

whole of Italy, although only the adjacent (Napoli) sheet
adopted the same style and four-colour printing. The three
northern sheets use only a monochrome blue overprint on a
grey base map, and of these, the two ﬁnal sheets (5 and 6)
have less elegant colouring and text than sheet 4. However,
all maps in the series depict essentially the same range of

under UK Home Forces in February 1943, but transferred
to North Africa in late March, to a base some 20 miles
south of Algiers (Clough, 1952). As the campaign pro-
from the scene of
gressed, Algiers became too far
operations, and in June 1944, Allied Forces Headquarters
and its survey units moved to Italy, the Survey Directorate
to Caserta, near Naples.

Water

supply data overprinted in blue (Figure 29)
comprise the courses of aqueducts plus features of both
surface water and groundwater. Only two categories of
ground are indicated, by different intensities of stipple: A
with water usually abundant, at depths less than 50 feet
[15 m], and B with only moderate supplies, probably
available at depths between 50 and 100 feet [15–30 m].
The maps noted: ‘Only patterned areas are recommended
for drilling during operational stage. Later work by ground-
water geologists may locate other places favorable for well
drilling’. Text (dated September 1943) printed on the
reverse of each map varied between sheets, but consistently

tabulated river discharge data, and provided extensive notes
summarizing information on surface water (streams, and
lakes, reservoirs or irrigation canals as appropriate), ground-
(wells and springs), and sometimes municipal
water
supplies. Some sheets tabulated data for streams, irrigation
canals, type A areas, type B areas and the remainder of the
region, plus wells (town, depth in feet, yield in gallons per
minute, and any descriptive features, e.g. hardness of water
in ppm). The Bologna-Firenze sheet (Figures 30) is one of
the most informative maps of this series. It shows more
extensive stippled areas, more reservoirs and far more deep
boreholes,
if fewer large springs, than typical for other
sheets. The reverse of the map (Figure 31) shows an
intensity of data fairly typical for maps in this series.

These water supply maps for Italy at both 1 : 500 000 and
1 : 250 000 scales were generated for joint British and
American operations. Moreover, they were printed under
British auspices, and during 1943 like King’s 1 : 50 000
maps for France. However, in style they are very different

The Cartographic Journal

(Shotton, 1963; Rose, 2004b). He was ‘greatly sought after
as a consultant on water supply matters’ (Shotton, 1963, p.
178), and served for some time as chairman of
the
‘Hydrology Sub-Committee’ of the Geological Society of
London. His last publication (King, 1957) was entitled
‘Water supply and geology’ – published after retirement to
his native North Yorkshire. Appointed as the geological
adviser to the War Ofﬁce (which later became the Ministry
of Defence) until his retirement from Cambridge in 1955,
he maintained British military expertise for potential
hydrogeological mapping for 10 years post-war, and edited
the Royal Engineers textbook (Anon., 1949) that was to
guide the next generation of British army ofﬁcers in
principles of militarily applied geology.

Shotton also became a professor, at the University of
Shefﬁeld in 1945, moving to the University of Birmingham
in 1949, and gained distinction primarily in the ﬁeld of
Quaternary geology – leading to his election as a later
President of the Geological Society, and as a Fellow of the
Royal Society (Coope, 1994; Rose and Clatworthy, 2008a).
At Birmingham, he later founded an MSc course in
hydrogeology – which continues to ﬂourish to this day.
In 1955, he succeeded King as geological adviser to the
Ministry of Defence, until about 1970. Thereafter, the post
lapsed.

Black remained at Cambridge, where he ‘played a role in
establishing sedimentary petrology (sedimentology, as it is
now called) as a separate branch of the earth sciences’
(Jeans, 1980, p. 4). His sedimentary laboratory was the ﬁrst
of its kind in England. He is, however, arguably now best
known for his research on the genesis and composition of
carbonate rocks, and on their microﬂoras, and especially for
his pioneering studies on the petrology and biogenic origin
of Britain’s Upper Cretaceous Chalk. The Yorkshire
Geological Society published two of his seminal papers on
coccoliths (sediment-forming algae) and a memoir com-
piled posthumously from unpublished manuscripts (Jeans
and Rawson, 1980). So far as we know, he contributed
nothing more to either military geology or hydrogeology.
Williams seemingly renewed his career in economic
geology. According to Geological Society records, he
remained a fellow until 2 November 1966, when he
resigned – soon after attaining the age of 65, so presumably
on retirement. Foster-Smith did not return to Camborne to
complete his course (Ludford et al., 2009). However, he
remained a fellow of the Society, ultimately as a senior
fellow, until his death in January 2008. Neither of them
gained prominence in academic geology, or served among
the geologists who pioneered geology in the reserve army
post-war (Rose and Hughes, 1993b). So far as we know,
they also contributed nothing more to either military
geology or hydrogeology.

In addition to the inﬂuence exercised by King and
Shotton, military hydrogeological expertise was preserved
from 1949 by geologists commissioned to serve in the
Royal Engineers of the reserve army (the Territorial Army
[TA] or Army Emergency Reserve [AER]), notably Austin
Woodland (1914–1990) of the Geological Survey, whose
wartime mapping (Woodland, 1943–1946) has been noted
above. He was commissioned as a captain in the Royal
Engineers (TA) on 1 June 1949, and promoted major on

colleagues for North-west Europe, and seem not to have
inﬂuenced their cartography.

POST-WAR

None of the wartime authors was to publish an account of
his water supply map work:
it was something Shotton
(1947) and King (1951) mentioned brieﬂy, but never
illustrated. Their ‘secret’ maps remained so until ofﬁcially
declassiﬁed, by which time all the authors were focused on
their civilian careers.

King gained distinction post-war

as Woodwardian
Professor of Geology at Cambridge, with publications
largely in the ﬁelds of palaeontology and stratigraphy. He
received many honours, including election as President of
the Geological Society, and as a Fellow of the Royal Society

30 January 1953, but left the reserve army in 1957 on
promotion to the grade of District Geologist within the
Survey (Rose and Hughes, 1993b). Successive promotions
took him to leadership of the Survey: he served as its
Director for the years 1976–1979. However, although
Territorial Army geological expertise has been maintained
to the present (Rose and Hughes, 1993c; Rose and
Clatworthy, 2007b), and TA geologists have helped to
generate other types of specialist geotechnical maps, British
military hydrogeological mapping effectively ended with
World War II. Thereafter, for countries within the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation, such mapping became pri-
marily a ‘host nation’
responsibility. Royal Engineers
textbooks published post-war both for geology (Anon.,
1949, 1976a) and water supply (Anon., 1956, 1971,
1976b) make little reference to water supply (or water
resource) mapping.

In the UK, the Water Act of 1945 marked the beginning
of quantitative hydrogeology, affecting the work of the
Geological Survey in several ways (Downing, 2004). The
number of geologists assigned to the Survey’s Water
Department increased, particularly in the late 1950s and
early 1960s. The Survey’s ﬁrst hydrogeological map (for
North-east Lincolnshire) was not published until 1967
(Day et al., 1967), but this marked the beginning of a series
of maps generated by a Hydrogeological Map Programme
covering almost all of the main aquifer units of the UK
(Gray, 2004). Within the UK as a whole, the last three
decades of the twentieth century saw an almost exponential
growth in the number of hydrogeologists and the ﬁelds in
which they work – brought about by changes in the
structure of the UK water industry and environmental

maps had been produced at 1 : 25 000 during World
War I (Rose, 2009) for smaller areas, there was no
precedent for such a large number of maps which in
total provided continuity of cover for so large an area
in near-consistent style.

3.

2. The style pioneered that of modern groundwater
development potential maps (Robins and Rose, 2007),
and although a development of groundwater inventory
maps initiated in the USA, it was new to Europe.
Printing the maps as black ink tracing overlays for use
with the topographical maps then in the widest
military use, rather than as overprints on a standard
or monochrome base map, had little precedent in the
British army (Rose, 2009) and contrasted markedly
with the practice in both German and US armies, but
allowed water supply data on the trace and topogra-
phical data on the corresponding base map to be read
with optimum clarity.

4. The 13 maps of northern France, Luxembourg and
Belgium plus nine maps of Germany, all at 1 : 250 000
and as traces in the same style, effectively pioneered
hydrogeological mapping in Europe across national
boundaries.
Introduction of green coloration on the otherwise
black ink traces of northern Germany provided a clear
guide to areas of poor water quality where this rather
than potential groundwater quantity was likely to
create problems of potable supply.

5.

The water supply maps contributed to the success of the
Allied liberation of Normandy, a consequence of arguably
the greatest amphibious assault in world history, and the
subsequent North-west European Campaign, which culmi-
nated in Allied victory and the end of the war in Europe.
Notably:

1. The maps of northern France at 1 : 50 000 helped to
confirm Calvados rather than the Cotentin Peninsula
as a region favourable for invasion, and guide the siting
of 30 British boreholes to provide potable water for
key installations in the Rear Maintenance Area that
provided part of the infrastructure for subsequent
rapid advance by Allied troops.

2. Maps at 1 : 250 000 for northern France were available
to guide operational planning of water supplies during
the August–September 1944 advance across France
and into Belgium, but new boreholes were unneces-
sary for this phase of operations.

3. Maps at 1 : 250 000 for Belgium were available to
guide the siting of at least 21 British boreholes. These
supplied water to base installations when capture of the
docks at Antwerp, and clearance of the Scheldt estuary,
made it possible to develop a short overland supply
route through Belgium (rather than maintain the
much longer one via Normandy) in preparation for the
continued Allied advance eastwards across the Rhine
and into Germany.
Presumably it was the proven planning value of the
1 : 250 000 maps for northern France and Belgium
that provided the imperative for preparation of similar
maps for northern Germany from November 1944
onwards, although only a few British boreholes were

CONCLUSIONS

Water supply maps prepared by British military geologists
during World War II reveal several innovations relative to
such maps prepared during World War I, to maps published
by the Geological Survey of Great Britain, by the United
States Geological Survey, or for German armed forces,
notably:

1. The 25 maps of northern France at 1 : 50 000 were the
first British hydrogeological map series at such a
detailed scale, and although German hydrogeological

88

The Cartographic Journal

actually emplaced in Germany, near the Rhine, before
the end of the war.

5. The use made of these maps for siting of British
boreholes quantified above was only part of their
value. American and Canadian as well as other Allied
forces had access to these maps and they also drilled
boreholes. Moreover, the maps were a guide to regions
unsuitable for new boreholes, and therefore to the
military requirement to treat and utilize surface waters,
build pipelines or face the challenge of transporting
water as well as ammunition and other supplies.

Perception of the value of militarily applied hydrogeology
was one of the reasons why the Chief Engineer of 21st
Army Group [Major-General Sir Drummond Inglis] noted
gratefully after the Allied victory in Europe:
‘We had,
fortunately, long appreciated the importance of geology in
modern war’ (Inglis, 1946, p. 177).

The objective of this study is the production and visualization of an emotional map
to reveal the unique emotions inherent to the areas surrounding the Yeongsan River,
which is often referred to as ‘the cradle of civilization’ in Korea. The sites selected for
this study are the 11 cities and districts (5667.6 km2) that cut across the vast granary in
the southeastern region of Korea, near the Yeongsan River. The emotional map was pro-
duced by extracting features of historical and cultural heritage distributed throughout
this region and by using a geographic information systems program and its functions
for spatial analysis. A database was constructed through interviews with locals and
Global Positioning System to index 4318 pieces of cultural heritage to achieve the visu-
alization of emotions. Among the 558 historical relics considered for representing the
regional culture, 100 with the largest emotional impact were selected. It was determined
that loyalty (
) should
be the major emotional elements. Methodologically, a set of regional, periodic, histor-
ical, and emotional classiﬁcation codes were ﬁrst systematized. After subjecting this
data to inverse distance weight interpolation and vertical exaggeration coefﬁcients, the
three-dimensional emotional map could be visualized.

Introduction

Owing to the development of information and communication technology and the advance-
ment of map design software, location information has come to be regarded as an important
element of the information society. Recently, even information about the history and cul-
ture of a particular region has been stored into a database (DB) and shared through the
Internet. Therefore, it is important to carry out further studies on systematic classiﬁcation,
spatial analysis, and application of the diverse location information stored.

Humankind created different civilizations along rivers; thousands of historical relics
and cultural heritages were distributed around these rivers. Traditional lifestyles; historic
events, ideas, and literature; and historical relics and remains are cultural contents with
high practical value in a knowledge-based society. Moreover, by analyzing the forma-
tion and distribution pattern of these historical and cultural relics, we can determine each

region’s distinctive emotional factors. This is because historical relics and remains reﬂect
the distinctive emotion of each region and country.

The present day is often referred to as a period of emotions (Ha and Kim 2009).
Emotion is a powerful cultural code used in various domains of our social life. New terms
such as ‘emotional management,’ ‘emotional marketing,’ and ‘emotional design’ are often
seen in mass media (Institute of Honam Studies 2008). These terms are consistent with the
existence of a close relationship between the regional culture and emotions of the people.
Moreover, frequent research has been conducted on the representation of the history and
culture of regions or eras on maps (Small 2004, Kong 2005, Gayo-Cal et al. 2006, Lee
2010); research has also been conducted on the cultures of water system areas (Thieler and
Danforth 1994, Sugumaran et al. 2004).

The study of emotions has proceeded in an extensive range of ﬁelds including neuro-
science, psychology, engineering, design, fashion, food, colors, and marketing. The studies
related to emotions began after American psychologist William James published his work
entitled, ‘What is an emotion’ in 1884 (Nagashima and Tomoeda 1984, Solomon 2003).
Moreover, in Japan, some researches recently attempted to design maps based on the
regional differences and distribution aspects of the culture of agricultural areas (Nagashima
and Tomoeda 1984). In France, geographical studies were carried out on the cultural prop-
erties and aspects for ethnic groups (Peltre and Thouvenot 1987). Researchers in Korea
have also produced an electronic cultural map of the Chosun period and managed to organ-
ically unite and store various cultural themes of the time (Kwon 2003). Furthermore, a
study on a ‘project for systematizing the emotions ingrained in Korean culture for a global
communication code’ is under way with the government support by the Institute of Honam
Studies at Chonnam National University (Lee 2010).

Christian Nold’s ‘Bio Mapping Project’ (biomapping.net) is one of the typical
researches conducted on emotional maps. By checking galvanic skin response and inves-
tigating the related biodata, such as degrees of stress and excitation, followed by carrying
out a large-scale project, such as the Emotion Mapping Project (emotionmap.net) which
included Paris East, Stockport, San Francisco, and Greenwich Emotion Map, he carried
out the biomapping project. Krygier and Wood (2011) suggested a method of mapping
intangible data by using geographic information systems (GIS). Based on this method,
recently, few attempted to use GIS for mapping quantitative data. On the other hand, Cope
and Elwood (2009) collected and edited various researches related to ‘qualitative GIS’
and deﬁned and showcased theory and practices to use the qualitative data. These stud-
ies are considered immensely helpful in visualizing the intangible data in the near future.
Nevertheless, substantial research was not conducted on how to extract emotional factors
from traditional cultures and historical relics and how to visualize them.

To express intangible emotional elements on the map, it is essential to use the inter-
polation method. Studies were conducted by Bartier and Keller (1996), Watson and Philip
(1985), Mueller et al. (2004), and Lu and Wong (2008) who used multivariate interpolation
and inverse distance weight (IDW) or kriging to improve the quality of maps. Meanwhile,
some researches on three-dimensional (3D) visualization (Oh 2002, Seo and Joh 2003,
Demsar and Skeppstrom 2005) were conducted in various ﬁelds related to facilities, envi-
ronmental pollution, and climate change. However, this study has applied the IDW method,
which has used a lot for spatial interpolation and visualized emotional maps in 3D by apply-
ing vertical exaggeration coefﬁcients so that the patterns of emotional distribution can be
clearly seen.

When reviewing the studies above, the production of maps with a view towards
including history, culture, and relics has been attempted in numerous countries. However,

research into the mapping and visualization of emotions is insufﬁcient. Hence, in this paper
we have attempted to collect and analyze items of cultural heritage related to emotions for
the ﬁrst time. In particular, it should be noted that emotional factors have been extracted and
rearranged along the temporal and spatial dimensions to prepare an emotional code. The
ultimate objective of this study is the production and visualization of emotional maps that
show Korean emotions through the analysis of historical and cultural heritage distributed
across regions surrounding a river known as the cradle of civilization in Korea.

Emotional maps provided through information of historical relics have a merit of grasp-
ing and sharing the ﬂow of history and people’s life patterns immanent in a particular
space. Since emotions are not visible, it is essential that one visualizes them properly,
and the outcomes will contribute to rediscovering and securing the values and identity of a
region. Therefore, this process of mapping and 3D visualization of intangible elements like
emotion extracted from historical relics will be an original case different from the existing
GIS researches.

2. Study area and methodological process

2.1. Study area
The spatial range of the target region is the area surrounding the Yeongsan River, which
consists of three cities – Gwangju, Mokpo, and Naju – and eight districts – Damyang,
Changsong, Hwasun, Yongam, Hampyong, Muan, Haenam, and Yonggwang (Figure 1).
Moreover, the Yeongsan River Basin is a region that occupies great signiﬁcance in the for-
mation of the historical culture and emotions for the Gwangju-Jeonnam region (Jang and
Lee 2009). Various historical and cultural relics are distributed around the numerous tribu-
taries (Hwangryong, Gwangju, Jiseok, Gomakwon, Hampyong, etc.) and centered around
the independent Yeongsan River. Hence, we chose this region to conduct our in-depth
research into Korean emotions.

The Yeongsan River ﬂows into the western sea by crossing over the extensive granary of
the Naju plains. It is one of the four rivers of Korea within the basin area of 371.4 km2. The

river is 136-km long (mainstream). Approximately 2.1 million people reside in the areas
surrounding the river. When the ﬂux is abundant, seawater ﬂows 73 km inland by going
up the river owing to the effects of tide and is active in marine transportation and distribu-
tion activities. This region is famous for its abundant prehistoric relics, such as dolmens,
ancient tombs, and kiln sites, and its marine interchange with other countries like China and
Japan, which was very vibrant in ancient times. Especially, the region selected for this study
belonged to the nodal region through which new ideas, religions, cultures, and technolo-
gies were introduced and spread into its neighboring regions. Geopolitically speaking, this
region was invaded by other countries several times in the history of Korea and had been the
core zone raising armies for the cause of justice during almost every war. Especially, it had
been the center for the Gwangju Students’ Independence Movement during the Japanese
ruling era and the Gwangju Pro-democracy Movement (May 18, 1980). Hence, it is evident
that the Yeongsan River Basin has played a signiﬁcant role in every developmental stage
in the history of Korea, indicating that it has always been very sensitive, high on emotional
elements.

Ultimately, this region is the most appropriate area for the production of an emo-
tional map of Korea. We consider it a place where various emotional elements and unique
emotional systems can be best understood.

2.2. Study subjects and process

The temporal range of the spatial data was determined by sub-dividing the time from the
prehistoric to the present day into 10 periods. Our basic data included 4318 historical relics
investigated during the past 3 years (2007–2009), and an extensive DB was compiled with
Global Positioning System (GPS) and interviews with locals for each relic. Interviews
were carried out by visiting the cultural centers (11) in the area each time an investigation
was completed on a particular area. In general, through an academic seminar for rural
historians and elder residents, particulars (relic name, period, location, and outline) for
this research were veriﬁed by them. During such a process of correcting misinformation
and supplementing information about relics missing, this study could minimize possible
errors. Furthermore, a relic’s cultural assets related to Korean culture and history, religious
facilities, and historical events were utilized in the analysis to visualize emotions.

For spatial analysis, 558 historical relics symbolizing the regional culture were chosen
among 4318 relics. From among these 558 historical relics, the 100 relics most abun-
dant in emotional factors were selected. After grasping the historical signiﬁcance of each

relic, the elements of loyalty (
) were selected as the major emotional elements. Moreover, the classiﬁcation codes
(
per region, period, relic, and emotion were determined and an emotional distribution chart
was produced using the IDW interpolation method (Watson and Philip 1985, Bartier and
Keller 1996, Mueller 2004, Lu and Wong 2008). Furthermore, the spatial analysis function
and the vertical exaggeration factor of the GIS were applied to increase the legibility of the
3D visualization (Oh 2002, Seo and Joh 2003, Demsar and Skeppstrom 2005). Here, the
programs ArcViewGIS 3.3, ArcGIS 9.3, and the 3D Analyst Extension were used.

The spatial DB (roads, rivers, contours, relics, GPS data, etc.) includes a base map
consisting of the foundation map and a thematic map for each ﬁeld. The base map was a
digital map (76 indexes) at a scale of 1:25,000, whereas the thematic map was prepared
by using the distribution of relics and emotions. Moreover, the DB attribute is used as
the basic data for visualization including search, inquiry, and analysis by linking common
identiﬁers with future spatial DB through bibliographic investigation, local investigation,

and interview data. In order to provide additional information, a reference DB that includes
photographs, satellite images, and multimedia data was created.

3. Mapping of emotional data
3.1. Formation and approach

Culture can be deﬁned as the native characteristics of a region, created through the har-
mony between the locals in a ﬁxed environment and their living space (Park 2008). Hence,
cultural resources are the components of culture that reveal the identity of a region through
architectural structures, locations, ﬁgures, and festivities. Furthermore, these resources
point to the native emotions of the region. Ultimately, the emotional map is a general chart
expressing the tangible and intangible cultural resources and emotional data of a region
(Figure 2). In this way, the emotional map is unlike a general map because it is more akin
to a symbolic map that encompasses different places and people.

Here, tangible cultural resources can easily be expressed as geographical coordinates.
However, the inherent difﬁculty with intangible cultural resources is that their actual posi-
tions are ambiguous. A more detailed and multi-dimensional approach is required when we
consider that emotional elements must be extracted from tangible and intangible cultural
resources.

Mind maps, cognitive maps, and social maps are commonly used to express the life,
experiences, and images of local residents (Bone 2010, Dhindsa et al. 2011, Lee et al.
2011). A mind map is a method of expressing thoughts by expanding a single keyword
using images, symbols, ﬁgures, colors, or words. A cognitive map mainly expresses per-
sonal thoughts and memories gained through experiences in a certain space through hand
drawings. A social map is prepared through questions and answers related to lifestyles,
dialects, and social issues of a region. In recent times, experts have used two or more of
these traditional methods or professional programs and equipments (Park 2008). These
methods are creditable because they deliver personal experiences and images beyond a
level of simply conveying information. Moreover, they are used a lot as a practice tool in
the ﬁeld of education to improve students’ abilities of spatial cognition and expression.
Besides, by reorganizing their thoughts through an emotional map, people are expected
to improve their thinking skills, creativity, and memory. This study explores new methods
that include the use of spatial analysis function of GIS, layer reiteration, and interpolation
(Figure 3).

In summarizing the problems of cultural maps that presently exist for domestic and for-
eign regions, it can ﬁrst be said that their purpose is to serve as tourist or information maps
for regional publicity. Second, these maps have a further weakness in that special themes
and historical facts cannot be structured into spatial and periodic dimensions. In addition,
they have difﬁculties in grasping the historical–cultural features and periodic status of the
region. Hence, in this study we have focused on three different differentiation methods to
solve these problems and overcome the current weaknesses of cultural maps. First, histor-
ical facts and speciﬁc themes will be classiﬁed spatially and periodically. Second, a map
production method that is readily understood by the public will be presented. Third, cul-
tural policy establishment data that are useful for developing a regional society will be
provided.

3.2. Visualization method

The visualization process should reveal the potential intangible emotions while showing
the location data of relics that are widely distributed. This means that the properties of
historically signiﬁcant relics should be examined to extract the emotional elements and
expressed dimensionally after coding the results. Among the interpolation methods that are
currently used, bilinear, cubic convolution, IDW, and kriging are the most well known. Here
we use the IDW method, which is the most popular among those mentioned. This method
ﬁnds the value of an unknown point by calculating its nonlinear weighting according to
a known basis point. The method is based on the theory that the impact on an unknown
point by different basis points gradually decreases as the distance from the point increases.
The reason for selecting this method is that it is effective in cases where the number of
relics with accurate emotional factors is insufﬁcient in comparison to the wide area of
interest. Moreover, it has been determined that this method can effectively visualize the
spatial distribution patterns of emotions on the map (Watson and Philip 1985, Bartier and
Keller 1996, Mueller 2004, Lu and Wong 2008).

4. Visualization of emotional map

4.1. Spatial and attribute data
The digital map must be prepared to make use of the spatial analysis function of the GIS.
The spatial data included in the basic map were edited after purchasing the digital map
(1:25,000 scale, 76 index) produced by the National Geographic Information Institute.
Longitude and latitude coordinates for the location of the relics were created by using a
mobile outdoor GPS (Garmin eTrex Legend C). The emotional information of the relics
was created by investigating data of various forms. This required a systematic classiﬁcation
method to manage the data effectively. Hence, we designed a DB that could classify the
relics by theme, period, and region (Figure 4).

A setup for the classiﬁcation system and a coding process for each item were required
to establish an effective DB. Hence, each subject area was divided into 11 regions, each
with a unique 5-digit number as the regional classiﬁcation code, according to the bound-
aries of the administrative districts. The time from the ancient times to the present was
divided into 10 periods organized by a 3-digit code. In the case of emotions, the data were
classiﬁed into 10 different types by investigating the native emotional factors associated
with the relics. Moreover, emotional classiﬁcations were deﬁned for ﬁve different types
of simple emotions (loyalty, justice, courtesy, resentment, and anger) and ﬁve different

types of complex emotions (loyalty–justice, justice–resentment, courtesy–resentment,
justice–anger, and resentment–anger) according to a three-digit code (Table 1).

The classiﬁcation of emotions was provided through three stages with assistance from
a scholar of Korean history and culture. The ﬁrst stage was to establish a frame of clas-
siﬁcation based on Korean traditions, religions, historical events, and geographical traits.
The second stage was to focus on discovering unique emotional elements deeply acting on
the Korean people’s inner world. In other words, emotion-forming factors were extracted,
such as Korean beauty and originality, people’s wisdom of life and manners, interior and
exterior collisions and exchanges, and social conﬂicts and reconciliations. The last stage
was to provide single emotions and complex emotions by combining both distinctive and
common things appearing while historical relics were being formed.

All the relics were largely classiﬁed into 4 kinds, such as ruins, artifacts, documentary
heritage, and natural heritage, which were divided into 25 sub-items. Then, by applying
ﬁve-digit codes per item, the entire list of relics could be provided (Table 2).

The basic scale of a layer was 1:25,000 and AutoCAD Map (Autodesk Corp.) was
used for editing. The spatial data used in the ﬁnal analysis was formatted as a shape ﬁle
(.shp), which was constructed using the converting function supported by ArcGIS Toolbox
(ESRI Corp.). The spatial data of this study could largely be divided into the basic map
and the thematic map. In the case of the basic map, 13 layers were constructed in all vector
types, whereas in the thematic map, 2 layers and 11 layers were constructed in the form of
rasterplots to use in the spatial analysis (Table 3).

4.2. Three-dimensional visualization

Unlike existing cultural maps, emotional maps require an entirely different visualization
method that not only reveals the position of subjects already existing on the indices but also
extracts the intangible attributes to visibly display in the indeﬁnite space. In other words,
it extracts the potential emotional factors of a region and visualizes them. There were 46
participants from 8 ﬁelds (antiquities, history, architecture, art, ecological environment,
folklore, literature, and foods), who contributed 4318 pieces of historic data. Furthermore,
among the 558 historical relics distributed in the Yeongsan River Basin based on the emo-
tional classiﬁcation code mentioned above, 100 distinct relics were selected as the basic
data for visualizing emotion (Figure 5).

Emotions are difﬁcult to depict accurately when there is insufﬁcient information about
relics, historical events, or locations. In these circumstances, it also becomes difﬁcult to
rely on the results. To satisfy the demand for accuracy, the emotional relics were selected
by consulting with specialists in each ﬁeld. These relics were re-classiﬁed into simple
emotional codes (loyalty, justice, courtesy, resentment, and anger) and complex emo-
tional codes (loyalty–justice, justice–resentment, courtesy–resentment, justice–anger, and
resentment–anger). Subsequently, a distribution of these emotional factors was created so
that their spatial correlations and emotional features could be visualized. In particular, the
emotions were visualized in the form of 2D and 3D maps (Figures 6–12).

The 3D visualization of the emotional map dimensionally expresses the strengths of
feeling for the emotional codes deﬁned above. In reality, when differences in the strength
of emotional factors are not strong, the clarity of the distribution may decrease. To solve
this problem, we calculated a vertical exaggeration for the 3D scene to enable a more
accurate classiﬁcation for the distribution among the regions. In other words, the strength
of feeling (Z) for the subject regions (X and Y ) was scored on a scale of 10–100, and the
coefﬁcients for vertical exaggeration were 176.5 on average. Moreover, the light angle was
set with an azimuth of 135◦ and an altitude of 30◦ to express the emotions with greater
dimensions (Table 4).

Isolines were created by expressing the emotional factors of relics as Grid data by using
the interpolation method and then inter-linking the relics with the same attribute value.

5. Results and discussion

Through analysis of the emotional map prepared by these processes, the distribution of
Korean emotions around the Yeongsan River Basin could be found. First, the map was
divided into an upper, middle, and lower area along the water system to reveal the major
emotional factors for the 11 cities and districts according to each region. In the mountain-
ous areas, the eastern region of the upper area revealed strong emotions of ‘resentment,’
whereas the western regions expressed emotions of ‘courtesy’ and ‘loyalty.’ The middle
area was a region of vast plains that expressed the emotion of ‘justice’ equally over its
entire region, whereas the emotion of ‘anger’ also appeared in the central area. The lower
area was the region with the most interactions with Japan because it was close to the ocean.
In this region, the emotion of ‘loyalty’ appeared to be the most distinct; in addition, the
complex emotions of ‘loyalty–justice’ and ‘justice–courtesy’ could be seen.

When examining the results for each region, we see that the Yongam, Haenam, and
Hwason districts display the distinct emotion of ‘loyalty,’ whereas the Gwangju, Naju,
and Muan districts display the emotion of ‘justice.’ The Yonggwang, Changsong, and
Haenam districts mainly show the emotion of ‘courtesy’ and the Hampyong, Gwangju, and
Damyang districts strongly express the emotion of ‘resentment.’ Moreover, the emotion of
‘anger’ appeared distinctively in certain areas of Gwangju, Hampyong, and Naju.

Moreover, it is possible to ﬁnd some aspects of the geographical environment and social
change of the region through an emotional map. This region experienced several invasions,
especially from Japan because of its geographical and strategic importance, and along the

6. Conclusion
The signiﬁcance of this study can be found in the emotional maps produced through the
integration of GIS technology and historical information from the river districts, as this

has never been attempted before. The study is unique in its use of digital maps in place
of simple and traditional analog maps. Ultimately, it offers an efﬁcient way to collect,
store, analyze, and represent emotional factors and their sub-elements distributed in the
geographical space.

This begs the question: ‘How will the emotional and cultural map be put to use?’ As
the study results have visualized the emotional elements in various forms by using the spa-
tial analysis method of the GIS, the resultant maps can serve the following functions. First,
they can be used to extract the emotional codes of each region. Second, the maps provide a
valuable tool for understanding the correlations among place, people, and emotions. Third,
we anticipate that the maps will contribute to the establishment of Korea’s emotional sys-
tem through the visualization of emotional factors. Last, they can be used as basic data for
fusion complex research in related topics by expanding the recognition of emotions.

During the creation of emotional maps, we should use cultural maps to secure accurate
location data in time and space. It is remarkably difﬁcult to visualize cultural phenom-
ena without this accuracy. Moreover, it is impossible to map all the cultural phenomena
present. Therefore, I will focus much more on qualitative visualization as well as quantita-
tive expression of cultural phenomenon in future studies, while continuing our research on
the establishment of emotional systems. Also, comparative research, using hydrospherical
districts located in other regions and nations, should be conducted in parallel with these
studies.

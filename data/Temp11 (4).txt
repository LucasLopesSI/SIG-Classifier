A GIS Toolbox for Measuring and Mapping Person-Based
Space-Time Accessibility

Department of Geography, University of Minnesota-Duluth

Abstract
This article presents a toolbox to compute and map person-based accessibility indicators, based on classi-
cal time geography concepts. The intent is to provide GIS and urban planning practitioners with a user-
friendly and easily customizable tool. While it relies on well-known concepts, the toolbox implements a
major innovation in person-based accessibility assessment by taking into account opening hours when
measuring the accessibility of urban facilities. The toolbox can be downloaded from http://bit.ly/

Introduction

For most people in industrialized countries, everyday life is structured around activities involv-
ing travel from their homes to places such as work, school, stores, clinics, leisure facilities and
so on. Morris et al. (1979, p. 91) deﬁne accessibility as “the ease with which activities may be
reached from a given location using a particular transportation system”. Accessibility matters
from several perspectives, notably those of social welfare or justice and urban or economic
efﬁciency. Poor accessibility to educational or health services, for instance, can negatively
impact the welfare of the population, and if some sub-groups are systematically more affected
this would amount to social injustice. Poor accessibility of work areas from residential areas –
“spatial mismatch”, see Gobillon et al. (2007) – results in a loss of economic growth (Li et al.
2013).

Traditionally, accessibility has been measured according to a place-based perspective,
meaning for instance that the accessibility of an urban facility by the residents of a certain
neighborhood is inferred from a measure of the accessibility of the physical location of the
facility from the physical location of the neighborhood. This leads to what Miller (2007, p.
508) calls a “place-based fallacy”, which “occurs when one incorrectly infers the attribute,
activities or experiences of people from places”. In his paper, Miller argues that both the
decreasing friction of physical distance and the loosening of social time regulation in an indus-
trial society render this fallacy increasingly problematic. He advocates a “people-based
science”, anchored in the concepts of time geography (Hägerstrand 1970), that takes into
account the actual space-time constraints and opportunities of individuals. The added value of
this person-based approach is illustrated for instance by Kwan (1998) or Casas et al. (2009),

who show how the assessment of personal accessibility through individuals’ spatiotemporal
constraints varies from place-based cumulative-opportunity measures.

Person-based space-time accessibility measures are complex to compute and the lack of
computing power was a major hurdle at the time they were ﬁrst proposed. Lenntorp (1979)
reports in his pioneering work that the study of the potential access of 200 individuals to
grocery stores in a suburb of Stockholm required the encoding of 3,000 punch cards, almost
six hours of computing on a Univac 1108 and resulted in a 3,500-page printout to go through.
Increased computing power and storage capacity led to the rise of GIS processing and of the
“big data” era, both of which improved the practicability of person-based accessibility meas-
ures. Since the 1990s many academic experiments have demonstrated the feasibility and inter-
est of person-based accessibility studies, notably Weber (2003), Casas et al. (2009), Neutens
et al. (2012), Farber et al. (2013), Widener et al. (2013), to cite only a few recent ones. Interest
in this approach even spread beyond the ﬁelds of urban geography and transportation, to
ﬁelds as diverse as criminology (Ratcliffe 2006) and archaeology (Mlekuž 2010). In parallel,
the original time geography concepts have been reﬁned, with the introduction of notions such
as space-time accessibility and beneﬁt measures, compatible with the classical framework of
utility-based functions (Miller 1999), joint accessibility (Neutens et al. 2008), or more recently,
reliable space-time prisms (Chen et al. 2013).

Despite all this scientiﬁc activity, person-based accessibility measures have yet to diffuse
outside academia to the concrete world of practitioners. An obvious reason may be the lack of
user-friendly tools derived from this research, and the shortcomings of the existing ones.
Indeed, Delafontaine et al. (2012) identify only two tools designed for use by a non-academic
audience, such as urban or transportation planning practitioners (leaving aside other time
geography GIS implementations that are not focused on accessibility, such as the one proposed
by Chen et al. (2011)). These are the historical GIS STAM software by Miller and Wu (2000),
linked to ArcInfo®, and the stand-alone STA toolkit developed by the CartoGIS research
cluster at Ghent University (Neutens et al. 2010). To these two can now be added the
community-developed online service OpenTripPlanner (OTP) and its still-developing analysis
extension (OTP Analyst). Delafontaine et al. (2012, p. 1134) argue that the usefulness of these
tools for practitioners is notably impaired by the fact that they do not produce area-covering
maps, the accessibility measures provided are too complex and they do not take into account
the operating hours of urban facilities. The aim of the present article is to introduce a user-
friendly toolbox to compute person-based accessibility measures that does not suffer from
these ﬂaws.

The structure of this article is as follows: the introduction is followed by a section provid-
ing a conceptual and methodological background on time geography and person-based acces-
sibility measures. A third section presents the implementation of the toolbox itself, followed by
an illustration section. The ﬁnal section outlines possible future development of the toolbox
and discusses the intrinsic limitations of the approach adopted.

2 Space-Time Accessibility

2.1 Classical Time Geography Concepts

Person-based space-time accessibility measures are derived from the time geography concepts
originally formulated by Hägerstrand (1970), which have subsequently been expanded and
reﬁned by numerous scholars. A succinct summary can be found in CSISS Classics (Corbett

2001) and more in-depth explanations are available, for instance, in Miller’s article (2007 pp.
512–521). For the sake of brevity, the present reminder will be limited to an overview of a few
key concepts only.

Time geography is well known for its representations that are built in a 3-dimensional ref-
erence system, where coordinates on the X and Y axes deﬁne spatial locations and the Z-axis
represents time. A space-time prism is a 3-dimensional ﬁgure that gathers all the locations that
can be reached between two ﬁxed points in time and space (see Figure 1). The exact shape of a
prism depends on both the space-time characteristics of the origin and destination and on
mobility assumptions. Denser networks and higher travel speeds will producer larger prisms.

The ﬁrst GIS implementations of time geography led to the development of the concept of
Potential Path Area – PPA (Miller 1991), which can be deﬁned as the 2D projection of the 3D
space-time prism to the geographical plane (see Figure 1). In other words, a PPA deﬁnes the
space that is accessible between two locations within a given time-budget. Taking into account
all the pairs of consecutive ﬁxed activities in an individual’s daily schedule, several PPAs can be
aggregated into a Daily Potential Path Area – DPPA, which represents the space accessible to
a speciﬁc individual given his or her space-time constraints for the day (Kwan 2004).

2.2 Measures of Space-Time Accessibility

Neutens et al. (2011) provide an extensive historical overview of space-time accessibility meas-
ures, and how they were reﬁned over time. Simple space-time accessibility measures were ini-
tially based on the size of the space-time prism or the PPA (volume, surface, length of the
transportation network within the PPA). But accessibility studies usually have a target – such

as jobs or urban amenities. Thus space-time accessibility measures based on the enumeration
of speciﬁc urban opportunities located within the PPA or DPPA or on the amount of time that
can be spent at each facility were developed. Obviously, these measures are improved when the
operating hours of facilities are taken into account, by selecting only those that intersect the
space-time prism and are thus deemed “feasible”, that is not only physically “reachable” but
also “available” at the time they can be reached (Weber and Kwan 2002; Kim and Kwan
2003). A wide variety of speciﬁc accessibility measures can be derived from the selection of
feasible opportunities, to ﬁt study needs. When additional information on the attractiveness of
speciﬁc locations or opportunities is available, utility-based space-time accessibility measures
can be computed, ﬁtting within the classical theoretical framework of place-based accessibility
measures (Miller 1999; Ashiru et al. 2003).

However, while increasing in reﬁnement, these measures also grew in complexity, to the
point that Delafontaine et al. (2012, p. 1134) judged that: “The complexity of these functions
obscures the interpretation for end-users who do not have prior knowledge about time geogra-
phy and accessibility modeling”. It is true that the equations look intimidating and conse-
quently the calculations may appear as a “black box” to certain categories of end-users. At
this stage of development, the toolbox presented below does not implement such utility func-
tions but rather simpler functions based on cumulative opportunities. The main novelty is that
it is, to the author’s knowledge, the ﬁrst publicly available tool that enables taking into
account the operating hours of urban facilities in the calculation of person-based accessibility
measures (Delafontaine et al.’s proposal from 2012 operates from a place-base perspective –
see the discussion section on the shortcomings of this approach relative to trip chaining).

2.3 Measures of Space-Time Accessibility Provided by the Toolbox

The toolbox can produce raster maps of PPAs or DPPAs, which was one of the features iden-
tiﬁed by Delafontaine et al. (2012) as missing in previous toolkits. The size of these PPAs or
DPPAs can be used as an accessibility indicator. But the main innovation of the toolbox pre-
sented here is the availability of indicators derived from the feasibility of facilities, taking into
account their operating hours as well as a minimal cutoff time for their usage (see Section 3.2
for the algorithm to calculate the feasibility of facilities). These indicators include the number
of feasible facilities as well as their proportion within the dataset. An average usage time is
also calculated, across all facilities as well as across feasible facilities only. A facility is deemed
feasible if the three following conditions are fulﬁlled:

It is physically reachable within the PPA or DPPA
It is available (operating) at the time it can be reached

•
•
• The amount of time during which it is available exceeds a user-speciﬁed cutoff time deemed

necessary to use it.

In this way, facilities that are closed or not open long enough after an individual is able to
reach them are excluded from the set of feasible opportunities. Kim and Kwan (2003) also
suggest excluding opportunities located further than a given travel time threshold, but this
feature is not implemented here (this topic is discussed in the last section).

Indicators based on the number of feasible opportunities or their possible usage time can
be useful, as access to more facilities for a longer time implies better accessibility. However,
redundant access to the same types of facilities is not necessarily helpful, which is why a diver-
sity index is also provided.

If facilities are categorized into several types, the diversity index is calculated as the sum of
the squares of the relative frequency of each type of facility (Simpon’s index). The lower the
index, the more diverse the facilities are. If all facilities are of the same type, the index is 1; if
all the types have an equal share of facilities, the index value is 1 divided by the number of
types. This diversity index is calculated for feasible facilities only. The diversity ratio is the
diversity index normalized by the diversity of the facility dataset: if the ratio is greater than 1,
feasible facilities are less diverse than the initial dataset; if it is lower than 1, they are more
diverse.

Depending on the tool from which the indicators are requested, supplemental indicators
may be available: the total “open time” in the DPPA, i.e. the amount of time not devoted to
ﬁxed activities, the “minimum travel time” in the DPPA, i.e. the minimum time required to
travel between the ﬁxed activities, and the “net open time”, which is calculated as the former
minus the latter. The ratio of the average usage time of facilities to the net open time is also an
indicator of accessibility: the lower it is, the more “out of the way” and/or “out of sync” facil-
ities are relative to the spatio-temporal constraints of the studied individual.

3 The Toolbox

3.1 Implementation

Much has been written on the beneﬁts of implementing software solutions in an open-source
and platform-independent environment to disseminate a technology (for instance by Neutens
et al. (2010) regarding the implementation of their STA toolkit). However, there also are
advantages in developing solutions within a popular commercial environment, in terms of
learning curve for potential users, readiness of data sources, integration of results with other
applications and ease of customization.

Although other implementations (through OTP for example) are possible, the toolbox
presented here was developed as an ArcGIS™ toolbox, directly plugging into the advanced
functionalities of the ArcGISTM Network Analyst,
including one-way and turn modeling,
setting of complex impedance parameters, advanced management of snapping of network
locations, possibility of modeling preferences (hierarchies) and temporary barriers. Another
beneﬁt from this implementation is the availability of a ready-to-conﬁgure user interface.

The toolbox is divided into three toolsets and eight tools (see Figure 2). The “Simple PPA”
toolset gathers tools that perform calculations between two ﬁxed activities only, while the
tools in the “Daily PPA” toolset handle a set of several ﬁxed activities throughout the day.
Tools in these two toolsets produce raster maps of the PPA or DPPA, calculate the reachability
or the feasibility of speciﬁc locations, or compute overall accessibility indicators. The “Util-
ities” toolset provides tools that may be used before or after PPA or DPPA calculations.

Tools in the “Simple PPA” and the “Daily PPA” toolsets can be run independently from
one another and rely on the same core procedure to compute a basic PPA (see section 3.2).
Different tools are provided to enable different outputs, depending on the study purposes. Pre-
vious toolkits, like Neutens et al.’s (2010) STA toolkit, already allowed PPA and DPPA calcu-
lations
the ones performed by the “HoursAtIntermediateStops-Points” and
“AvailableTimeInDPPA-Points” tools. The raster versions of these two tools provide area-
covering maps that were not previously available. Moreover, “UsageTimeInSimplePPAby-
Resource” and “UsageTimeInDPPAbyResource” are the ﬁrst publicly available tools that
compute the feasibility of opportunities taking their opening hours into account.

Each tool in the toolbox calls a speciﬁc Python script, which in turn calls common func-
tions written in the main Python module (see Figure 3). This module makes an extensive use of
the ArcPy library, but could be easily adapted to another geospatial library with similar
network functions, keeping the same algorithms. Conversely, ArcGIS users can easily custom-
ize both the interface and algorithms, by modifying the open Python code.

computed with the ODCostMatrix function and later added to the ending time of the origin
activity or subtracted from the beginning time of the destination activity. The time available at
each point of interest is deduced by simple subtraction. Depending on the tool chosen, the
output will be either a set of new attributes or area-covering raster maps, derived through a
simple conversion to raster of a set of points of interest shaped as a regular grid (see Figure 4).
For DPPA calculations, the basic PPA procedure is run iteratively between consecutive
pairs of ﬁxed activities, and the total time available throughout the day at each point of inter-
est is compiled. The output is either a new attribute or a raster map. Additionally, if the points
of interest correspond to facilities, the operating hours of these facilities, as well as a minimum
cutoff time deemed necessary to use them, can be taken into account to determine the possible
usage time of these facilities, following the algorithm presented in Figure 5. This part of the
algorithm is carried out as a simple ﬁeld calculation, where the earliest possible arrival time at
and the latest possible departure time from each facility are matched against its opening and
closing hours through a series of logical and arithmetical operators. The algorithm in its
present form can handle up to three operating periods throughout the day. It returns as attrib-
utes the duration during which each facility is feasible between each pair of ﬁxed activities, as
well as the total duration throughout the day.

The global accessibility measures presented in Section 2.3 can optionally be requested;
these are mostly calculated as simple summary statistics based on the feasibility durations.
Users could easily derive additional indicators based on these same durations.

Figure 6 Perfomance of PPA computation with the PPA toolbox

3.3 Performance

Computation time is always a concern for PPA algorithms and the choice of an implementa-
tion in ArcGISTM does not allow for the same optimization strategy as used in OTP for
instance, where partial calculations from previous iterations of the shortest path algorithm are
recycled in the computation of the distance between each origin-destination pair. However,
computation times are kept at perfectly reasonable levels, as illustrated by the graphs in
Figure 6. These times were established through batch computation in ArcGIS™ 10.2 of simple
PPAs based on networks and datasets of increasing size. The standard desktop PC used for the
experiment was equipped with an Intel® Core™ i7-3770 CPU@ 3.40 GHz processor and ran
on Windows 7 Enterprise – 64-bit. The time depends on both the size of the network (number
of edges) and on the number of calculation points requested, as well as on their multiplicative
factor.

4 Illustrations

This section presents examples of the various outputs that can be obtained from the toolbox
through a series of examples kept purposefully simple. Typical accessibility studies, such as

those mentioned in the introduction, would compare the accessibility of different sub-
populations based on only one, or at most a few, of these outputs. Since the purpose here is to
systematically review all the outputs and their possible uses, the following examples are all
based on just one single ﬁctional individual, whose ﬁxed schedule consists in a round trip to
and back from work, with eight hours spent at work and a total of 12 consecutive hours spent
away from home (these constraints are consistent with a typical working day in France, for a
person who does not have to take care of other family members). Various tools from the
toolbox offer different insights on what might be available to this individual during the four
hours of open time, depending on different scenarios.

The city where these examples are staged is the metropolitan area of Grenoble, France, in
2010. A multi-modal network dataset was built that provides several types of impedances,
notably travel time by car at peak or off hours and average or maximum travel time using
public transit. It should be noted here that the modeling of transit does not rely on GTFS data,
which are not supported yet by the toolbox (see discussion section). The frequency of Gren-
oble’s public transit is so high during the daytime that the frequency of each route is published
instead of a schedule with precise hours. These frequencies were used to set up average and
maximum waiting times as attributes for each connector between the street network (used by
pedestrians to access the transit lines) and the transit stops. These connectors were subse-
quently included in the evaluators for transit travel time, accounting for initial or transfer
waiting times.

The examples below also make use of an extensive database of business and service loca-
tions, with their opening hours, that was gathered or collected in 2010 under supervision by a
team of local researchers (see acknowledgments).

4.1 Raster Maps

Tools that provide raster output should be chosen when seeking to produce maps for visual
analysis or broad estimates of accessibility across an area of study. Cell values are calculated
based on the location of cell centers. The raster maps in Figure 7 were produced by the
“AvailabeTimeInDPPA_Raster” tool and illustrate the variation of urban accessibility, depend-
ing on transportation mode or car trafﬁc ﬂuidity for the studied ﬁctional individual who, in
this scenario, lives in a western suburb of Grenoble and works from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the
main hospital, on the other side of town. The most efﬁcient way to store and aggregate area-
covering accessibility measures for several individuals is through this type of raster map and
map algebra. Maps of average spatio-temporal accessibility based on subsets of a survey
sample can be used to explore global differences in urban accessibility depending on gender,
age, social group, places of residence or of work, and so on.

4.2 Accessibility at Points and Feasibility of Resources

A drawback of raster maps is their constant resolution, which is ill-suited to urban spaces that
are fractal in nature (Batty and Longley 1987). As a consequence, too much computing time
may be devoted to assess the accessibility of spaces that are not really attractive anyway, while
not getting a nuanced enough picture of higher interest areas. In this case, it may be more eco-
nomical to calculate directly the accessibility of speciﬁc points of interest. The map in Figure 8
shows the accessibility of post ofﬁces for the same scenario as in Figure 7, using public transit.
The size of each pie chart is proportional to the total time available in the DPPA at each post

ofﬁce location, calculated with the “AvailableTimeInDPPA_Points” tool. The two southern
locations cannot be reached at all within the DPPA, while the time available is rather similar
across the core-city locations.

However, as mentioned above, when assessing the accessibility of speciﬁc urban resources,
the operating hours of the facilities should be taken into account. In Figure 8, the grey wedge
of each pie chart represents the amount of time within the DPPA that actually falls within the
opening hours of each post ofﬁce, calculated with the “UsageTimeInDPPAbyResource” tool.
In addition to the two post ofﬁces that are not reachable, 10 others are not feasible given their
operating hours. And the potential usage time varies widely, even across core-city locations.

4.3 Accessibility Indicators

The feasibility of a set of locations can be summarized through the various accessibility indica-
tors presented in Section 2.3. Table 1 demonstrates how these indicators can be used to
explore changes in accessibility to food stores induced by changes in the space-time constraints
of an individual schedule.

Different scenarios were built, keeping the core basic constraints of an 8-hour work day
with 12 consecutive hours away from home. The base scenario is the same as in the previous
examples, i.e. an individual living in a western suburb, working at the main hospital and using

public transport. In the second scenario, this individual works a night shift (8 p.m. to 4 a.m.)
and has to travel by car because public transport is not operating when the shift ends. In the
third scenario, the individual is back to a regular day-shift and public transport but now
works in a secondary hospital, located in a southern suburb. And in the last scenario, the indi-
vidual has moved to this southern suburb to be closer to the new workplace.

The metropolitan area of Grenoble contained, in 2010, 690 stores that sold food items,
which are grouped here into ﬁve categories: bakeries; butcher shops; other specialized food
stores; small grocery stores; supermarkets.

The impacts of the scenario changes on the studied individual’s accessibility to these stores
can be seen in the various indicators presented in Table 1. In the second scenario, compared
with the base scenario, the individual travels by car at off-hours and the minimal travel time is
divided by almost four, which allows a longer net open time and a longer average usage time
of food stores. However, not all the time gained in transportation can be spent in stores,
because many of them close well before 8 p.m., when the individual must be at work. As a
result, the ratio usage time/net open time falls from 64 to 58%.

In the third scenario, compared with the base scenario, the individual has a longer
commute by public transport, due to the change of workplace. The minimum travel time in the
DPPA increases by 19 minutes and the average usage time of food stores decreases, but only by
11 minutes. As a result, the ratio usage time/net open time increases slightly, to 65%. This can
be explained by the fact that the commute to this new workplace goes through a wider part of
the core city and is closer on average to more stores.

Finally, in the last scenario the minimal travel time in the DPPA is down to half that of the
base scenario (43 minutes less), following the individual’s move to a new home closer to the
new workplace. But the number of feasible stores decreases and the average usage time
decreases even more signiﬁcantly, down by 21 minutes. As a result, the ratio usage time/net
open time falls to 39%, the lowest of the four scenarios. The explanation is that the now
shorter commute takes place in a less dense urban area. Many more stores are now out of the
way and would require special trips. Though the temporal constraint of this person appears to
have diminished, the spatial constraint has increased.

It can be noted that with all four scenarios, the diversity of the feasible stores is roughly
constant and equivalent to the diversity of the input dataset. This implies that the distributions
of the locations and operating hours of the different types of stores are relatively homo-
geneous, at least within the DPPAs studied here.

5 Discussion

5.1 Potential Developments of the Toolbox

The main asset of the toolset presented in this article may be its ease of use by ArcGIS™ users
familiar with Network Analyst, which hopefully may contribute to the dissemination of space-
time accessibility analyses outside the academic world. To this end, the toolbox has been pub-
licly available on ArcGIS online since January 2013 http://bit.ly/1h6yg5Z. The open code in
Python is easily modiﬁable by anyone who wishes to improve the toolbox or to customize the
tools to their own needs.

While no new concepts are introduced, the toolbox implements a major innovation
in person-based accessibility assessment by taking into account operating hours when
in its present state of develop-
measuring the accessibility of urban facilities. However,
ment,
that could be addressed by future
suffers
development.

Travel times on a given network usually vary throughout the day and an algorithm had
been developed to take this into account when calculating PPAs (Wu and Miller 2001; Wu
et al. 2001). However, this feature is not available in the toolbox, where all the calculations
are done with the same impedance throughout the day, which is unrealistic when computing a
daily PPA. ArcGIS™ Network Analyst allows travel time calculations based on live or histori-
cal trafﬁc data, but the toolbox in its current setup cannot accommodate the required data
input. This is a development priority.

ArcGIS™ Network Analyst currently does not read GTFS data, which can be a real hurdle
to computing PPAs constrained by a public transit schedule. The Grenoble examples presented
in Section 4 are a speciﬁc case: daytime service frequency is so high that no schedule is pub-
lished, but only average frequencies for each line. It is thus possible to set up a network dataset
impedance so that either the maximum or the average waiting time at the origin of a trip and
at each transfer is taken into account. However, in most cases, being able to take into account
schedules published through GTFS datasets – as OTP does – would deﬁnitely be a major
improvement to the toolbox. This endeavor seems feasible, based on work by Melinda
Morang to integrate GTFS data in Network Analyst (Morang n.d.).

Finally, the set of available outputs could be enhanced, which could notably include the
introduction of utility-derived accessibility measures (Ashiru et al. 2003) and the production
of 3D space-time prisms (or series of prisms over the day). The latter would likely be the
most efﬁcient way to derive joint accessibility measures as proposed by Neutens et al. (2008)

and implemented in the STA toolkit (Neutens et al. 2010). An additional development could
be to implement a maximum travel time when determining the set of feasible opportunities,
as suggested by Kim and Kwan (2003). However, the arguments in support of such a limi-
tation tend to shift the focus of the calculations from measuring sheer potential to simulat-
ing realistic behaviors, which would probably be best attempted using agent-based modeling
(see below).

5.2 Intrinsic Limitations of the Approach

5.2.1 Lack of data on individuals’ schedules

Even with a perfected tool, some limitations inherent to the conceptual approach would
subsist. In their critique of person-based space-time accessibility measures, Delafontaine et al.
(2012, p. 1134) underlined the lack of data on individuals’ activity schedules:

Not only is such information merely occasionally available for a sample of individ-
uals, it is also questionable whether this sample data are representative in all its
dimensions for the associated population. This delicate issue has never been pro-
foundly addressed in studies on person-based accessibility, which questions the useful-
ness of the related tools.

Indeed, accurate information on individual activity schedules is hard to come by. Many
person-based accessibility studies have relied on diary surveys providing extensive information
not only on individuals’ effective mobility but also on their spatio-temporal constraints (Kwan
1999; Ritsema van Eck et al. 2005; Kwan and Weber 2008; Schwanen et al. 2008; Casas et al.
2009). These surveys are however costly to conduct (hence small sample sizes in most cases)
and relatively rare.

However, transport planners have been conducting and using household-travel surveys
throughout the world for decades to feed trip generation models. While these surveys include
information on actual trips only, not on constraints, Soo (2009), building on previous work on
stochastic frontier models (Kitamura et al. 2000, Pendyala et al. 2002, Yamamoto et al. 2004),
explains how temporal constraints can usually be derived from these types of datasets.
Another possibility is to study person-based accessibility through scenarios,

just as
Delafontaine et al. (2012) do for their place-based study. They study the accessibility of public
libraries for a one-hour time budget on Monday from 6 to 7 p.m., for a visit of at least 30
minutes (and they later study the impact of a squeeze of the time budget). Although this is just
a scenario, their study is useful since it is a likely time for a visit to the library (after work-
hours and before family time). Similarly, person-based measures may be used on likely sce-
narios to assess accessibility between ﬁxed activities. For example, would it be possible for
parents who cannot drop their kids off at school before 7:45 a.m., who must pick them up by
5:30 p.m. (hours of before and after-school programs in Grenoble public schools) and who
spend eight hours at work (standard length of a work day for a full-time worker in France–
including lunch break), to stop at the grocery store on their way to or back from work?

5.2.2 Consideration of trip-chaining

One area where a person-based approach is superior to a place-based approach is in the con-
sideration of trip-chaining.

Place-based studies measure the accessibility of a facility based on a round trip from and
to the same location, overlooking people’s capacity to chain their trips in multi-purpose tours.

The need to take into account multi-purpose tours in accessibility assessment was identiﬁed
early on (Richardson and Young 1982; Arentze et al. 1994). Literature on trip-chaining ﬁnds a
varying but consistently noteworthy propensity to trip-chain. Most recently, Brunow and
Gründer (2013), using a sample of the adult population of Germany, found that a third of
home-based tours combined multiple activities. Granted access to the Grenoble 2002
Household-Travel Survey data, I found a similar average of 35%. Moreover, the rates in Gre-
noble were up to 45% for chains including a leisure activity, 60% for chains with a shopping
activity and 75% for chains with a personal business activity. In such a context, considering
accessibility to stores or health care resources on the basis of round trips only is not entirely
satisfying, and measures based on individuals’ space-time prisms are more relevant.

However, even measures based on space-time prisms assess only the possibility of visiting
a single location/facility between two ﬁxed activities. The possibility that two or more inter-
mediary activities might be chained between two ﬁxed activities is not taken into account. In
practice, this is of little concern since complex trip-chains are rare. In the same Grenoble
survey where I found that 35% of tours were multi-purpose, only 5% featured more than one
intermediary activity between two ﬁxed activities. And this estimate is based on an overly
restrictive deﬁnition of ﬁxed activities as home and work only, when in reality many health-
care or personal business activities, as well as chauffeuring, can be considered as ﬁxed activ-
ities. So the frequency of occurrence of trip-chains that would not be captured by the space-
time prism model is even lower than this estimate.

Theoretically though, it would be possible to compute accessibility indicators based on the
feasibility of complex activity programs, but doing so by taking into account all the possible
combinations of space-time prisms between all the possible space-time locations of non-ﬁxed
activities would be computationally inefﬁcient. An approach through GIS integrated agent-
based simulation, such as what was outlined in the MIRO project (Banos et al. 2010) would
be more relevant, given the combinatorial complexity of the problem. It would also have addi-
tional beneﬁts, such as providing a truly dynamic simulation of trafﬁc conditions or saturation
of facilities. But as promising as this approach is, it is still in the experimental stage and not
ready for implementation in user-friendly tools intended for practitioners (Crooks 2013).

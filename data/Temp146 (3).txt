In  1066,  English  and  Norman  forces  engaged  in  a  decisive 

battle  near  Hastings.  The  battlefield  itself  provides  an  ex‐

ample of the way in which physical geography can contrib‐

ute to our understanding of historical events. According to 

historical  accounts,  the  rolling  landscape  of  the  Hastings 

battle site was unquestionably an important factor in under‐

standing  the  conflict.  Yet  surprisingly  few  analyses  of  the 

local terrain exist to test this proposition. In part, this is be‐

cause historians of the battle have largely affirmed that the 

current battle site bears little or no physical resemblance to 

that present in 1066, and thus is unsuitable for contempo‐

rary  analysis  that  might  shed  light  on  the  outcome  of  the 

battle  itself.  By  applying  advanced  geographical  analysis 

using the RUSLE model, this study demonstrates that there 

is  in  fact  considerable  evidence  to  suggest  that  a  limited 

amount of sediment was removed, hence the battlefield has 

in  fact  changed  very  little  since  the  battle.  This  finding  is 

significant, insofar as it opens the door to new research on 

the  Battle  of  Hastings  which  may  shed  additional  light  on 

the  events  that  occurred  there  and  the  factors  that  influ‐

enced the outcome of this key conflict in British history.

There  is  much  that  physical  geography  can  contribute  to  our  understanding  of  historical  landscapes.  A  salient 

example of this is the now‐famous Battle of Hastings in 1066, which—as an outcome of the Norman victory over 

the defending English—resulted in profound changes to English politics and society.

In  accordance  with  historical  accounts,  the  rolling  landscape  of  the  battle  site  was  an  important  factor  in 

understanding the outcome of the conflict. Yet, few analyses of the local terrain are in evidence to test this prop‐

osition. In part, this is because previous research has largely affirmed that the current battle site bears little or no 

physical resemblance to that present in 1066, and thus is unsuitable for contemporary analysis that might shed 

light on the outcome of the battle itself. According to Hare, further supported by Lawson, who is considered a 

leading authority on the battle: “there has been a considerable build‐up of material... [hence, the present slope] 

bears little relation to the much steeper one up which the Norman cavalry would have to charge” (Hare, 1980, 

p. 80; Lawson, 2003, p. 50). This conclusion was reached from an in‐depth archaeological investigation of Battle 

Abbey on the battle site (Hare, 1985). Consequently, in their view, historians are fully justified in believing that the 

entire modern landscape does not resemble the landscape the English and Normans fought over in 1066 (Hare, 

1980; Lawson, 2003). Certainly this is also the position of English Heritage, which has used Hare’s and Lawson’s 

assertion to justify their longstanding explanation for the dearth of archaeological remains that have been recov‐

ered to date on the site (Porter, 2012); this despite the fact that Hare himself was able to locate the grave of one 

of Battle’s early abbots, who was buried in the abbey in 1102 (Hare, 1985). However, the landscape surrounding 

Battle Abbey was not investigated. As the battle may have extended beyond the area studied by Hare, it is import‐

ant to examine that landscape as well (Grehan & Mace, 2012; Hewitt, 2016).

In fact, given the general physical processes that would have been acting on this region over time, there is 

reason to believe that the battlefield we see today bears far closer resemblance to the past than is commonly held. 

To further explore this possibility, this article combines cartographic and environmental sources to assess long‐
term changes to the local geomorphology, hydrology, and soil loss at the 50 m2 resolution at the site of the battle 

to address the question: “how much material has been removed from the site of the Battle of Hastings since the 

battle?” This study will employ novel techniques that to date have not been used in previous historical GIS‐based 

environmental studies such as those of Pearson and Collier (1998, 2002), Donahue (2008), and Knowles (2008). 

Specifically, the study employs the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model in GIS format—taking into 

account climate, local topography, and land use—to determine the actual amount of material which has been re‐

moved from the area since the battle, thus providing a test of historical contention in this regard (Fernandez, Wu, 

McCool, & Stockle, 2003; Winchell, Jackson, Wadley, & Srinivasan, 2008). Furthermore, to the author’s knowl‐

edge, this study is the first time this model has been applied back to the medieval period.

The Battle of Hastings was the climax of a succession crisis to the English throne between Harold II Godwineson 

and William, Duke of Normandy. The battle occurred on October 14, 1066 on a hill north of Hastings. The battle 

lasted all day and concluded with the death of Harold and the defeat of the English army. Along with contempo‐

rary written and artistic accounts, there exist a large number of more recent accounts of the conflict (Bradbury, 

1998; Morillo, 1996; Lawson, 2003; Hewitt, 2016; Gravett, 1992; Wood, 2009).

Geographical analysis can tell a great deal about precisely what has changed, or not changed, since 1066 at the 

Battle of Hastings site. According to English Heritage (Porter, 2012), the battle was fought on Battle Abbey hill 

just to the south of the town of Battle, essentially within the boundaries depicted on the UK’s Battlefields Trust 

website (The Battlefields Trust, 2017). In terms of the local topography, the local slopes range from close to flat 

to 14° (Hewitt, 2016). Regarding the shape of the topography, the battle area consists of intermixed divergent 

and convergent shoulders, backslopes, and footslopes (Pennock, Zebarth, & de Jong, 1987). The shoulders are

presumably  where  the  English  stood  to  repulse  the  Norman  attack  (Hewitt,  2016).  From  a  geologic  perspec‐

tive (British Geologic Survey), the Hastings area is a sedimentary landscape (Allen, 1975; Natural Environment 

Research  Council,  2016).  Lawson  provides  a  brief  discussion  of  the  local  geology  surrounding  the  battle  site 

and references  a geologic  map  (Geological Survey  of  Great  Britain, 1980;  Lawson, 2003;  Natural Environment 

Research Council, 2016). The map indicates that to the south and west, the landscape is based on Tunbridge Wells 

sand and Wadhurst clay, which are derived from mudstone, sandstone, and siltstone. To the east and north of 

the battlefield, the landscape is primarily Ashdown formations with clay, which are also derived from mudstone, 

sandstone, and siltstone (Geological Survey of Great Britain, 1980). With regard to naming the battle site, Lawson 

references the Wadhurst clay as impermeable and producing sandy streams (Lawson, 2003, p. 58). Lawson (2003) 

did not consult an available local soil survey (Soil Survey of England and Wales, 1983; Cranfield University, 2012), 

which indicates that the soils around Battle consisted of either clay or loam. As the local soils have similar char‐
acteristics, the bulk density for clay/loam soils is typically 1.3 Mg/m3 or 1,300 kg/m3 (Morgan, 2005). However, 
the density can range from 0.9 to 1.5 Mg/m3 (Brady & Weil, 2004). The site also indicated that few soils in the 

area were freely draining (Cranfield University, 2012; Natural Environment Research Council, 2016). This would 

contribute to overland flow into streams with eroded sediment present.

The two streams which drain the site of the Battle of Hastings are the Brede and Combe Haven. The loca‐

tion  map  (Figure  1)  depicts  each  river’s  respective  basin  as  well  as  the  general  location  of  the  battle.  London, 

Canterbury, Dover, and Hastings are included for reference.

In terms of erosion rates, there have been general studies for south‐east England. Jones looked at the long‐

term uplift and denudation rates in the Weald. He revealed the maximum denudation rate in the area would be 

0.0204 mm/yr, which works out to 19.176 mm or 1.918 cm per 940 years (Jones, 1999). In terms of hill processes,

most that are acting upon the Battle landscape are slow‐moving fine particle processes such as landslips, creep, 

slumps, slides, and spreads, with landslips the most noticeable (Williams & Robinson, 1983; Evans, 1992; Trenhaile, 

2010). In the Hastings area, Williams and Robinson (1983) have estimated the average amount of soil loss to range 

from 4 to 15 cm per millennium. However, these are general estimates for entire drainage basins. There have also 

been specific studies which have examined the different sections of the study area. Several studies have examined 

in detail the long‐term development of the coastal region from Romney Marsh in the east to Pevensey in the west 

(Moffat, 1986; Jennings & Smyth, 1987, 1990; Smyth & Jennings, 1988; Waller, 1994; Long, Waller, & Plater, 2006; 

Long, Waller, & Stupples, 2006).

The RUSLE could provide a more detailed estimate of soil loss at the battle site (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 

1991; Brady & Weil, 2004). This model is defined as soil loss (A) = R × K × L × S × C × P and is determined by rainfall 

(R), soil erodibility (K), topography (L, S), land use (C), and “erosion‐control practices” (P) (Brady & Weil, 2004, pp. 

526–527). Other more detailed models were not considered because they included many more variables, which 

would have been impossible to estimate back to the eleventh century (Morgan, 2005).

The map‐based analyses were conducted in ArcGIS with separate file folders for the Brede and Combe Haven 

basin models. The folders contained the local digital elevation models (DEMs) at 50 m resolution and land uses 

with associated C values at 250 m resolution due to data accuracy (Hewitt, 2018a). The R values were kept in an 

Excel spreadsheet. The soil erodibility (K factor) was a single value for the study area of 0.045, from a European 

soil survey database. A single value was selected due to the similarity in the local soils, as discussed previously 

(Panagos & Montanarella, 2011; Cranfield University, 2012; Panagos, Meusburger, Alewell, & Montanarella, 2012; 

European Community, 2013). As the DEMs have a 50 m resolution, the RUSLE was calculated at that resolution. 

However,  before  the  RUSLE  model  can  be  applied,  three  processes  require  more  in‐depth  examination.  These 

processes are the local climate, topography, and land uses, which are explored in the following sections.

A critical variable in the development of the RUSLE model is climate. In this section, the climate at the time of—and 

since—the Battle of Hastings is explored through the development of precipitation graphs of the local region. The 

analysis in this section, as conducted with SPSS statistical software, relies on environmental precipitation recon‐

structions from previous studies and measurements from the Centre of Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).

5.1 | Precipitation change since the battle

Of  the  two  fluvial  systems  which  drain  the  Battle  area,  only  the  Combe  Haven  system  possessed  precipitation 

records for any length of time (with over 40 years of monthly observations), as opposed to the Brede system with 

less than a decade of monthly observations (Natural Environment Research Council, 2013). Therefore, to ensure the 

Combe Haven sample was representative of the area, years where both systems had records were compared with a 
correlation test. The output from this test (R2 = 0.979; p < 0.001; N = 96) indicates that there is a high degree of cor‐

relation between the datasets. Thus, statistically speaking, the Combe Haven sample is representative of the area.

With respect to precipitation volumes, there are two historical precipitation datasets which date back to be‐

fore the Battle of Hastings, one developed for southern‐central England (Wilson et al., 2012) and the other for 

East Anglia (Cooper, Melvin, Tyers, Wilson, & Briffa, 2012). Both datasets only cover the months of March to July 

HEWITT    |  827

(MAMJJ) and therefore annual values have to be estimated from these values (Cooper et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 

2012). Table 1 presents the correlation coefficients between the annual precipitation and the two MAMJJ precip‐

itation reconstructions, as well as an average between the two. The first column presents the raw data while the 

second and third columns present 3 and 5‐year running means of the datasets (Cooper et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 

2012; Natural Environment Research Council, 2013). Based upon these correlation tests, the data which optimally 

approximated the Hastings annual rainfall was a 3‐year running mean of the data from Cooper et al.’s (2012) arti‐

cle. Therefore, the annual precipitation values could be estimated from this data and are explored further statisti‐
cally in Table 2. Table 2 presents a model summary with the R and R2 values. Next there is an analysis of variance 

(ANOVA) analysis of the regression, which indicates that the F statistic is significant. This implies that the modeled 

precipitation explains a significant amount of the variability in the measured annual precipitation. The final part of 

Table 2 presents the coefficients for the model. As indicated by the ANOVA test, the coefficient of the modeled 

precipitation from Cooper et al. (2012) is significant in the model. Therefore, the Cooper et al. (2012) March to July 

precipitation values can be interpolated into annual values.

The  annual  values  were  achieved  by  first  calculating  a  3‐year  running  mean  from  1065  until  2006  for  the 

Cooper et al. (2012) data, which was then multiplied by the precipitation coefficient of 2.303 and added to the 
constant of 222.708 (y = 2.303x + 222.708, Table 2) to generate the predicted annual values. These values were 
then averaged by decade, providing 94 decades of measurements. This data is summarized in Figure 2, with the 

minimum and maximum per decade as well (Cooper et al., 2012; Natural Environment Research Council, 2013).

Figure 2 demonstrates that the precipitation in the area since the battle has varied roughly between 750 and 

850 mm/yr. However, in the early nineteenth century, there was a drier decade with less than 700 mm of rain on 

average per year.

When applied to the RUSLE, the R factor was determined depending on the amount of rainfall (P) in millime‐
ters.  For  less  than  850 mm,  the  equation R = 0.04830P1.610  was  used  and  for  more  than  850 mm,  the  equation 
R = 587.8 − 1.219P + 0.004105P2 was used (Renard & Freimund, 1994).

The  “Panorama”  DEM  for  south‐east  England  was  obtained  from  the  Ordnance  Survey  website  (Ordnance

same resolution (50 m2) as the DEM and set equal to 1 (Natural Environment Research Council, 2013). Next, the 

DEM was multiplied by the basin raster which produced a DEM of only the basin. Figure 3 depicts the DEMs of

The changes to the general land use of the area were explored regressively through the development of land use 

maps for both the Hastings and Battle areas, each representing an historical period of change back to the bat‐

tle (Hewitt, 2018a). For this study, the maps were generated following Rippon’s technique (Rippon, 2004) from 

historical maps (Hewitt, 2018b), the East Sussex Historical Environmental Record (ESHER) (East Sussex County 

Council,  2013),  a  previously  published  interpretation  of  the  data  (Bannister,  2010a),  and  local  environmental

Land  use  categorizations  were  derived  from  Bannister’s  characterization  and  interpretation  discussion 

(Bannister, 2010b; Table 3). Based on applications of the RUSLE model in Europe, the C values were defined in the 

literature (Panagos et al., 2015) with considerations from other studies on erosion (Wolman, 1967; Dissmeyer & 

Foster, 1981; Chow, Rees, & Daigle, 1999; Fiener & Auerswald, 2003, 2005). To the author’s knowledge there have 

not been any studies conducted using the RUSLE model in the UK for historical landscapes. One study focusing on 

Spain indicated C × P values of around 0.2 for historical land uses back to the eighteenth century (Vanwalleghem, 

Amate, de Molina, Fernandez, & Gomez, 2011). According to the findings in another European study, the P value 

was set to 1 (Panagos et al., 2015).

7.1 | Geographically presenting historic land uses

The  methods  and  analysis  of  mapping  land  uses  back  to  1066  are  explored  by  Hewitt  (2018a).  First,  the  his‐

torical maps from 1778–1783, 1884, and 1920–1921 were geo‐referenced, which provided detailed cartographic 

evidence for land uses (Ordnance Survey, 1920; 1921; 1969a; 1969b; Yeakell & Gardner, 1783). For time periods 

before the eighteenth century, the ESHER database comments and less detailed historical maps from the sev‐

enteenth to fourteenth centuries were relied upon (Fontana, 2000; Lilley, Lloyd, & Campbell, 2009; East Sussex 

County Council, 2013; British Library, 2016; Hewitt, 2018a). Once the historical maps were geo‐referenced, the 

areas in the ESHER database were classified into the various land uses by period as mentioned above. The data 
were then simplified to a resolution of 250 m2. This low resolution was selected because, in maps depicting an 

earlier period, a finer resolution “could lead one to the conclusion that we know more than we really do” (Heinen, 

1998, p. 189).

The land use legend is depicted in Figure 4 and the maps are presented in Figure 5, for both the Brede and 

Combe  Haven  basins.  These  were  derived  from  the  data  presented  in  Hewitt’s  study  on  the  land  uses  of  East 

Sussex dating back to the battle (Hewitt, 2018a). The first map (A) represents modern land use from the present

coverage of woodland, fieldscapes, and settlement areas, together with the growth of modern horticulture, in‐

(Hewitt, 2018a).

This section combines the climatic and land use evidence analyzed previously to evaluate Hare’s claim concerning 

denudation rates in the Battle area since the time of the battle. This analysis applied the RUSLE back to 1066 using 

the average precipitation per decade, as well as the minimum and maximum precipitation amount per decade. 

Considering the average denudation over the past millennium, the RUSLE model was tested with a variety of fac‐

tors to ensure their reliability. The output of the model was in tonnes (t) per hectare per year, which was converted 

into kilograms per square meter. The resulting value was converted into a denudation rate in meters by dividing by 
the density (kg/m3) assuming a bulk density of 1,300 kg/m3.

The results (Tables 4 and 5) for the average precipitation indicate that the amount of sediment eroded over 
the entire study period is estimated to be 1.281 × 107 kg/m2 for the Brede and 1.094 × 107 kg/m2 for the Combe 
Haven. These values can be converted into yearly estimates of 13,633 and 11,634 kg/m2, respectively, by divid‐

ing by 940 years. The total amount of sediment per year can be estimated by multiplying the yearly estimate by 
2,500, the number of square meters per 50 m2 cell (cell resolution). This produces an estimated amount of eroded 
sediment in the Brede basin of 3.408 × 107 kg, or approximately 34,081 t. The Combe Haven produces a similar 
amount at 2.908 × 107 kg, or approximately 29,084 t. The amount in tonnes per square kilometer can be deter‐
mined by dividing the amount (t) by the area (km2) (the area for the Brede is 46.459 km2, while that for the Combe 
Haven is 35.889 km2). These values work out to 734 and 810 t/km2, respectively. From here the sediment delivery 

ratio can be calculated.

The sediment delivery ratio is “[t]he portion of eroded sediment that exits the drainage basin as part of the 

river’s load” (Charlton, 2008, p. 55). This value is calculated by dividing the amount of sediment which exits a basin 

every year by the total amount of eroded material (RUSLE output). A dataset summarizing sediment samples from 

each basin was accessed from the Environmental Agency (2013) and the daily discharge was accessed from the 

Natural Environment Research Council (2013). The two datasets were then linked and plotted as sediment rating 

curves. Based on an analysis of the data, the Brede sample for 2006 and the Combe Haven sample for 1990 to 

1999 had the strongest correlation Pearson coefficients of 0.805 and 0.612, respectively. The amount of sediment 
removed was estimated to be 5.133 and 5.558 t/km2 per year for each respective basin. Given a 300% error in 
the data, the values were increased by 300% (15.399 and 16.674 t/km2 per year, respectively) (Morgan, 2005).

Worrall, Burt, and Howden (2013) conducted a study on sediment yields for the UK and indicated that the sedi‐
ment yield in this area was between 2 and 25 t/km2 per year with a raster map indicating the rate as 11 to 20 t/km2 

per year. These statistics confirm the estimated values. These values were divided by the RUSLE’s average yearly 

amount eroded per basin, and both basins produced results around 2%. As the sediment delivery ratio for the UK 

is expected to range from 2 to 29% with a median of 10%, these values are within the expected range (Worrall et 

al., 2013). This finding confirms the reliability of the analysis.

To determine the denudation rate, the total amount of sediment removed (kg/m2) is divided by the number of 
50 m2 cells in the basin (18,485 in the Brede basin and 14,356 in the Combe Haven basin) and then multiplied by 

2% (the amount removed per cell). This indicates the average amount of sediment removed per cell. Next, this value 

is divided by the density to indicate the amount by which the surface has declined since the battle. Tables 6 and 

7 present the average rates of denudation for the model using the average precipitation as well as the minimum 
and maximum precipitation amounts. Various soil densities were also applied, ranging from 900 to 1,500 kg/m3.

In terms of cartographic outputs, there is a map depicting the total amount of sediment eroded (Figure 6), the 

amount of sediment removed (Figure 7), and the denudation rate in meters since the battle (Figure 8). The rates are 

based on the amount of sediment exiting each cell. The location of the battle is depicted as well.

The maps overall depict that most of the sediment was eroded in the hills surrounding the basins, while very 

little was eroded in the valleys. Figure 6 shows the mass of sediment that was eroded, which appears to justify 

Hare’s claim. However, if the sediment delivery ratio is applied, which indicates the amount of sediment removed 
per 50 m2 area, the rate is much less (Figure 7). In terms of the denudation rate, it was revealed to be on the order 

of 11 cm since the battle. This means that on the most eroded landscape (i.e. to the north of the battle in the Brede 

basin or to the south‐east of the battle in the Combe Haven basin), it is suggested that only 11 cm is removed per 
50 m2 area. On the battle site, this rate is much lower (see the area around the point marked with a cross in Figures 

6 to 8). Therefore, this finding does in fact contradict Hare’s claim that the landscape has changed drastically since 
the battle at the 50 m2 resolution.

In summary, as the figures developed in this section show, in the absence of major hillslope processes (Williams 

& Robinson, 1983), the maximum rates of local topographic lowering tend to be on the order of 4–15 cm over a

millennium (Williams & Robinson, 1983). Thus, very little has been altered by physical processes in this landscape 

since the battle. This finding is in substantial contradiction to the propositions by Hare and Lawson, who had sug‐

gested much more substantial landscape lowering overall in the period between 1065 and the present.

9 |  D I S CU S S I O N  A N D LI M ITATI O N S

Although this study provides new data effectively challenging conventional views of landscape lowering at the 

site of the Battle of Hastings, certain limitations are present in modeling at this scale and these warrant discussion 

(Beven & Brazier, 2011).

Modeling climate change presents a number of challenges. The climatic data presented in the previous sec‐
tions contain several limitations. The first originates from the R2 value associated with the correlation between 

the Combe Haven precipitation values and Cooper et al.’s (2012) data, as presented in Table 2, which is low at 

around  0.354.  This  statistic  indicates  that  the  fit  is  rudimentary,  despite  evidence  that  the  data  is  significant. 

Therefore, the selected precipitation record could be incorrect in estimating precipitation of this location back to 

the medieval period. However, these data are the most up‐to‐date datasets for climate reconstruction in England 

back to the medieval period. This possible error was taken into account in the development of the RUSLE model 

by considering the minimum and maximum precipitation rates per decade.

With respect to land use, one of the main limitations in undertaking the regressive reconstruction above is 

the sources of error associated with the use of historical maps. For example, in attempting to geo‐reference the 

older maps to the modern landscape, existing road networks were of little use as they frequently did not match 

the historical road network. Therefore, fewer points could be added to the older maps and thus, they could not be 

referenced precisely (Hewitt, 2018a).

A second land use limitation relates to the difficulty of classifying land uses. This was particularly true for the 

fieldscapes class, which could be arable, pasture, or a combination of the two over time. However, which areas 

were classified as which land use—and for how long—is open to debate in the near millennial time span since the 

battle (Evans, 1992; Hewitt, 2018a).

HEWITT    |  835

F I G U R E   6  Sediment amount eroded (2005–1065) per basin at 50 m resolution

Another limitation comes from the time periods for the land uses. For example, the medieval land use spans 

from 1066 to 1499, which is over 400 years (East Sussex County Council, 2013). Therefore, this classification cov‐

ers all the developments of the period. Thus, this land use likely represents a value closer to the maximum extent 

of arable in the medieval period.

Additionally,  Beven  and  Brazier  (2011)  have  indicated  that  the  C  and  P  values  were  not  transferable  from 

U.S. studies. This could lead to incorrect erosion estimates. In this study, the C and P values were derived from a 

European study (Panagos et al., 2015,2015). This would increase the reliability of the study.

There are also a number of limitations associated with modeling denudation rates. In terms of scale, this model 
determined the amount of erosion for 50 m2 areas. These areas could mask gullies and rills at a finer scale, which 

could  underestimate  the  amount  of  local  erosion.  They  could  also  mask  construction  projects  such  as  Battle 

Abbey, which could alter the local topography as well (Hare, 1985). However, as indicated above, to get to a finer 

scale would require more precision, which is not possible with data dating back to the medieval period. Therefore, 

the  precision  must  be  reduced  to  be  able  to  model  the  landscape  back  to  the  medieval  period  (Harvey,  1985; 

Heinen, 1998).

From Figures 6 to 8, there is a clear spatial variation in the amount of sediment eroded since the battle. This 

variation could be the result of the limitations of the model. These could include limitations in the land use clas‐

sification or resolution, since a comprehensive analysis of all documents regarding land use was not conducted. 

Therefore, some areas could potentially have been labeled incorrectly. This limitation could impact the erosion 

rate at a specific location, being more or less than it should be.

Another potential limitation came from the fact that there were few specific local studies to compare with 

the  results  of  this  study  (Collins,  1981;  Williams  &  Robinson,  1983).  This  lack  of  similar  studies  is  problematic, 

HEWITT836  |    

F I G U R E   7  Sediment amount removed (2005–1065) per basin at 50 m resolution

specifically in the urban areas which become rather extensive in the twentieth century. Nonetheless, as indicated 

above, local studies do agree with the general amount of soil loss. Therefore, there is an element of reliability to 

the model.

Thus, in conjunction with other uncertainties such as soil density, a range of denudation rates were provided. 
These statistics indicate that at the 50 m2 resolution, the physical landscape processes have not greatly impacted 

the landscape since the Battle of Hastings.

10  | CO N C LU S I O N S

From  an  historical  perspective,  it  may  be  true  that  the  Battle  of  Hastings  is  one  of  the  most  intensely  studied 

events in British history. At the same time, one of the key elements of the battle itself, as it relates to local land‐

scape, appears to have been almost completely overlooked. This study has gone some distance to remedying this 

oversight, and with significant consequences for future research into topics such as archaeology, local resources, 

viewsheds, and a cartographic model of the battle.

Despite its limitations, the analysis has revealed—through a comprehensive analysis of the cartographic and 

environmental sources with the RUSLE model—that the claims reported by Hare and promoted by Lawson may 
well be incorrect. As the study indicates, there is considerable evidence that at the 50 m2 resolution, a limited 

amount of sediment has been removed since the battle, hence the general shape and slope of the battlefield has 

remained the same since the battle. This finding is of significant importance, insofar as it confirms that in fact—and 

despite current wisdom—the modern topography of the battlefield has changed little since 1066. This should open 

HEWITT    |  837

F I G U R E   8  Denudation rate (2005–1065) per basin at 50 m resolution

the door to new research, including an archaeological investigation on the Battle of Hastings, which would shed 

additional light on the events that occurred there and the factors that influenced the outcome of this key conflict 

in British history.

In addition, and beyond the immediate relevance of the findings presented here, the study reaffirms yet again 

the importance of employing multi‐disciplinary approaches to expand disciplinary knowledge. In this case, geo‐

graphic data and a geographic approach—specifically geomorphology and hydrology—have been applied to histor‐

ical analysis. Other combinations, of course, may well be possible, both within and beyond these two disciplines. 

Hopefully this study will have contributed in some measure to further broader acceptance and use of such com‐

bined methodologies.

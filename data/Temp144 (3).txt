Abstract
Geospatial approaches to monitoring and mapping water quality over a wide range
of temporal and spatial scales have the potential to save ﬁeld and laboratory efforts.
The present study depicts the estimation of water quality parameters, namely tur-
bidity and phosphate, through regression analysis using the reﬂectance derived from
remote sensing data on the west coast of Mumbai, India. The predetermined coastal
water samples were collected using the global positioning system (GPS) and were
measured concurrently with satellite imagery acquisition. To study the inﬂuence of
wastewater, the linear correlations were established between water quality param-
eters and reﬂectance of visible bands for either set of imagery for the study area,
which was divided into three zones: creek water, shore-line water and coastal water.
Turbidity and phosphate have the correlation coefﬁcients in the range 0.75–0.94 and
0.78–0.98, respectively, for the study area. Negative correlation was observed for
creek water owing to high organic content caused by the discharges of domestic
wastewater from treatment facilities and non-point sources. Based on the least
square method, equations are formulated to estimate turbidity and phosphate, to

bility of satellite imagery for water quality pattern on the coast is veriﬁed for efﬁcient
planning and management.

1 Introduction

Protection and maintenance of water quality is a primary objective for any regulatory
agency and organization. The quality of water, and thus its suitability for recreation and
other activities, is affected by the type and the quantity of various suspended and
dissolved substances, including sediments. Increase of turbidity and phosphate is symp-
tomatic of eutrophic conditions (Shaﬁque et al. 2001) and serves as a carrier and storage
agent for nitrogen, phosphorous and organic compounds that can be indicators of
pollution (Jensen 2000). The water quality parameters that can be estimated with optical
remote sensing methods include phytoplankton (chlorophyll), turbidity, water tempera-
ture, suspended inorganic material, e.g. sand, dust and clay, colored dissolved organic
matter, etc. (Allee and Johnson 1999, Forster et al. 1993, Fraser 1998, Kondratyev et al.
1998, Parada and Canton 1998, Pattiaratchi et al. 1994, Rimmer et al. 1987, Tassan
1998). Some of the substances found in water contribute to the way in which optical
radiation interacts with water bodies through scattering and absorption of electromag-
netic radiation (EMR). Since these optically signiﬁcant substances change the color of
water, remote sensing instruments using spectral bands in the optical region of the
spectrum can detect the changes and estimate the amount of optically signiﬁcant sub-
stances. Remote sensing satellites measure the amount of solar radiation at various
wavelengths reﬂected by surface water (Ekercin 2007). Remote sensing techniques have
the potential to overcome the limitation of traditional methods of water quality studies
by providing an alternative means of studying and monitoring water quality over a wide
range of both temporal and spatial scales. Water turbidity is widely accepted as a
representative parameter for the littoral dynamic study investigated by diverse authors
from digital
images at different spatial (scale) and spectral resolutions, e.g. ATM
(Pattiaratchi et al. 1986), SPOT HVR (Lathrop and Lillesand 1989), Landsat TM
(Pattiaratchi et al. 1994).

Water quality assessment of ocean and inland waters using satellite data has been
carried out since the ﬁrst remote sensing satellite Landsat MSS was operational
(Thiemann and Kaufmann 2000). Today, there are many satellites with high resolution
for use in water quality monitoring studies. Among these satellites, IKONOS, despite the
restrictive spectral range of its multispectral imagery (up to 800 nm), is suitable for water
quality mapping because of its high spatial resolution (Li and Li 2004, Ritchie et al.
1990). Most of the previous studies focused on the discovery of the relationship between
remote sensing data and in-situ measurements. Moreover, integrating a geographic
information system (GIS) into the system, rather than using traditional numerical tech-
niques, aids the study of spatial variation of monitoring data results. Water quality within
surface water bodies can exhibit signiﬁcant spatial variability and the estimation and
characterization of these patterns will help in planning and management.

The primary aim of the study was to estimate turbidity and phosphorus using remote
sensing data in order to produce thematic maps complementing experimental informa-
tion and to interpret the spatial distribution of water quality parameters. Based on in situ
measurements and reﬂectance data from satellite imagery during the same period,

correlation coefﬁcients for the abovementioned water quality parameters were calcu-
lated. Two different numerical approaches were used, namely traditional multiple regres-
sion and geostatistical
resulting from these
applications were integrated into a GIS, together with other information, with the goal
of achieving more efﬁcient planning in water quality management.

2 Study Area

Maharashtra, one of the coastal states located on the west coast of India, is endowed
with a coastline of 720 km. Mumbai is one of the densely populated metropolitan cities
located on the west coast, 26 km along its western edge. The coastline is indented with
large and small creeks. These creeks or coastal waterways are tide dominant, and
therefore naturally turbid because of the strong tidal currents, which mobilize the
suspended particles. The study covers an area from longitude 72°42′45″ to 72°50′00″
and latitude 19°06′47″ to 19°14′52″ including Malad creek, Manori creek, seashore and
coast (see Figure 1). The study area is divided into three zones, coast, creek and seashore,
because the interference of organic matter through wastewater varies the relationship
between turbidity and phosphate with satellite derived reﬂectance.

3 Methodology

Broadly, the methodology consisted of the following steps:

1.

conversion of satellite image digital number values to unit-less surface reﬂectance to
eliminate the effects of high local variability on remote sensing observation values;

2. atmospheric and geometric correction of the satellite image;
3.

regression analysis between the pixel (5 ¥ 5 pixel conﬁguration array) reﬂectance
values and the water quality parameters;
estimating water quality through simulation;

4.
5. mapping turbidity and phosphate from the satellite image.

3.1 Estimation of Water Quality Parameters: Field Data

3.1.1 Sampling

The sampling was performed by a boat at the predetermined sampling location ﬁxed with
the help of a Trimble Juno global positioning system unit and synoptic coverage of
satellite imagery and its variance in digital number (DN) values. The position of each
sampling location was constrained by differential global positioning system. In all, 32
sampling locations were ﬁxed to cover the entire study area divided into three different
study zones (see Figure 1). Sampling locations S1-S16 are categorized as coast, S17–S21,
S23 as seashore and S22, S24, S25, and S26–32 as creek.

The turbidity of sea water samples is determined in the laboratory with the help of a
turbidity meter by measuring the scattering of light from the water sample. The intensity

of light scattered at 90 degrees as the beam of light passes through a water sample.
Turbidity measured in NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units) was estimated per the
standard method APHA (2002). Similarly, phosphate in sea water samples is determined
by molybdate reactive orthophosphate with the calorimetric stannous chloride estima-
tion method. The intensity of the blue coloured complex is measured using a spectro-
photometer, which is directly proportional to the concentration of phosphate present in
the sample in mg/L.

3.2 Image Analysis

The satellite imageries used for this case study consisted of: (1) IKONOS (Space
Imaging) 1-m color product, IKONOS Geo-processing level, which was created by
pan-sharpening multispectral (red: 0.632–0.698 mm, green: 0.506–0.595 mm, blue:
0.445–0.516 mm) imagery at a spatial resolution of 4 m using panchromatic imagery
at a spatial resolution of 1 m; (2) Landsat 7 ETM+ consisting of visible and infrared
bands at a spatial resolution of 30 m. The scenes used in this study were collected
coincident with the water survey for quality parameters. The image is cloud-free over
the water and no wind lines are visible on the water surface.

The digital number values in the satellite image bands were converted to surface
reﬂectance values as described below. This conversion is necessary for studies regarding
reﬂectance of water surfaces because the raw digital numbers of a Landsat 7 ETM+/
IKONOS image are not only dependent on the reﬂectance characteristics of the speciﬁc
scene, but also contain noise and digital number value offsets that are a result of the
viewing geometry of the satellite, the angle of the sun’s incoming radiation, atmospheric
depth due to viewing angle and the design characteristics of the sensor. Conversion of the
data to radiance removes the voltage bias and gains from the satellite sensor using
equations (1) and (3). The radiance values are then further converted to satellite reﬂec-
tance according to equations (2) and (4). This conversion accounts for the varying sun
angle due to differences in latitude, season, and time of day, and the variation in the
distance between the Earth and Sun.

3.2.1 Image standardization

Image standardization is the process of normalizing image pixel values for differences
in sun illumination geometry, atmospheric effects and instrument calibration. In the
ﬁeld of remote sensing the most commonly used measure of radiant energy is radiance
(L). Radiance is deﬁned as the amount of radiant energy per unit time per unit solid
angle (i.e. towards a certain direction) per unit of projected area of the source. Spectral
radiance is the radiance per unit wavelength interval at a given wavelength (unit W m-2
sr-1 mm-1).

(i) DN-to-Reﬂectance Conversion: Landsat ETM+

The conversion of DN values to radiance has been carried out using the following
equation (1) using different characteristics of the imagery (see Table 1).

Remote Sensing of Turbidity and Phosphate in Creeks and Coast of Mumbai

where Ll is the radiance for spectral band 1 at the sensor’s aperture (W/m2/mm/sr), DNl
is the Digital Number of each pixel in the image, LMAX and LMIN are the calibration
constants, and QCALMAX and QCALMIN are the highest and the lowest points of the range of
rescaled radiance in DN.

(ii) Spectral Reﬂectance Calculation, Landsat ETM+

The reﬂectance for band l is computed by the following equation (Markham and Barker
1986, NASA 2002):

ρ
λ

=

×

π

L
λ
ESUN

λ

×

d

θ

where Ll is the spectral radiance, which is the outgoing radiation energy of the band
observed at the top of atmosphere by the satellite, d is the Earth-Sun distance in
astronomical units, ESUNl is the mean solar exo-atmospheric irradiances for the band l,
and Cosq is the cosine of the solar incident angle. Supposing a horizontal land surface is
ﬂat, the cosine of solar incident angle (cosq) can be calculated from the Sun Elevation cos
(90-SunElevation). The Zenith angle for the image is 38.40° (obtained from the header
ﬁle of the imagery).

(iii) DN-to-Reﬂectance Conversion: IKONOS Data

The pixel value in the 11-bit IKONOS DNs in different bands are transformed to spectral
radiance value (W sr-1 cm-2) using different characteristic features of the sensor (see
Table 2) using equation (3) (Space Imaging Eurasia 2006):

=

)

(

where Ll is the radiance for spectral band 1 at the sensor’s aperture (W/m2/mm/sr), DNl
is the digital value for spectral band 1, CalCoefl is the radiometric calibration coefﬁcient
[DN/(mW/cm2-sr)], Bandwidthl is the bandwidth of spectral band 1 (nm).

The three IKONOS bands were converted to at-satellite reﬂectance (albedo) r

where r is the at-sensor reﬂectance, Ll is the radiance for spectral band 1 at the sensor’s
aperture (W/m2/mm/sr), ESUNl is the band dependent mean solar exoatmospheric irra-
diance and d is the Earth-sun distance, in astronomical units, and qs is solar zenith angle
and was found to be 27.29 (Fleming 2003).

4 Correlation of in situ Water Quality Parameter with Reﬂectance

An attempt was made to establish the relationship between the average reﬂectance values
of 5 ¥ 5 pixels with measured concentration of turbidity and phosphate in three visible
bands of satellite imagery (Ekercin 2007). The spectral signature of the waterbody
indicates that it has reﬂectance only in visible red and green bands but absorbance in the
near-infrared band. The regression model was calibrated by in situ samples. Different
linear regression models are formulated for different study zones using different satellite

imagery for turbidity and phosphate. Spatial variation of water quality parameters are
plotted as contours using the spline interpolation method on the GIS platform based on
in-situ values of turbidity and phosphate.

5 Retrieval of Water Quality Parameters using Remote Data

The linear least squares ﬁtting technique is the simplest and most commonly applied form
of linear regression and provides a solution to the problem of ﬁnding the best ﬁtting
straight line through a set of points. Regression equations were developed for two
different datasets (Bilge et al. 2003). A mathematical procedure was utilized for ﬁnding
the best-ﬁtting curve to a given set of points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the
offsets (the residuals) of the points from the curve. The sum of the squares of the offsets
is used instead of the offset absolute values because this allows the residuals to be treated
as a continuous differentiable quantity (Farebrother 1999). The correlation coefﬁcient
and the standard error are calculated as in linear regression. Based on the least square
method, constants are derived using Solver in MS Excel to be best ﬁtted to N data points.
Finally, equations are formulated as illustrated below in order to estimate the selected
water quality parameter.

Equations derived for Y, Turbidity (NTU)/ Phosphate (mg/L) through regression analysis,
for x, the pixel reﬂectance in the vis blue, green and red bands using satellite imagery and
A0, A1, A2 and A3 are derived constants. The turbidity and phosphate water quality
parameters are estimated at numerous locations other than the in situ sampling locations
from reﬂectance of satellite imagery falling under three different study zones using the
equations derived based on the least square method (see Table 3). These simulated values
are plotted as contours and compared with the in-situ contours.

6 Results

The turbidity and phosphate in creek water and seashore are high as compared to coastal
water based on in situ measurements, due to wastewater discharges emanating from the
anthropogenic activities of a densely populated city like Mumbai as visualized from
satellite imagery. Spatial variability of in situ water quality parameters is depicted from
the contours superimposed upon the satellite imagery (see Figures 2a–d).

Before ﬁnding any relationship between one of the water quality parameters and
reﬂectance in the satellite imagery, an attempt was made to establish a relationship of
reﬂectance among various bands. It was found that there is a strong relationship between
vis-blue and green bands of either set of imagery, which is conducive for the study of
water quality in both the bands (see Table 4).

Goward et al. (2003) found radiometric differences between the two sensors but
when the Ikonos sensor is aggregated to 30 m spatial resolution, the difference is
minimized. However, correlations of turbidity and phosphate with reﬂectance were
explored in different visible bands, namely vis-blue, green and red of IKONOS (see
Figures 3a–f) and Landsat 7 ETM+ (see Figures 4a–f) in order to formulate equations to
derive water quality parameters.

The regression models were found to be statistically signiﬁcant with correlation
coefﬁcients in the range of 0.76–0.94 for turbidity and 0.78–0.98 for phosphate for three
different study zones using either set of imagery (see Table 5).

The best correlation was found in blue reﬂectance, which is inconsistent with the
results of Fraser (1998) in which equal correlation was found for red, green and blue
bands. Lathrop and Lillesand (1986) found it for the Vis Red band. The coefﬁcients in the
above equations could vary with different weather and illumination conditions. Turbidity
and phosphate were found to be positively correlated as far as coast and seashore zones
were concerned, which is consistent with many case studies using satellite imagery. But
in the case of the creek zone, a strongly negative correlation was found between turbidity
and reﬂectance because of the high quantity of organic matter present (Chen et al. 2009).
The presence of organic matter in the creek water is evident from biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD) values ranging from 15–40 mg/L due to discharges of wastewater from
the nearby sewage treatment facilities and non-point sources. In order to derive the best
ﬁt model to estimate turbidity and phosphate, measured and estimated values are
compared (see Figures 5a–d and Table 6).

However it has been found that water quality parameters are highly correlated with
reﬂectance values of satellite imagery (0.98, P = 0.005). The comparison relationship was
tested on simulation points by estimating the water quality. Water quality parameters
were estimated on simulation points using different equations for different study zones
and plotted as contours for both sets of imagery to interpret the spatial variability over
the study area (see Figures 6a–d).

The spatial variability of simulated values is shown as contours over the region.
Based on the error percentage between in situ and simulated values, the spatial dif-
ference is also indicated as contours between in situ and simulated values. Similarly,

the difference in spatial extent of the simulated values between Landsat ETM+ and
IKONOS vary due to reﬂectance estimated based on the empirical relationship.

It is also important to evaluate the effect of pixel size on water quality assessment.
There are many possible sources of errors for estimation of the water quality param-
eters as far as this study is concerned. The spatial resolution of
the Landsat
ETM+ data may result in an overestimation of water quality parameters compared
with IKONOS. Even though the 30 m resolution is low in comparison to the
IKONOS, 1 m with a coverage of 30 ¥ 30 m represents the same value. In reality,
however, within the small coverage of 1 ¥ 1 m the water quality parameter is not
homogeneous. Another source of error is geometric error carried with the satellite
imagery. Hence, care has been taken while performing geometric correction of the
imagery to study the sampling locations coherently, with the help of DGPS. Selection
of sampling sites may have been insufﬁcient, resulting in a high spatial variability of
the water quality parameter. This presents another source of error in estimating water
quality using satellite data. Sources of error in measuring water quality using remote
sensing data will be there for 1 m2 (IKONOS sensor) as well as more for 900 m2
(Landsat ETM+). Bearing in mind that the studied parameters, turbidity and phos-
phate, dilute over a large spatial extent of sea region, a 5 ¥ 5 pixel array is considered
for the study.

7 Conclusions

In the present study, an attempt has been made to establish the relationship between
water quality parameters, such as turbidity and phosphate, with high and moderate
resolution satellite imageries such as IKONOS and Landsat 7 ETM+ in a speciﬁc study
area on the west coast of Mumbai, India. The applicability of satellite imagery to this
kind of study show strong evidence of turbidity and phosphate, as discussed above.
Multiple regression results give signiﬁcantly consistent information with very high
determination coefﬁcients for both of the water quality parameters. In the creek zone,
strong negative correlation was found reﬂecting high turbidity and low reﬂectance due
to the presence of a large quantity of organic matter. Another aspect of the study was

water quality parameters. It has been found that the high resolution satellite imagery
also provides good results in comparison with moderate resolution satellite imagery,
and hence are suitable for water quality mapping. The ﬁnding of the case study infers
that there is an interference of organic matter through wastewater discharges in creek
water, because of which a negative trend was found between the water quality param-
eter and satellite derived reﬂectance as evident from BOD values of sampling locations
in the creek. Spatial distribution of water quality in the form of contour maps over the
water bodies also shows water quality conditions over the whole region. This type of

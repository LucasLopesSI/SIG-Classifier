Different types of maps have speciﬁc, limited functions, and to satisfy user requirements under various situations,
combinations of types are required. With the development and popularization of mapping applications on mobile devices,
efforts have been made to integrate analogue maps with location-based services (LBSs). Previous work in this area has
mainly used points as georeferences to calculate positions on map images, but point-based geocoding does not achieve
accurate and stable positioning results. This paper introduces a map signboard collage system (MSCS) to enable LBSs
using copied images of multiple map signboards on smartphones. The system uses polylines as georeferences, improving the
accuracy and stability of positioning results, and supports automatic egocentralization of map images with compass
sensors in smartphones. In addition, it collages multiple maps to allow natural, smooth and dynamic map switching for
inter-map navigation.

INTRODUCTION

As cities become larger and more complex, people are
increasingly relying on maps and location-based services
(LBSs) to travel around them. Many types of maps are
available to communicate information about a city, such as
mobile mapping, paper maps and map signboards. However,
in many cases, people still ﬁnd it difﬁcult to understand
their spatial environment. One reason for this is the limited
function of each kind of map, which is suitable only for a
narrow range of situations. Mobile mapping is equipped with
LBSs for positioning, searching and navigating, but is usually
too general for use in local areas. Illustrated paper maps are
a concise means to attract visitors to certain places, and
provide users with useful information, such as recommended
views and routes of travel, but it is difﬁcult to use them to
determine self-position. Map signboards are well designed
for local areas and have ‘You Are Here’ (YAH) points to
help determine self-position, but they are not portable.
A comparison of characteristics of map signboards, paper
maps and mobile mapping is given in Table 1. Research has
also found that different kinds of maps are ﬁt for different
tasks (Ishikawa et al., 2008; Dillemuth, 2005).

As the situations of map use vary considerably, it is not
really possible to say which kinds of maps are good and
which are not. Each kind of map has its advantages and

disadvantages. Attempts have been made to combine
analogue maps with digital maps to complement each
other (Scho¨ning et al., 2009; Morrison et al., 2011; Wang
et al., 2012; Lu and Arikawa, 2013a, 2013b, 2014). It is
possible to provide LBSs with the images of analogue maps
on mobile devices. However, a signiﬁcant problem is that
the accuracy of positioning on the map images is not high.
This paper introduces a map signboard collage system
(MSCS), which uses polylines as georeferences to integrate
multiple map signboards on smartphones. The remainder of
the paper is organized as follows: Related work section

to take, geocode and display YAH maps. They proposed
two ways of geocoding YAH maps: two-point referencing
and smart alignment. These methods enable positioning on
the map images, but both have critical prerequisites. The
two-point referencing method is available only for northed
maps, and the smart alignment method requires that the
user traces overlap with the spatial extent of the photograph
of the map. According to Scho¨ning et al. (2009), only 81%
of maps that they collected met the ﬁrst requirement and less
than half (48%) met the second. Morrison et al. (2011)
developed an augmented reality application MapLens that
could simultaneously overlay location-based media on a
paper map image. It uses predetermined map data ﬁles to
position media at the right place on a map, thereby enriching
the map’s original content. However,
the application
requires a combination of a mobile phone and a real map,
which makes it inconvenient to use. In addition, although it
supports the search function from map position to media,
it does not support searches in the reverse direction.
Wang et al. (2012) proposed a three-point referencing
method to calculate the user’s location on the image of a site
map. They tried to increase the positioning accuracy of the
calculation by weighting GPS locations according to GPS
in positioning
accuracy. However,
accuracy is limited. On the one hand,
factors other
than GPS errors, such as distortions of map images, are
not considered. On the other hand, the introduction of a
third referencing point will not necessarily increase
positioning accuracy if the third point itself has a large
error. Lu and Arikawa (2013a, 2013b, 2014) studied the
integration of illustrated maps on tour guidebooks with
mobile devices. They geocoded maps, illustrated texts and
images of guidebooks for positioning and story telling. They
also enabled users to employ geocoding for spatial references
and points of
interest. However, the editing tools are
difﬁcult for ordinary users to operate, and the positioning
results calculated by the two-point
referencing are
not stable.

the improvement

These works have offered many ideas on integrating
analogue maps with mobile devices to enrich analogue maps
with LBSs and multimedia. However, there are still several
problems that remain to be solved, the ﬁrst of which is the
issue of accuracy of positioning on map images on mobile
devices. Many investigations have used points as referencing
objects to calculate positions. As Lu and Arikawa (2013a,
2013b) have indicated,
the error in point-referencing
positioning increases with distortion of the map image and
with distance from the user’s location to the reference
points. Thus, a user will drift off the correct position on
moving further away from the reference points. In addition,
each time the reference points for calculating the user’s

position change, there will be a distinct jump of the user’s
trajectory on the map image.

The second problem is misalignment of

the maps.
The map images are aligned in the directions in which
they were taken, rather than being aligned egocentrically
for users.

The third problem is the lack of connections among
different maps. Switching between maps is static, breaking
the continuity of navigation. To adjust the various spatial
contexts and user requirements during navigation, natural,
smooth and dynamic switching among maps with different
areas of coverage, scales and topics is needed.

To solve the above problems, the MSCS proposed in this
paper uses polylines as georeferences to offer stable and
accurate positioning results. Directions are calculated to
automatically egocentralize map images, and multiple map
signboards are arranged to work together.

FRAMEWORK OF THE MSCS

The framework of the MSCS is shown in Figure 1. The
system uses map signboards as resources to produce map
collages. Images of real map signboards are taken as target
maps, and web/mobile mappings are used as base maps for a
polyline-based map geocoding. Mapping relations between
base maps and target maps will be constructed to calculate
the directions and positions, so that users’ current positions
and moving trajectories can be presented on the target map
images and so that different maps can be arranged to make
map collages.

Polyline-based map geocoding
Paths are important spatial references for forming images
of cities (Lynch, 1960). Polylines are used to geocode
paths (roads, rivers, etc.) to make connections between
base maps and target maps. Polyline-based geocoding
involves two steps. In the ﬁrst, linear objects, usually roads,
are drawn on the base and target maps. In the second,
corresponding referencing polylines on the base and
target maps are matched. Care must be taken that the
endpoints of the corresponding referencing polylines on the
base and target maps refer to the same positions in the real
world and that the order of the start point and end point is
retained.

Calculation of directions
Map signboards are sometimes misaligned (i.e. not
referencing
egocentrically aligned). The MSCS uses

directions to autoalign the map images egocentrically.
The process involves four steps:

Calculation of positions  on  map  images

Positioning is one of the most important functions of LBSs.
The accuracy of positioning has a direct effect on the
quality of LBSs. The MSCS uses polylines as referencing
objects to calculate positions on the target maps, which
ensures accurate and stable results. The calculation of
positions based on referencing polylines involves three
steps:

two end points. As shown in Figure 3, U is the user’s
location on the base map, AB is the nearest polyline on
the base map and A0B0 is the corresponding polyline on

2. Map the geo-coordinates of the user’s location to the

the foot point V from U to AB, as shown in Figure 3,
calculate the corresponding foot point V 0 on A0B0 such
that LAV/LAB ¼ LA0V0/LA0B0. Then, calculate the user’s

In the second case, the calculated foot point coincides
with one of the end points or with the middle point of the
referencing polyline on the target map. In this case, we move
the foot point slightly along the referencing polyline to
avoid the end point or middle point (see Figure 6).
On passing the middle point of a referencing polyline,
the user’s trajectory on the target map may undergo
a jump. To avoid such jumps and to maintain stability of
trajectories, when geocoding map images, the referencing
polyline should be separated into several referencing
polylines at sharp turns.

Arranging map signboards
The area of coverage and spatial information of a single map
signboard are limited. To cover large areas and provide
comprehensive information,
it is necessary to combine
multiple map signboards. However, there are gaps in spaces,

To ensure smooth, natural and dynamic switching among
different maps, they should be arranged such that spatial
relations between them remain correct. Because of
the different distortions to which the target maps are
subjected, it is difﬁcult to overlay the whole of two maps
perfectly. The MSCS proposes a focal point arrangement to

ensure high overlaying accuracy around the user’s position
on the target map.

Among many target maps, one functions as the main map
(the user chooses an initial main map), with the other maps
being arranged based on this main map. The process of
arranging a second map based on the main map involves the
following ﬁve steps:

1. Overlay the centres of the main map and the second
map, and calculate the user’s positions on each
map. As shown in Figure 7a, the red map is the main
map and the green map is the second map, O and O0 are
the centre points of each map, and U and U0 are the
user’s positions on each map.

2. Rescale the second map to the same scale as the main
map. As shown in Figure 7b, AB and CD are the
polylines on the two target maps. Denote by A0B 0and
C0D0 (not shown on the ﬁgure) the corresponding
polylines on the base map. Scale the second map such
that LAB/LA0B0 ¼ LCD/LC0D0. The current user’s position
on the second map is U 0

The arranged map collages ensure a dynamic switch among
different maps. The user’s positions on the screen, map
scales and map directions will be the same before and
after switching, which makes the switching process smooth
and natural.

EXPERIMENTS, RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

We have developed a prototype of MSCS. Figure 8 shows
two map signboard images of the Kashiwa Campus of
the University of Tokyo, and Figure 9 shows map collages of
the two maps on the prototype. We can see that the
north arrows on both map images, calculated main map
north, and compass north points to the same direction as
real north.

As has been mentioned, positioning accuracy is essential
for LBSs. Experiments were performed to test
the
positioning accuracy of the proposed algorithm. A walking
trajectory was recorded (Figure 10). A map signboard image
was geocoded based on referencing points
and
referencing polylines. The referencing points are the
nodes of the referencing polylines, as in Figure 11. The
mapped trajectories on the target map image using
referencing points and referencing polylines are shown in
Figure 12.

As shown in Figure 13, the distances from the trajectory
points to the referencing polylines m (denoted by mb on the
base map, by mp on the point-based geocoded map and by
ml on the polyline-based geocoded map) and the distances

The experimental results indicate that
calculated based on polyline references

The main reason for the good results with polyline-based 
positioning  is  that  the  accurate  areas  of  polyline-based 
geocoded maps show good overlap with people’s patterns of 
movement. See Figure 18, where Cb is a spatial object on the 
base map, Ct  is the corresponding object on the target map,

AB by d, the map scales vertical to the referencing segment 
on the base and target maps by sv and s 0
v, respectively, and the 
scales  parallel  to  the  referencing  segment  on  the  base  and 
target maps by sp and s 0
p, respectively (assuming that the map 
scales are constant at the local area). Then, the error distance 
between the calculated position C 0

correlated with the distance to the referencing polyline. The
areas near to the referencing polylines are accurate areas of
the map image and people usually move along the
referencing polylines, which is the main reason for the
accurate and stable positioning results obtained using
polyline references.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

This paper has introduced an MSCS that provides LBSs
with images of map signboards on smartphones. The
system uses polyline-based map geocoding for positioning
on the target maps. The experimental
results have
shown that the positions calculated using polyline references
are more accurate and stable than those calculated
using point references. In addition, directions are calculated
for
self-aligned map images, with different maps
being arranged to enable dynamic and smooth switching
among maps.

However, polyline-based geocoding is more complex and
time-consuming than point-based geocoding. First, poly-
line-based geocoding requires that the middle points of
polylines be input. Second, greater
is needed
for example, a road must be
for polyline geocoding;
geocoded as several referencing polylines separated by
sharp turns. Third,
in some cases, base maps do not
contain a sufﬁcient number of linear objects, and data
acquisition ﬁeldwork is needed. In the future, we hope to
simplify the geocoding process while retaining the
positioning accuracy.

skill

Another point that we will improve in the next step is
smart map switching among different maps. So far, the
proposed system supports spatially dynamic and smooth
map switching, but not cognitively smart map switching.
For some crucial areas in cities, there will be multiple maps
overlaid with the same mapping area with different topics
and characteristics. In the future, we shall consider users’
personal preferences and spatial behaviour contexts to
provide smart and friendly map switching.

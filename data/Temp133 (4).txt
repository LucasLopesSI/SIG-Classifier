Abstract. This paper presents a variant of p-(cid:142) eld simulation that allows genera-
tion of spatial realizations through sampling of a set of conditional probability
distribution functions (ccdf ) by sets of probability values, called p-(cid:142) elds. Whereas
in the common implementation of the algorithm the p-(cid:142) elds are nonconditional
realizations of random functions with uniform marginal distributions, they are
here conditional to 0.5 probability values at data locations, which entails a
preferential sampling of the central part of the ccdf around these locations. The
approach is illustrated using a randomly sampled (200 observations of the NIR
channel ) SPOT scene of a semi-deciduous tropical forest. Results indicate that
the use of conditional probability (cid:142) elds improves the reproduction of statistics
such as histogram and semivariogram, while yielding more accurate predictions
of re(cid:143) ectance values than the common p-(cid:142) eld implementation or the more CPU-
intensive sequential indicator simulation. Pixel values are then classi(cid:142) ed as forest
or savannah depending on whether the simulated re(cid:143) ectance value exceeds a
given threshold value. In this case study, the proposed approach leads to a
more precise and accurate prediction of the size of contiguous areas covered by
savannah than the two other simulation algorithms.

attached to spatial interpolation, and more generally the quanti(cid:142) cation of the quality
and accuracy of produced maps (Burrough and McDonnell 1998). Most of this
analysis is being carried out using geostatistics (Goovaerts 1997) which provides a
set of tools for incorporating the spatial and temporal coordinates of observations
in data processing. Of the utmost importance when coupling GIS data and environ-
mental models is the issue of error propagation , that is how the uncertainty in input
data translates into uncertainty about model outputs. Methods for uncertainty
modelling and propagation (Heuvelink 1998), such as Monte Carlo analysis, are
critical for estimating uncertainties associated with spatially based policies in the

area of agriculture or environmental health, and in dealing eŒectively with risks
(Goodchild 1996).

This paper tackles the issue of spatial uncertainty caused by the need to create
spatially exhaustive layers of
information from usually sparse data. A common
approach consists of estimating the attribute at unsampled grid nodes using minimum
error variance (kriging)
interpolation algorithms. The estimated map typically
smoothes out local details of the spatial variation of the attribute, with small values
being overestimated and large values being underestimated (conditional bias).
Another shortcoming of kriging is that it does not allow propagation of uncertainty
through global (multiple-point ) GIS operations (Heuvelink 1998). For example, if
attribute values are used to discriminate between diŒerent soil types or fertility
classes, one would like to assess the uncertainty attached to delineation of these
areas. Although kriging provides a measure of uncertainty for each grid node
separately, there is no easy way to aggregate these location-speci(cid:142) c measures of
uncertainty.

Stochastic simulation (Srivastava 1996, Goovaerts 1997, Dungan 1998) allows
generation of maps that reproduce the spatial variability of the data without
smoothing eŒects. Moreover, multiple equally probable maps can be generated and
then fed into GIS operators (e.g. classi(cid:142) cation), allowing one to assess how uncer-
tainty about the spatial distribution of environmental attributes translates into
uncertainty about classi(cid:142) cation results. These attractive features of stochastic simula-
tion are balanced by the computational demand of generating multiple realizations
over the large number of grid nodes that are typically manipulated in GIS. Parametric
algorithms, such as sequential Gaussian simulation, are very fast but they may be
inappropriate for attribute values that display class-speci(cid:142) c patterns of spatial variab-
ility. Among nonparametric (indicator) simulation algorithms, p-(cid:142) eld simulation
appears to be a better alternative than sequential indicator simulation because it
allows rapid generation of a large number of conditional realizations. However,
comparative studies have shown that p-(cid:142) eld simulation does not ensure a good
reproduction of target statistics (histogram, semivariogram) and tends to yield larger
spaces of uncertainty (larger spread of model outputs) than other simulation algo-
rithms (Goovaerts 1999). Moreover, the use of nonconditional p-(cid:142) elds creates
arti(cid:142) cial discontinuities around data locations (Srivastava 1992).

This paper presents a new implementation of the p-(cid:142) eld algorithm that uses
conditional probability (cid:142) elds to sample a set of indicator-base d probability distribu-
tions. The approach is illustrated using a SPOT (Syste`me Pour l’Observation de la
Terre) scene, and its performances (reproduction of target statistics, classi(cid:142) cation
accuracy) are compared to realizations generated by sequential indicator simulation
and p-(cid:142) eld simulation with nonconditional probability (cid:142) elds. The use of satellite
data in this paper is mainly dictated by the availability of the reference image, which
will allow one to assess the quality of simulation results. Also, there are situations
where it is useful to estimate obscured (e.g. bad atmospheric conditions such as cloud
covers), or missing, remotely sensed data (Rossi et al. 1994, Bielski and Cavayas 1999).

about the unknown z-value is modelled by the conditional cumulative distribution
function (ccdf ) of the random variable Z(u¾

j):

F(u¾

j; z|(n)) 5 Prob {Z(u¾

j)<

z|(n)}

(1)

where the notation ‘|(n)|’ expresses conditioning to the local information, say, n
neighbouring data z(ua). The function (1) gives the probability that the unknown is
no greater than any given threshold z. In this paper, it is modelled using an indicator
approach that allows one to consider diŒerent spatial patterns for separate classes
of attribute values, through a series of indicator semivariogram models (Journel
1983, Goovaerts 1994).

The basic idea of the p-(cid:142) eld simulation approach (Srivastava 1992, Froidevaux
1993, Goovaerts 1997, Journel and Ying 2001) is to sample the set of ccdfs using a
set of spatially correlated probability values { p(l)(u¾
j), j 5 1, ..., N}, known as a probab-
ility (cid:142) eld or p-(cid:142) eld, so that the resulting simulated values, {z(l)(u¾
j), j 5 1, ..., N},
reproduce a target histogram and covariance (semivariogram) model:

z(l)(u¾

j) 5 FÕ

1(u¾

j; p(l)(u¾

j)|(n))

j 5 1, ..., N

In the current implementation of the algorithm, the probability (cid:142) eld is generated as
a nonconditional realization of a random function P(u) with a uniform marginal cdf
and a covariance CP(h) identi(cid:142) ed with the covariance CX(h) of the uniform transform
of the original variable Z:

Prob {P(u)< p} 5 p

Yp×[0,1]

CP(h) 5 E{X(u) · X(u1

h)}Õ

[E {X (u)}]2

where X(u) 5 F(Z (u))×[0,1] is the uniform transform of Z(u). The p-(cid:142) eld does not
need to be conditional since at any datum location ua the ccdf is a unit-step function
identifying the datum value z(ua). Thus, whatever the simulated p-(cid:142) eld value p(l)(ua)
at that location,

FÕ 1 (ua ; p(l)(ua)|(n)) 5
The approach is attractive for two reasons:

z(l)(ua) 5

z(ua)

Yp(l)(ua )×[0,1]

1. It allows easy incorporation of secondary information through the derivation

of ccdfs (e.g. use of soft indicator cokriging for estimating ccdf values).

2. Generation of multiple realizations (l 5 1, ..., L ) over large grids is reasonably
fast because ccdfs need to be modelled only once, and only multiple non-
conditional p-(cid:142) elds need to be generated.

Until recently the main shortcoming was the lack of a theoretical basis for the
generation of p-(cid:142) elds. However, Journel (1995) proved that, under conditions of
ergodicity and on average over a large number L of realizations, the z-histogram
and the covariance of the z-uniform scores are reproduced by the set of simulated
z-values. Still, in practice one observes that: (1) p-(cid:142) eld realizations display large
ergodic (cid:143) uctuations in terms of reproduction of histograms and semivariogram
models (Goovaerts 1999), and (2) observations form local minima or maxima in the
simulated maps (Srivastava 1992). These two features can be related to the fact that
the p-(cid:142) eld is nonconditional, hence our proposal of using conditional probability
(cid:142) elds. The remaining question is which p-data p(ua ) should we use for such condi-
tioning? Assume that there is some uncertainty about the actual z-value at ua and

model it as a zero-mean normally distributed error component. The ccdf is not unit-
step anymore, but it becomes symmetrical centred on the datum z(ua). In order for
the simulated value to identify the actual z-value at ua, the median of the distribution
must be sampled, that is p(ua ) 5 0.5. Thus, it is proposed to use 0.5 as p-data. As in
the current implementation of p-(cid:142) eld simulation, the probability (cid:142) eld has a uniform
histogram and a covariance function identi(cid:142) ed with that of the uniform transform
of the original variable. A practical consequence of conditioning the probability (cid:142) eld
to 0.5-value s at data locations is that around data locations the central part of the
ccdf will be preferentially sampled.

Besides p-(cid:142) eld simulation, one also considers the widely used sequential indicator
simulation algorithm which amounts to modelling the ccdf F(u¾
j;z|(n)), then randomly
sampling it at each of the N grid nodes visited along a random sequence. In this
approach the correlation between simulated z-values originates from the conditioning
of the ccdfs to all previously simulated values in addition to the n original data.
Thus, the ccdf at each location u¾
j must be modelled as many times as there are
realizations to be generated. This can become very tedious if many thresholds are
considered for indicator kriging and if secondary information is incorporated through
indicator cokriging.

3. Case study

The diŒerent simulation algorithms are applied to a SPOT High Resolution
Visible (HRV) scene (near infrared NIR channel) of a 16 km2 area covered by
tropical forests and savannah. Figure 1 (top row) shows the exhaustive 2003 200
image which has been randomly sampled, yielding a set of 200 values that will be
considered as the only data available for semivariogram modelling and simulation.

spatial continuity of low values: zero nugget eŒect and largest range for the semi-
variogram corresponding to the second decile of the sample histogram, which war-
rants the adoption of indicator kriging instead of a multi-Gaussian approach that
assumes a similar spatial continuity for low and high values.

Conditional distributions (ccdf ) were modelled using ordinary indicator kriging
(Goovaerts 1997, p. 294) with nine threshold values corresponding to the deciles of
the sample distribution of (cid:142) gure 1. The resolution of the discrete ccdfs was increased
by performing a linear interpolation between tabulated bounds provided by the
sample cdf (Deutsch and Journel 1998, p. 136). One hundred nonconditional and
conditional probability (cid:142) elds were generated using sequential Gaussian simulation
and the standardized (unit sill) semivariogram of uniform transforms shown at the
bottom of (cid:142) gure 1. These p-(cid:142) elds were used to sample the set of indicator-base d
ccdfs, yielding 200 realizations of the spatial distribution of re(cid:143) ectance values; the
(cid:142) rst two are displayed in (cid:142) gure 2 along with the (cid:142) rst two realizations generated
using sequential indicator simulation (sis). At (cid:142) rst glance, the simulation algorithm
has a pronounced impact on realizations; note in particular the strong clustering of
high and low values in sis realizations. Despite the size of the sample set, none of
these maps shows striking similarities with the reference image of (cid:142) gure 1. The CPU
time (seconds) for generating 100 realizations on a SUN Ultra 10 workstation is,

Misclassified savannah  pixels (%)

Number of pixels

Figure 5. Histograms of: (a) the size (number of pixels) of the largest patch of savannah
found, for each realization, within the block delineated by the white dashed line on
the reference image of (cid:142) gure 4; (b) the proportion of pixels within the patch of savannah
that are wrongly classi(cid:142) ed as forest. The black dot in the box plot below each histogram
( left column) is the true size. Five vertical lines are the 0.025 quantile, lower quartile,
median, upper quartile, and 0.975 quantile of the distribution of 100 simulated values.

values was computed for each realization. Figure 3 (left column) shows that, on
average over 100 realizations, the proportion of data that form local minima is twice
for p-(cid:142) eld simulation (16 %) than for sequential indicator simulation (7 %). This

proportion is greatly reduced if conditional probability (cid:142) elds are used (11 %).
DiŒerences between algorithms are much less pronounced for the proportions of
local maxima, see (cid:142) gure 3 (right column).

Reproduction of statistics, such as (indicator) semivariograms, provides an incom-
plete measure of how well the series of simulated images capture spatial patterns,
and in particular the repartition of land covers. As an example of GIS operator, the
pixel of each image was classi(cid:142) ed as forest or savannah according to a re(cid:143) ectance
threshold (38) derived from the calibration of the reference image of (cid:142) gure 1. The
‘reference’ classi(cid:142) cation was deduced from the red channel that provides a much
better separation of the two types of vegetation, see (cid:142) gure 4 (middle graph) . The
classi(cid:142) cation was performed for the block delineated by the white dashed line on
the image at the top of (cid:142) gure 4, and the size of the largest object (savannah) was
computed as the number of connected pixels below the threshold value (Deutsch
1998). The ‘reference’ largest object, that is, the largest patch of savannah identi(cid:142) ed
on the reference image, is depicted in black at the bottom of (cid:142) gure 4. Figure 5 ( left
graph) shows, for each simulation algorithm, the histogram of the size of the largest
patch of savannah identi(cid:142) ed on each realization. The use of conditional p-(cid:142) elds
yields a distribution that is the most precise (narrow) while still including the true
value (accuracy). The average proportion of within-object pixels that are wrongly
classi(cid:142) ed as forest is also smaller for p-(cid:142) eld realizations (48 %) than for sis realizations
(58 %), see (cid:142) gure 5 (right column).

4. Conclusions

Probability (cid:142) eld simulation has great potential for the simulation of spatial
processes over large grids when a non-parametric (indicator) approach is warranted.
It is faster than sequential indicator simulation and, in this case study, the use of
conditional probability (cid:142) elds leads to a better reproduction of target statistics (histo-
gram, semivariogram) and more precise distributions of response values when the
uncertainty is propagated through a straightforward classi(cid:142) cation procedure.

Future research will focus on the incorporation of secondary information; for
example, simulation of sparsely sampled ground data using satellite images as second-
ary information. De Bruin (2000) performed sequential indicator cosimulation to
predict the areal extent of a contiguous olive region and the associated uncertainty,
using 688 land cover samples and exhaustive remotely sensed data. A similar
approach could be implemented within the p-(cid:142) eld framework: calibration of second-
ary data would yield a ccdf at each grid node including data locations which would
allow direct computation of probability data as quantiles of the observations for
these ccdfs.

Much effort has been applied to the study of land use multi‐

objective  optimization.  However,  most  of  these  studies  have 

focused on the final land use scenarios in the projected year, 

without considering how to reach the final optimized land use 

scenario. To fill this gap, a spatio‐temporal land use multi‐objec‐

tive optimization (STLU‐MOO) model is innovatively proposed 

in this research to determine possible spatial land use solutions 

over time. The STLU‐MOO is an extension of a genetic land use 

multi‐objective optimization model (LU‐MOO) in which the LU‐

MOO is generally carried out in different years, and the solu‐

tions at year T will affect the solutions at year T + 1. We used 

the Wuhan agglomeration (WHA) as our case study area. The 

STLU‐MOO model was employed separately for the nine cities 

in  the  WHA,  and  social,  economic,  and  environmental  objec‐

tives have been considered. The success of the experiments in 

the case study demonstrated the value and novelty of our pro‐

posed STLU‐MOO model. In addition, the results also indicated 

that the objectives considered in the case study were in conflict. 

According to the results, the optimal land use plan in 2050 can 

be traced back to 2040, 2030, and 2020, providing a series of 

Pareto solutions over the years which can provide spatio‐tem‐

poral land use multi‐objective optimization solutions to support 

the land use planning process.

climate change, are becoming increasingly serious over time (Fischer & Heilig, 1997; Pielke, 2005; Cohen, 2006; 

Chen,  2007;  Deng,  Ke,  Hong,  &  Qi,  2009).  Moreover,  increasing  numbers  of  mainstream  studies  have  empha‐

sized the influence of human activities on the global environment (Osenberg & Schmitt, 1996; Vitousek, Mooney, 

Lubchenco, & Melilloet, 1997; Cook et al., 2016; Goudie, 2018). In 1995, the International Geosphere–Biosphere 

Programme (IGBP) and the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP) 

identified land use/cover change (LUCC) as an essential scientific research project, which made LUCC one of the 

research topics at the frontier of global change research (Anderson, 1976; Liu et al., 2014; Uhrqvist & Lövbrand, 

2014; Liu, Huang, & Zhang, 2017; Chang, Hou, Li, Zhang, & Chen, 2018).

The research topic of LUCC can be traced back to the early 20th century and mainly depended on the ex‐

perimental applications of remote sensing by aviation and aerospace. Before the 1990s, research focused mainly 

on the LUCC models and classification of land use via description, mapping, and monitoring, with few topics re‐

lated to the analysis of LUCC (Anderson, 1976; Wilson & Henderson‐Sellers, 1985; Turner, 1994; Parker, Manson, 

Janssen, Hoffmann, & Deadman, 2003; Pontius Jr. & Malanson, 2005; Pontius et al., 2008). After the 1990s, along 

with the more in‐depth research in this domain, it had become explicit that LUCC is an important and direct factor 

of global change. There is increased attention from international organizations and scholars on the in‐depth anal‐

ysis of LUCC, including spatial statistical explanatory analysis, predication, and simulation (d'Aquino et al., 2002; 

Evans & Kelley, 2004; Pontius Jr. & Malanson, 2005; Guan et al., 2011; Arsanjani, Helbich, Kainz, & Boloorani, 

2013; Cao, Huang, Li, & Li, 2014).

Moreover, to better address land use change and planning issues toward sustainable development, there have 

also been many studies in the past decade on the optimization of land use. This research has been conducted 

successfully by a variety of scholars and is based on multi‐objective optimization models and various efficient and 

effective approaches such as linear programming, goal programming, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and 

ant colony optimization algorithms (Diamond & Wright, 1988; Chuvieco, 1993; Fonseca & Fleming, 1993; Balling, 

Taber, Brown, & Day, 1999; Matthews, 2001; Aerts & Heuvelink, 2002; Aerts, Erwin, Heuvelink, & Stewart, 2003; 

Aerts,  van  Herwijnen,  &  Stewart,  2003;  Stewart,  Janssen,  &  van  Herwijnen,  2004;  Ligmann‐Zielinska,  Church, 

&  Jankowski,  2005,  2008;  Janssen,  van  Herwijnen,  Stewart,  &  Aerts,  2008;  Cao  et  al.,  2011;  Haque  &  Asami, 

2011, 2014; Cao, Huang, Wang, & Lin, 2012; Cao & Ye, 2013; Masoomi, Mesgari, & Hamrah, 2013; Stewart & 

Janssen, 2014). For example, Ligmann‐Zielinska et al. (2008) successfully conducted a land use optimization study 

in Chelan, a small environmental‐amenity town in the north‐central region of the State of Washington, USA, which 

considered the objectives of infill development and compatibility of neighboring land uses, as well as defensible 

redevelopment. Cao et al. (2012) also successfully considered the objectives of gross domestic product (GDP), 

land  use  conversion,  ecological  and  geological  suitability,  accessibility,  the  not‐in‐my‐back‐yard  (NIMBY)  influ‐

ence, spatial compactness, and compatibility in the land use optimization study.

However, most of these studies only considered the final optimized land use scenario after a certain time period 

and  did  not  consider  the  process  of  how  the  final  optimized  land  use  scenario  could  be  achieved. Apparently,  to 

better guide the land use change and support land use planning, it would be more meaningful to know an optimized 

trajectory of land use change over the temporal dimension toward the final planned or optimized land use scenario, 

which could thus be understood as a spatio‐temporal land use multi‐objective optimization problem. So far, there 

has been a lack of notable research on this aspect, except for some preliminary exploration by Shirabe (2004), due 

to its modeling and computing complexities. Moreover, the complexities of modeling and computing have already 

been a huge challenge for the spatial land use multi‐objective optimization problem. For example, the experiment 

of Janssen et al. (2008) required approximately 48 s for only a 20 × 20 grid research area, and the running time in‐

creased proportionally to approximately the 2.7th power of the number of cells. In the research of Cao et al. (2012), 

which considered 8 objectives and 16,779 cells, the time spent for the computation of 5,000 iterations was up to 

5.5 h. Apparently, the computational intensity of addressing a spatio‐temporal land use multi‐objective optimization 

problem would  be  much  more  than  that  of  a  spatial  land  use  multi‐objective  optimization  problem.  Nonetheless, 

alongside the emergence of state‐of‐the‐art technology and artificial intelligence, there also exist many opportunities 

CAO et Al.    |  3

to help address this category of complex and computationally intensive problems, namely the spatio‐temporal land 

use multi‐objective optimization problem in this research.

To further address the described spatio‐temporal land use multi‐objective optimization problem in this re‐

search, one spatio‐temporal land use multi‐objective optimization model (STLU‐MOO) is innovatively proposed, 

and one case study in Central China was successfully conducted. The remainder of this article is thus arranged 

in four sections. The second section introduces the research framework and methods employed in this research; 

the third section introduces the case study in Central China, including the research area, the data sources, and 

the  quantification  of  considered  objectives  and  their  constraints;  the  fourth  section  focuses  on  the  research 

results of the case study; and the last section will highlight the discussion, conclusions, and implications of the 

research.

Numerous  studies  have  carried  out  land  use  multi‐objective  optimization  models  (LU‐MOOs)  by  using  genetic 

algorithms or other artificial intelligence methods, the process of which is presented as follows.

1.  Identify  inputs  for  the  LU‐MOO.

a  Take the original land use (OLU) grid at T0 as original input. The OLU can be obtained from remote sensing 
images or publicly accessible land use datasets. The land uses are indicated by positive integers from 1 to 
the number of land use types (N).

b  Identify the changeable grids in the OLU. To protect reserves, water bodies, or agricultural land, unchange‐

able grids can be set in the OLU. The LU‐MOO is merely conducted for changeable grids in the OLU.

c  Determine the area of increased built‐up areas (Areabu−Tn) in the projected year Tn.  Areabu−Tn can be deter‐

mined by linear regression based on the historical increasing trends of the areas of built‐up land.

2.  Use a genetic algorithm (GA) to conduct the LU‐MOO.

a  In the process of GA, new built‐up areas in the OLU are first randomly located with area Areabu−Tn to generate 100 
new solutions, all of which satisfy the constraints. The new built‐up areas will only be located in the changeable 

b  Then, based on the fitness function and objective evaluation functions, the new solutions can be ordered 

according to their fitness. Ordinarily, four types of objectives can be considered in the LU‐MOO, including 

economic‐related  objectives,  social‐related  objectives,  environmental‐related  objectives,  and  spatial‐re‐

grids.

lated objectives.

c  Then, the processes of selection, crossover, and mutation are carried out to generate 100 new solutions. 

Specifically, we randomly selected two solutions from the top 10 solutions as parents. Then, the crossover 

was conducted for these two solutions to generate new solutions for the next generation. For mutation, 

there was a 5% probability that the grids in the newly generated solutions would be randomly changed. 

Finally, 100 new solutions were generated, all of which must satisfy the constraints. Otherwise, the gener‐

ated solutions are deleted.

d  The 100 new solutions are also taken as original solutions to generate the next 100 new solutions by the 

above process. The GA will terminate if: (1) the number of iterations has reached a relatively large threshold, 

or (2) the improvement in fitness between the last two generations is relatively small.

Figure 1 presents the process of GA‐based LU‐MOO. A set of solutions can be determined at the projected year; 
however, the pathways from the baseline year T0 to the projected year Tn are missing.

The  proposed  STLU‐MOO  method  extends  LU‐MOO  optimization  for Tnto  STLU‐MOO  optimization  for 
the years T1, T2, …, Tn. STLU‐MOO conducts the LU‐MOO from T0to T1first, as shown in Figure 1, where the

land use pattern in T0is taken as the OLU. Assuming that the Pareto solutions at T1are M1 = (m11,m12, … ,m1k), 
where m1iis the ith solution at T1, then the Pareto solutions (m11,m12, … ,m1k) at T1will be taken as the OLU from 
the first to the last, when the LU‐MOO is conducted from T1to T2. This means that all the Pareto solutions at Ti
will be used as the OLU when searching for optimal solutions from Tito Ti + 1. When we connect the solutions 
for T0to Tn, one pathway from the base year to the projected year can be detected, as the orange arrows show 
in Figure 2. By the proposed STLU‐MOO method, the spatial distribution of land use at different years can 

be achieved.

3.1 | Case study area

The Wuhan agglomeration (WHA) is a metropolitan area consisting of Wuhan (WH), Huangshi (HS), Erzhou (EZ), 

Xiaogan (XG), Huanggang (HG), Xianning (XN), Xiantao (XT), Qianjiang (QJ), and Tianman (TM). The WHA, situated 

in the east of Hubei Province, Central China, follows the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (112°30′–116°10'E, 
29°05′–31°50′N). The WHA covers an area of around 5.8×104 km2. The WHA plays an important economic role in 
Hubei Province, contributing half of the total population and 60% of the GDP (Tan et al., 2014).

3.2 | Data source

3.2.1 | Net primary productivity

Net primary productivity (NPP) was used to build the environmental objective in this study. NPP, one of the major 

components of the carbon cycle, could also represent the carbon sequestration capacity of the ecosystem (Ma, 

Janzen, Gregorich, & Vandenbygaart, 2007; Li et al., 2018). It demonstrated its value in many aspects, not just 

terrestrial carbon cycle studies (Bonan, 1995), but also studies of regrowth after forest fires (Liu, Chen, Cihlar, & 

Chen, 2010). In this study, increasing or preserving NPP is set as an objective. The required dataset was collected 

from the Data Central of the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy 

of Sciences (http://www.resdc.cn/) using a 1 × 1 km resolution (Figure 3).

Statistical  economic  data  were  used  in  defining  economic  objectives.  Specifically,  GDP  values  were  extracted 

from the statistical yearbook. These included the GDP values of primary, secondary, and tertiary industry for each 

city in the WHA, all obtained from the prefectural statistical yearbook.

3.2.2 | GDP

3.2.3 | Land use

The land use data used in this study included six land use types, including agriculture, forest, grassland, water 

bodies, built‐up land, and unused land, with a resolution of 1 × 1 km. The land use datasets were downloaded from 

the Data Central of the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of 

Sciences (http://www.resdc.cn/). These data have undergone operative dynamic monitoring every five years from 

1990 to 2015 (Li et al., 2016).

3.3.1 | Economic goal: Maximizing GDP

The unit GDP factor, UGDP, for a given land use, which indicates the GDP generated in a unit area for a given land 
use (10,000 yuan/km2), varies from one land use type to another and from one district to another. UGDPwas calcu‐
lated according to the statistical GDP value and the corresponding land use area in each district.

The primary industry in the WHA is made up of farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, each of which 

is generated on different land use types. The GDP of farming is generated on agricultural land. For animal husbandry, 

the main livestock types in the WHA are pigs, cattle, sheep, and chickens. Pigs and chickens are fed on agricultural 

land use, and cattle and sheep are fed on grassland. Therefore, the ratios of animal husbandry GDP on agricultural 

land and grassland were set to A and B, respectively, the equations for which are: 

A =

PN + 0.1 ∗ ChN
PN + 0.1 ∗ ChN + 2 ∗ CaN + SN

B = 1 − A =

2 ∗ CaN + SN
PN + 0.1 ∗ ChN + 2 ∗ CaN + SN

(1)

(2)

where PN, ChN, CaN, and SN are the numbers of pigs, chicken, cattle, and sheep, respectively. The coefficient of 

poultry is the weight.

In terms of fisheries, only freshwater fish exist in the WHA, and they thrive in the lakes. Forestry GDP is gener‐

ated on forestland. Note that the tertiary industries of farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries were in fact 

counted as the GDP value generated on the corresponding agricultural, forest, and water bodies in which they are 

located. For other tertiary industries that were not classified under these categories, their GDP values were generated 

on built‐up land. In addition, secondary industries in Wuhan were also generated on built‐up land. Table 1 thus lists 

all the grouped GDP sectors (according to the GB/T 4754–2011 system for the industrial classification of national 

economic activities) and their corresponding land uses.

The GDP value grouped by sector was collected from the Hubei Statistical Yearbook 2016 and the statistical 

yearbook of each city in the WHA. The corresponding area of each land use type was retrieved from the land use

3.3.2 | Social goal: Minimizing land use incompatibility

In practice, a given land use (e.g., industrial land) tends to be clustered, which is a phenomenon commonly known 

as agglomeration or zoning. When such agglomeration occurs in a given region, the region is seen to have achieved 

good  compatibility.  Improving  land  use  compatibility  minimizes  conflicts  among  neighboring  land  use  parcels 

(Ligmann‐Zielinska et al., 2008; Cao et al., 2012). Moreover, ensuring compatibility is also critical for enhancing 

accessibility and reducing the cost of resource consumption. Hence, maximizing land use compatibility, or mini‐

mizing incompatibility, should be set as one objective in LU‐MOO.

Different land use has different preferred neighboring land use types, and these preferences could be utilized in 

measuring or calculating the incompatibility degree (Zhang and Huang, 2015). For instance, a provided built‐up land 

plot is usually preferentially located next to other built‐up land parcels. In this study, the degree of conflict between 

two land use types was defined and used to measure the degree of incompatibility. To be specific, a lower value of 

degree of conflict indicates a smaller incompatibility between two land use types, and the degree of conflict between 

two land use types ranges from 0 to 1 (Ligmann‐Zielinska et al., 2005; Cao et al., 2011, 2012). The analytic hierarchy 

process (Tsyganok, Kadenko, & Andriichuk, 2012) was used to collect and analyze the feedback from experts, deci‐

sion‐makers, and stakeholders to determine the degree of conflict between land use types, as presented in Table 3. 

The equations used to calculate the objective of minimizing the degrees of incompatibility are presented below:

where DInComkis the degree of incompatibility between land use in 2015 and the kth optimal land use. InCom2015
is the incompatibility of the land use in 2015, which equals the sum of the conflict index of the ith land use with 
the mth land use in 2015 (IndIncim), multiplying the area of the ith land use and the mth land use when they are

entire WHA rather than for each city.

3.4.1 | Separate constraints

Constraints  are  an  important  part  of  the  mathematical  optimization  for  land  use  allocation.  Defining  the  con‐

straints in areas of specific land use helps to ensure that the optimization outputs are feasible solutions by reflect‐

ing environmental, social, and political limits (Kaim, Cord, & Volk, 2018). In our case study, two types of constraints 

were defined: separate constraints set up for separate cities in the WHA, and overall constraints set up for the 

With reference to existing Chinese policies and land use‐related plans, three separate constraints for cities were 

identified. The first constraint limits the growth of built‐up land to ensure that there is no excessive urban devel‐

opment in the cities. The second constraint limits the minimum area of agricultural land and water bodies in each 

city according to existing Chinese polices. Finally, the third constraint requires the urban development on the plain 

area to be built without the presence of a steep slope.

3.4.2 | Increasing built‐up area constraints

Excessive  urban  development  undermines  the  capacity  of  ecosystems  to  sustain  food  production,  regulate  air 

quality, and maintain freshwater and forest resources (Foley et al., 2005). Within this context, it is thus necessary 

to control the built‐up area in the process of land use optimization. In this study, we attempted to predict the 

increase in built‐up land based on our understanding of historical land uses; we then compared these predicted 

areas with the areas determined by the overall land use plan.

Figure 4 presents a linear regression for predicted future built‐up land for cities in the WHA, with year as the 
x axis and built‐up area as the y axis. R2 values larger than 0.7 indicate that the linear increase of built‐up land is 

acceptable for all cities in the WHA.

On the contrary, the overall land use plans have limited the areas of built‐up land for cities. The limited areas 

proposed by the overall land use plans are listed in Table 4. Since 2020 is deemed to be the projected year for overall 

land use plans, the predicted built‐up areas in 2020 are also given in the table as a form of comparison.

For  most  cities,  the  predicted  limitations  are  stricter. Within  these  cases, we  used  the  predicted value  as  the 

limitations. For XT, TM, and QJ, the limitations proposed by the overall land use plan are much stricter. The results 

have shown that there are small differences between the limitations proposed by overall land use and predicted lim‐

itations. Moreover, the limitations proposed by the overall land use plan did not affect the years after 2020. Within 

this context, we continued to use the predicted limitations as our measurements for XT, TM, and QJ. Specifically, we 

designed the limitations for each decade in the pathway by distributing the limited built‐up land predicted by regres‐

sion over five decades (see Table 5). Negative numbers indicate that the current built‐up land area is larger than the 

limited areas and that there should be a reduction in the total area of built‐up land. Positive numbers, in contrast, 

indicate that the increased built‐up area did not exceed that number since the last decade.

3.4.3 | Constraints of agricultural land and water bodies

Under the rapid progress of urbanization and economic development, it is essential to protect farmlands to guarantee 

food security for China's estimated 1,300 million people. According to regulations on basic farmland protection, overall 

land use plans have declared the minimum agricultural land in projected years (see Table 6) for cities in the WHA.

However,  the  WHA  has  many  lakes,  and  indeed  Hubei  is  known  as  the  “land  of  a  thousand  lakes”  (Zhang  

et al., 2014). Water bodies are able to preserve ecological diversity and local climate, which are vital to human 

life and societal well‐being (Baron et al., 2002). It is thus critical to protect the water bodies in the WHA as well. 

Therefore, in this study, constraints regarding water bodies in the WHA were not changed in the process of land 

use optimization.

3.4.4 | Constraints of terrain

According to the code for vertical planning in the urban field (CJJ 83‐99), areas with steep slopes larger than 10% are not 

suitable for urban development. Therefore, there is a need to set a constraint on the type of terrain in which urban devel‐

opment can take place in the area. As such, development can only be built on lands with slope steepness less than 10%.

3.4.5 | Overall constraints

In addition to the separate constraints for each city, there are some limitations for the entire WHA. According to 
the overall plan for the WHA, agricultural land should occupy no less than 17,600 km2 in 2020.

3.5 | Land use optimization for the WHA

Since there are nine cities in the WHA, the multiple solutions for each city were first searched using GA, consider‐

ing these constraints set for the cities. Afterwards, the separate solutions for cities were combined to be the final 
results for the WHA. Assuming that the number of solutions for cities in the WHA is N =
{N1, … ,N9}, the total 
number of possible solutions for the WHA will be Tn =N1 ∗ N2 ∗ ⋯ ∗ N9. In the process of optimization, only the 
newly increased built‐up land was optimized.

4.1 | Separated results for cities

The optimized land use patterns for all cities in the WHA were achieved successfully. Table 7 presents the Pareto 

solution pathways for cities from 2020 to 2050. It is noted that the number of Pareto solutions increases significantly 

from 2020 to 2050. In 2020, because of the constraints on built‐up land, EZ, HG, XG, XN, XT, TM, and QJ do not 

have any possible land use plans. They do not possess any potential land use to be developed as built‐up land in 2020. 

However, in 2040, all the cities will possess space to develop built‐up land, even with consideration of the stated 

constraints  on  areas  of  built‐up  land.  In  addition,  it  is  also  noted  that  the  number  of  possible  solutions  increased 
dramatically. In 2020, the possible solutions for WHA are 1.60 × 102

, which then increases to 5.84 × 1017

 by 2050.

To display the land use changes in the process of optimization, the areas of land use in their final solutions are 

presented in Figure 5. In addition, the constraints on agricultural and built‐up land are marked. The results indicate 

that almost all possible solutions satisfy the constraints and that the areas of land use types change in different 

solutions. This suggests that the possible area usually varies within a range.

For agricultural land, all possible solutions satisfy the constraints. For example, there are 67 possible solutions 
for WH, all of which maintain the agricultural area to be larger than 2,645 km2 (the constraint) in 2050. Specifically, 
the area of agricultural land in the WH ranged from 3,787 to 3,899 km2. This suggests that the area of agricultural 

land in the WH in 2050 is flexible and can satisfy the requirement. Similarly, the solutions in other cities satisfy the 

constraints on the area of basic farmland according to our results.

The constraints on built‐up land are also marked in Figure 5. It was found that all the solutions in most cities satisfy 
the constraints. For example, the constraint on the area of built‐up land in the WH increases no more than 287.12 km2 
in 2050 (Table 7), which means that the total area of built‐up land should not exceed 2,192.60 km2 in 2050. According 
to the results, the areas of built‐up land in the optimal solutions ranged from 2,127 to 2,181 km2, all of which satisfy the 

constraint. Similarly, all optimal solutions satisfy the constraints on the area of built‐up land in HG, XN, XT, TM, and QJ. 

However, for HS, EZ, and XG, some solutions do not satisfy the constraints on the area of built‐up land.

The values of objectives vary in the pathway. Figure 6 presents the objective variations for all nine cities. First, all 

the objectives obviously vary in a range. For example, the GDP values in the WH in 2020 range from 1.1175 ×1012
1.1220 ×1012
planner can then accordingly select the solution with a satisfactory GDP value. In contrast, the GDP value is found to 

 yuan. This means that the possible GDP value in 2020 can also be in this range and that the land use 

 to 

increase from 2020 to 2050. It is obvious that the WH would experience the fastest GDP increase as its predicted 
GDP value increases to 1.8081 ×1012
according to the experimental results.

 yuan. In addition, other cities also experience a relatively low GDP increase 

CAO et Al.    |  13

F I G U R E   5  Areas of land use in solutions for cities in the WHA in 2050

However, the increase in GDP is usually accompanied by ecological degradation. Taking the WH as an example, 

along with the increase in GDP, the NPP decreases in the range of − 104.40 to − 31.50 in 2020. A dramatic drop in NPP 

would then occur in 2030. For 2050, the value of NPP would range from − 787.90 to − 558.80. This suggests that the 

GDP increase conflicts with NPP preservation. Similarly, the incompatibility would decrease from 2020 to 2050 as the 

GDP increases, which suggests that there is a conflicting relationship between compatibility and increasing GDP value.

4.2 | Integrated results for the WHA

As previously stated, the total possible solutions for the WHA are Tn = N1 ∗ N2 ∗ ⋯ ∗ N9. In this case, the possible solu‐
to 4.14 ×108
tions for the WHA should increase from 1.60 ×102
in 

in 2040, and finally 5.84 ×1017

in 2030, 8.82 ×1014

2050. Since it is impossible to analyze entire solutions in 2050, 100,000 random solutions were sampled for analysis. 

Since the overall constraint on WHA is looser than the separate constraints on cities, all integrated solutions satisfy 

the overall constraint. At the overall optimization level, the conflicts between objectives are revealed in Figure 7. The 

color in the matrices indicates the number of solutions: red indicates a larger number of solutions and blue a smaller 

number of solutions. We found that most solutions concentrated in the center, with medium objective values (see 

the marked places in Figure 7), and that the number of solutions decreased when one objective value increased. The 

conflicts between objectives can be revealed by the results proposed in Figure 7.

For comparison, we selected three optimal plans out of 1,000,000 integrated plans. Specifically, plans PL1, PL2, 
and PL3 maintained the best values for GDP, DInCom, and DNPP, respectively. The objective values for PL1, PL2, and 

PL3 are listed in Table 8. It was found that the trend of the plan with the largest GDP value (PL1) maintained the low‐

est values for Ob2 and Ob3 (−11,954.10 and − 5,605.00, respectively), whereas the values of Ob2 and Ob3 for PL2 
and PL3 were relatively better, but the GDP value was relatively low (approximately 2.83 ×1012

 to 2.86×1012yuan).

The differences between PL1, PL2, and PL3 and the current land use pattern are displayed in detail in Figure 8. 

It is found that the PL1, PL2, and PL3 trends are to allocate more built‐up land in the WHA, especially in the WH, as 

CAO et Al.16  |    

seen in Figure 8. For QJ, XT, and TM, the spatial distributions of built‐up areas for PL1, PL2, and PL3 are almost the 

same (black plots in these cities). For the other cities, except for QJ, XT, and TM, more plots with red color can be 

found, which suggests that PL1 generates more built‐up land in the other cities. For agricultural land, PL2 and PL3 

trends are to locate the agricultural land as concentrated areas (green plots are close to black plots), whereas PL1 

trends are for dispersed locations of the agricultural land (red plots in PL1 are dispersed in the south and northeast 

WHA).  Similarly,  for  forest  and  grassland,  PL2  and  PL3  trends  are  to  locate  the  forest  and  grassland  as  clusters, 

whereas PL1 trends are to locate the forest and grassland as scattered areas.

In the past decades, many studies have been conducted to address the issues and challenges brought by tremendous 

global land use and land cover change. These studies include land use change monitoring, mapping, simulation, predica‐

tion, and even land use optimization. To better support land use planning and relevant policy making, many efforts have 

been made in the study of land use multi‐objective optimization, which can be viewed as a classic spatial optimization 

problem, especially in the past decade. However, most of these studies concentrated on the final land use scenarios in 

the projected year, without considering how to reach the final optimized land use scenario. To fill this gap, a STLU‐MOO 

model was  innovatively  proposed  in  this research  to determine the  possible  spatial land  use  solutions  over time. The 

STLU‐MOO is an extension of a genetic LU‐MOO in which the LU‐MOO is generally conducted on different dates, and 

the solutions at year T will affect the solutions at year T + 1. Rather than obtaining multiple solutions for the projected year, 

our proposed model provides the solutions in different years, which can be thought of as spatio temporal solutions. In this 

study, we took the WHA as a case study area. Three objectives were considered for the WHA, including maximizing GDP, 

maximizing land use compatibility, and maximizing NPP, along with the constraints on agricultural land and built‐up land 

proposed by overall land use planning. Subsequently, the STLU‐MOO was implemented separately for the cities in the 

WHA. The Pareto solutions in 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050 were searched for the cities. The results indicated that these 

objectives were in conflict and that the objective values varied in different solutions. A possible range of objective values 
was also provided. For WH, the possible GDP value range in 2020 is 1.1175 ×1012
ners or policy makers can thus select solutions based on satisfying objective values. The STLU‐MOO model also provides 

to 1.1220 ×1012

yuan. Land use plan‐

spatial solutions in different years, and the solutions in year T + 1 would be optimized based on the land use pattern in year 

T. Finally, the integrated spatio‐temporal optimized land use solutions for the WHA could be achieved by combining sepa‐
rate solutions from these cities. Massive solutions could be generated and, as shown in our research results, 5.84 ×1017
possible solutions could be explored. Unfortunately, it is impossible to analyze all these solutions. Therefore, 1,000,000 

sampled solutions were studied to generate the optimized solutions in this research.

In contrast, a few limitations remain in this research that could be of concern in future studies. First, only three 

objectives were considered in this research. In the future, more objectives can be considered to reflect a more com‐

prehensive understanding of land use optimization. In addition, the quantification of each objective could also be 

improved with consideration of the uncertainties in the coming future. Moreover, due to the computational intensity 
of our experiments, only 1,00,000 sampled solutions out of 5.84 ×1017
also be improved in the future with the integration of high‐performance computing. Last but not least, land use opti‐

possible solutions were analyzed, which could 

mization was conducted separately for the nine cities in this research, which has not considered the contiguity on the 

boundaries of these cities per se. This will also be another direction of our future research on this subject.

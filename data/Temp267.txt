ABSTRACT
The modelling of human mobility and migration patterns has
received much attention due to its substantial
importance.
Despite long-term eﬀorts, we still
lack a modelling framework
that captures mobility patterns and further obtains a prospective
view of movement trends with regards to diverse impacting fac-
tors. Here, we propose a proportional odds model of human
mobility and migration (POM-HM)
takes a probabilistic
approach to model human movements. Our model is based on
the migration probability with a log-logistic distribution under the
proportional odds assumption. Explanatory variables are intro-
duced into the model by re-parameterizing the probability distri-
bution function. The two resultant
the
migration strength and cumulative hazard, are used to estimate
regional diﬀerences among travel ﬂuxes and their tendencies. The
performance of the POM-HM in terms of its validity and accuracy is
examined and compared with the gravity model and the radiation
model. The probability-based modelling framework enables us to
investigate regional variations in migrant ﬂuxes consequently
further predict potential future patterns. In short, our modelling
approach captures the probabilistic nature of human mobility and
migration and furthers our understanding of both the spatiotem-
poral patterns of population movements and the impacts of var-
ious driving forces.

1. Introduction

The investigation and modelling of human movements have a long history beginning
with the original work of Ravenstein (1885), and they have attracted increasing attention
in recent years, particularly with regards to social and geographical research, owing to
both the increasing availability of observational data and the notable importance of a
wide range of issues, such as demography, urban planning, and epidemiology (Candia
et al. 2008, Hu et al. 2008, Balcan et al. 2009, Liu et al. 2012, Noulas et al. 2012,

Wesolowski et al. 2012, Becker et al. 2013, Dalziel et al. 2015, Toole et al. 2015). Despite
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the spatiotemporal patterns of travel, human mobility has been
found to exhibit an appreciably high regularity and predictability (Brockmann et al. 2006,
González et al. 2008, Song et al. 2010). However, capturing these mobility patterns and
identifying the trends of human travel and migration are still challenging primarily
because of the spatiotemporal complexity of human movements and limits on the
observation data in terms of the observational level, precision, coverage and complete-
ness of the target population (Blanford et al. 2015).

There are currently several diﬀerent ways to investigate human migration and mobi-
lity across a wide range of levels in terms of both geographical displacement and
temporal duration; for instance, population census estimates, mobile phone use, geo-
located social media and bill tracking can provide valuable data (Brockmann et al. 2006,
Liu et al. 2012, 2014, Lu et al. 2012, Wesolowski et al. 2013, Devile et al. 2014, Pei et al.
2014, Jiang et al. 2017). Given the spatiotemporal uniqueness of an individual’s mobility
and the diversity of the underlying driving forces of travel, it is not easily possible to
universally characterize human movement patterns at the local, regional and global
scales (González et al. 2008, Song et al. 2010, Noulas et al. 2012). In related studies, two
widely used and distinct approaches have emerged for quantitatively estimating the
number of travellers between locations, and each method has its own perspective
(Barthélemy 2010, Simini et al. 2012). Traditional methods (i.e. the gravity model and
the intervening opportunities model) (Stouﬀer 1940, Zipf 1946, LeSage and Pace 2008,
Barthélemy 2010) suggest that the movement ﬂux will increase as the populations of
two locations either decay or grow depending on the geographical distance or inter-
vening opportunities. A recently developed modelling method known as the radiation
model (Simini et al. 2012) argues that human mobility and migration likely depend on
topological patterns of the population distribution rather than the metric distance. This
model is regarded as a promising candidate for a universal model (Yan et al. 2014, Kang
et al. 2015); however, because it is parameter free, the model may be less eﬀective in
instances of heterogeneous population distributions due to the assumption that it obeys
simple particle diﬀusion (Masucci et al. 2013).

In practice, even though their theoretical foundations were notably diﬀerent, the
primary objectives of previous modelling eﬀorts were generally aimed at generating
exact analytical
results to closely match observed population movement data
(Barthélemy 2010). Such deterministic modelling methods are much less likely to allow
us to investigate regional distributions or variations in movement patterns with respect
to current statuses and future trends under various driving forces. The diﬀerences and
similarities among speciﬁc destinations in terms of their incoming and outgoing ﬂuxes
are generally sensitive to socioeconomic conditions and regional disparities (LeSage and
Pace 2008, Zhong et al. 2013); hence, we are less likely to obtain a prospective view of
human mobility and migration. Moreover, even though we can take advantage of
various technologies (as mentioned above) with an unprecedented resolution and a
much broader range of observations, the incompleteness of observational data and the
uncertainties therein (Blanford et al. 2015) arising from the spatial diversity and temporal
heterogeneity of human movements oﬀer a crucial challenge towards universally quan-
tifying estimates of mobility and migration ﬂuxes.

Given the aforementioned limitations on previous modelling eﬀorts, the objective of
this study is to develop an alternative modelling approach to investigate human move-
ment patterns. This is accomplished primarily by using a re-parameterized probability
model and by combining the observationally estimated probability distribution of move-
ment ﬂuxes with the underlying driving forces. The remaining sections will demonstrate
how to develop a probability-based modelling framework via the proportional odds
assumption for a regional-scale human mobility and migration model (hereafter known
as the proportional odds model of human mobility and migration or POM-HM) based on
seven nationwide observation datasets of population movement ﬂuxes. Further applica-
tions of the POM-HM for human movement research in terms of regional characteristic
analysis and future movement estimations will be demonstrated and exempliﬁed with
population census-derived migration data using the POM-HM.

2. Datasets of human movements and driving factors

For the present study, we compiled seven nationwide datasets of long-term migration
and short-term mobility across China from three diﬀerent data sources at the regional
level: the last national population census and two social media platforms. Our datasets
include non-hukou and hukou migration (details are explained in Table 1, also see Chan
et al. 1999) at the province level (NMPP and HMPP) and at the province-city level (NMPC

and HMPC), intercity mobility ﬂows before and after the Chinese New Year (IBCC and
IACC) and city-level daily movement (ITCC). The two non-hukou migration datasets
(NMPP and NMPC) and the two hukou migration datasets (HMPP and HMPC) consist
of the number of migrants from their household registration locations and their birth-
places to their current places (the long-term migration), respectively. The two social
media platform-derived datasets record the number of trips between places (the short-
term mobility) during the observation period. Both IBCC and IACC datasets were
provided by Baidu Chunyun map representing the total amount of intercity trips during
the Chinese New Year. ITCC dataset was assembled from the Weibo check-in data in
which user’s two consecutive check-in records occurring in two diﬀerent cities and
having more than 1-day interval were counted as one intercity movement. All of the
detailed information regarding the spatial and temporal scales and the data sources of
all three datasets is summarized and explained in Table 1. These migration and mobility
datasets are nationally representative observations for various types of population
movements given diﬀerent reasons for inter-regional travel at diﬀerent spatial and
temporal scales.

Remotely sensed data consisting of regional average artiﬁcial lighting signals at night
derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (available at https://ngdc.
noaa.gov/eog/dmsp. html) are used as proxy measures of the average magnitude of the
regional socioeconomic activity and the urbanization level because of the consistent and
spatially explicit manner of the data (as demonstrated by Doll et al. 2000, Ma et al. 2012).
Despite the fact that the over-glow and saturation eﬀects of night-time light images
might aﬀect the spatial investigation of urban expansion at the local scale, the total
volume of nocturnal brightness at the regional scale generally shows a robust mono-
tonic relationship with the regional socioeconomic activity, thereby allowing us to
estimate the regional-scale socioeconomic status using original night-time lighting
signals.

The selection of explanatory variables could vary with the various natures of human
movement across diﬀerent spatial and temporal scales (Barthélemy 2010). Because the
primary objective of our study is to present a general framework for modelling human
movement, several typical covariates are taken into account commonly for seven
diﬀerent datasets of human movement. As exempliﬁed by the NMPP dataset shown in
Figure 1, although a diversity of factors can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence an individual’s
mobility, regional-level migration ﬂuxes are most likely primarily related to the com-
bined eﬀect of geographical, demographic and socioeconomic variables. Furthermore,
as demonstrated by the case of Guangdong Province (see Figure 1), which has the
largest number of incoming migrants due to its notable economic development over
the past several decades, the ﬂux of the incoming population exhibits a signiﬁcant
negative correlation with the geographical distance on a logarithmic scale (Pearson’s
r = −0.71, P < 0.001). The logarithm value of the incoming population shows a signiﬁcant
positive correlation with the home region population size (r = 0.69, P < 0.001) and a
signiﬁcant negative correlation with the average night-time radiance in the migrant
origin areas (r = −0.48, P = 0.008). We therefore select ﬁve explanatory variables
involving the geographical distance, regional population size and average night-time
lights (the latter for both the origin and the destination regions separately) as covariates
for our inter-regional mobility and migration modelling.

paired destination are linked by a counter-clockwise arc. The satellite-derived night-time lights

economic development and urbanization.

3. Statistical basis of the POM-HM

The commonly used gravity model is an empirically based framework for modelling
human movements, and it typically assumes that the number of trips Gij between two
places i and j is proportional to the product (generally the some power) of the popula-
tion of the source (mi) and the population of the destination (nj) and decays with the
Euclidean distance rij between them according to a power law:

Gij ¼ A

β
mα
i n
j
γ
r
ij

(1)

where A is a proportionality constant and α, β and γ are adjustable exponents generally
obtained by ﬁtting the observational data. Despite the widespread use of the gravity
model, several limitations have been addressed mainly with respect to its theoretical
guidance, predictive discrepancies and deterministic nature (Simini et al. 2012).

The recently proposed radiation model, which was derived from a simple particle
diﬀusion-absorption model, assumes that the number of travellers Tij that move

6

between a location i and a location j depends only on mi and nj and on the total
population sij in a circle of radius rij centred at the home-region (Simini et al. 2012):

Tij ¼ Ti

(cid:1)

(cid:3)

minj
(cid:1)
mi þ nj þ sij

(cid:3)

mi þ nj

(2)

where Ti, which is assumed to be proportional to mi, is the total number of trips starting
from location i. Despite the advantages of parameter-free approaches, the radiation
model is based on job opportunities, which are assumed to be proportional to the
regional population, and it is thus unlikely to be reasonable for a large region with a
non-uniform population distribution and various human settlement sizes attributable to
an increased human population heterogeneity (Masucci et al. 2013).

In this study, we introduce a probability-based modelling framework to investigate
human mobility and migration patterns. We use a probabilistic approach rather than a
deterministic modelling method mainly because of the following considerations: (1) The
actual number of trips between the origin and the destination during a given time
interval is often hardly determinable due to the heterogeneity of individuals’ movement
behaviours and the limited capabilities of observational techniques. Hence, deterministic
approaches will yield a biased estimate (which are usually underestimated) of the
prevalent population movement pattern with unseen cases. (2) In practices, the basis
of simple emission-absorption dynamics might be not suitable for diverse human move-
ment patterns, particularly for long-term migration, while the distributions of the impact
factors are inter-regionally uneven and non-uniform. Thus, relative explanatory variables
instead of merely using topological metrics. (3)
should be included in the model
Moreover, it is important to introduce independent variables that consider not only
the driving forces of human movement but also the abovementioned features of the
empirical data into the model.

In the probability-based modelling framework, we consider the potential number of
individuals N that move between an origin and a destination as a random variable and
hence use a parameterized distribution function that incorporates several underlying
driving factors. Our method is initially inspired by the accelerated-failure time model for
survival data with random censoring (Richards 2012) that was originally used to model
the relationships between observed event distributions and explanatory variables.
Considering the limitations of observational data, we use a parameterized probability
distribution of N rather than a direct expression of the sampled ﬂuxes and explanatory
variables as the basis for analysing movement patterns to reduce the eﬀects of unseen
events and biased samples. Because our approach for the modelling of human mobility
and migration (HM) is based on the assumption of proportional odds (PO), we will refer
to the proposed approach as the POM-HM.

Furthermore, statistical comparisons using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) further
indicate that the log-logistic distribution is generally favoured over the alternative and is
comparable to the log-normal distribution in the cases of the NMPC, HMPC and ITCC
datasets (see Table 2). Thus, the proportional odds model, which has a log-logistic
baseline and a covariate X, is considered generally appropriate for the parameterized

sures for the following typical driving forces: the geographical distance (D), popula-
tion size in the home region (PO), and destination region (PD) and the economic
development as measured by the anthropogenic nocturnal radiances in the source
area (EO) and destination area (ED). The expression of λ Xð Þ is based on widely
documented empirical evidence (as demonstrated in Section 2) that the ﬂux of
human travel
is related to the product of the geographical distance (inversely
proportional according to a power law) and the linear combination of demographic
and socioeconomic factors (proportional according to an exponential law):

4. Results and discussion

4.1. Model testing and comparison

The ability of the POM-HM to quantitatively model empirical data can be explored by
using estimates of the parametric median (i.e. Equation 7) for the log-logistic distribu-
tion. Here, we test the parametric median of M n; X
Þ against empirical travel ﬂuxes over
the seven observational datasets. As illustrated in Figure 3, the points in the scatter plot
for each pair of geographical units generally lie along the balanced diagonal (except the
ITCC data), and there are signiﬁcant correlations between the empirical data and pre-
dicted data (P < 0.001 for all cases); both of these ﬁndings commonly suggest that the
median estimate of the POM-HM can generate realistic approximations of the observed
travel ﬂow at multiple spatiotemporal scales.

ð

Moreover, we also examine the POM-HM against both the most commonly used
gravity model (according to Equation 1 through non-linear regression) and the recently
introduced radiation model (according to Equation 2, where Ti is treated as the total
number of observed trips starting from the location i). The modiﬁed version of the
Sørensen-Dice similarity index (SSI) is used to quantify the average matching degree
between the empirical and modelled data for the three models (see Figure 3). Here, the
SSI is calculated as

where T is the total number of travel ﬂuxes. As shown in Figure 3, the comparison results
indicate that the POM-HM has the best overall performance compared to the alterna-
tives. In general, the gravity model also returns competitive results primarily because the
expression of the parametric median of M n; X
Þ is based on similar empirical evidence
ð
as the gravity model.
In comparison, the radiation model provides relatively poor
predictions of the empirical travel ﬂuxes across all seven datasets. This is largely because
the uneven inter-regional socioeconomic development in China has resulted in a
distribution of job opportunities (or other attracting factors) that is disproportional to
the population size. Thus, the diﬀusion-absorption dynamics of population movements

cannot capture the underlying structure of the travel ﬂow at the regional scale in a very
large area such as China.

4.2. Movement feature analyses via the POM-HM

The parametric median estimate for inter-regional population movements in the POM-
HM, as shown in Equation 7, in which log λð Þ is regarded as a linear (log-linear for D)
function of the covariates, allows us to not only generate a realistic approximation of the
observed travel ﬂows (as addressed above) but also characterize the diverse patterns of
human mobility and migration according to the geographical distance and socioeco-
nomic factors at diﬀerent spatiotemporal scales. Variations in the exponents of the re-

parameterized scale factor are likely related to the type and the scale of population
movement. As listed in Table 3, both the IBCC and the IACC data, which primarily consist
of short-timescale travel (8 h) during the Chinese New Year, show the most marked
decline with the geographical distance among the datasets (α = −1.82 and −1.88,
respectively).
ITCC, which captures routine intercity movements (at the timescale of
24 h) with diverse travel purposes, exhibits a comparatively slow distance-related
decay (α = −0.40). The other four datasets containing long-term migration data show
a relatively moderate decline with the distance and slight variations in the data
(α = [−1.21, −1.10]) despite diﬀerent observation levels.

The eﬀects of demographic and socioeconomic variables on travel patterns might be
diﬀerent among the seven movement datasets due to distinct diﬀerences in their
exponents (Table 3). First, we note that relatively large β 1 and β 2 values are common
at the city level (including ITCC, IBCC and IACC), while relatively small β 1 and β 2, values
are prevalent at the province level (including NMPP and HMPP). Second, we ﬁnd that
three city-level travel ﬂows show a symmetry in β 1 and β 2, potentially indicating that
short-timescale, inter-regional movements most likely occur between relatively popu-
lous areas. Third, both province-level datasets (i.e. NMPP and HMPP) exhibit an asym-
metry in β 1 and β 2 that probably indicates a diﬀerence in the population size between
the home region and the destination region for long-term migration. Fourth, four long-
timescale migration datasets (i.e. NMPP, HMPP, NMPC and HMPC) are found to have
negative β 3 (for the origin) and positive β 4 (for the destination) values. This result
suggests that the human population tends to migrate from relatively less developed
areas to more developed areas; this migration is often driven by socioeconomic con-
cerns during long-timescale migration. Fifth, relatively higher seasonal mobility (IBCC
and IACC) likely occurs among the developed areas, while the coeﬃcients β 3 and β 4 are
both positive and similar. In addition, the distribution of f(n) (Equation 5) is generally
unimodal at the regional level because the shape factor p > 1 for all seven datasets.

4.3. Migration probability and cumulative hazard

In comparison with the gravity model and the radiation model, an advantage of the
POM-HM is that, unlike deterministic models, it can provide us with a statistical view of
potential human movement in terms of unobserved or upcoming events because it is
based upon estimated migration probabilities rather
relationships
between the ﬂuxes and their driving factors. In addition to the migration function M nð Þ,
a quantitative index-cumulative hazard function H nð Þ can further portray the saturation
(or hazard) degree of prospective incoming and outgoing ﬂuxes relative to retrospective
or observed movement events for the given source and destination regions. Derived
from the deﬁnition of M nð Þ, H nð Þ can be determines by the following (closely akin to the
index in survival analysis, see Richards 2012):

where H nð Þ is interpretable as the expected value of the degree of saturation (or hazard)

large H nð Þ value implies a relatively low probability for potential incoming or outgoing
ﬂuxes due to a high degree of migration saturation.

We use a case study of the NMPP dataset to demonstrate the joint application of the
migration probability and the cumulative hazard to investigate potential future human
migration patterns. Figure 4 represents the observed distribution of the migration
probability deﬁned by M nð Þ and its corresponding estimates for the regional average
migration probabilities of incoming migration and outgoing migration. The cumulative
hazard of migration estimated by H nð Þ for an individual-based migration ﬂux is shown in
Figure 5(a–b); corresponding estimates for the regional average cumulative hazard are
also presented. Taken together, these two ﬁgures jointly exhibit a tendency towards
increased or decreased human migration, including both incoming and outgoing migra-
tion for a target region. For instance, the internal migration to Guangdong and Zhejiang,
the two largest destinations of outgoing migrants over the past several decades, will
gradually decline after 2010 (the observation year of NMPP) because both provinces
show relatively small incoming migration probabilities (Figure 4(b)) and correspondingly
higher cumulative hazards (Figure 5(b)).
In contrast, even though they experienced
sizeable numbers of incoming migrants before 2010, Beijing and Shanghai are both
likely to have additional upcoming migrants because both show a medium likelihood
and a small cumulative hazard for incoming migration. Outgoing migration will be more
likely to continuously increase in Henan and decline in Chongqing, which are two of the
largest sources of migration before 2010, due to a relatively higher
for
Chongqing) migration probability and a relatively smaller (larger for Chongqing) cumu-
lative hazard for outgoing migrants for Henan than for other source regions.

These inferred results can be veriﬁed by comparing the population growth in 2010
with that in 2015. Figure 5(c) and d show quantitative relationships between the

provinces and seven large destination provinces (or municipalities), respectively. The
population data are provided by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (available at
http://data.stats.gov.cn/). From these two ﬁgures, we can ﬁnd a signiﬁcant positive log-
linear response of the population growth rate to the net cumulative outgoing migration
hazard (Figure 5(c)) and a negative log-linear relationship between the cumulative
incoming migration hazard and population growth rate. For the individual migration
destinations, the populations in Guangdong and Zhejiang increased by 3.9% (from 104
to 108 million) and 1.7% (from 54.5 to 55.4 million), respectively, which are markedly
higher and lower than the country-level average rate of population growth (2.8%, from

1334 to 1371 million), respectively. This indicates a gradual decline in the incoming
migration to Guangdong and Zhejiang since 2010. Meanwhile, an increase in the
incoming migration has likely occurred in Beijing and Shanghai, where the population
size increased by 10.7% (from 19.6 to 21.7 million) and 5.2% (from 23.0 to 24.2 million),
respectively, both of which are notably higher than the national average. For the
migration sources, the population growth rates show distinct diﬀerences between
Henan (0.7%, from 94.1 to 94.8 million) and Chongqing (4.5%, from 28.9 to 30.2 million),
suggesting notably increased and decreased trends of incoming migrants and outgoing
migrants, respectively. By adopting these results, we can ﬁnd that all of these statistical
data-based observations are highly consistent with the inferred results from the POM-
HM based on the migration probability and cumulative hazard.

4.4. Migration strength impacted by multiple covariates

As discussed above, several factors can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the aggregate behaviours of
human migration and mobility among the diﬀerent regions. The POM-HM allows us to
investigate how the underlying driving forces result in regional diﬀerences in the
migration patterns among the sources and destinations. For instance, following the
median estimate in the POM-HM (Equation 7), we can deﬁne the γ factor as:

γ;γ A1 ! B vs: A2 ! B

ð

(cid:6) (cid:7)α

Þ; D2
D1

(cid:1)

(cid:3)

exp βT X2 (cid:3) βT X1

(11)

In this deﬁnition, we consider the strength comparison of outgoing migration between
two sources A1 and A2 with respect to the same destination B in terms of regional
diﬀerences in the source covariates X1 (for B1) and X2 (B2). Generally, γ<1 indicates that
there might exist relatively more outgoing migrants in A1 than in A2 with respect to the
destination B. Moreover, Equation 11 states that γ can be linearly decomposed into
separate components, thereby allowing for a quantitative comparison of the individual
covariates aﬀecting the migration strength.

We use a case study of census-based outgoing migration to Guangdong Province
from 30 provincial-level regions in the NMPP dataset to demonstrate the application
of the γ factor. Figure 6(a–d) illustrate the inter-regional variations in the outgoing
migration to Guangdong Province impacted by the metric distances between the
geographic proximity, source population and economic development in the home

outgoing migrants in a case region (X-axis) would prefer to migrate to Guangdong
in comparison with outgoing migrants in the opposite control regions (Y-axis), which
is likely explained by the corresponding covariates. The red colour denotes a rela-
tively larger strength gap between the case and control regions, while the blue colour
represents a relative smaller diﬀerence. All of the regions are arranged in ascending
order based on the geographical distance to Guangdong from left to right and from
bottom to top. From these ﬁgures, we can ﬁnd that the strength gap between the
case and opposite control regions clearly increases with an enhanced diﬀerence in
the explanatory variables. Regional diﬀerences in the relative migration strength can
be explained by the combined eﬀect of individual variables that can be quantitatively

estimated according to the γ factor (Equation 11). As shown in Figure 6(e), we further
ﬁnd that there exists a signiﬁcant linear relationship between the sum of the γ factor
and the number of outgoing migrants to Guangdong. Comprehensively, Hunan,
Guangxi, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Hubei and Henan have contributed major numbers of
incoming migrants to Guangdong owing to relatively low γ factors (also see
Figure 6(d)) that generally resulted from relatively shorter geographical distances
larger source population sizes (Figure 6(b)) and lower socioeconomic
(Figure 6(a)),
statuses (Figure 6(c)) than other source places either independently or jointly.
In
contrast, both Zhejiang and Yunnan, which even show a geographical distance to
Guangdong Province that is similar to those of other major sources of incoming
migrants, have fewer numbers of incoming migrants to Guangdong Province because
of relatively high γ factors determined by their population size and socioeconomic
status.

5. Conclusions

Conspicuously diﬀerent from previous modelling methods, our POM-HM is estab-
lished based on the observed probability distribution of mobility and migration
events (i.e. the migration function). Via the proportional odds assumption, we further
ﬁnd that the log-logistic distribution is generally the optimal baseline distribution for
our human movement datasets. By re-parameterizing the scale factor in the migration
function with a log-logistic baseline, we introduce several typical explanatory vari-
ables involving geographic, demographic and socioeconomic metrics into the prob-
ability-based migration function. Compared with both the gravity model and the
radiation model, the POM-HM oﬀers several advantages including: (1) An empirical
examination and a performance comparison commonly suggest that the POM-HM is
more reliable than the alternatives for regional-scale observations of human mobility
and migration. (2) Probability-based modelling would beneﬁt the data requirements
in terms of the completeness and accuracy of observational records. (3) Furthermore,
using the POM-HM modelling method, we can obtain an understanding of the
regional variabilities in retrospective and prospective movement events in terms of
the migration probability and cumulative hazard (i.e. the degree of saturation). The
regional diﬀerences in movement patterns resulting from their impact factors can be
explained by the γ factor. (4) The utility of an empirical modelling method is often
limited by the complexity of the mobility behaviours and the diversity of the under-

modelling diﬀerent patterns of human mobility and migration by changing the
baseline distribution and the re-parameterized form with various covariates according
to speciﬁc observations of travel ﬂuxes.

Further applications of the probability-based modelling approach, particularly for
small-scale, intra-regional human mobility patterns with high dynamics and for other
countries with various driving factors (Liu et al. 2012, Noulas et al. 2012, Masucci et al.
2013, Kang et al. 2015), can be beneﬁcial
for our understanding of the diverse
patterns of human mobility and migration at multiple spatiotemporal scales.
In
addition,
it should be noteworthy that the POM-HM is based on the proportional
odds assumption and the re-parameterization of the empirical distribution function.

Hence, an appropriate probability distribution of human population movement and
an explicit quantitative expression of explanatory variables, both of which may vary
by geographical region and observational level, are typically crucial for the probabil-
ity-based modelling approach.

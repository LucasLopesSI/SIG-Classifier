Abstract. The objective of this paper is to present a GIS-based multivariate
application for land suitability assessment with a public participation base. The
approach takes into account the issues and concerns of the stakeholders, and
employs a multivariate statistical procedure for classifying land units into land
suitability groups, according to sectoral interests. Sets of spatial algorithms are
incorporated into a GIS database to identify such groups. A participatory plan-
ning workshop was carried out to de(cid:142) ne the set of environmental attributes that
determine the land-use pattern, in conformity with the interests, objectives, and
values of the stakeholders. The approach allows experts to interpret the informa-
tion generated by the stakeholders under methodologically rigorous conditions,
with a minimum of spatial data, and with relatively low cognitive processing level
demanded to the representatives of socioeconomic sectors, interest groups, and
authorities.

1.

Introduction
Land suitability is determined by both the (cid:142) tness of the land for a particular use
(Steiner 1983), and the values and interests of the stakeholders in a region (Bojo´rquez-
Tapia et al. 1994). In fact,
land-use decisions depend upon the socioeconomic
activities and the character of the involved social organizations (Malczewski and
Ogryczak 1995). However, environmental con(cid:143) icts appear whenever diŒerent sectors
with incompatible activities compete for available land (Bojo´ rquez-Tapia et al. 1994 ).
Environmental con(cid:143) icts over the allocation of land have resulted in laws and
policies that require public participation in decision making. Since ideas, values, and
attitudes over natural resources vary between social organizations and people (Smith
et al. 1995), the goal is to provide the constituencies with an opportunity to collabor-
ate and to attain consensual land-use decision making (Bojo´ rquez-Tapia et al. 1994,
Brown 1986 ).

Con(cid:143) ict resolution then implies making judgments about the stakeholders’ goals
and interests (Edwards and Newman 1986). It also entails the comparison of trade-
oŒs among diŒerent decisions resulting from particular sectoral interest and land-
use scenarios ( Van Huylenbroeck and Coppens 1995 ). Hence, a critical issue in

consensual decision making is the credibility of the con(cid:143) ict resolution process,
particularly with respect to the unique demands of the stakeholders involved in
participatory planning (Selin and Cha´vez 1995). From the technical point of view,
credibility depends upon the availability of data, the internal structure of the analyt-
ical procedure, and the interactions and discussion among interest groups (OEA
1984, Crowfoot and Wondolleck 1990, Harashina 1995 ).

A land suitability assessment is a planning tool for the design of a land-use
pattern that prevents environmental con(cid:143) icts through the segregation of competing
land-uses (Eastman et al. 1993). It is a decision problem under multiple criteria and
multiple objectives that, when adapted into a geographical information system (GIS),
produces a land-use pattern that minimizes con(cid:143) icts and maximizes consensus among
the stakeholders (Eastman et al. 1993, Malczewski et al. 1997 ).

Therefore, a successful land suitability assessment depends on how the activities
and interactions of the relevant interest groups are included into the analysis
(Malczewski et al. 1997 ), and how the decision rules are constructed in a way that
all of the stakeholders’ land-use criteria are satis(cid:142) ed (Eastman et al. 1993). Hence,
GIS-based assessments have to include the three land-use decision elements at the
regional scale (Smith et al. 1995): (1) the distribution of land cover, population, and
human activities over the landscape, or infrastructure; (2) the social organizations
present in a region, or structure, and (3) the ideas, values, and attitudes that people
have about the particular uses of the land, or superstructure .

The objective of this paper is to present a GIS-based approach for land suitability
assessment, which translate the infrastructure, structure, and superstructure of land-
use decisions into a rigorous spatial analysis. It is presented by means of a case
study: The regional land-use planning for Costa Norte of the state of Nayarit, Mexico.
Baseline data for the approach is obtained during participatory planning work-
shops. These allow both the stakeholders’ representatives and the decision makers
to produce a set of land-use criteria. Then, a multi-criteria assessment is used to
determine suitability scores for each sector. In an analogous way to other approaches
(Eastman et al. 1993, Pereira and Duckstein 1993), each grid cell in a raster GIS is
valued according to its quality for a particular use, and each thematic layer represents
an assessment criterion. Next, a multi-objective evaluation aggregates land parcels
into suitability groups, based upon the multi-criteria evaluations for each sector. In
essence, the aggregation is carried out by means of a multivariate numerical classi-
(cid:142) cation, through a divisive polythetic partitioning (Noy-Meir 1973, Pielou 1984 ).
Finally, land suitability groups are associated to environmental con(cid:143) icts by means
of the relative suitability among groups, so that land-uses can be allocated in a
pattern that minimize con(cid:143) icts and maximize consensus among the stakeholders.

2. Study area

Costa Norte extended from San Blas, Nayarit (21ß 31¾ N–105ß 23¾ W) to Teacapa´ n
estuary (22ß 46¾ N–105ß 46¾ W), along the Southern portion of the alluvial Paci(cid:142) c
Coastal Plain ((cid:142) gure 1). It encompasses a total of 3500 km2, which includes the
Teacapa´ n-Agua Brava-Marismas Nacionales system.

The Teacapa´ n-Agua Brava-Marismas Nacionales system covers 607 km2 of tidal
channels, seasonal (cid:143) ood plains, and coastal lagoons, and 705 km2 of mangrove
swamps and forests. It is under intense pressure from competing resource uses. On
the one hand, major shrimp farming developments were being projected or under-
taken in the region at the time of this study. Since shrimp farming has resulted in

the degradation of wetland ecosystems and threatens their biological diversity else-
where (Snedaker et al. 1988, Larsson et al. 1994, Flaherty and Karnjanakesorn 1995),
the Mexican government was responsible for designing strategies aimed at preventing
further deterioration and reducing environmental con(cid:143) icts (Bojo´rquez-Tapia et al.
1997 ). Fishing was the most important economic activity in coastal lagoons.

On the other hand, Teacapa´n-Agua Brava-Marismas Nacionales is important for
biological conservation. The system contains the largest expanse of mangroves on
the Paci(cid:142) c coast, and about 22% of the total mangrove cover in Mexico (Flores-
Verdugo et al. 1992). It was a critical component of the Paci(cid:142) c migratory (cid:143) yway,
and the system provides important habitats for commercial, endemic and endangered
species (Flores-Verdugo et al. 1990 ).

Along the coastal plain, the river deltas and alluvial soils allow the development
of highly productive agriculture and cattle ranching on 1410 km2 . Likewise, terrestrial
natural vegetation has been fragmented and reduced to a total of 782 km2 of low
deciduous forest and scrub lands.

3. Methods

The land suitability assessment for Costa Norte was carried out through the
method described by Bojo´rquez-Tapia et al. (1994 ), adapted for a spatial analysis in
a GIS. We used the UNIX-based software Geographic Resource Analysis Support
System, GRASS (USA CERL 1993) for generating the data layers and for carrying
out all of the spatial analyses. The assessment involved three tasks: (1) development
of decision rules, (2) database development, and (3) land suitability assessment.

3.1. Development of decision rules
3.1.1. Participatory planning workshop

Law in Mexico requires public participation in regional land use planning. Hence,
a three-day participatory planning workshop was organized. In preparation for the
workshop, consultations with federal, state and local policy makers, representatives
of socioeconomic sectors, and spokespersons of non-governmenta l organizations
were carried out to identify the relevant stakeholders in the region. These included
shrimp farming associations, (cid:142) shing cooperatives, agricultural and cattle ranching
organizations, international conservation groups, academics, and state and municipal
authorities. The stakeholders and the authorities were divided into four sectors to
simplify the analysis: aquaculture , agriculture and cattle ranching, and conservation.
The activities in the workshop included a combination of lectures and group
dynamic techniques ((cid:142) gure 2 ). The lectures were used to allow the representatives
to present their goals, objectives, and concerns publicly, and to provide the particip-
ants with a basic understanding of the analytical tools to be used latter. Then, the
stakeholders were divided into small groups of ten to (cid:142) fteen people, according to
their respective sector.

Through small-group involvement techniques (Steiner 1991 ), a facilitator guided
group discussions to clarify the key issues, identify problems, and generate solutions.
The specialists of the interdisciplinary team assisted the facilitators in the small-
group dynamics; their role was to assist the stakeholders to generate criteria in a
format usable for the spatial analysis. Thus, the representatives were able to:
(1) declare the sectoral objectives and activities, (2) identify the physical, biological,
and socioeconomic characteristics needed to carry out their activities, (3) establish
the activities that could be in con(cid:143) ict with other sectors’ goals, and (4) produce

ment of Costa Norte de Nayarit, Mexico.

the speci(cid:142) c compromises that would have to be assumed by each sector to prevent
land-use con(cid:143) icts.

3.1.2. Interdisciplinary team

An interdisciplinary team of (cid:142) fteen specialists was formed and organized in two
groups (Holling 1978): specialist group and core group. The (cid:142) rst included specialists
of the following disciplines: geomorphology , hydrology, soils, vegetation, remote

sensing, biological conservation, and human ecology. Team members were selected
because of their experience, technical capacity, and knowledge of the stakeholders’
interests.

The results of the participatory planning workshop were studied in detail by the
specialists group. Each expert translated the physical, biological, and socioeconomic
land attributes needed to perform a sectoral activity into speci(cid:142) c spatial environ-
mental criteria; this task was simpli(cid:142) ed by the participation of the specialists in the
small-group dynamics. Next, the experts de(cid:142) ned the conditions or states of favour-
ability-unfavourabilit y for each criterion, and ranked the importance of the attributes
for each activity, as in Betters and Rubingh (1978). Disagreements among the
specialist over de(cid:142) nitions, and interpretations of the elements of the model, and
importance weights were conciliated during brainstorming sessions.

The core group included specialists in GIS and regional planning. This group
was responsible of applying multi-criteria/multi-objective techniques for the suitabil-
ity assessment. Once the suitability assessment was completed, the whole interdis-
ciplinary team conceived speci(cid:142) c compromises to settle land-use con(cid:143) icts, taking
into account the information generated in the participatory planning workshop.

3.2. Database development

Results of the participatory planning workshop were transferred to a large scale
(1:50 000) GIS database. Thus, the database included the following layers: vegetation
and land cover, soil type, landforms, elevation, major roads, and urban areas. The
vegetation and land cover layer was created by means of a supervised classi(cid:142) cation
of Landsat TM satellite imagery, while the others were digitized into the GIS from
corresponding thematic maps or, in the case of the elevation layer, derived from a
digital elevation model.

The GIS layers for each land-use criterion were reviewed by the specialists group.
This process was crucial for the conservation and aquaculture . For these sectors,
wetlands were at (cid:142) rst identi(cid:142) ed as a criterion in the workshop. After the revision by
the specialists, however, the conservationists indicated that habitat requirement of
shoreline birds and water fowl oblige the use of two separate criteria: salt marshes
and coastal lagoons. Likewise, aquaculture specialists pointed out that (cid:143) ood prone
areas would su(cid:141) ce as a criterion.

Therefore, the vegetation and land-cover, and the landform layers were adjusted
to suit the conservation criteria. Since salt marshes were not separated by the initial
satellite image classi(cid:142) cation, a second image interpretation was necessary. Aerial
vertical videography techniques (Graham 1993 ) were used to support the second
classi(cid:142) cation, whose results identi(cid:142) ed the salt marshes as a land-cover class.
Meanwhile, (cid:143) ood prone areas and coastal lagoons were located from the landform
layer. The specialists group suggested no additional changes.

3.3. L and suitability assessment
3.3.1. Multi-criteria analysis

The multicriteria analysis valued the landscape attributes with respect to speci(cid:142) c
land-uses or sectoral activities. As in Eastman et al. (1995 ) and Pereira and Duckstein
(1993), each thematic layer represented an evaluation criterion and grid cells were
valued according to their quality for a particular land-use through a weighted linear
combination.

Formally, the set of all pixels in a given GIS database, X, with a total of K

135

pixels, is represented by (Pereira and Duckstein 1993 ):

X 5 {x1, x2, ..., xk},

k 5 1, 2, ..., K.

Each pixel is characterized by a set of criteria or decision variables, I, so the kth
pixel takes a value x for criterion i, and the collection of all possible values in
diŒerent map layers is de(cid:142) ned as follows:

xk 5

1, xk
(xk

2, ..., xk
i );

i 5 1, 2, ..., I; x 5

(0, 1); Yxk

j ×X

where xi 5 0 if the state of a criterion is favourable for a sector, and xi 5 1 otherwise.
The suitability sj at the kth pixel was computed by a weighted linear combination

as follows (Eastman 1993 ):

sk
j 5

wijxk
ij;

Yxk

i ×X

I

i

where wij is the weight, and xik is the value of criteria i for sector or land-use j in
the kth pixel.

The criteria weights, wi, were computed on an ordinal scale as follows:
wij 5 nj Õ

rij 1 1

where n is the total number of criteria, and r is the rank of criterion i for sector j.

The multi-criteria analysis was implemented in GRASS in two steps ((cid:142) gure 3).
First, a set of binary layers was generated to locate the favourable state for each
criterion. Thus, the appropriate variables, either numerical (e.g. distance to roads)
or nominal (e.g. soil type), were reclassi(cid:142) ed to a category value of 1. Next, the r.weight
program of GRASS was used to carry out a weighted linear combination of the data
layers and obtain sectoral suitability scores for each pixel.

The multiplication of ordinal weights (wij) and binary criteria (cij) generated a
complete ordering of the geographical regions with respect to their importance for
a speci(cid:142) c land-use j. Because of the properties of measurement scales, however, the
ordinal map layers had to be transformed to an interval scale for their use in the
weighted linear combination.

Nevertheless, the level of understanding and education of the stakeholders con-
strained us to employ a relatively low cognitive processing approach, which in
practical terms implied that the generation of transformation functions was avoided.
Hence, we made the following assumptions: (1) the unequal separation between
ranked criteria could be accounted for, and (2) there was a transformation function
that could convert the ranked criteria to values in an interval scale. To simplify the
manipulation of map layers in GRASS (which is restricted to integer numbers), the
values of the ranked map layers were assumed to be equal to those of the interval
scale needed for the execution of r. weight. The resulting suitability scores, sj, were
then normalized to a 1 (minimum) to 10 (maximum) suitability scale to facilitate
comparisons between sectors. Also, normalization avoided the ‘range eŒect’ generated
by diŒerent number of criteria among land-uses.

An aftermath of the multi-criteria procedure presented here was that a partially
compensatory decision-making was implicit in the analysis; that is, the addition of
low ranking criteria could compensate the absence of high ranking criteria in a pixel
(Malczewski et al. 1997 ). Consequently, the quality of pixels for a land-use could be
overestimated in areas where high ranking criteria were not present.

3.3.2. Multi-objective analysis

The multi-objective analysis aggregated land parcels into land suitability groups.
These allowed the interdisciplinary team of experts to estimate the magnitude and
likelihood of the environmental con(cid:143) icts. The groups were formed by gathering the
pixels in accordance to the similarities of their sectoral land suitability scores.

The GIS procedure consisted of a multivariate numerical classi(cid:142) cation, through
a divisive polythetic partitioning (Noy-Meir 1973, Pielou 1984). The partitioning
method required the application of principal component analyses (PCA) in successive
steps. We used the i.pca program of GRASS to separate the suitability groups. At
each step, the two resulting clusters were obtained by calculating the grouping of
pixels that maximized the increment of homogeneity. This increment was computed
by the following procedure: (1) The (cid:142) rst-component-score s were divided in a fre-
quency histogram; (2) the histogram classes were placed into a series of two sets (for
example, class one of the histogram was placed in set a, and the other classes in set
b; next, classes one and two were placed in set a, and the rest in set b; and so on);
(3) the increment in homogeneity was calculated by the pairwise comparison of the
sets. The formula used was the following:

Ds 5 stÕ

(sa 1 sb)

where Ds is the increment in homogeneity; st is the average variance of all the (cid:142) rst-
principal-component score classes; sa is the variance of set a of (cid:142) rst-principal-
component scores classes; and sb is the variance of set b of (cid:142) rst-principal-componen t
scores classes. Therefore, the resulting classi(cid:142) ed subsets of pixels were homogeneous
with respect to their aptitude for the land-uses altogether.

The subsets of pixels or groups units formed by the numerical classi(cid:142) cation were
transferred to a nominal map, which showed their spatial distribution. Finally, a
matrix of mean group suitability Z was generated to compare the relative aptitudes
amongst clusters. Matrix Z was adjusted following the Gower’s residuals by a double
centring procedure (Gower 1966, Digby and Kempton 1987, Bojo´ rquez-Tapia et al.
1994 ):

zgj 5 mgj 1 mg. 1 m.j Õ m..

where zgj is the adjusted mean land suitability, mgj is the mean land suitability of
group g and sector j, respectively, mj. is the mean land suitability of group g for all
sectors, m.j is the mean land suitability of sector j for all groups, and m.. is the mean
of the whole matrix. A positive value of zgj indicates a high mean suitability of group
g for land-use j, while a negative value denotes the opposite.

In conformity with multi-objective theory (Szidarovszky et al. 1986 ) and the area
multiple use concept (Brooks et al. 1991 ), con(cid:143) icts were located by examining which
suitability groups presented positive Gower’s residuals for competitive land uses
(these occur whenever accomplishing a sectoral objective contravenes other sectoral
objectives). Hence, the identi(cid:142) cation of land uses that minimized con(cid:143) icts at each
land unit was achieved by maximizing the Gower’s residuals through an integer
programming procedure; formally (Dykstra 1984):

Maximize (cid:158)

Constraint (1) ensures that all the Gower’s residual values are considered, con-
straint (2) avoids the inclusion of mutually excluding decision variables (re(cid:143) ecting
competing land uses), and constraint (3) is the binary restriction for the decision
variable.

It should be noted that the range eŒect did not in(cid:143) uence the multi-objective
analysis because the land suitability map layers were normalized into the 1 to 10
suitability scale, and an intrinsic assumption in the numerical classi(cid:142) cation was that
all the sectors had the same importance. For example, a numerical classi(cid:142) cation
might generate a land unit A by gathering pixels with high sj scores for two sectors
( j 5 1, 2) and low sj scores for one sector ( j 5 3), and a land unit B by gathering
pixels with the opposite sj values for those same sectors.

The accuracy of the multi-objective model was computed by means of an error
matrix (Jensen 1996). This contrasted the land suitability groups with the land cover
categories used as decision criteria in the sectoral suitability analysis. Land cover
data was obtained by interpretation of 3707 georeferenced images that were derived
from vertical airborne videography (Graham 1993, Bojo´rquez-Tapia et al. 1997 ).
Both the errors of commission and the errors of omission were computed for each
land suitability group and each land cover class.

4. Results

the suitability scores

The outcome of the participatory planning workshop resulted in nine environ-
mental criteria (table 1(a, b)). The combination of these criteria by means of the GIS
revealed the spatial distribution of
for each land-use
((cid:142) gure 4(a–d)). The largest extension of high land suitability scores were obtained
for conservation (48% of the study area), followed by agriculture and cattle ranching
(40%), (cid:142) shing (14%), and aquaculture (5%). The high land suitability scores were
located as follows: for conservation, along the wetlands (coastal lagoons, estuaries,
and swamps), and on areas with remnants of natural cover on the coastal plain; for
agriculture and cattle ranching, on the coastal plain; for (cid:142) shing on the coastal
lagoons; and for aquaculture , on the wetlands (estuaries, and swamps), and on beach
ridges and barrier islands.

The numerical classi(cid:142) cation for Costa Norte required seven PCA iterations to
obtain eight groups ((cid:142) gures 5 and 6). The (cid:142) rst PCA separated highlands from
lowlands. The second PCA was applied to the highlands cluster and separated two
sets of pixels, which were related to the elevation. One of those sets was subjected
to the third PCA. It resulted in Group I, clearly associated with the higher lands on
the coastal plain and the barrier islands (29% of the study area), and Group II,
which was related mainly to the (cid:143) ood prone areas close to riparian zones in the
coastal plain (11% of the study area). The other set was subjected to the fourth PCA

that produced two clusters. From one of these, the (cid:142) fth PCA segregated groups
Groups III and IV, while the other cluster formed Group V. Group III included
pixels located on (cid:143) ood prone areas of brackish water, near to mangroves (3% of the
study area). Group IV gathered a heterogeneous collection of pixels located within
estuaries or in (cid:143) ood prone areas near to mangrove swamps (2% of the study area).
Group V was distributed along the riparian areas in highlands (1% of the study area).
The lowlands were subjected to the sixth PCA, which produced Group VI, the
coastal lagoons and estuaries (8% of the study area), and a collection of pixels that
was divided by the seventh PCA. This generated Group VII, associated with man-
grove forests and natural cover in the coastal plain (33% of the study area), and
Group VIII, related to the natural cover on the coastal plain and salt marshes (13%
of the study area).

The maximization of the Gower’s residuals ((cid:142) gure 7) depicted the potential for
con(cid:143) ict among the four sectors, in contrast with the average suitability scores for
each sector (table 2). Groups I and II presented a clear land suitability for agriculture
and cattle ranching. Group III exhibited a high relative suitability for aquaculture ,
while Group IV showed a moderate relative suitability for aquaculture .

The suitability of Group V was not clearly de(cid:142) ned because it obtained low
suitability scores for the four sectors (table 2) and, as an aftermath, the Gower
residuals were close to zero ((cid:142) gure 7). Nonetheless, the positive residuals indicated
that there existed potential for con(cid:143) ict among agriculture and cattle ranching and
aquaculture . Note that conservation obtained a negative residual value ((cid:142) gure 7) in
spite of having the highest average suitability score among the four sectors (table 2).
The explanation of this result was that the average suitability score in Group VII
was among the lowest for the sector.

Groups VI and VII had a high relative suitability for conservation, although
Group VI was also suitable for (cid:142) sheries. Con(cid:143) ict was not expected among these
Groups because the activities of these two sectors were considered compatible.
Finally, the suitability of Group VIII was related to conservation and agriculture
and cattle ranching, so con(cid:143) icts among these sectors were predicted ((cid:142) gure 7).

Figure 6. Land suitability groups for the Costa Norte de Nayarit, Mexico.

The error matrix of the land suitability map layer consisted of the eight groups
and (cid:142) ve land cover classes (table 3). The overall error was acceptable ( p 5 0.18 ).
High errors of commission were detected for Groups IV (suitable for aquaculture),
which was mistaken with terrestrial natural cover (suitable for conservation) , and
Group VII (suitable for conservation) , which was mistaken with agricultural and
cattle ranching areas. Likewise, a high error of omission was generated by confusion
of tropical deciduous forest and scrub cover, that was assigned to agriculture instead
of conservation. In the computation of commission error for Group IV, the cover
type of agricultural and cattle ranching was considered as correct because the

proximity of the corroboration sites to (cid:143) ood prone areas was within the range of
the inherent inaccuracy of videography positional recordings.

5. Discussion and conclusions

The land suitability assessment for the Costa Norte exempli(cid:142) es how eŒective
public participation in land suitability assessments can be attained. Although four
sectors were identi(cid:142) ed as relevant in the study region, emphasis was given to locating
appropriate sites for shrimp farming projects. The rationale was that most of the
environmental con(cid:143) icts in the region would be generated by a governmental program
for aquaculture development. Such an emphasis was congruent with previous
experiences on the negative eŒects of shrimp farming on wetland ecosystems and
their prevention (Snedaker et al. 1988, Larsson et al. 1994, Flaherty and
Karnjanakesom 1995 ).

was a laborious process. During the participatory planning workshop, a combination
of lectures and group dynamics techniques were used to solicit the opinions of diverse
stakeholders. But, it was precisely during the group dynamics sessions that the
di(cid:141) culties in participatory planning di(cid:141) cult became evident. Understanding of the
assessment’s objectives varied among stakeholder representatives; for some of them,
it was especially di(cid:141) cult to grasp the analysis because of their lack of
formal
education. Furthermore, the ability for conceiving decision rules was uneven among
participants and sectors (for example, representatives of aquaculture investment
groups had more technical training than representatives of organizations that
grouped poor farmers and ranchers). For some of the representatives, problems in
devising decision rules were related to geographical scale (for example, the need for
a regional suitability assessment when their immediate problems were local), and to
the type of issues that could be examined spatially (for example, corruption or
(cid:142) nancial problems of producers issues had to be excluded from the GIS analysis).

Nonetheless, results show that, despite its di(cid:141) culties, the participatory planning
workshop was a practical mechanism for incorporating the sectoral issues and
concerns into the assessment. The role of experts was important in the whole
procedure because they acted as technical advisors to the sectors. As the participatory
planning workshop progressed, such technical advise enabled the representatives to
be aware of the importance of the issues, and assured the sharing of basic information
among the sectors. Moreover, the specialists were able to interpret the requirements
for each activity into a format useful for the spatial analysis. Later, the interaction
of the specialist group and the core group ensured an appropriate representation of
the sectors in the suitability analysis.

Another important factor in the process was the simplicity of the GIS-application
developed for this case study. The multi-criteria/multi-objective procedure allowed
the stakeholder representatives and decision makers to understand land suitability
assessment, and enabled them to reach a general agreement on the results. It was
uncomplicated for the public to grasp the weighted linear combination because of
its plain arithmetic, while understanding the numerical classi(cid:142) cation was intuitive,
although mathematically complex. Furthermore, the risk of misinterpreting the stake-
holders¾ criteria or introducing biases into the analysis was diminished by the whole
procedure because it fostered strict de(cid:142) nitions of issues and variables.

Therefore, the overall results of the Costa Norte case study corroborate some of
the assertions about how to achieve credibility in land suitability assessments. First,
they con(cid:142) rm that the team of experts needs to perform a double role in a land
suitability assessment: (1) providing technical advises to the stakeholder representat-
ives ( Vasseur et al. 1997), and (2) complementing the data needed for the assessment
(Xiang et al. 1992, Teng and Tzeng 1994). Second, they demonstrate that public
participation is enhanced whenever the decision rules are derived from consensus
among experts and non-experts (Banai-Kashani 1989). Finally, they show that the
spatial analysis have to be simple to be understandabl e by the stakeholders, while
being rigorous at the same time to serve as a con(cid:143) ict resolution tool (Eastman
et al. 1993 ).

The relatively high accuracy of the land suitability groups map layer (table 3)
indicated that the resulting land suitability groups were not sensitive to the critical
assumption of the multicriteria model (namely, that the ranked criteria could be
used as an interval scale). The errors of commission could be explained by the
classi(cid:142) cation errors in the vegetation and land use map, which was derived from the

147

interpretation of a satellite image. Indeed, it was di(cid:141) cult to diŒerentiate the patches
of natural cover from agricultural (cid:142) elds.

Then, we can conclude that, at the scale and purpose of the Costa Norte study,
our approach was superior than alternative methods, such as the Analytical
Hierarchy Process (AHP; Banai-Kashani 1989, Biodini and Giavelli 1992, Pereira
and Duckstein 1993, Malczewski et al. 1997), or fuzzy logic (Eastman 1993).
Although these methods generate an interval scale, we found that the time needed
to apply these techniques exceeded the duration of the workshop. Also, the cognitive
processing demanded by the AHP surpassed the quali(cid:142) cation of the majority of the
stakeholders. Similarly, fuzzy logic would have been more complicated to grasp by
the participants of the workshops.

The method used in the Costa Norte assessment for identifying homogeneous
land units resembles other numerical classi(cid:142) cation approaches (Mart´n de Agar et al.
1995, Betters and Rubingh 1978, Omi et al. 1979, Ferguson and Bowen 1991, Calvo
et al. 1992, Klijn et al. 1995 ). However, most GIS applications base the clustering
procedures on sampling subsets of pixels when applied to large raster layers, a rather
ine(cid:141) cient technique. In contrast, the divisive polythetic partitioning method used in
Costa Norte is capable of classifying entire raster layers without size limitations
(Noy-Meir 1973, Pielou 1984, Bojo´rquez-Tapia et al. 1994 ).

Under conditions similar to those of Costa Norte, numerical classi(cid:142) cations should
be preferred over other approaches for delineating land suitability groups, such as
the capability analysis (Cendrero and Diaz de Tera´n 1987, Cendrero et al. 1993 ),
neural networks, and fuzzy logic (Banai-Kashani 1990, Yin and Xu 1991, Xiang et al.
1992 ). The (cid:142) rst adjusts a Normal statistical distribution to the resulting land suitabil-
ity scores and, then, a set of (cid:142) ve land suitability classes are derived using the
standardize d deviations from the mean. Thus, the division among classes is subjective,
and detrimental for attaining credibility in a participatory planning framework. With
respect to the latter approaches, they are just as e(cid:141) cient as the more commonly
used multivariate statistical procedures in depicting land suitability groups, with the
disadvantag e that they require specialized software.

Land suitability assessments have to be based on an appropriate spatial frame-
work such as administrative units (i.e. municipalities, land tenure, or natural protected
areas), cartographic divisions (i.e. grids, sections, or quarter sections), and ecological
components (Cendrero and Diaz de Tera´n 1987, Steiner 1991, Yin and Xu 1991).

Nonetheless, for our case study, any of those spatial frameworks would have
been inadequate for the integration of the biophysical and socioeconomic factors
related to the infrastructure, structure, and superstructure elements of
land-use
decisions (sensu Smith et al. 1995). Administrative units and cartographic divisions
did not correspond to ecological components, and socioeconomic data were limited
to administrative units. Moreover, biophysical data about ecological components
were available at a small scale. For these reasons, we decided to use each pixel as
the spatial framework in the Costa Norte assessment. This facilitated the tasks of
integrating data from diŒerent sources (i.e. biophysical and socioeconomic), and
locating areas of distinct land suitability for a sector within administrative or ecolo-
gical units ((cid:142) gures 6 and 7). In the end, when con(cid:143) icting objectives were predicted
simultaneously in a land suitability group, the activity with the highest suitability
score was recommended, or a set of environmental guidelines were prescribed for a
negotiated solution.

We acknowledge that the political climate may in(cid:143) uence the (cid:142) nal adoption of a

land suitability assessment. Certainly, the implementation of any assessment rests
on predominating institutional and political circumstances. In the case of the Costa
Norte de Nayarit, the results of the land suitability assessment have not been
implemented by state and federal authorities. Therefore, it has not been possible to
evaluate formally the acceptance of the results by the o(cid:141) cial sectoral representatives.
Nevertheless, the worth of a land suitability assessment as a strategic planning
tool at the regional level must be evaluated in light of the following premises (Hollick
1981, Bojo´ rquez-Tapia and Ongay-Delhumeau 1992 ): (1) resulting land use patterns
must be in the best interest of the group at large, (2) environmental planning is a
continuous process of narrowing steps and monitoring studies, and related to this,
(3) regional planning is a prerequisite for better environmental planning at a larger
scale, primarily environmental impact assessments (EIA) of individual projects.

Regarding the (cid:142) rst premise, a contribution of the Costa Norte case study to the
whole group betterment resides in the identi(cid:142) cation of a set of land suitability groups
generated from sectoral preferences. Thus, it can be asserted that the ensuing land
use pattern maximizes consensus among the stakeholders, and minimizes con(cid:143) ict
between competitive land uses. This assertion is supported by a follow-up telephone
survey, which was conducted to ascertain indirectly the usefulness of the Costa Norte
assessment. The following potential users of the case study were questioned: Wetlands
International, a non-governmenta l organization for conservation, one private
investor in aquaculture developments, three consultants in environmental impact
assessments, local delegates of Secretar´a de Medio Ambiente, Recursos Naturales y
Pesca (SEMARNAP, the federal environmental ministry responsible for imple-
menting land suitability assessments) , academics of the Universidad Auto´ noma de
Nayarit (the state university) , and state and municipal o(cid:141) cials.

The survey showed that Wetlands International was using the land suitability
groups for designing conservation strategies for the region; the private investor and
the consultants were incorporating the results in their projects; academics were
recommending the implementation of assessment; and state and federal environ-
mental authorities were using the study for initiating compromises with other admin-
istrative agencies. Therefore, it is evident that the land suitability assessment has
been used by some relevant sectors to base decisions over allocation of land uses.

In relation to the two last premises, it is evident that information generated at a
regional scale is of limited use for decision making at the local level. More complex
models are needed to sanction projects at that level and they should be included in
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) (Bojo´ rquez-Tapia and Ongay-Delhumeau
1992, Hollick 1981). Given the circumstances of the study region, combination of
data at the regional and local scales is especially important for preventing the
problems generated by localized shrimp farming endeavors. Thus, Costa Norte de
Nayarit land suitability assessment furnishes a set of environmental guidelines that
must be incorporated into the respective EIA. To that end, a prototypical GIS-multi-
media application is available to assist the authorities in the integration of the land
suitability assessment and EIA (Moreno-Sa´nchez et al. 1997), so that the appraisal
of projects at the local scale can be based on information and considerations at the
regional scale as well.

Consequently, it can be concluded that the Costa Norte de Nayarit land suitability
assessment provides a technical basis for sensible land-use planning at the regional
level. Because of the prevailing political factors in the region, it is the foundation of
a legal framework towards environmental con(cid:143) ict resolution, and for improving the

decision making process in the region. When linked to the mandatory EIAs, the
land suitability analysis will enable the local and federal authorities to have access
to both regional information and local data for appraising individual projects and
inhibiting environmental con(cid:143) icts.

The experiments described in this article combine response time measurements and eye
movement data to gain insight into the users’ cognitive processes while working with
dynamic and interactive maps. Experts and novices participated in a user study with a
‘between user’ design. Twenty screen maps were presented in a random order to each
participant, on which he had to execute a visual search. The combined information
of the button actions and eye tracker reveals that both user groups showed a similar
pattern in the time intervals needed to locate the subsequent names. From this pattern,
information about the users’ cognitive load could be derived: use of working memory,
learning effect and so on. Moreover, the response times also showed that experts were
signiﬁcantly faster in ﬁnding the names in the map image. This is further explained by
the eye movement metrics: experts had signiﬁcantly shorter ﬁxations and more ﬁxations
per second meaning that they could interpret a larger part of the map in the same amount
of time. As a consequence, they could locate objects in the map image more efﬁciently
and thus faster.

Introduction

Usability engineering (UE) and user-centred design (UCD) are well-known themes in the
domain of software development. UCD involves the user in the subsequent stages of the
product’s development to enhance the usability of the ﬁnal product. By involving the user
in the production process, the effectiveness of the product – or its quality towards the user –
improves drastically. ISO 9241-11, Guidance on Usability, deﬁnes usability as ‘the extent
to which a product can be used by speciﬁed users to achieve speciﬁed goals with effective-
ness, efﬁciency and satisfaction in a speciﬁed context of use’ (Earthy et al. 2001, p. 554).
In this context, effectiveness is related to how well a user can accomplish a certain task: the
accuracy and completeness. Efﬁciency is related to how fast a user can accomplish a task:
learning time and completion time. Finally, satisfaction is related to the user’s preferences.
A frequently used UE technique to examine, among others, the layout of user interfaces
and websites is eye tracking (e.g. Goldberg et al. 2002, Jacob and Karn 2003, Schiessl et al.
2003, Fleetwood and Byrne 2006, Djamasbi et al. 2010). This technique allows ‘tracking’
the movements of the participant’s eyes: his point of regard (POR) is registered at a certain

sampling rate. From this long list of (x, y) positions, eye movement metrics such as ﬁxations
and saccades can be derived. A ﬁxation is a stable POR during a certain time span and
indicates that the user is interpreting the content at that location. A saccade is a rapid eye
movement between two ﬁxations. The velocity of these saccades (up to 500◦/s) is such
that the user cannot interpret any content at these moments. A scanpath is a succession of
ﬁxations and saccades (Rayner 1998, Poole and Ball 2006, Duchowski 2007).

The use of eye movements in user studies is not a new method. One of the ﬁrst exper-
iments dates back to the end of the nineteenth century. These initial techniques differ
signiﬁcantly from the ones used today. They were rather invasive with direct contact to
the participant’s eyes. The ﬁrst application of eye movement studies in the ﬁeld of UE
is described in the work of Fits et al. (1950), who used motion picture cameras to study
the movements of pilots’ eyes (Jacob and Karn 2003). Also in cartography, the use of
an eye-tracking method to study the user’s attentive behaviour is not new. Inspired by
the systematic use of eye movement recordings in research ﬁelds that involve graphical
communication, such as psychology and art, Jenks (1973) studied the scanpaths of users
looking at a dot map. Based on this initial study, a number of follow-up studies were con-
ducted during the 1970s and the ﬁrst half of the 1980s (e.g. Dobson 1977, Castner and
Eastman 1984, 1985, Steinke 1987).

After these ﬁrst studies, researchers recognized the method’s applicability, but con-
cluded that no new knowledge could be derived from it. Consequently, the use of eye
movements almost disappeared in cartographic user studies after 1985. Jacob and Karn
(2003) give three main reasons why the use of eye movements in usability research did not
get widely accepted. First, the technical problems related to capturing the actual eye move-
ments were very challenging in the past and produced rather inaccurate and thus unreliable
results. Second, eye trackers produced huge amounts of raw data from which meaning-
ful metrics need to be extracted. This labour-intensive and often manual data extraction
complicated and slowed down the analysis signiﬁcantly. Third, the interpretation of the
extracted data was very difﬁcult. Furthermore, some doubts emerged regarding the link
between a person’s eye movements and his spatial attention during a visual search: we can
all move our attention without moving our eyes (Rayner 1998, Montello 2002).

More recent studies, however, show that eye movements are critical to interpret visual
information efﬁciently while performing a complex visual and cognitive task (Henderson
and Hollingworth 1998, Duchowski 2007). The eye-tracking systems have also evolved
drastically during the last decades with new and more accurate techniques that have a
smaller impact on the participant himself. Moreover, the cost of the eye-tracking devices
has decreased considerably during this period. The software packages that come with these
eye trackers today allow more ﬂexible extractions of meaningful metrics related to ﬁxations
and saccades (Rayner 1998, Goldberg, et al. 2002, Jacob and Karn 2003, Poole and Ball
2006, Duchowski 2007). Not only what a user is looking at but also how long, how often,
the length and speed of the saccades and so on can be discovered. As a consequence, more
detailed insight into the user’s cognitive processes can be derived from these measurements
in comparison with the initial eye movement studies. Even more, during these last decades
psychological research on cognitive processes linked with visual search has received much
attention, which resulted in new and more detailed theories regarding cognitive cartography
(e.g. MacEachren 1995, Slocum, et al. 2001, Harrower 2007).

At the same time, the maps have also experienced a tremendous evolution during this
period: from a static, analogue format to highly dynamic and interactive digital maps.
In 2001, Kraak deﬁned a rough web map classiﬁcation based on how the map is or can
be used. He distinguished between static and dynamic maps on the one hand and between

1775

view-only and interactive maps on the other hand. Kraak (2001, p. 3) noted that ‘The
most common map found on the WWW is the static view-only map.’ Today, however,
almost every map on the Internet is ‘clickable’ and produces dynamic responses such as
animations or videos.

The recent evolutions in cognitive cartography and the improvement of the eye-tracking
method have resulted in a renewed interest in eye movement research in the ﬁeld of
cartography during the past few years, but so far, only a few studies have been conducted.
Brodersen et al. (2001), for example, investigated the symbology of analogue (paper)
topographic maps. Fabrikant et al. (2008) and Coltekin et al. (2010, 2009) recorded par-
ticipants’ eye movements to evaluate animations and interactive interfaces related to the
presentation of maps. These initial eye movement studies (using the improved eye-tracking
techniques) prove the suitability of eye movement research for investigating how users
perceive these highly dynamic and interactive maps of the current digital era. Montello
(2009) also recommended the recording of eye movements as a future method for cognitive
GIScience research.

The goal of this article is to extend these eye movement studies to obtain insight into
the user’s cognitive processes while working with these dynamic and interactive maps:
construction of the mental map, cognitive load, learning effect after interactions and so on.
These observations can be compared with the cognitive load theory that Harrower (2007)
and Bunch and Lloyd (2006) described in relation to the interpretation of map animations.
The cognitive load theory distinguishes between two main memory types: working
memory and long-term memory. The working memory is used when new information
is processed. It cannot contain large amounts of data or store it for a long time. In this
case, the user’s long-term memory is addressed. Consequently, information has to be trans-
ferred from the working memory to the long-term memory. This learning task is achieved
by linking the current (active) information in the working memory with knowledge and
skills already stored in the long-term memory. When necessary, information stored in the
long-term memory can be retrieved and used again in the working memory. The cognitive
load theory describes three types of cognitive load that have an inﬂuence on the working
memory and the learning task. The intrinsic cognitive load is related to the complexity of
the visual information: complex information is more difﬁcult to process and results in a
higher cognitive load. The second type of cognitive load, the extraneous cognitive load,
will increase due to distractions or a poor representation of the information. Finally, the
germane cognitive load is closely linked to the learning task itself: a part of the work-
ing memory is used to link the active information (in the working memory) to previous
knowledge in the long-term memory so that the active information can be passed on to the
long-term memory (Bunch and Lloyd 2006, Harrower 2007).

What is more, different users may interpret and process the same information in a
different way. Consequently, map users cannot be considered as one homogeneous group
but as different categories of users, and individual user differences have to be taken into
account. Different user characteristics of interest are gender, age, experience, background
knowledge and so on (Aykin 1989). Important and interesting differences between users
are the background knowledge and the level of experience they have with the topic under
investigation, maps in this case (Nielsen 1989, MacEachren 1995). Since the interpretation
process is closely linked to the structure and the use of the user’s memory, it is inﬂuenced
by previous knowledge. As a consequence, designers of user studies often differentiate
between expert users (high level of experience) and novice users (low level of experience)
(Nielsen 1993, Duchowski 2007, Rubin and Chisnell 2008).

This article gives an overview of the results from an experiment conducted on both
novices and experts. Since the same stimuli – screen maps in this case – are presented

K. Ooms et al.

to the two different user groups, this study has a ‘between user’ design (Nielsen 1993,
Duchowski 2007). The comparison of the results allows detecting whether experts (persons
with cartographic training and experience in interpreting maps) can interpret maps more
efﬁciently. A combination of response time measurements and eye movement data is used
to obtain insight into the participants’ cognitive processes while working with dynamic and
interactive maps.

2. Study design
2.1. Participants

The participants of the expert group were at the moment of this study employed at the
Department of Geography at Ghent University. They had obtained at least a Master’s
degree in geography or geomatics and received, both theoretical and practical, cartographic
training. In their daily job they use paper and digital maps on a regular basis. Consequently,
the expertise of this group is twofold. On the one hand, they have a substantial level of back-
ground knowledge of cartographic syntax and semiotics, and on the other hand, they are
highly experienced in working with paper and digital maps.

The group of novices were Bachelor students of the Faculty of Psychology and
Educational Sciences at Ghent University. None of them received any previous training
in cartography. The group of expert users counted 16 participants, whereas the group of
novice users 15. All participants cooperated on a voluntary basis and were Dutch speaking
(the language in which the test was presented).

2.2. Stimuli

Twenty demo maps were presented to each participant in a random order on a screen.
An example of a demo map is presented in Figure 1a. The design of these maps was very
basic and controlled. The following sections explain the reasons for this speciﬁc design.

First of all, the design had to be homogeneous within one map, without any deviating
regions in it. Second, the design of all maps had to be very similar in order to avoid users
being distracted in any way. The cognitive load related to processing the information on
these maps needed to be limited, equal for all maps and equal for all participants. In this
way, the design prevents certain users from considering a speciﬁc area on a map more
interesting or that a certain map would be more interesting than the others.

In order to keep the extraneous cognitive load limited and equal for all maps, the same
simple background image was used for every map. The simplest background image of a
map consists of a small number of polygons (e.g. three) ﬁlled with an unobtrusive pastel
colour. These polygons can present, for example, countries or thematic regions. Adding
extra objects to this background (such as lines or more polygons) would increase the com-
plexity of the map, resulting in a higher intrinsic cognitive load for the user. Using one or
more striking colours could distract the users, resulting in a higher extraneous cognitive
load. Too many or different map elements across the 20 trials would distract the partici-
pant from the actual task. The complexity of the information presented on the foreground
also needed to be limited and balanced across the 20 maps. The number of elements, types
of elements and their distribution on the map contribute to the intrinsic cognitive load of
the user: the complexity of the visual information. Therefore, only point objects and their
associated labels were depicted, which may represent cities or points of interest. The num-
ber of labels depicted was similar for all the 20 maps. The actual visualization of these
objects has an inﬂuence on the extraneous cognitive load. In order to keep this load low,
all labels were visualized in the same colour (black) and only a limited level of hierarchy

was present in the labels. Some labels were presented in capitals, but most were depicted
in a normal font. The names in the task were rather short (consisting of, on average, ﬁve
characters) and not written in capitals. What is more, the distribution of cities (points) and
their names originated from existing regions in order to present realistic situations to the
participants. However, these regions were selected in such a way that none of the Belgian
participants was likely to recognize one of the regions. Familiarity of a participant with a
certain region would mean that the participant has already stored some information about
that region in his long-term memory. The germane cognitive load for this participant is

inﬂuenced differently when viewing the familiar regions: he can make a direct link between
the working memory and the long-term memory.

After a ﬁxed interval of 50 s, a user interaction was simulated: a horizontal pan oper-
ation to the right. As a consequence, a part of the initial view remained visible on the left
side of the screen and a new part of the map emerged on the right. This ﬁxed time interval
ensures that all users will look at the initial map for the same amount of time. Figure 1b
depicts such a view after the interaction.

It was chosen to use a basic map design in the test to avoid as many inﬂuencing, possibly
confounding, factors as possible. This map design also implies that the value of expertise,
related to the expert users, is limited. Using very complex maps with multiple layers of
information might be prejudicial for the novice map users because they do not have the
same background knowledge and level of experience. In extension to this study, new exper-
iments can be designed with an increased level of map complexity, related to the objects
themselves or to the visualization of the objects. This way it can be discovered which ele-
ments or what level of complexity has a profound impact on the different types of users:
novices and experts. However, this extension is beyond the scope of this article.

2.3. Procedure
On the right side of each map, a list of ﬁve names was presented (see Figure 1a). The
participant was asked to locate these names in the map image and to push a button each
time a name was located. The participant could use any of the buttons at the bottom of
the joystick in order not to distract him from the task or to discriminate between left-
handed and right-handed people. Each of these button actions resulted in a response time
measurement. In order not to disturb the cognitive processes of the participants, they were
free to choose the order in which they wanted to locate the ﬁve names. According to a
previous (unpublished) study by the authors it was found that most participants could locate
these ﬁve names within 50 s. Therefore, the horizontal pan operation was simulated on
the screen after this time interval. As a result of this design users can anticipate when
and how the interaction will occur, which is considered a positive element: when users
perform an interaction ‘in real life’ they also know in advance when and how this will
occur. Unexpected changes in the map view, in terms of both time and direction, may
confuse the user.

During the simulated pan operation, the list of ﬁve names also changed (see Figure 1b).
Three of the initial names reappeared in the new list (at different positions) and two were
new. The user had to locate these names in the map image again and push one of the two
buttons at the bottom of the joystick to conﬁrm he had found one. When all names were
located, the user could end the trial by pushing one of the buttons on top of the joystick.

Before the actual start of the test, two demo trials were presented to the participant. The
goal of these demo trials was twofold. First, the participant could practise on the assignment
allowing him to ask any additional questions before the start of the actual experiment.
Second, he was able to familiarize with the background and general structure of the maps
used during the actual tests.

The task described above corresponds to a visual search on an image. A visual search
is a very realistic and natural operation for a map user. He is trying to ﬁnd locations, such
as cities, on a map of which he only knows the name. When exploring the surroundings of
these locations, the user will use a pan operation to visualize a larger part of the map. After
the pan operation, the user tries to orient and explore the map by locating new names and
relocating known names from the view before the interaction.

2.4. Apparatus

This study was conducted in a controlled environment: the Eye Tracking Laboratory in
the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences (Ghent University). An EyeLink
1000 eye-tracking device (Kanata, SR Research, Ontario, Canada) was used to record the
participant’s eye movements during this study. This system can sample the participant’s
POR once every millisecond. Each participant received a joystick (Microsoft Sidewinder
Plug and Play Game Pad) from which two button clusters could be used. The stimuli were
presented on a 21 inch monitor with a resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels.

2.5. Recordings

During this study, different types of recordings were obtained and combined. First,
response time measurements were obtained from the button actions. With these button
actions, the participant indicated that he found a label. However, a user could push the
button without ﬁnding a correct name. Therefore, these absolute response times were com-
pared with the eye movements. If a user was not focussing on a name from the list, the
measurement was removed from the dataset. In the analyses, the relative response times
are used: the time interval between locating two subsequent names. Hence, locating a
wrong label inﬂuences the relative response time of the next label. Consequently, these
measurements, related to the subsequent label, were also removed from the dataset.

3. Results

3.1. Response time measurements
The relative response time measurements indicate how fast a certain user could ﬁnd each
subsequent label. The overall (all labels, all users) mean (M) relative response time was
5.472 s (SD = 1.605 s). A one-way ANOVA shows that the experts were signiﬁcantly faster
at ﬁnding the subsequent labels (M = 5.227 s, SD = 1.433 s) than the novices (M = 5.595 s,
SD = 1.673 s), with F = 7.056 and P = 0.008 < 0.01. When considering only the time
intervals before the simulated interaction, a marginal signiﬁcant difference could be found
in the response time measurements (F = 3.000; P = 0.084). During this time interval the
experts’ mean relative response times were shorter (M = 5.619 s, SD = 1.462 s) than those
of the novices (M = 5.965 s, SD = 1.648 s). After the simulated interaction, the experts
were also signiﬁcantly faster at locating the names than the novices (M nov = 5.235 s,
SDnov = 1.622 s, M exp = 4.836 s, SDexp = 1.297 s, F = 4.594, P = 0.033 < 0.05).

In Figure 2, the mean response times (with their associated 95% conﬁdence intervals
(CIs)) are represented for each subsequent label. If the code of the labels starts with 1, it
means that this is one of the labels the participant had to locate before the interaction. For
example, 13 corresponds to the third label the participants found before the interaction.
A code starting with 2 corresponds to labels that had to be located after the interaction:
for example, 23 is the third label the participants found after the interaction. Figure 2
indicates that the mean response time measurements for the experts were always lower
than those of the novices, but they follow the same pattern. This pattern can also be derived
from the actual values in Table 1. Both before and after the interaction, the shortest time
interval was linked to the second label (label numbers 12 and 22). After this label was
found, the relative response times grew with each subsequent label, also both before and
after the interaction. The time needed to locate the ﬁrst label before (label 11) and after
the interaction (label 21) was always higher than for the second label. Furthermore, the

response times before the interaction were always longer than after, compared with the
corresponding label (e.g. label 13 vs. label 23; label 14 vs. label 24).

A one-way ANOVA shows for both user groups a highly signiﬁcant difference in the
mean response times before versus after the interaction (Fnov = 19.372, Pnov < 0.001;

Fexp = 16.071, Pexp < 0.001). The last columns of Table 1a and b show the results from
the statistical comparison between the corresponding intervals. These P values indicate
that, for both user groups, only the ﬁrst three corresponding intervals are signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent. For the experts, the intervals related to the fourth label showed a marginal signiﬁcant
difference, whereas no signiﬁcant difference was detected for the novices. The last corre-
sponding time interval showed no signiﬁcant difference for the two user groups. According
to Figure 2, both the expert and the novice map users show a steep increase in the response
times for each subsequent label after the interaction, which is not the case before the inter-
action (see Figure 2). Furthermore, this increase is more pronounced for the novices than
for the experts. As a consequence, the fourth and ﬁfth corresponding intervals show no
signiﬁcant difference for the novices, but a marginal signiﬁcant difference is detected in
the fourth corresponding interval of the experts.

3.2. Fixation duration

Longer ﬁxation durations can give insight into two elements: the user has more difﬁculty
with interpreting the visual input or the user considers the visual input more interesting.
In this study, the latter explanation is not considered. Because of the basic design of the
maps, it can safely be assumed that both user groups look at all maps with the same level of
interest. The longer ﬁxations measured during this study thus indicate that the user needs
more time to process the (visual) information. The overall (all labels, all users) mean ﬁxa-
tion duration was 0.225 s (SD = 0.086 s), with 0.249 s (SD = 0.080 s) for the expert group
and 0.265 s (SD = 0.094 s) for the novice group. A one-way ANOVA shows that these eye-
tracking metrics differ signiﬁcantly (F = 44.176, P < 0.001). Before the interaction, the
mean ﬁxation duration linked to the expert group was signiﬁcantly shorter (M = 0.249 s,
SD = 0.081 s) than that linked to the novice group (M = 0.260 s, SD = 0.090 s), with
F = 9.315 and P = 0.002. After the interaction, the experts had signiﬁcantly shorter ﬁx-
ations (M = 0.248 s, SD = 0.077 s) than the novices (M = 0.270 s, SD = 0.097 s), with
F = 39.858 and P < 0.001.

These measurements also indicate that, for the novices, the mean duration was numeri-
cally longer after the interaction than before. A one-way ANOVA shows that this difference
is signiﬁcant (F = 6.119, P = 0.013). For the expert users, however, the mean ﬁxation
durations were very similar during both intervals (F = 0.123, P = 0.726). An overview of
the ﬁxation durations related to ﬁnding the 10 labels is listed in Table 2. The distribution
of these measurements is depicted in Figure 3 and reveals that the mean ﬁxation durations
diverge between the two user groups with each subsequent label that was found, both before
and after the interaction. Interval 21 is an anomaly in this trend: the ﬁxation duration of the
novice group was very high, but no deviation was noticed in the expert group.

3.3. Fixation count
The number of ﬁxations a user can have per second is closely related to the duration of the
ﬁxations. If the duration of the ﬁxation is very long, the number of ﬁxations per second
will decrease. However, the combined results of the ﬁxation count and duration provide
a better insight into the user’s cognitive processes. Other elements that have an inﬂu-
ence on the ﬁxation count are the saccades. Shorter saccades may increase the number
of ﬁxations per second. The mean ﬁxation counts for each subsequent label are listed in
Table 3 and their distribution is depicted in Figure 4. The overall (all labels, all users)
mean ﬁxation count was 3.658 ﬁxations per second (SD = 0.762 ﬁx/s). Experts had a
higher count (M = 3.694 ﬁx/s, SD = 0.750 ﬁx/s) than the novices (M = 3.605 ﬁx/s,
SD = 0.775 ﬁx/s). A one-way ANOVA shows that the measurements of both user groups
differ signiﬁcantly (F = 16.716, P < 0.001). As can be derived from Figure 4, the experts
had signiﬁcantly more ﬁxations per second (M = 3.713 ﬁx/s, SD = 0.736 ﬁx/s) than
the novices (M = 3.597 ﬁx/s, SD = 0.754 ﬁx/s) before the simulated interaction, with
F = 14.726 and P < 0.001. The same goes for after the interaction: a signiﬁcantly higher
ﬁxation count for the experts (M = 3.675 ﬁx/s, SD = 0.764 ﬁx/s) than for the novices
(M = 3.613 ﬁx/s, SD = 0.796 ﬁx/s), with F = 3.940 and P = 0.047 < 0.05.

Similar to the ﬁxation durations, the number of ﬁxations per second diverged between
novice users and expert users with each subsequent interval. Equally, interval 21 of the
novice group showed a deviation in the measurement: a much higher number of ﬁxations
per second. When comparing the measurements within both user groups, no signiﬁ-
cant difference could be detected between the intervals before and after the interaction
(Fnov = 0.223, Pnov = 0.637 > 0.05 and Fexp = 1.902, Pexp = 0.168 > 0.05).

3.4. Fixation distribution

Analysing the eye movement data qualitatively and visually reveals spatial patterns in the
search behaviour of users. The location of ﬁxations indicates which part of visual stimuli
(map in this case) is of most interest to a user at a certain moment. Since this experiment
focuses on two types of users, differences in these patterns might be noticed. In Figure 5,
a number of intervals are depicted for each user group presented by a grid of nine areas
of interest (AOIs) that cover the whole map image. The number of ﬁxations in each AOI
during the mentioned time interval is presented in percentages. The darker the cell is, the
more are the ﬁxations that were registered. With this ﬁgure, the locations of ﬁxations before
the interaction can be compared with the corresponding intervals after the interaction on
the one hand and between the two user groups on the other hand. Furthermore, evolutions
in the user’s search behaviour might be visible in the subsequent time intervals.

Figure 5. Distribution of the ﬁxations of both user groups on the map image (in percentage) during
a ﬁxed time interval.

Before the interaction, the distribution of the ﬁxations was very similar between the
novice users and the expert users. During the ﬁrst second of the map’s display more than
50% of the ﬁxations were located in the middle of the map due to the drift correction: the
user had to look at a ﬁxed point in the middle of the screen and the deviation was mea-
sured. This was executed after each trial to control the quality of the current eye tracker’s
calibration. During the next few seconds, the grid of AOIs shows a higher concentration
of ﬁxations in the top row. This indicates that the users tended to start their search in the
upper part of the map. Only after 3 s, the ﬁxations seem to be more homogeneously spread
over the different AOIs and thus over the map image. During the remaining intervals, the
AOIs in the middle seem to have the lowest count, whereas the AOIs on the top right corner
always have a rather high count. A possible explanation is the list of names located on the
right side of the map, but outside the map image. When starting to search for the names,
some of the ﬁxations in the scanpath are located in the closest AOI.

After the interaction, no drift correction was executed, resulting in a more homogeneous
spread of the ﬁxation during the ﬁrst second. Similarly as before the interaction, both user
groups started scanning the upper part of the map, whereas they focussed only in a later
moment on its lower part as the higher concentration of ﬁxations in the top row of AOIs
reveals. However, in contrast with before the interaction, the novice users systematically
had more ﬁxations in the left column of the AOIs, thus on the left side of the map. The

ﬁxations of the expert users were concentrated in the middle and right columns of AOIs
and much less in the left one.

4. Discussion
The combined results of the response time measurements and eye movement recordings
allow detecting how efﬁcient and effective a user can perform a certain task related to map
use. The response time measurements give insight into how fast the participant ﬁnds a
name, and the position of the eye movement at that moment reveals if he found a correct
one. Furthermore, eye movement metrics (ﬁxation duration and ﬁxation count) give more
detailed insight into the users’ cognitive processes while performing a visual search. This
insight explains the results of the response time measurements related to the cognitive load
theory. The ‘between user’ study design allows differentiating between both user groups:
Does the background knowledge and experience have an inﬂuence on the user’s cognitive
processes?

For both user groups, the same trend was visible in the response time measurements
for each subsequent label. The smallest time interval was associated with the second label
(12 and 22), but not with the ﬁrst label (11 and 21). This ﬁrst longer interval may be
explained by the orientation process. The moment when a map is presented to the partici-
pant, he has to orient the map and the list of names before he can start searching on the map.
This orientation process will be longer in the initial view because the map is completely
new to the user. After the interaction, however, only part of the map is new and thus the
orientation time is reduced. After the second label, the response times increased with each
subsequent label, which may indicate an equal increase in the cognitive load. On the one
hand, the user is trying to locate a current label. This task requires the working memory to
process the active visual stimuli and link this information to the previously gathered infor-
mation (stored in the long-term memory). On the other hand, the position of previously
located labels is being processed. This process also addresses the working memory which
may increase the germane cognitive load in order to be able to transfer this information to
the long-term memory. With each new label, longer response times were measured, which
may suggest an increase in the (germane) cognitive load. The reduced response times after
the interaction may be explained by a reduced germane cognitive load. Users may ﬁnd
it easier to create links with the long-term memory. However, the response times related
to the last two labels after the interaction showed a steep increase, which was even more
pronounced for the novice users. This steep increase suggests an equally steep rise of the
novice users’ cognitive load.

The shorter response times after the interaction may indicate a learning effect: less time
was needed after the interaction because the cognitive load of the user was lower. A part of
the map the user was already familiar with remained visible after the interaction: a mental
map for this part of the map was constructed and stored in the long-term memory. After
the interaction, this mental map had to be completed with only a small part of the current
view that could be linked with the former view. These elements suggest a reduction in the
germane cognitive load after the interaction. This implies that the user could invest more
of his working memory in processing the current visual stimuli. This investment could
explain the signiﬁcantly faster retrieval of the labels in the second view.

However, the reaction times of the experts were signiﬁcantly shorter than those of
the novices. Although these differences were less than 1 s, they have to be interpreted
in the context of the study design: locating a name on a basic map. These differences
may be explained by the eye movement metrics, providing insight into the users’ cognitive

processes while working with these dynamic and interactive maps. First, the duration of
a ﬁxation may indicate the degree of difﬁculty experienced when interpreting a certain
(visual) content. The results from the experiment show that experts had signiﬁcantly shorter
ﬁxations than the novices, both before and after the interaction. This suggests that experts
had it easier to interpret the map’s content than novice users. The background knowledge
and experience of the experts might be the cause for this increased efﬁciency: previous
knowledge and habit facilitate interpreting complex visual stimuli. Second, the number of
ﬁxations per second is considered. During a ﬁxation the user interprets the visual input.
The more the ﬁxations, the more visual input the user can interpret. Consequently, the user
can interpret more content or a larger part of the map. The number of ﬁxations per sec-
ond is closely related to the duration of the ﬁxation. The results of the experiment show
that experts had signiﬁcantly more ﬁxations per second than novices, also both before and
after the interaction. As a consequence, experts could ‘scan’ or interpret a larger part of
the map image in the same amount of time and they can locate the names on the map more
efﬁciently, resulting in shorter response time measurements.

The signiﬁcantly longer ﬁxations of the novice group after the interaction were mainly
caused by the deviation of the measurement during interval 21. A peak is noticed in the
measurements, which is not the case for the expert group. The results from the ﬁxation
counts show the same peak during interval 21 for the novices but not for the experts.
Normally, longer ﬁxations are typically associated with fewer ﬁxations per second, but
this is not correct for this interval. Since this interval is situated right after the simulation,
it could be assumed that the novice map users might have been distracted by the presented
pan operation. However, this simulation does not seem to have an inﬂuence on the response
times of the experts.

The qualitative and visual presentation gives more insight into the distribution of the
users’ ﬁxations, their evolution over time and differences between both user groups. The
grid of nine AOIs with the associated ﬁxation count (in percentages) gives an overview
of the regions on the map that are of interest at a certain moment in time. Both before
and after the interaction, both user groups start interpreting the upper part of the map.
Gradually more ﬁxations are found in the middle and the lower parts of the map. Before
the interaction, there was not much difference in the distribution of the ﬁxations between
the novices and the experts. After the interaction, however, the novices tended to have more
ﬁxations on the left side of the map than the experts. The left side corresponds to the part of
the map that was already visible during the initial view (before the interaction). The novice
users seemed to be more attracted to this familiar part of the map, whereas the expert
users had a remarkably low percentage of ﬁxations in this region. This could be explained
by a better structured cognitive map of the expert group, which would make it easier to
determine whether a certain label is within the overlapping part after the interaction. They
only searched on (‘ﬁxated’) the left part of the map if a label (from the list) is located in this
region. Novices experienced more difﬁculties in determining whether a label was already
visible on the initial view and consequently searched more often in the left part of the map.

5. Conclusion and future work
The analyses described in this article reveal how users look at, interpret and search on
maps, which is essential information to understand the users’ cognitive processes while
working with these maps. This understanding is crucial to be able to create more ‘user
friendly’ or effective maps in the future, especially since animations and dynamic inter-
actions are increasingly being added to the interface of maps on the Internet. Recent

technologies allow and even support this evolution, but the limits of the end users’ cognitive
processes need to be considered. Users who are not that familiar with working on maps
might not beneﬁt from all the interaction and animation possibilities since they need more
time to interpret the content. These technical possibilities could also be used to differenti-
ate the map content according to the type of user. However, until now very little practical
knowledge has been gathered about these cognitive processes related to (dynamic and
interactive) screen maps.

The experiment described in this article is part of a larger study to obtain more detailed
insight into the cognitive processes of map users while working with dynamic and inter-
active maps. Since maps are essentially spatial objects, the statistical analysis will be
extended with a more detailed visual analysis of the eye movement. The visualization of
the users’ scanpaths might reveal patterns in the orientation and/or search behaviour, as
well as inﬂuencing factors. Furthermore, new tests are planned, using topographic maps,
that deviate even more between different user groups.

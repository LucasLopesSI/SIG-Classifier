Facility placement and associated service coverage are major concerns in urban
and regional planning. In this paper an approach is detailed for the problem of
covering spatial demand for service, where potential facilities are located in the
continuous plane. It is shown that weighted demand, represented as points, lines
or polygons, can be optimally served by a finite number of potential facility
locations, called the polygon intersection point set (PIPS). The developed
approach is an extension of a point-based abstraction of demand to more general
representations (e.g. points, lines or polygons). An empirical analysis of warning
siren siting in Ohio is carried out, highlighting the applicability of this approach.

Introduction

Facility location is a major concern in regional service analysis and planning. Of
interest is making a choice about where to site a facility in order to best serve
potential demand. Facility location problems arise in a variety of public- and
private-sector contexts (Daskin 1995). For example, local governments need to
decide where to locate public libraries and schools to achieve maximum social
benefits. In the private sector, retail outlets wish to capture market share and
optimize revenue, while manufacturers are interested in reducing costs in acquiring
raw materials.

selection, and there have been various attempts to categorize the range of

Mirchandani and Francis 1990, among others). A major distinction has been
discrete versus continuous (or planar) siting methods. Whereas discrete approaches
assume that the locations of potential facilities are known in advance, continuous
approaches allow facilities to be located anywhere in space. Thus, continuous space
methods can be thought of as supporting strategic decision-making. In this research
we are interested in maximizing demand covered by a specified number of facilities,
allowing facilities to be located in continuous space, similar to the planar coverage
problem detailed in Church (1984). The motivation here is emergency warning siren
siting, where the facilities are the sirens and service coverage is based on sound
transmission from the siren. Thus, given a fixed budget, the question is where to
place sirens in order to provide the greatest coverage of a regional population. In

contrast to the approach of Church (1984), we are interested in the coverage of more
complex spatial objects/features, not just points.

A confounding issue is representing geographic space in facility location models.
Traditionally, space and associated demand for service has been conceived to be
discrete points (Bennett and Mirakhor 1973, Miller 1996, Mirchandani and Francis
1990, ReVelle 1991). In part this has been to keep representation simple, but also
points serve as central locations for areas, or as towns or cities depending on the
geographic scale of analysis. Miller (1996) has raised the issue, however, of whether
facility location approaches relying on only point-based representations of space are
too simplistic given capabilities to represent more complex vector objects like lines
and polygons in geographic information systems (GIS). In fact, Murray and O’Kelly
(2002) highlight representation issues in coverage modeling, showing that reliance
on a point based abstraction of a region could lead to an over-estimation of actual
coverage provided to a region using a location model. Given this, there is a need for
coverage modeling approaches capable of serving points, lines or polygons, as
suggested by Miller (1996).

In this paper the interest is to optimally cover point, line or polygon features
representing demand for service in a region, allowing facilities to be located in
continuous space. In particular we look to extend the coverage problem of Church
(1984) to account for line or polygon features. In the next section, continuous space
coverage of demand is reviewed. The planar maximal covering problem is then
reviewed. This is followed by the introduction of a method for identifying a finite set
of potential facility locations containing an optimal solution to the continuous space
problem. An application to warning siren coverage is then detailed. Finally, a
discussion and conclusions are provided.

2. Background

Continuous space siting has been of longstanding interest. Weber (1909) was interested
in finding the location in the plane for siting a single industry or firm to minimize
transportation costs. A range of spatial optimization problems have followed, with a
major feature being that facilities are to be located in continuous space in order to
minimize or maximize objective criteria. Continuous space siting assumes that a facility
to be located can be placed anywhere in the plane. This necessarily means that one must
consider an infinite number of possible locations at which to site facilities. Often times
this has been a foreboding challenge computationally, unless special approaches could
be identified or developed. With recent advances in computational geometry and
GIScience, however, continuous space problems are increasingly being addressed in
more general planning contexts. Examples include the continuous space p-center
problem (Suzuki and Drezner 1996, Suzuki and Okabe 1995, Wei et al. 2006), where
Voronoi diagrams are relied upon for problem solution, the single facility coverage of an
area (Matisziw and Murray 2007), where the medial axis is used to delineate optimal
siting locations, and multi-objective facility siting in continuous space incorporating
GIS-based neighborhood search (Li and Yeh 2005), among others.

Central to this paper is the work on the planar maximal covering (PMC) location
problem defined originally in Church (1984),* but also detailed in Mehrez and

* Richard Church originally presented this research at the ORSA/TIMS meeting in Philadelphia, PA, April 1976 (‘The
planar maximal covering location problem’), with a manuscript produced as well. The paper was ultimately published
with the same title (Church 1984).

Stulman (1982, 1984). PMC is important because of the planning applications it can
be used to address. As an example, Mehrez and Stulman (1984) note that it can be
used for siting fire and radar stations to maximally cover demand distributed across
a service region. Along these lines, Murray et al. (2007) detail the need for
addressing emergency warning siren placement, where sirens are to be located in a
region and residents are to be covered within the audible service range of a siren.
is the
One contribution of Church (1984), and Mehrez and Stulman (1982),
developed approach for identifying a finite point set containing an optimal solution
to suitably cover point-based service demand. Specifically, continuous space is
discretized using the circle intersection point set (CIPS), as defined in Church (1984).
Given a service standard R and Euclidean distance travel, the CIPS are those points in
space where circles of radius R centered on demand locations intersect. This exploits
the circular provision of service as only those locations within the circle emanating
from the demand point can cover, or serve, that demand point. Further, it is proven
that the CIPS contain at least one optimal solution to PMC when Euclidean travel is
assumed (Church 1984, and Mehrez and Stulman 1982 as well though referred to it
only as a ‘finite candidate solution set’). Church (1984) also extends this for the case of
rectilinear travel, but again for the coverage of point-based demand. With a finite
number of potential facility placement sites to evaluate (e.g. CIPS), one can then rely
on the original discrete space maximal covering location problem (MCLP) proposed
in Church and ReVelle (1974) to solve the continuous space generalization. Again,
geometrical
insights make it possible to address the complexities of siting in
continuous space without altering the planning problem.

There has long been interest in dealing with other demand objects, like areas, in
location modeling (see Aly and Marucheck 1982, Bennett and Mirakhor 1974,
Drezner and Wesolowsky 1980, Love 1972, Marucheck and Aly 1981, Wesolowsky
and Love 1971). However, there have been computational difficulties in addressing
area (or polygon) representations of demand, limiting practical capabilities beyond
the above-noted work. In the context of coverage optimization, Benveniste (1982)
recognized the importance of being able to represent demand as polygons in a
location model, but offered no approach for doing this. Miller (1996) highlights that
much of location modeling research has only addressed point-based demand.
However, demand can be conceived of as line- and area-based as well. Line demand
object applications include street or river segments, and polygon demand objects
could be watersheds, census tracts or planning districts. A major challenge raised in
Miller (1996) is to be able to address these more complex representations of space in
location modeling. Driving this need is no doubt spatial information managed using
GIS, where spatial features are represented as vector objects, like points, lines or
polygons. Much spatial information exists to support location decision-making, so
there is a need to account for how demand is represented, rather than assume it is
only point-based.

The objective of this research is to extend the PMC to consider any vector-based
demand objects, not just points. This begins to address the spirit of what Miller
(1996) recognized as an important frontier in GIScience research, although for a
particular class of spatial optimization problem. Beyond this, as will be detailed later
in the paper, the ability to address the problem of providing maximal service
coverage to non-point-based demand, like a polygon, is needed in its own right as it
has practical use and application in urban and regional analysis (see Benveniste
1982, Li and Yeh 2005, Murray et al. 2007).

3. Problem formulation

Before proceeding, it is necessary to formally specify the planning problem of
interest. As noted previously, the idea is to extend the PMC to account for other
vector features, like lines and polygons. A useful beginning point is to first detail the
MCLP of Church and ReVelle (1974), as the PMC naturally follows. Consider then
the below notation:

i5index of demand points
j5index of potential facility locations
ai5expected service required for demand i
gi5{set of potential facilities j capable of covering/serving demand i}
p5number of facilities to site

(cid:1)

1

Xj~

0 otherwise

if potential facility j located

(cid:1)

Yi~

0 otherwise

if demand i suitably covered=served

It is worth mentioning that Church and ReVelle (1974) defined the cover set, gi, in
terms of a distance standard R, where R represented the distance that could be
traveled to suitably serve (or cover) demand. If travel is assumed to be based on
Euclidean distance, then dij is the distance from demand i to potential facility j.
Thus, formally the cover set is: gi5{j|dij(R}. The model now follows.

What has effectively been defined above is the problem of covering as much total
weighted demand as possible by positioning a given number of circles of radius R
centered on a sub-set of potential locations j. The planar version of this problem

relaxes the requirement that circles must be centered on the discrete, prespecified
potential facility locations, meaning that facilities can be located anywhere in the
plane.

Planar Maximal Covering Location Problem (PMC): Maximize point-based demand
covered by a specified number of facilities located in continuous space.

The implications of this relaxation in facility location placement are that greater
efficiency in coverage is now possible, as siting locations are no longer restricted.
That is, as much or more total coverage can be achieved for a given configuration of
facilities using the PMC. From a planning and analysis perspective, such an insight
is fundamentally important, as this establishes the greatest efficiency possible for a
particular level of infrastructure investment.

Church (1984) looked at two instances of the PMC, one the PMC with Euclidean
travel distances (PMCE) and the other the PMC with rectilinear travel distances
(PMCR). Mehrez and Stulman (1982, 1984) assumed Euclidean distance travel, so
examined the PMCE. Given the application context, extending the PMCE is of
interest in this paper, so Euclidean travel distances between locations are assumed.
The PMCE generalization can be more formally detailed. Define S as the entire
region of analysis, in which facilities can be located anywhere. Further, the index j
now is j51, 2, 3, …, p. The location of an individual facility location j is defined as a
coordinate pair, (xj, yj) g S, and represents decision variables in the model. That is,
the optimization model is to find the coordinates of where to site the p facilities in
order to maximize total demand covered. Given this, it should be obvious that gi
cannot be defined a priori as the location of an individual facility can be anywhere in
the region S, in contrast to the discrete approach of the MCLP.

The model extension in this paper is to consider demand i as points, lines or

polygons, not just points as previously assumed. Thus, the problem of interest is:

Extended Planar Maximal Covering Location Problem—Euclidean (EPMCE):
Maximize demand objects (points,
lines and/or polygons) covered by a specified
number of facilities located in continuous space, assuming Euclidean distance travel.

Given this new spatial optimization problem, the task is now finding methods for
solving it.

4. Coverage of demand

As suggested previously, demand can be abstracted spatially as points, lines or
polygons using GIS. In this section we examine coverage provision to these variants
of demand representation. The coverage properties that follow provide the basis for
solving the EPMCE.

Suppose we have a facility F located at (xF, yF) capable of providing service
extending out to a distance standard R, assuming Euclidean distance travel, with
demand represented by a point A located at (xA, yA), as shown in figure 1. The circle
represents the service area. Demand is covered when it is on or inside the circle.
Thus, we can establish the following property.

Point coverage property: Demand point A can be served by facility F if the distance
between the two points is no greater than the service standard R.

This property can be stated mathematically when service is provided to point A:

As a function of a circle defining service coverage, this condition is as follows:

Thus, geometrically a circle with radius R centered on facility F is able to cover
demand point A when it is on or within this circle.

Consider now a line segment AB representing linear demand. End points A and B
of segment AB are located at (xA, yA) and (xB, yB), respectively. Again, facility F is
capable of service out to a distance R, assuming Euclidean travel. Coverage of this
line segment is illustrated in figure 2, and the following property can be stated.

Line segment coverage property: If points A and B are both covered by facility F, any
point C located at (xC, yC) on segment AB is also covered by facility F.

The line segment coverage property can be proven mathematically. Point C on line
segment AB can be represented in terms of A and B as follows:

the squared distance from point C to facility F is bounded by:

ð13Þ

If points A and B are covered by facility F, any point C on line segment AB is also
covered. Therefore, coverage of a line segment by a circle is guaranteed when both
end points are covered, and the line segment coverage property is proven.

Line segment coverage can be extended for a polygon, or area object. Figure 3
shows polygon ABCD with area-based demand covered by facility F with service
radius R, again assuming Euclidean distance travel. ABCD consists of four line
segments, and the following property can be observed:

Polygon coverage property: If each line segment end point in ABCD is covered, then any
point on the boundary or within the polygon is also covered by facility F.

The proof of the polygon coverage property follows. If all vertices of polygon
ABCD are covered by facility F, then according to the line segment coverage
property any line segment connecting two vertices is also covered by F. Thus, the
boundary, comprised of series of line segments, is also covered by the circle centered
at F with radius R. Consider any point M inside ABCD. If a line is drawn passing
through M in any direction, this line will intersect two or more line segments
defining the boundary, AB, BC, CD, or DA. Without loss of generality, suppose the
intersection points are h1 and h2. Since these two points are on the boundary of
ABCD and the vertices (or line segment end points) are covered by facility F, point
M on segment h1h2 is also covered. Thus, the entire polygon, boundary and interior,
is covered when boundary segment end points are covered, and our proof is
complete.

5.

Identifying optimal potential facility siting locations

As noted previously, facility location is permissible anywhere in continuous space,
and the intent is to identify a configuration of facilities that provides maximal

coverage of demand for service using the EPMCE. This necessarily means that some
locations will be better than others in terms of providing coverage. The previous
section established conditions under which spatial features are covered, or served,
when demand is represented as points, lines or polygons. Thus, in this section these
properties will be used to derive a process for identifying sufficient potential facility
locations. This is done by exploiting geometrical aspects of the EPMCE. Further, it
will be shown that an optimal solution to the EPMCE is comprised of this set of
discrete points.

Before proceeding, it is worth reviewing the relationship between points, lines and
polygons as GIS-based vector objects, a discussion of which can be found in
Worboys and Duckham (2004) among others. A point is a coordinate pair. A line is
comprised of a series of coordinate pairs, where it is typically assumed that a straight
line connects consecutive coordinate pairs. Thus, a line is a series of line segments.
Finally, a polygon is also a series of coordinate pairs, but the last coordinate pair
corresponds to the first coordinate pair thereby enclosing the polygon. Thus, a
polygon is also a series of line segments. Mathematically these definitions are:

Point:
Line:
Polygon:

(x, y)
{(x1, y1), (x2, y2), …, (xn, yn)}
{(x1, y1), (x2, y2), …, (xm, ym), (x1, y1)}

Thus, points and line segments are fundamental components of traditional vector
objects.

In terms of developing a solution approach for EPMCE, one assumption is made
regarding the relationship between the coverage distance standard R and object size.
Here it is assumed that the size of objects i are significantly smaller than R, or
specifically R is greater than the maximum diameter of the smallest enclosing circle
for any spatial demand object.* This assumption ensures that all objects can be
suitably covered. If this is not the case, it is assumed that one can readily partition
the object(s) into smaller objects as this is a standard feature of GIS.

The previous section has detailed the conditions under which demand objects
(points, lines or polygons) receive coverage. Expanding on this, it is possible to
define the area for which placement of a facility would result in coverage of a given
demand object/feature. This is, of course, dependent upon the nature of service
provision, which in this case extends out a distance R. Thus, for point-based
demand, a circle centered on the demand point represents the area where locating a
facility would ensure coverage of this associated demand. This is illustrated in
figure 4a, where three points are depicted, A, B and C, along with their
corresponding covering boundaries, KA, KB and KC, respectively. Therefore, siting
a facility on or in KA would serve demand point A, siting a facility on or in KB would
serve demand point B, and siting a facility on or in KC would serve demand point C.
In the context of maximizing coverage, overlapping covering boundaries (e.g.
KA>KB and KB>KC in figure 4b) are important because they represent areas where
efficiencies can be achieved. Specifically, if a facility is located in an overlapping
area, multiple demand points can be covered. With this in mind, any point in an
overlapping covering area is equally as good. Thus, we can focus on particular

* Finding the smallest enclosing circle for an object, or set of points, is itself an optimization problem. It is also referred
to as a minimum circle, minimum spanning circle, smallest enclosing circle, smallest enclosing disc or a minimal
covering circle in the literature. A discussion and review of this problem is given in Wei et al. (2006).

critical points associated with the overlapping covering boundary. These critical
locations are shown in figure 4b, and are referenced as c1, c2, c3 and c4. In this case
we have four discrete locations where facility placement makes sense from the
perspective of optimization efficiency. In fact, these critical locations are the circle
intersection point set (CIPS) identified in Church (1984), and are proven to contain
an optimal solution to the PMCE.

For line-based demand, the covering region is more complex given the need to
cover an entire segment, yet remains a function of the service distance standard R.
Thus, the covering boundary is a spatial object, likely comprised of line segments,
arcs and curves. An example for two line segments is shown in figure 5a. Demand
along line segment AB can be suitably covered if a facility is located in or on KAB
and demand along line segment CD can be suitably covered if a facility is located in
or on KCD. No point on AB is further than R from any point on KAB. The same is
true for segment CD and KCD. As in the case of demand points, overlapping
covering boundaries (e.g. KAB>KCD in figure 5b) represent potential optimization
efficiencies. Not surprisingly, critical locations associated with intersecting covering
boundaries also exist in this case, as shown in figure 5b. These locations are referred
to as c91 and c92.

Figure 5. Line segment-based demand: (a) covering boundaries; (b) critical locations.

Finally, for polygon-based demand, the covering boundary again is more complex
than a circle given the need to cover the entire polygon, but remains a function of
the service distance standard R. Thus, again the covering boundary is a spatial
object, likely comprised of line segments, arcs and curves. An example for two
polygons is shown in figure 6a. Demand in polygon ABCD can be suitably covered if
a facility is located in or on KABCD and demand in polygon EFGH can be suitably
covered if a facility is located in or on KEFGH. As in the case of demand points and
line segments, overlapping covering boundaries (e.g. KABCD>KEFGH in figure 6b)
represent efficiencies for optimizing coverage. Not surprisingly, critical locations
associated with intersecting covering boundaries exist here as well, as shown in
figure 6b. These locations are referred to as c01 and c02.

Given these insights regarding covering boundaries, an approach can be
structured to identify a discrete set of critical locations to consider as facility sites
in solving the EPMCE, thereby reducing an infinite number of potential facility
locations to a finite and discrete set of locations. Of course, with such a discrete set
of locations, one can then use the MCLP to solve the EPMCE. Formally, the
approach for identifying critical locations is as follows:

Polygon Intersection Point Set (PIPS) Approach

coverage

locations

5.

The first step of PIPS is straightforward. Step 2, along with the assumption
regarding object size relative to covering distance R, ensures that a feasible covering
solution exists. Steps 3 and 4 are obviously central, but are readily supported by
standard GIS functionality. The covering boundary in Step 3 is effectively
structured using an overlay process, from which the associated spatial object can
be extracted. Given the assumption that R is greater than the maximum diameter of
the smallest enclosing circle of any object, the covering boundary can be obtained by
establishing a circle of radius R centered on each point, or vertex, of the object to be
covered (e.g. (x1, y1). (x2, y2), (x3, y3), …, (xm, ym)). The covering boundary results,
as it is the area of overlap of all object edge circles. Figure 7 depicts this process for a
polygon, where figure 7a shows the object, figure 7b illustrates the circles of radius R
on each object defining vertex, and the overlapping area is highlighted in figure 7c.
This overlapping area is the covering boundary for this object. Given covering
boundaries identified in Step 3, Step 4 involves finding the intersection points for
boundary pairs, if they exist.* Extracting these locations is supported by standard
commercial GIS functionality, but involves solving for intersecting points for spatial

* If an intersection point does not exist for an object i, the object vertices (Step 2) are necessary critical points.

objects. Step 5 is optional, but recognizes two issues. First, the number of critical
locations identified may be rather large. Second, some locations may in fact be
better than others in the sense that one location can cover everything that another
location can cover and more. As an example, if c1 covers all demand objects covered
by c2 plus additional objects, c1 dominates c2 as it would always be better to utilize c1
over c2 given the coverage superiority. This domination principle has long been
recognized in coverage modeling (see Toregas and ReVelle 1973), and was detailed
in the context of CIPS as well by Church (1984).

What remains is to prove that the PIPS contain an optimal solution to the
EPMCE. This proof is similar to that given in Church (1984) for the CIPS applied to
the PMCE. Consider any solution to the EPMCE and it can be shown there is
another solution, at least as good, with all facility locations in the PIPS. If some
facility location F of the solution lies outside boundary Ki, then F cannot cover
object i. Replacing F by a critical point ct on Ki, and in the PIPS, gives a solution at
least as good. If some facility location F of the solution lies inside or on exactly one
Ki, then it covers object i but no other object l. Replacing F by any critical point on
Ki yields a solution equally as good. If some facility F of the solution lies inside two
or more covering boundaries Ki, but not on any Ki, move it in any direction until it
intersects a Ki containing its original position, e.g. F,Ki. Replacing F by its new
position, F9, yields a solution at least as good. Finally, if some facility location F of
the solution lies exactly on Ki and inside one or more Kl, move it along the boundary
of Ki until it intersects one of the Kl’s or until a complete rotation is made about Ki
without encountering another boundary Kl. If a move along Ki meets a Kl, replacing
F with this intersection point, c, yields a solution at least as good. If a complete
rotation about Ki is made without encountering another boundary Kl, then Ki is
contained in Kl, and replacing F with a vertex c of object i yields a solution at least as
good. Assume that all such replacements have been made. Then, the current solution
has all facility locations in the PIPS and the proof is complete.

6. Application and results

The EPMCE is applied to site emergency warning sirens in Dublin, Ohio (figure 8).
Omnidirectional sirens with a maximum effective range of 976 m are to be sited.
Rated performance standards indicate that a siren’s electromagnetic (acoustic)
waves propagate in straight lines uniformly in all directions, so Euclidean distance
travel is appropriate for representing service provision. All areas of the Dublin
region are viewed as being important to provide service to, if possible given budget
limitations. Figure 8 depicts the region as a ‘regular’ tessellation of 255 polygons,
where mostly square polygons 5006500 m in size reflect potential demand for
service. Demand is assumed uniformly distributed to avoid altering the importance
of covering any particular polygon.

The analysis is carried out on a Pentium Xeon 3.0 GHz personal computer with 2
GB RAM. ArcGIS was utilized for spatial data analysis, manipulation and
processing. The PIPS approach was structured using ArcObjects, the Visual Basic
interface for accessing ArcGIS functions, and the associated EPMCE problem was
structured using PIPS and the MCLP and exported as a text file. This text file was
imported into CPLEX 8.1 and solved, with solution results exported to ArcGIS for
subsequent analysis and display.

Application of the PIPS approach to identify sufficient potential facility locations
for the EPMCE resulted in 944 sites in order to cover the associated 255 polygons.

Figure 8. Dublin region delineated as regular polygons.

Required processing time was 187.95 s. If Step 5 of the PIPS is not included to
reduce the number of identified potential facility locations, some 6288 sites would be
needed. Only 6.98 s would be necessary to identify the 6288 sites, but there are
almost seven times more sites that would need to be considered. As these additional
sites are dominated, they need not be assessed, and if included would likely require
significantly more computational effort in problem solution as we have encountered
instances where 83 times more processing was needed.

The EPMCE is evaluated for a range of investment options in providing warning
siren services, varying p from 1 to 30. Solution details and coverage provided for
each level of investment are summarized in table 1. The model has 1199 decision
variables and 256 major constraints. Table 1 shows that siren coverage ranges from
4.21% when p51 (1 siren sited) to 100% when p530 (30 sirens sited). Model solution
time is minimal, requiring at most 118.44 s in the case of p529. The coverage
tradeoff is depicted in figure 9, based upon coverage for value of p considered in
table 1. An interesting tradeoff solution is when only 20 sirens could be acquired
(p520), and is shown in figure 10. The model finds that 78.45% of demand is
suitably covered by this configuration of emergency warning sirens.

7. Discussion and conclusions

The application results demonstrate that it is possible to solve the EPMCE using
PIPS combined with the MCLP. In particular, identifying the PIPS is computa-
tionally feasible and the associated MCLP instance is relatively easy to solve using
commercial optimization software.

The implications are that this continuous space problem, the EPMCE, can take
advantage of geometrical insights to derive a tractable solution approach. Thus,
PIPS exploit the nature of service coverage to identify suitable potential facility
locations. One question then is whether another approach is possible. Certainly one
can use the MCLP to cover spatial objects, as this is done here. However, a discrete
set of potential facility sites is needed to apply the MCLP. One approach taken in
the literature is to generate a uniform pattern of points to represent potential facility
locations, as done in Current and O’Kelly (1992) for siting warning sirens. Consider
then allowing sirens to be placed at polygon vertices in figure 8. There are 186 such
vertices in this case. If an associated MCLP is solved, allowing sirens to be placed at
polygon vertices and coverage provided to polygons, one finds that the range of p
values to consider actually goes from 1 to 51. Thus, it is not until 51 sirens that all
demand areas finally are covered. This is an increase of 70% over what the EPMCE
found to be necessary for complete coverage. It should be no surprise then that
achieving 78% coverage of total demand in this case would require 34 sirens. Not
only is this more than what the EPMCE found necessary for complete coverage, but
it is 70% more sirens than the EPMCE identified to provide this level of service (i.e.
p520 shown in figure 10). Thus, one cannot expect to reasonably identify sufficient
potential facility locations when facilities can be sited anywhere in continuous space.
As a result, the PIPS approach is invaluable, both for reducing problem complexity
and achieving the greatest efficiency possible.

Figure 10. EPMCE solution (p520).

The extended planar maximal covering location problem—Euclidean (EPMCE)
was introduced to address planning situations where coverage maximization is
desired assuming Euclidean distance service travel and demand is represented as a
vector object (point, line or polygon). An approach was proposed to deal with
continuous space siting, exploiting geometric insights and demand representation.
The polygon intersection point set (PIPS) was proven to contain an optimal solution
to the EPMCE. Application results demonstrated the computational capabilities for
addressing important planning problems. Approaching this complex spatial

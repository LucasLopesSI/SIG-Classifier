Abstract
Classical multivariate analyses are based on matrix algebra and enable the analysis
of a table containing measurements of a set of variables for a set of sites. Incomplete
mapped  data  consist  of  measurements  of  a  set  of  variables  recorded  for  the  same
geographical region but for different zonal systems and with only a partial sampling
of this zone. This kind of data cannot be analysed with usual multivariate methods
because  there  is  no  common  system  of  sites  for  all  variables.  We  propose  a  new
approach  using  GIS  technology  and  NIPALS,  an  iterative  multivariate  method,  to
analyse  the  spatial  patterns  of  this  kind  of  data.  Moreover,  an  extension  of  our
method  is  that  it  can  be  used  for  areal  interpolation  purposes.  We  illustrate  the
method in analysing data concerning the distribution of roe deer weights over sev-
eral years in a reserve.

1 Introduction

For  several  years,  GIS  has  been  recognized  as  the  best  tool  to  store  and  manage  com-
pilation of spatially referenced data. Analysis of these data is often made more dif(cid:222)cult
by the fact the areal units differ among various data sets. This incompatibility arises,
for example, from the fact that data come from different sources or that studied areas
change over time (Gregory 2002). This problem is well known by GIS users and can be
solved  with  areal  interpolation  methods  (Goodchild  and  Lam  1980),  which  transform
data  from  one  system  of  areal  units  (source  zones)  to  another  (target  zones).  Areal
interpolation  methods  often  (cid:210)take  the  form  of  interpolating  the  data  from  the  source
regions  to  the  intersections  of  the  source  and  the  target  regions,  and  then  combining
these  appropriately  to  infer  the  data  for  the  target  regions(cid:211)  (Bloom  et  al.  1996).  This

implies  that  areal  interpolation  requires  that  each  areal  units  system  covers  the  whole
study  region.  If  this  is  not  the  case  two  problems  arise:  (1)  when  one  or  more  source
polygons do not intersect (at all) with the target polygons, data from these polygons will
not be transferred to the target coverage, (2) when one or more target polygons is not
intersected by a source polygon, no estimation can be made for this target polygon.

Multivariate  analysis  is  a  natural  tool  to  summarise  large  data  sets.  Standard
methods such as principal component analysis (Hotelling 1933) or spatially constrained
methods such as local or global PCA (Thioulouse et al. 1995) are commonly used with
GIS (Guisan et al. 1999, Kadmon and Danin 1997, Zhang and Selinus 1998) to identify
and represent multivariate spatial structures. Multivariate analyses are based on matrix
algebra  (singular  value  decomposition)  and  data  must  be  contained  in  a  matrix  where
each column represents a variable and each row represents a site (e.g. Greenacre 1984).
Performing  multivariate  analyses  is  then  very  restricting  because  it  requires  that  all
sites  must  be  sampled  for  all  variables.  If  it  is  not  the  case,  there  are  two  alternatives:
(1) estimation of missing values, or (2) exclusion of variables and sites containing missing
values. From these considerations, we can easily deduce that classical multivariate ana-
lysis cannot be used directly on compilation of data sets with different areal units. If each
system of areal units covers the whole study zone, a primary step of areal interpolation
can  be  performed  and  multivariate  analysis  is  then  applied  on  estimated  values.  For
other  cases  (i.e.  partial  sampling  of  the  study  zone),  it  seems  that  there  is  no  evident
solution to perform multivariate analysis.

The purpose of this paper is the analysis of incomplete cartographic data. This deals
with data collected for the same geographical region but for different zonal systems and
with only a partial sampling of this zone. The analysis of spatial variations of this kind
of  data  is  not  possible  with  usual  multivariate  analyses  because  the  data  cannot  be
entered in a variable-by-individual matrix. We propose a new methodology based on a
joint  use  of  GIS  technology  and  multivariate  analyses.  We  analyse  a  data  set  on  the
distribution of roe deer weights over years in the Chiz(cid:142) reserve (France) to illustrate the
method.  The  sampling  scheme  adopted  for  this  study  involves  that  the  sampling  loca-
tions  where  the  data  have  been  collected  are  not  considered  as  points  (like  for  most
studies on spatial data) but as polygons. Indeed, in a particular capture session, people
fenced some given forestry plots with 2—5 km of nets and animals enclosed in this area were
counted and weighed. Each year, from 58 to 79% of the area of the reserve is sampled
and the sampling scheme (and so the sampling units) changes over years (Figure 1). In
our  example,  variables  correspond  to  different  dates  and  so  we  analyse  the  temporal
variations of a spatial structure.

2 Areal Interpolation and Changes in Support

2.1 Literature Review

It is common in geographical research that areal units for which data are available are
not necessarily the  ones the  analyst  wants  to study. An answer  to  this  problem  can  be
obtained by areal interpolation (Goodchild and Lam 1980, Lam 1983) that consists of
transferring data collected originally on one set of areal units (source zones) to a differ-
ent  set  of  areal  units  (target  zones).  This  problem  is  well  known  by  GIS  users  and
various kinds of data transfer have been proposed in the literature. The (cid:210)polygon over-
lay(cid:211) (Markoff and Shapiro 1973) also referred to as (cid:210)areal weighting(cid:211) is probably the

simplest method and has become a major function of many GIS softwares (Bloom et al.
1996). Data for target zones are estimated as a weighted average (or weighted sum) of
data  for  the  source  zones  with  which  they  intersect.  Weighting  is  in  proportion  to  the
area of the zones of intersection. The (cid:210)pycnophylatic interpolation(cid:211) originally suggested
by Tobler (1979) improves the areal weighting method considering the values of neigh-
bouring  source  zones.  More  (cid:210)intelligent(cid:211)  methods,  taking  into  account  other  relevant
knowledge about the zones, have been developed. These methods are based on statistical
assumptions  providing  maximum  likelihood  estimates  of  values  for  the  target  zones.
They use the values of other ancillary variables to which the variable of interest may
be related to improve the interpolation (Flowerdew and Green 1991, 1992, 1994,
Flowerdew et al. 1991, Langford et al. 1991). Goodchild et al. (1993) present a general
framework considering many of the previously mentioned methods.

These  areal  interpolation  methods  have  been  proposed  in  the  case  of  two  systems
of areal units covering the entire study region. There is no doubt that these methods can

be easily extended to more than two zonal systems if one zonal system is chosen as the
reference. Hence, multivariate analysis could be performed on real data for the reference
zonal  system  and  on  estimation  for  other  zonal  systems.  This  approach  is  not  satis-
factory  and  introduces  biases  in  the  analysis  because  there  are  estimation  errors  for
estimated  data  (Gregory  2002,  Sadahiro  1999)  and  not  for  the  real  data  of  the
reference  areal  units.  Moreover,  areal  interpolation  methods  fail  in  the  case  of  partial
sampling  because  they  cannot  be  used  if  there  are  target  polygons  with  null  intersec-
tions. To resolve these problems, we propose to operate changes in support by de(cid:222)ning
a reference layer of spatial units that covers the whole study zone, independently of the
data. This allows preserving the symmetry of the data analysed and does not favour one
system of areal units. We adopt an approach of areal weighting but other methods could
be considered.

2.2 Spatial Linkage

We  consider  an  area  with  de(cid:222)ned  boundaries.  Some  parts  of  this  area  are  sampled
at  the  (cid:222)rst  date  (Figure  1).  For  the  next  dates  (e.g.  year  2,  year  3  . . .  ),  other  sampled
areas  can  be  different  or  can  overlap  the  previous  sampled  areas.  The  (cid:222)rst  step  of  our
procedure  is  to  create  a  reference  layer  of  spatial  units.  Administrative  units  or  some
other  kinds  of  space  partitioning  can  be  used  to  de(cid:222)ne  the  spatial  units.  In  this  paper,
we chose to de(cid:222)ne the spatial units as the quadrats of a grid. The choice of the quadrat
size is discussed below. Then, for each year, it is easy to construct neighbouring relation-
ships between the quadrats of the reference grid and the sampling areas (Figure 2).

Let us consider, for year 

 areas have been sampled. We construct a grid of

  quadrats.  The  easiest  way  to  establish  a  neighbouring  relationship  is  to  construct  a

This neighbourhood matrix represents the strength of the potential interaction between

matrix is to take into account the area of overlap between sampling areas and quadrats.

3 NIPALS Analysis

NIPALS (Nonlinear estimation by iterative partial least squares) is an algorithm, which
is at the root of PLS regression. Wold (1966) presented this algorithm under the name
of NILES (Nonlinear estimation by Iterative Least Square) in the case of PCA. NIPALS
allows  performing  a  PCA  (principal  component  analysis)  with  missing  values  without
deleting individuals with missing data or estimating the missing data. The algorithm
is  iterative  and  based  on  successive  linear  regressions  (Tenenhaus  1998).  A  general
presentation of the NIPALS algorithm is given in Wold et al. (1987). The method is shown
in schematic form in Figure 3 and the algorithm used for NIPALS analysis with missing
data is de(cid:222)ned as follows:

measurements of variable (Xi) and neighbourhood matrix (Ai) are used to compute the aver-
age for each quadrat. A new table crossing quadrats and years is then created in binding all

In this way, NIPALS allows a user to perform PCA with missing values without estimat-
ing or deleting empty records. As for classical PCA, NIPALS allows the user to compute
row (th) and column (ph) coordinates as well as an eigenvalue for the h-th axis:

A  PCA  of  table Z  with  the  NIPALS  algorithm  aims  to  (cid:222)nd  a  row  score  that  is  a  com-
promise of the different spatial patterns observed for all variables (i.e. years).

4 Application: Spatio-temporal Variation of Roe-deer Weights

This  study  was  carried  out  in  the  2,614 ha  fenced  Chiz(cid:142)  reserve  situated  in  western
France (46(cid:176) 05(cid:213)N, 0(cid:176) 25(cid:213)W). The roe deer population has been intensively monitored by
capture-mark-recapture methods since 1978 (Gaillard et al. 1993). Ten days of capture
in January and February allow 150—350 roe deer to be caught each year. In a particular
capture  session,  more  than  100  people  are  involved  and  drive  animals  into  2—5 km  of
nets,  enclosing  some  given  forestry  plots.  Most  animals  are  released  with  individual
collars and the remainder is exported.

Fawns were captured between January and February and weighed using an electronic
balance. The site of capture and the sex were noted. All information was transferred into
a GIS. Sampling areas vary from one year to another (Figure 1). Male fawns are slightly
heavier  than  female  fawns  (Gaillard  et  al.  1996),  so  adjusted  weights  for  males  were
computed with an ANOVA in order to include in the analysis all individuals captured.
The reference layer was chosen as a grid of 58 quadrats measuring 800 m on a side.
We  chose  this  size  to  be  consistent  with  the  scale  of  the  data  because  the  area  of  a
quadrat (0.64 km2) corresponds roughly to the average sampling area (0.654 km2). GIS
was used to compute the table of weight means crossing the 58 quadrats and the 6 years.
In  this  table,  there  is  more  than  6%  missing  values.  The  year  1998  was  the  poorest
sampled (10% missing values) and three quadrats contained only values for four years
out of the six total. Convergence was obtained in the NIPALS analysis and the decrease
of  eigenvalues  suggests  a  one-axis  structure  (Figure  4a).  All  years  are  positively  cor-
related  with  axis  1  (Figure  4b)  which  indicates  that  for  these  years  heavy  roe  deer  are
found in the Northeast part of the reserve whereas light roe deer are found in the South
(Figure 4c). However, coordinates of years on the correlation circle indicate that some

years (e.g. 1992) are more correlated to the common structure than others (e.g. 1998).
Reconstitution  formulae  (Equation  3)  based  on  the  (cid:222)rst  axis  of  NIPALS  analysis  were
used  to  obtain  estimates  of  the  weight  distribution  for  all  years  for  the  58  quadrats
(Figure 4c). We used GIS to perform areal interpolation (i.e. areal weighting) to estimate
weights  for  each  zonal  system  (target  zones)  from  the  grid  of  quadrats  (source  zone).
The results are satisfying if we consider that reconstitution of the data have been made
using only one axis (Figure 5). The total sum of squares of differences between observed
data  and  estimation  is  222.57  (Table  1).  There  are  obvious  differences  in  (cid:222)t  between
years  and  this  can  be  con(cid:222)rmed  by  the  values  of  correlation  coef(cid:222)cients  between
observed data and estimation per year (Table 2). The best (cid:222)t is obtained for 1992 and
the worst for 1998. This is probably due to the fact that year 1992 is more correlated
to  the  common  structure  identi(cid:222)ed  on  the  (cid:222)rst  axis  of  NIPALS  analysis  than  1998
(Figure 4b). Moreover, 1998 is also correlated with the second axis and it is evident that
the  (cid:222)t  for  1998  will  be  greatly  improved  if  the  reconstitution  is  performed  on  the  (cid:222)rst
two axes of NIPALS analysis.

Variations  of  quadrat  size  (Tables  1  and  2)  in(cid:223)uence  NIPALS  analysis.  With  the
decrease  of  the  size,  the  number  of  quadrats  and  the  percentage  of  missing  values
increase. If the number of missing values increases, then the convergence is attained with
dif(cid:222)culty and the number of iterations increases. Nevertheless, the use of small quadrats
induces  a  (cid:222)ner-scale  study  and  local  patterns  of  variations  can  be  detected.  Therefore,
the (cid:222)rst eigenvalue increases and estimation is better adjusted with the detection of local
patterns. This is con(cid:222)rmed by the fact that global correlation coef(cid:222)cients decrease as the
quadrat  size  increases.  Year  1992  is  always  the  best  (cid:222)tted  whereas  lowest  correlation
coef(cid:222)cients  were  produced  for  years  1993,  1998,  and  2001.  This  con(cid:222)rms  results
obtained for a size of 800 m and suggests a more sophisticated spatial structure than a
one-axis structure for these years. In our example, the in(cid:223)uence of the quadrat size on
the results is minor because the structure observed in the roe-deer weights distribution
is simple and strong and is detected easily at each spatial scale.

5 Discussion and Conclusions

Our  approach  requires  that  the  user  specify  a  reference  layer  of  spatial  units.  These
spatial  units  are  the  statistical  individuals  in  the  NIPALS  analysis.  The  choice  of  this
layer  can  be  induced  by  the  data  but  in  most  cases,  the  user  must  create  this  space
partitioning  and  so  the  simplest  way  is  to  create  a  grid  of  quadrats.  The  choice  of  the
size of quadrats has to be consistent with the spatial scale of the study. In our case, the
area  of  quadrat  is  roughly  the  area  of  sampled  plots.  Moreover,  the  size  of  quadrats
in(cid:223)uences the number of missing values in the new data table. The smaller the quadrats,
the larger the number of missing values is, because the number of intersections decreases.
If there are too many missing values, convergence of NIPALS will not be attained. In the
other way, the use of large quadrats will decrease the ef(cid:222)ciency of the method to detect local
structure and thereby the quality of the estimation. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the
choice of the size has to be decided by considering the data a priori. In our case, sam-
pling locations are polygons and so it is easy to establish the neighbourhood relationships
by considering intersection across polygons. If the sampling locations are points, the use
of  buffer  zones  or  more  sophisticated  methods  such  as  tessellation  (Green  and  Sibson
1978) can be used to assign a polygon to each sampling location and de(cid:222)ne neighbours.

Estimations of the data by reconstitution formulae are not very satisfactory but this
is  not  surprising.  Indeed,  estimations  have  been  made  using  only  one  axis  and  will  be
greatly  improved  with  more  axes.  However,  the  (cid:222)rst  aim  of  our  method  is  to  perform
multivariate analysis in the case of different zonal systems and partial sampling and not
to predict data for new locations. This approach allows us to identify the most import-
ant  structures  in  the  data  and  to  obtain  information  on  spatial  patterns  for  the  whole
study region from partial spatial data. Our method contains two steps of areal weighting
and it is evident that it can be considered for areal interpolation purposes. Nevertheless,
for this task, the estimations will be better with quadrats of small size and by using more
axes  in  the  reconstitution  formula.  Estimation  of  the  data  is  made  on  the  basis  of  the
structures  identi(cid:222)ed  by  the  (cid:222)rst  axes  of  the  analysis.  Therefore,  we  estimate  a  year  by
taking into account the global structure of all years and considering only the common

Figure 5 Estimated and observed roe deer weights. Estimates of weights are computed for
each quadrat using reconstitution formulae after NIPALS analysis. Then, these estimates are
used  to  compute  the  averages,  weighted  by  area  of  intersection,  for  each  sampled  area.
Correlations are given in Table 2

Table 1 NIPALS  analysis  of  roe-deer  weights  data  with  quadrats  of  varying  size.  The  total
number  of  quadrats  and  the  percentage  of  missing  values  is  given  for  each  quadrat  size.
Moreover, the (cid:222)rst eigenvalue and the number of iterations from NIPALS analysis are noted.
The error sum of squares (ESSQ) between observed data and estimation computed using (cid:222)rst
axis of NIPALS analysis and GIS are given

spatial variability among years. Hence, it is evident that the (cid:222)t will be improved if two
or  more  common  structures  were  taken  into  account.  In  this  context,  the  NIPALS
approach  can  be  considered  as  an  intelligent  areal  interpolation  method  because  for
each  variable,  the  estimation  takes  into  account  the  values  of  other  variables  de(cid:222)ning
the NIPALS axes.

In  this  study,  GIS  appears  as  the  central  part  of  a  multidisciplinary  problem.  GIS
has been used to capture, manage and display the data. The representation of the data
in the GIS has motivated new biological questions. The joint use of GIS and statistical
analyses results in the elaboration of new methodology that helps with the resolution of

biological  problems.  So,  the  integration  of  GIS  allows  us  to  improve  the  statistical
methodology  as  well  as  biological  knowledge.  GIS  users  get  to  know  spatial  analysis
tools  from  geostatistics.  Problems  related  to  the  integration  of  geostatistics  in  GIS
softwares have been discussed for some time (e.g. Anselin and Getis 1992, Goodchild
et al.  1992).  These  re(cid:223)ections  have  produced  numerous  packages  linking  geostatistics
and GIS (Bivand 2001), and GIS and geostatistics are now considered rightly as essential
partners for spatial analysis (Burrough 2001). In the same way, we think that the ana-
lysis  of  spatial  data  would  probably  bene(cid:222)t  for  the  improvement  of  the  links  between
GIS and multivariate analyses.

Abstract. The WGS84 ellipsoid is tessellated using quadrilaterals of roughly the
same size. This tiling is of general interest to global geographical information
systems, but it has special relevance to global digital elevation models based on
block averages. The simple relation between the tiling presented and the latitude/
longitude reference system makes the tiling easy to implement, and the
quadrilateral property of the cells offers regular subdivision like quadtrees. An
error analysis gives a strict bound on the difference between cell averages
calculated in plane and ellipsoidal coordinates. The mathematical results from
this investigation are general and can be applied in error analysis related to other
types of quadrilateral meshes. The grid can be easily subdivided into quadtree
blocks. The error estimate makes it possible to combine the quadtree structure
with standard two-dimensional wavelet representations.

Introduction
During the work with models over the Norwegian land and sea areas, the
authors of the present paper discovered the need for a new method to partition the
earth’s surface into cells of appropriate shape and regularity required in digital
elevation models based on wavelet representations of block averages. Partitioning
geographical data into cells is a fundamental problem of data sampling, analysis,
processing, storage, and retrieval. In Geographical Information Systems (GIS), for
example, indexing schemes are important for efﬁcient region searches, queries and
data storage (Gaede and Gu¨ nter 1998). Spatial sampling schemes and models
applied in statistics and geographical information science also require some kind of
gridding of the curved surface of the Earth. For small-area applications, the spatial
tessellation is often carried out in a plane, but for global information systems, the
spherical shape of the earth must be considered. Several global schemes of the kind
addressed are proposed in the literature (Dutton 1989, Goodchild and Shiren 1992,
Kimerling et al. 1999, Ottoson 2001, Ottoson and Hauska 2002, Bjørke et al. 2003).
Goodchild and Shiren (1992) apply a hierarchical triangular mesh, the so-called
QTM proposed by Dutton (1989). Another global tiling is the popular Digital
Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) format (NIMA 2003). DTED is based on an
evenly spaced quadrilateral grid of points. Kimerling et al. (1999) compare different

global tessellation methods and conclude that the Icosahedral Snyder Equal-Area
(ISEA) projection is the best choice for an equal-area partitioning.

The FFI grid introduced by Bjørke et al. (2003) and used by The Norwegian
Defence Research Establishment is based on a quadrilateral gridding scheme (FFI
is an abbreviation for Forsvarets Forskningsinstitutt,
i.e. Norwegian Defence
Research Establishment). Bjørke et al. (2003) investigated the regularity of the FFI
grid and showed that approximately half the cells deviate less than 10% from the
normal cell size, and only a small portion of the cells deviate more than 20% from
the normal cell size. The FFI scheme has a simple relation to the latitude/longitude
reference system, supports a matrix indexing scheme, provides variable spatial
resolution, and offers tessellation of the surface of the Earth into approximately
equal-area cells. Since there is a relation between the tessellation scheme and the
complexity of the algorithms we apply to analyse the geographical information, the
equal-area quadrilateral tessellation is attractive. The equal-area property simpliﬁes
the comparison between the different cells, the quadrilateral property of the cells
offers regular subdivision, and the matrix representation makes implementation
easy. Therefore, the grid is well suited for the representation of global digital
elevation models, for example. For the reasons addressed, we will present the FFI
grid, examine it, and demonstrate its attractive properties.

In data analysis, average values over cells can be more meaningful than point
data. For example, assume depth values measured by a multibeam echo sounder.
Since the different beams integrate the energy over some area, we can hardly talk
about the depth value in a 0-dimensional reference unit. As another example, we
can assume that we measure the relief of a terrain surface by some photogram-
metric equipment. In this case, we often talk about the height value in a point, but
since the terrain surface has some stochastic behaviour, we can ask whether it is
more informative to assign average height values to areas than to points.

Average values of real-world phenomena can be associated to cells of
appropriate size. In order to support the kind of application considered, there is
a need to deﬁne subdivisions of the cells of the FFI grid. The subdivision can follow
different schemes, but since the cells are quadrilaterals,
they can be easily
subdivided into a variable spatial resolution grid. The variable spatial resolution
can be motivated from the irregular sample pattern often generated by the data
collection equipments. Multibeam echo sounders and airborne laser scanners, for
example, are frequently used for sea-ﬂoor and topographic mapping. Several
parameters like the speed of the vessel, the beam angle, the sea depth, and the relief
of the terrain determine the distance between the sample points. Usually, we cannot
expect the kind of equipment considered to give a regular spatial distribution of the
sample points. Therefore, we have to deal with variable spatial resolution. Figure 1
shows how a typical survey with multibeam echo sounder equipment can be divided
into quadtree blocks so that each block contains maximum one data point. The
variable spatial resolution is clearly visible in the ﬁgure considered.

The purpose of the present paper is to:

1. introduce the FFI grid;
2. examine the properties of the FFI grid as a basis for assigning average values

3. demonstrate how the FFI grid supports variable spatial-resolution-data

to the cells and their subcells;

structures.

2. Grid deﬁnition

The FFI grid is a global tessellation of the ellipsoid, based on ‘constant area’
quadrilaterals. Grid cells are almost
rectangular with dimensions between
1/261 nm (nautical miles) and 161 nm. The structure of the grid is similar to
the DTED grid, but the FFI grid has a more uniform cell size than DTED. The
FFI grid was ﬁrst presented in Bjørke et al. (2003). We will repeat the most
important details here.

We start with a coarse partitioning of the ellipsoid, using 30‡ sectors drawn
along meridians, and bands, which are areas between two different latitudes. The
intersection between a sector and a band is called an i-block (intersection block);
see ﬁgures 2 and 3.

Each i-block is divided into cells using regular subdivision. All cells have the
same height (one arc minute/nm). The width of a cell is approximately one nautical
mile at the lower latitude boundary of each band and decreases towards the upper
latitude boundary.

There are two criteria for determining the height of each band: (1) the width of
the cells along the upper boundary should not be smaller than a certain percentage
of a nautical mile; and (2) the height of the band, in minutes of latitude, should be
divisible by eight. A collection of eight by eight cells (ﬁgure 3) is called an o-block
(oct-block). These blocks form a coarse-scale representation that can be used,
among other things, to navigate the data. There are roughly two million o-blocks
on the ellipsoid, which is in the same order of magnitude as the number of pixels on
current computer screens.

Exactly how narrow the cells are allowed to become at the upper boundary is

shown in the second column of table 1. The numbers are based on a factorization of
the number of minutes in a 30‡ sector. The largest factors (closest to unity) are used
for the lower latitudes. As a result, no cell between the equator and 75‡ has an area
of less than 80% of an ‘‘ideal’’ 161 nm cell. The table also shows the horizontal
number of cells within each band and the exact location of the boundaries between

30‡ sector is divisible by eight for all bands from the equator up to 89‡52’, meaning
that there are unbroken meridians in the grid for every 3‡45’.

The reference frame of the grid is WGS 84. This system deﬁnes an ellipsoid,

which is an oblate spheroid, that can be written in a standard form:

intersection areas between the latitude bands and the 30‡ longitude sectors. The ﬁgure
illustrates two i-blocks.

The latitude w on an ellipsoid is deﬁned as the angle between the normal vector
on the surface of the ellipsoid and the horizontal plane; see ﬁgure 4. To ﬁnd the
rectangular coordinates of the corresponding point, we make use of the following
result from differential geometry. A normal vector to the ellipsoid is given by the
gradient of g:

The calculations are made easier if we make use of the rotational symmetry of

the ellipsoid and ﬁnd the coordinates in the plane y~0 ﬁrst.

Using equations (3) and (4), we can now solve for r(0, w):

To include the l variation in the formulas, we only need to rotate r(0, w) around

the z-axis. Thus, r(l, w)~Rl r(0, w), where

We call (l, w) the projected coordinates.
The next goal is to calculate the area of the cells. To do this, we need an
expression for the surface element dS. Consider a small rectangle in the (l, w)-plane
with side lengths Dl and Dw. The image of this rectangle on the ellipsoid is a curved
rectangle with sides that are approximately equal to Lr
Lw Dw. The area
spanned by these two vectors is given by the length of the cross-product of the two
vectors. Taking the limit, we ﬁnd the surface element:

These formulas are important in their own right, but we will use them mainly

for calculating averages.

Let a data set on the ellipsoid be represented by the scalar function f. Using
the ellipsoidal latitude and longitude as parameters, we can write f~f(l, w). Let
Me denote the average value of f on the ellipsoid, and Mp the average value
in the projected domain; both values calculated over a rectangular region
R~(l1, l2)6(w1, w2). The formula for the average on the ellipsoid is

The important quantity is the difference |Me2Mp|. If this number is small, it
means that we are allowed to interpret the averages resulting from calculations
carried out in projected coordinates as true averages on the ellipsoid. The ﬁrst step
toward obtaining a bound is to factor out the mean value of the data.

there are no rapid oscillations. This means that h’ behaves roughly like a cosine

We have chosen to write this formula as a product of three terms, each with its

own interpretation. The ﬁrst term is related to the topography of the data set. Large
variations give larger errors. The third term depends only on the size of the grid
cell. The second term measures how the grid degenerates towards the poles. Since
h0 (cid:1)ww(cid:4) (cid:5) tends to zero as (cid:1)ww approaches p/2, it would appear that the formula is singular
at the poles, but this is not so. The point (cid:1)ww will always be located approximately
half way between w1 and w2, and will only be close to p/2 for very small rectangles.
The effects of the terms cancel each other out, so the product is actually bounded.
To illustrate the use of the formula, let us look at a grid cell located at a latitude
of 60‡. We have h0 (cid:1)ww(cid:4) (cid:5)&1=2. The height of a cell is one minute of arc, which means
that w22w1~p/10800. If we have extreme terrain with a height difference of 1000 m
inside the cell, the error in the average value is still less than 15 cm. For a subcell
with height and width 1/8 of a nautical mile (c. 230 m), the error is less than 2 cm,
even with terrain variations of up to 1000 m inside the cell. This shows us that the
errors in the representation caused by interpretation of projected averages as true
averages are generally smaller than, sampling errors, for example. Therefore, for
practical purposes, a representation based on the FFI grid can be considered free of
projection errors.

4. Wavelet quadtrees

As an example of how the error analysis can justify the use of simple algorithms,
we show how to construct efﬁcient wavelet-based quadtrees on cells. Efﬁciency here
means both that models with different spatial resolutions should be easily accessible
within the structure and that the size of the model should be small.

As we said at the beginning of the paper, the spatial resolution of a data set can
vary within the domain. We do not want to throw away information in areas of
high spatial resolution, and we do not want to create the impression of a uniform
high resolution in a data set by using interpolation in low-resolution areas. The
solution we have found to this problem is to combine the FFI grid with a regular
quadtree structure on each cell. Figure 5 shows an easy-to-implement quadtree
structure with a typical numbering scheme: values are stored left to right, and only
for end nodes.

A better strategy for multiresolution terrain models is to store level by level. If

we need to generate models for each level of spatial resolution, we will also have to
assign values to the branch nodes, and this increases the amount of data that needs
to be stored; see ﬁgure 6. It seems that by insisting on a multilevel structure, we
have had to give up some of the ‘efﬁciency’ of the representation. This is, however,
only apparent. If, instead of storing average values for each node in ﬁgure 6, we
store Haar wavelet coefﬁcients, we end up with a multilevel structure that requires
exactly the same number of values to be stored as the original model. At each node,
we know the average value. To ﬁnd the average values of the four subcells, we need
only three numbers describing how the subcell averages deviate from the average
value of the cells combined.

If all sub-cells had the same size, the average value over the combined cell would
be exactly the arithmetic mean of the four subcell averages. Since the subcells in
fact are not the same size, the algorithm might need to be modiﬁed. But, as our
error analysis showed, the projection error is negligible over each cell, so no change
is necessary.

This short example is only meant as an illustration. The Haar transform is
certainly not the best wavelet transform; approximations are piecewise constant,
and coefﬁcients decay too slowly to give any real compression. But, for variable
spatial resolution data, the transform works well. If we want to use better, i.e.
smoother and more efﬁcient, wavelets we need data sets with a uniform resolution
over larger areas. With average interpolating wavelets, it is still possible to use the
same quadtree structure, but at each node there will be a block of wavelet
coefﬁcients instead of only one value.

Bruun and Nilsen (2003) give details on the Haar transform and average
interpolating wavelets, as well as information on how to implement the wavelet
quadtrees.

5. Conclusions

We have shown how the system of grid cells in the FFI grid covers the whole
globe with cells of approximately the same size. The relation between the FFI grid
and the latitude/longitude system is simple, the grid system supports a matrix
representation, and the grid supports variable spatial resolution data structures, e.g.
quadtrees. The simple relation between the FFI grid and latitude/longitude system

A constant-area quadrilateral grid

makes the tiling easy to implement, and the approximately equal area property of
cells makes the grid attractive in analysing geographical information, i.e. if we
assume there is a relation between the tessellation scheme and the complexity of the
information. For the reasons
algorithms we apply to analyse the geographical
addressed, we claim that the grid is well suited for the representation of global
digital elevation models, for example.

Since average values of the real-world phenomena can be associated with cells of
for example heights of a digital elevation model, we have
appropriate size,
demonstrated how the FFI grid can be subdivided. The subdivision we have
proposed is based on a quadtree scheme. The quadtree provides a variable spatial
resolution, and it is therefore well suited in cases where the underlying data set is
not regularly sampled. The subdivided cells are not exactly rectangular, but an error
analysis shows that for practical purposes, we are allowed to treat the grid cells as if
they were rectangular. The rectangular quality of the grid is attractive in wavelet
representations of global digital elevation models, for example. In the wavelet case,
the rectangular property of the grid leads to simple and efﬁcient algorithms. An
example demonstrates how the FFI grid and the quadtree structure can be utilized
in a wavelet representation of a global digital elevation model.

The error analysis gives a strict bound on the difference between cell averages
calculated in plane and ellipsoidal coordinates. The method is general and can be
applied to obtain similar estimates for other quadrilateral grids.

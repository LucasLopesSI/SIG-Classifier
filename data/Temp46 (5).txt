(Received 17 July 2012; ﬁnal version received 6 October 2012)

Geomorphometric parameters (slope, aspect, valley depth, and areal density of cones)
derived from a moderate resolution digital elevation model with a grid spacing of
100 m are used in an attempt to interpret the tectonic/structural features related to sur-
face deformation in the Auca Mahuida volcanic terrain (Neuquén Basin, Argentina).
The Auca Mahuida (2.03–0.88 Ma) is the southernmost volcanic ﬁeld of the Payenia
volcanic province, in the Andean foreland. The foreland is subjected to an E–W
compression related to the eastward migration of the N–S striking thrust front of the
Andes. The geomorphometric analysis indicates that the Auca Mahuida consists of a
basal, E–W elongated lava ﬁeld with monogenic vents and a summit, polygenic, also
E–W elongated, cone. A N100◦E striking fault controls the southern ﬂank of the ﬁeld,
which is also affected by scarps related to erosional and gravity-controlled processes.
The drainage network shows a pseudo-radial pattern around the summit cone, and
the Auca Mahuida’s deepest valley is structurally controlled by a NNW–SSE striking
fault affecting the sedimentary basement. The volcanic ﬁeld lies on a NE to E dipping
substratum. The areal distribution of the monogenic cones is consistent with ascent of
magmas along E–W striking fractures, and with elastic models of a pressurized hole
(magma chamber) subjected to an E–W compression. At Auca Mahuida, the ascent
of melts from the mantle is controlled, in the overriding crust, by tectonic structures
formed in response to the E–W compression of the Andes.

Introduction

1.
The Auca Mahuida (Neuquén Basin, Argentina) is the southernmost volcanic ﬁeld of the
Payenia retroarc volcanic province, which extends in the Andean foreland between 35◦
and 38◦S lat. (Figure 1a; Ramos and Kay 2006). The Payenia volcanism started during
the Miocene and mainly developed between the Pliocene and the Quaternary, to the east
of the roughly N–S striking Andes mountain front. The more recent (<5–4 Ma) activity
was characterized by basalts with a within-plate afﬁnity and minor trachybasalts and tra-
chytes (Bermúdez et al. 1993, Llambías et al. 2010). Payenia volcanism is absent south
of the Auca Mahuida volcano, where the N100◦E striking Cortaderas lineament is located
(Figure 1a and b). This major lineament, which is not related the Payenia volcanism, marks
the southern boundary of a shallower Miocene subduction (Kay et al. 2006). The Payenia

volcanism has been attributed to extensional tectonics induced by a rollback steepening
of the subducting slab under the Andes, which, in turn, promoted an upwelling of the hot
asthenosphere (Ramos and Folguera 2010, Gudnason et al. 2012). However, geophysical
data collected in the Payenia retroarc (Khazaradze and Klotz 2003, Guzman et al. 2007,
Guzman and Cristallini 2009) and structural investigations on the Payun Matru volcano
(Figure 1a; Mazzarini et al. 2008) provide evidence of an about E–W striking compres-
sion. Geomorphological and neotectonic data in the central and southern Neuquén Basin
are also consistent with a general E–W compression related to the eastward propagating
front of the Andes in the foreland throughout the Plio–Quaternary (Messager et al. 2010).
Therefore, the occurrence of within-plate basaltic volcanism in Payenia retroarc coexisting
with contemporaneous compressive tectonics represents an unusual geodynamic setting
which deserves to be investigated. The geomorphometric analysis and interpretation of
the Auca Mahuida volcanic terrain might reveal new geomorphological and structural fea-
tures of this complex region. Here, we use a moderate resolution, digital elevation model
(DEM) with 100 m grid spacing provided by Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF), by
focusing on the geomorphology and distribution of the Auca Mahuida monogenic parasitic
cones. The 100 m grid spacing DEM is appropriate for the mapping of terrain features at
a 1:250.000 map scale according to Maune et al. (2007). Therefore, the use of this DEM
allows us to characterize the large-scale geomorphic features of the Auca Mahuida related
to volcanism and/or tectonics and to evaluate the thematic information at this scale. This
is important because of the availability of 100 m spacing (3 arc seconds) Shuttle Radar
Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM for free providing almost global coverage (http://srtm.
csi.cgiar.org/SRTMdataProcessingMethodology.asp). The ﬁndings of our research might
be applied to the survey of other regions of the world covered by SRTM DEM, assum-
ing that volcanic features of appropriate scale are evident. The terrain/geomorphometric
analysis ﬁndings will be integrated with the available geophysical (seismic, breakout) and
geological information. The collected data are discussed and a geological model of the
Auca Mahuida plumbing system and of its relationships with the geodynamic context is
provided. Our study puts new constraints on the role of pre-existing structures and active
stress ﬁelds in controlling the geometry of the Auca Mahuida vents and on the geodynamic
signiﬁcance of the Payenia volcanic province.

2. Geological setting
Auca Mahuida volcanic ﬁeld (37◦44´S, 68◦55´W; Figure 1a and b) consists of an E–W
elongated lava ﬂow plateau with a summit central cone with a crater that reaches an altitude
of 2258 m a.s.l. (above sea level) (Figures 1a and 2). The plateau covers a surface of
about 2700 km2 and it is located about 40 km west of the outcropping front of the Andes
(Figure 1a). Data from wells indicate that the thickness of the lavas is over 500 m below
the central crater and decreases to 10–20 m at the periphery of the lava plateau (Rossello
et al. 2002). Several monogenic scoria and cinder cones occur on the Auca Mahuida ﬂanks
(Figure 2a).

The southern boundary of the Auca Mahuida volcanic ﬁeld coincides with the
Cortaderas lineament (see Section 1 and Figure 1b) and with the E–W elongated Añelo
depression, which represents the Andean foredeep. The age of the erupted products, which
range in composition from within-plate basalts to trachytes, is between 2.03 ± 0.3 and
0.88 ± 0.3 Ma (Kay et al. 2006, Ramos and Folguera 2010). The basaltic lava of the
plateau covers a mesa composed of sediments of the Neuquén Basin, which consist of
Permian–Triassic to Quaternary sediments (Vergani et al. 1995). According to Messager

et al. (2010) and Witte et al. (2012), an active, about E–W striking compression affects
the sectors of the Neuquén Basin located north and south of the Auca Mahuida volcanic
ﬁeld. Such compression is related to the eastward migration of the N–S striking Andean
front. Data from deep wells (Guzman and Cristallini 2009) located on the Auca Mahuida
evidence a rough E–W oriented maximum horizontal stress (Figure 1b). A similar orienta-
tion of the maximum horizontal stress characterizes the northern and central sectors of the
Payenia volcanic province including the E–W elongated Payun Matru volcanic complex,
which is located about 140 km north of the Auca Mahuida (Mazzarini et al. 2008).

The Auca Mahuida volcanic ﬁeld lies on a NNW–SSE to NW–SE striking anticline
located in the northeastern sector of the Neuquen Basin involving the complete sedi-
mentary sequence (Rossello et al. 2002, Mosuqera and Romos 2006); this sequence is
affected by NNW–SSE to NW–SE striking normal faults of the Entre Lomas half-graben
(Figure 1b; Cristallini et al. 2006). The activity of these faults mainly developed from the
Late Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous periods, with minor activity in more recent times. The
southern boundary of the volcanic ﬁeld is delimited by a system of south-facing, N100◦E

striking scarps, probably representing the surface expression of the N100◦E to E–W faults
affecting the Añelo depression (Figure 1b).

3. Geomorphometric parameters
The geomorphological analysis of the Auca Mahuida volcanic ﬁeld has been conducted
using a DEM with 100 m grid spacing (original projection: Gauss-Kruger Argentina
Zone 2, datum: Campo Inchauspe, Spheroid: International 1924, used projection: UTM
WGS84 Zone 19). The DEM is a digital ground elevation model derived by photogram-
metric techniques with a vertical accuracy of 5 m and a horizontal (circular) accuracy of
6 m. By comparison, the 90 m grid spaced SRTM-derived DEM has an absolute vertical
accuracy of 16 m and a horizontal accuracy of 20 m (Rabus et al. 2003).

Slope (◦) and aspect (dip direction, in◦ from the north in a clockwise trend) digital
maps have been constructed using a 3 × 3 pixel moving window. Valley depth (in m)
and drainage network maps have been extracted from DEM following Conrad (2006 and
references therein) and Hengl (2009) by using the SAGA-GIS software (http://www.saga-
gis.org/en/index.html). These maps are shown in Figure 3. Histograms of the distribution
of slope, aspect, and valley depth are reported in Figure 4. Shaded relief images from DEM
and panchromatic Ikonos satellite images with 0.85 m resolution have been combined to
locate the parasitic cones outcropping on the Auca Mahuida lava plateau. Ikonos images
were used to distinguish cones from other volcanic features like domes or necks. A density
map of the parasitic cones (number of cones/4 km2) is reported in Figure. 5a, along with
the azimuthal distribution (rose diagram) of the cones with respect to the Auca Mahuida
central crater. Figure 5a shows that the higher density (>5 cones/4 km2) areas are located
in the eastern, central, and western sectors of the volcano.

4. Terrain analysis
The distribution of the altitude classes shows three maxima at about 420, 600, and 960 m
a.s.l. (Figure 4a). The peak at 420 m coincides with the depressed surface located south
of the Auca Mahuida lavas, where the Quaternary deposits ﬁlling the Añelo depression
outcrop. The maximum at 600 m deﬁnes the peripheral lavas ﬂows of the southern sector
covering the mesa constituted by the Neuquén Basin sedimentary rocks. The maximum at
960 m deﬁnes the average altitude of the lava ﬂow plateau, which preferentially extends
in the eastern sectors. The topographic and slope maps (Figures 2a and 3a) show the
occurrence of an about 15 × 11 km E–W elongated summit cone with slopes up to 30◦
(on average 8–10◦) located in the central sector of Auca Mahuida, a sub-circular crater
with a diameter of about 1.8 km outcrops on the top of the cone. Lobe-like structures, i.e.,
fronts and lateral boundaries of lava ﬂows, characterize the slopes of the cone as well as
the Auca Mahuida plateau. The steeper slopes on the cone, which concentrate in the cen-
tral sector of the Auca Mahuida, are trachytic lava ﬂows, as revealed by our ﬁeld survey.
The distribution of the slope values indicates that Auca Mahuida is characterized by gen-
tle, generally <5◦ ﬂanks (Figure 4b). The aspect values show a maximum at about 90◦
and a minimum at 280◦ (Figure 4c). This suggests that the lavas ﬂowed on a sedimentary
substratum possibly tilted toward the east, as also suggested by the dip directions (east to
northeast) of the stratiﬁed sediments of the Neuquén Group below the volcano (Rossello
et al. 2002). The slope map clearly shows that the southern ﬂank of the volcano is affected
by steep, articulated scarps (Figure 3a). The southern scarp (A in Figure 3a) is charac-
terized by an amphitheatre-like rim suggesting gravity-controlled, sliding processes. The

to the central summit cone is reported in the inset; (b) simpliﬁed scheme of deformation (stress

occurrence of large blocks, observable also in the slope map at the base of the scarp, is
consistent with this interpretation. The southwestern scarp (B in Figure 3a) shows a more
articulated rim suggesting erosional processes, whereas the almost rectilinear, sub-parallel
rims of southeastern scarp bounds a NNW–SSE striking valley (C in Figure 3a). This sug-
gests a possible structural control on the formation of this morphological structure. Finally,
the easternmost and westernmost rims (D in Figure 3a) coincide with the steep slope of
the mesa constituted by sediments of the Neuquen Group and overlying lavas. The map
of the drainage network shows a pseudo-radial pattern (Figure 3a and c). A deepest (up to
320 m), NNW–SSE striking rectilinear valley affects the southeastern sector of the Auca
Mahuida (Figure 3c). Figure 5a shows that the Auca Mahuida parasitic cones concentrate
in three main zones aligned in an E–W direction. Such zones are located in the western,

central (Auca Mahuida summit), and eastern sectors of the volcanic ﬁeld. However, the
spatial and azimuthal distributions (inset of Figure 5a) of the parasitic cones depict a more
complex arrangement. Those located west of the Auca Mahuida main cone show a clear
E–W alignment, whereas the cones located to the east are arranged in three main branches
departing from the central sector of the volcanic ﬁeld toward NW, E, and SE directions. The
arrangement of such lineaments is not compatible with that of possible trap-door faults or
other caldera-like structural features.

5. Discussion
The available geological and DEM-derived data indicate that the Auca Mahuida volcanic
ﬁeld mainly consists of lava ﬂows and monogenic cones emplaced on an east to northeast
tilted mesa constituted by the sedimentary rocks of the Neuquén Group. The Auca Mahuida
polygenic summit cone controls the development of the drainage network, which shows a
pseudo-radial pattern (Figure 3a). However, the deepest, NNW–SSE striking rectilinear
valley affecting the Auca Mahuida southern ﬂank is located in correspondence of a major
fault affecting the sedimentary basement (Figures. 1b and 2a). We propose that the forma-
tion of such a deep valley is structurally controlled by this fault (Cristallini et al. 2006).
A south-facing, major normal fault with a N100◦E strike also affects the southernmost
sector of the Auca Mahuida ﬁeld (Figure 2a). This fault marks the boundary between the
Auca Mahuida volcanites and the sediments of the Añelo depression. The highest scarps
affecting the Auca Mahuida volcanic ﬁeld occur in its southern sector, at the footwall of
this major fault. The formation of these scarps reﬂects different processes including ero-
sion and gravity, as suggested by the shape of the scarp rims (see Section 4). We suggest
that these processes were active on the higher altitude, southern side of the tilted mesa
underlying the Auca Mahuida volcanites, whereas the mesa of the northern side is ﬂat,
entirely covered by lava ﬂows, and not affected by erosion- or gravity-related forms. The
general E–W elongation of the Auca Mahuida summit cone and volcanic ﬁeld, as well as
the occurrence of three, E–W aligned areas of concentrated monogenic cones suggest that
a major E–W structural discontinuity controls the shallow plumbing system. The preferred
orientation of the maximum horizontal stress from breakout analysis below Auca Mahuida
and in the northern sector of the Neuquén Basin is 88.7◦ with a 95% conﬁdence interval of
13.3◦ (Figure 1a; Guzman et al. 2007). According to these authors, such a stress orientation
mainly reﬂects plate boundary (i.e., the eastward compression from the Andes) and topo-
graphic (mountain front) forces. Independent geomorphological and structural analyses by
Cobbold and Rossello (2003) and Messager et al. (2010) indicate that the Neuquén Basin
is in a shortening phase due the eastward propagation of the Andes deformation front (see
also Khazaradze and Klotz 2003). In light of these geological and geophysical data, the
three E–W aligned Auca Mahuida areas of a higher density of parasitic cones (Figure 5a)
can be interpreted as the surface expression of a volcanism related to the ascent of mag-
mas along E–W striking fractures affecting the crust. Such fractures could represent the
southern boundary of the shallower Miocene subduction. Our conclusion is also consis-
tent with the structural model of Nakamura (1977), according to which the orientation of
elongated volcanoes and their plumbing systems follows that of the maximum horizontal
stress. A similar interpretation has been also proposed for the Payun Matru volcano, which
is located in the northern sector of the Payenia retroarc volcanic province, where an E–W
ﬁssural volcanism has been recognized (Mazzarini et al. 2008).

The occurrence of a polygenic central cone at Auca Mahuida suggests, according to the
presence of trachytic lavas on the cone ﬂanks and well data from Rossello et al. (2002), the

formation of a sill-like reservoir below the central sector of the volcanic ﬁeld. Following
Takada (1994), the development of monogenic cones and lava ﬁelds is allowed by high dif-
ferential stress in the crust, whereas that of polygenic cones is favored by lower differential
stress. The pyroclastic deposits of the Auca Mahuida cones are generally covered by the
lava ﬂows emitted from the central sector. Therefore, at Auca Mahuida, the transition from
monogenic (parasitic cones) to polygenic (central cone) volcanism could be related to a
change (decrease) in the differential stress possibly related to an increase of compression.
Unfortunately, the available geochronological data do not allow us to constraint the timing
of this transition.

According to the data from Figure 5a, the distribution of the Auca Mahuida monogenic
cones is consistent with four main fracture/dike systems within the ediﬁce: an E–W strik-
ing fracture extending westward from the central, polygenic cone, and three NW–SE, E–W,
and NE–SW striking fractures departing eastward from the cone. Results from numeri-
cal models on the stress distribution around a pressurized hole (magma chamber) within
an elastic half-space bounded to the west by a N–S rigid front (mountain front), and at
which a regional stress orthogonal to the front strike is applied (Mueller and Pollard 1977),
well reproduce the arrangement observed at Auca Mahuida (Figure 5b). These models
assume linear elasticity during dike emplacement, planar boundary, and uniform regional
stresses, and dike emplacement along a unique set of trajectories of maximum compressive
stress. These elastic models show that, to the west of the magma chamber (in our case the
Auca Mahuida polygenic summit cone), the maximum horizontal stress trajectory strikes
roughly orthogonally to the mountain front, according to the density distribution of the
monogenic vents located west of the cone. To the east of the magma chamber, the trajec-
tories form smoother curves resembling the pattern depicted by the density distribution of
vents (Figure 5b). The intensity of the stress ﬁeld is also consistent with our results from
Auca Mahuida, which show a larger number and dispersion of cones east of the central
cone, where, according to the models (Figure 5b), stress intensity decays slowly with the
distance from the vent with respect to the westernmost sector. The azimuthal distribution
of the Auca Mahuida cones (Figure 5a) is very similar to that described by the dykes of
Spanish Peak (Colorado), which, similar to the Auca Mahuida ﬁeld, is also located east of
a main N–S striking thrust system, as previously reported.

6. Conclusions
In summary, our data show that the distribution of the Auca Mahuida volcanic structures
is related to the ascent of magmas in a compressive stress ﬁeld induced by the eastward
migration of the Andean thrust front. Galland et al. (2007) also report cases of volcanoes
from the Andes (e.g., Tromen, Figure 1a) where the formation of sill-like reservoirs occurs
in compressive tectonic settings. The results of our analysis suggest an evolution of dike-
type to sill-like controlled magma emplacement at Auca Mahuida possibly induced by a
decrease of differential stress. In the light of the general models of subduction zones (see
Messangre et al. 2010 and reference therein), the steepening of the slab below the Andes
in the last 4 Ma, which, according to Ramos and Folguera (2010), is responsible for an
asthenospheric upwelling and the Payenia volcanism, does not trigger an extensional stress
in the overriding crust. As suggested by Mazzarini et al. (2008), the NNW–SSE extensional
structures occurring in the Neuquén may be interpreted as accommodation zones on the
hanging wall of regional thrust systems. At Auca Mahuida, the ascent of asthenospheric
melts from the mantle is controlled, in the overriding crust, by tectonic structures formed
in response to the E–W compression of the Andes.

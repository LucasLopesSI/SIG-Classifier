ABSTRACT
This paper aims to contribute to the area of geodemographic research
through the development of a new and novel ﬂow-based classiﬁcation
it applies an
of commuting for England and Wales. In doing so,
approach to the analysis of commuting in which origin-destination
ﬂow-data, collected as part of the 2011 census of England and Wales,
are segmented into groups based on shared similarities across multi-
ple demographic and socioeconomic attributes. k-Means clustering
was applied to 49 ﬂow-based commuter variables for 513,892 interac-
tions that captured 18.4 million of the 26.5 million workers recorded as
part of the 2011 census of England and Wales. The ﬁnal classiﬁcation
resulted in an upper-tier of nine ‘Supergroups’ which were subse-
quently partitioned to derive a lower-tier of 40 ‘Groups’. A nomencla-
ture was developed and associated pen portraits derived to provide
basic signposting to the dominant characteristics of each cluster.
Analysis of a selection of patterns underlying the ninefold
Supergroup conﬁguration revealed a highly variegated structure of
commuting in England and Wales. The classiﬁcation has potentially
wide-ranging descriptive and analytical applications within research
and policy domains and the approach would be equally transferable to
other countries and contexts where origin-destination data are disag-
gregated based on commuter characteristics.

Introduction

This paper reports on the development of a new and novel geodemographic classiﬁca-
tion of commuting ﬂows for England and Wales. Conventional modelling frameworks
have often struggled to explain complex commuting behaviour because of their
assumptions of the existence of a ‘normal’ commuter population; their focus on idea-
lised spatial structures; or their focus on aggregate ﬂow dynamics (van der Laan et al.
1998, Sohn 2005). Through the extension or re-speciﬁcation of conventional approaches,
recent research has demonstrated the continued utility of commuting-based modelling
approaches (LeSage and Pace 2008, Masucci et al. 2013, LeSage and Thomas-Agnan
2015). However, we support the contention that whilst conventional models of com-
‘. . . new approaches are
muting have potential to inform decision-making processes,

needed to advance knowledge about the social and geographical factors that relate to
the diversity of commuter patterns, if policies targeted to speciﬁc individuals or places
are to be eﬀective’ (Lovelace et al. 2014: 282).

This reasoning demands approaches that are capable of diﬀerentiating between the
individuals or groups that would beneﬁt from further targeting of
types of places,
mobility-related intervention (Ponti et al. 2013).
In this vein, Lovelace et al. (2014)
suggest that spatial microsimulation approaches might be used to better understand
the social and geographical factors that aﬀect the diversity of commuting patterns. We
contend that there is also potential for wider use of geodemographic approaches in the
analysis of commuting (Longley and Adnan 2016). As part of the 2011 census of England
and Wales, data were collected on commuting between usual residence and place of
work for people aged 16 and over who were in employment in the week before the
census. These origin-destination data are referred to as Special Workplace Statistics
(SWS) and have been previously used to examine commuting ﬂows and to visualise
place-based interactions (Rae 2016). However, to our knowledge, the SWS data have yet
to be used in the development of a geodemographic classiﬁcation of commuting in
which ﬂows, measured from an origin to a destination, are simpliﬁed into groups based
on shared similarities across multiple demographic and socioeconomic attributes.

In light of this gap, the aim of this paper is to contribute to the area of geodemo-
graphic research through the development of a new ﬂow-based classiﬁcation of com-
muting that has the potential to inform transport investment decision-making and
policy evaluation. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section
provides a background to the development of the ﬂow-based classiﬁcation drawing on
existing research in the areas of geodemographics and commuting. The third section
outlines the methodology that was used to develop the commuting ﬂow classiﬁcation
for England and Wales. In the fourth section, the application of the classiﬁcation is
explored through select examples of commuting structures and patterns. The ﬁnal
section draws the paper together by reﬂecting on the utility of the classiﬁcation for
understanding commuting and considers areas for further development.

Background: geodemographics and commuting

Geodemographic systems are created when large volumes of georeferenced data are
subjected to classiﬁcation methods to identify homogenous groups based on multiple
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics (Vickers and Rees 2011).
In the UK,
census data have formed the backbone of many small area residential classiﬁcations
since the early 1970s (Longley 2005, Singleton and Spielman 2014). Following the 2001
census of England and Wales, a small area residential classiﬁcation was developed for
the then newly introduced geography of Output Areas. In England and Wales, Output
Areas were constructed from clusters of adjacent unit postcodes and were developed to
be as socially homogenous as possible.
In developing the 2001 Output Area
Classiﬁcation, 41 variables were subjected to clustering. An innovation introduced here
was the use of k-means clustering to generate a nested classiﬁcation of broad
Supergroups and more detailed Groups (Vickers and Rees 2007). The approach used
to create the 2001 Output Area Classiﬁcation has since been used in the development of
the equivalent 2011 classiﬁcation – albeit with some modiﬁcation (Gale et al. 2016). It

has also been modiﬁed and used in the development of a geodemographic classiﬁcation
of workplace zones using 2011 census data for England and Wales. Workplace zones
were introduced in England and Wales to overcome long-standing problems associated
with representing workplace population through residential-based census units
(Debenham et al. 2003, Martin et al. 2013). As such, the 2011 workplace zone classiﬁca-
tion is based on the characteristics of the population working in the area rather than
those living there (Cockings et al. 2015).

The research reported in this paper is intended to contribute to the UK tradition of
geodemographic research through the development of a novel classiﬁcation of com-
muting ﬂows in which origin-destination ﬂow-data are segmented based on a combina-
tion of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The potential for applying
geodemographic principles to commuting ﬂow-data is considerable particularly since
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are known to inﬂuence commuting
patterns and behaviours (Green et al. 1999, Hincks 2012, Lovelace et al. 2014). It is
recognised that women tend to have shorter and more concentrated trips than men
(McQuaid and Chen 2012). Green (1997) found that in dual career households, signiﬁ-
cant care is taken to balance the needs of both workers resulting in a complex trade-oﬀ
in the length of the commute and in the choice of residential locations. McQuaid (2003)
also contends that the relationship between commuting and age might be bimodal. He
suggests that younger and older age groups have the lowest propensity to commute
over longer distances and time frames. The eﬀect of ethnicity on commuting has long
been a point of debate in the UK with evidence as to the eﬀects being mixed. Thomas
(1998) found that workers of ethnic minority groups were less willing to commute over
10 miles to work. More recently, McQuaid and Chen (2012) found that ethnicity aﬀected
the time spent commuting only for men employed full-time.

The eﬀect of socioeconomic status on commuting more generally has been exa-
cerbated by major structural economic changes over recent decades which are
understood to have intensiﬁed patterns of cross-commuting between urban centres,
suburbs and surrounding hinterlands (Hincks and Wong 2010, Hincks 2012). In this
context, full-time workers have been shown to have longer commutes and a higher
propensity to commute than part-time workers (Green et al. 1999). As educational
achievement and income increases so too does the propensity for workers to com-
mute over longer distances and times (McQuaid 2003). This is particularly notable for
professional and managerial workers when compared to lower status workers, routine
and semi-routine workers (Dargay and Clark 2012). Although access to a car is
thought to have contributed to an extension of commuting patterns and more
diverse commuting behaviour (Lovelace et al. 2014),
it has also been suggested
that longer distance commutes are diﬀerentially aﬀected by access to public transport
networks (McQuaid and Chen 2012).

The research outlined here suggests that commuter trends and behaviours are likely
to be inﬂuenced by diﬀerences in the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of
the commuter. In light of this context, the next section outlines a methodology that was
applied to segment commuters into groups based on their demographic and socio-
economic attributes, leading to the development of a new geodemographic classiﬁca-
tion of commuting ﬂows for England and Wales.

Methodology

The methodology consists of four stages and was developed using conventions that
ensure consistency with established geodemographic principles.

Stage 1: data collection and preparation

The classiﬁcation was developed using origin-destination SWS, collected as part of the
2011 census of England and Wales and released through the UK Data Service (https://
wicid.ukdataservice.ac.uk/). The data consisted of 89 variables covering 11 categories of
commuters and were released initially at Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level
for England and Wales. In 2011, there were 7201 MSOAs in England and Wales, which
form part of a nested geography of census units. At the ﬁnest scale are Output Areas.
These are nested within Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs), which in turn are
nested within MSOAs. LSOAs and MSOAs have minimum and maximum residential
population and household thresholds that help deﬁne their geographies (Table 1).

The raw origin-destination count data were processed so that all variables were
integrated into a single ﬁle. The total number of commuters within each MSOA interac-
tion (e.g. E02000001 → E02000119) formed the numerator and each characteristic
variable (e.g. male, age 16–24) formed denominators. Any ﬂow of ﬁve people or less
on the numerator variable was removed from the data set. The reason for this was
twofold. First, the eﬀects of small cell adjustment methodology are known to be most
acute for interactions with very small numbers (Stillwell and Duke-Williams 2007).
Second, the sheer number of small cells in the data set with counts between one and
ﬁve greatly increased the length of the tails of the distributions for many of the
candidate variables under consideration. Testing revealed that the distributions of
many of the variables were improved – once they had been subjected to normalisation
and standardisation – by excluding interactions of ﬁve people or less.

This preparation exercise generated a data set of 513,892 commuting interactions.
This captured 18.4 million of the 26.5 million workers (70%) that were recorded as part
of 2011 census of England and Wales. At this stage, the values of each of the variables
were still in count form. The ﬁnal step of data preparation involved converting each of
the commuter characteristic variables from counts to rates.

Stage 2: transformation, standardisation and variable selection

All 89 variables from the 11 categories of commuters were initially identiﬁed as potential
candidate variables for inclusion in the classiﬁcation (Table 2 and supplementary online
material for further details). The Shapiro–Wilk test and measures of skewness and

kurtosis were used to test for non-normal distributions. Visual outlier detection was also
undertaken at this stage. The initial analysis revealed that all the variables suﬀered from
skewness and/or kurtosis1 in a way that necessitated the use of transformation and
standardisation procedures.

The 2011 Output Area Classiﬁcation methodology was the starting point in deciding
which transformation and standardisation techniques to use (Gale et al. 2016). All of the
variables were transformed in stages using Log, Box–Cox and Inverse Hyperbolic Sine to
create three new data sets. An additional transformation approach was also tested

668

which involved fractionally ranking each variable (Conover and Iman 1981) before an
inverse distribution function was calculated. Each of the transformed data sets were
then standardised using z-scores, range standardisation and inter-decile range proce-
dures which generated three additional data sets.

Combinations of the four transformation and three standardisation approaches were
tested through examination of outliers, skewness and kurtosis values, and pilot cluster-
ing runs. These pilot runs were used to examine how diﬀerent combinations of trans-
formation and standardisation techniques conditioned the cluster outcomes, including
whether certain combinations produced small or indistinguishable cluster solutions
(Gale et al. 2016). This exercise revealed the utility of adopting a transformation proce-
dure in which all variables were fractionally ranked before being subject to an inverse
distribution function followed by range standardisation.

For the variables that lay within a normal distribution, Pearson correlation was
used to evaluate candidate variables and to minimise data redundancy within the
ﬁnal classiﬁcation. Although there is no standard rule for determining excessive
correlation between candidate variables (Vickers and Rees 2007), in this study pairs
of variables with correlations of ±0.70 were evaluated. The threshold of ±0.70 is
stricter than the ±0.90 suggested by Mooi and Sarstedt (2011) but more lenient
the 2011 Output Area
than ±0.60 threshold used in the development of
Classiﬁcation (Gale et al. 2016). Of the 89 variables that were originally subjected to
the transformation and standardisation procedures, 51 candidate variables from
across the 10 categories were identiﬁed for inclusion in the next stage of analysis.
The decision as to which variables should be excluded was taken on a case-by-case
basis determined by a combination of measures including outliers, skewness, kurtosis
and correlation (Vickers and Rees 2007).

Stage 3: k-means clustering to create a two-tier commuting ﬂow classiﬁcation

k-Means clustering is commonly used in the development of geodemographic systems
(Singleton and Longley 2009). It is a process for partitioning objects into k centroids that
are ﬁxed a priori (MacQueen 1967). In this study, objects (ﬂows) are iteratively reassigned
to clusters in an attempt to derive a series of centroids that minimise

where V is the sum of squared distances of all variables from cluster means for all
clusters, zyxi is the standardised variable for ﬂow i, variable x and cluster y, μ
yx is the
mean for variable x in cluster y, k is the number of clusters, v is the number of variables
and nk is the number of ﬂows in cluster.

Using IBM SPSS v.22, the 51 candidate variables were included in the pilot runs. One
of the limitations of k-means clustering is that case order can aﬀect the outcome of the
cluster solution. In an eﬀort to minimise these eﬀects, cluster solutions were rerun using
randomly ordered cases (ﬂows). The cluster method was set to ‘iterate and classify’ and
diﬀerent combinations of variables were tested through the systematic inclusion and
exclusion of variables. This process was intended to improve the quality of the solutions

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

that were generated. Stability was reached once the iteration of centroids between
clusters had ceased.

Following Vickers and Rees (2007), sensitivity tests were undertaken on each variable
to examine how the removal of variables aﬀected clustering. This was an extended
process that involved iterative pilot clustering of variables and an assessment of the
eﬀects of variables on cluster distances. ANOVA, cluster membership and the evaluation
of cluster solutions were used to assess sensitivity, operationalised using the procedure
outlined in Stage 4 (see below). As diﬀerent combinations of variables were included
and excluded, it became clear that two variables – living in a couple family and living in
a lone parent family – detracted from the quality of the cluster solutions. These two
variables were excluded from the ﬁnal clustering exercise leaving 49 variables for
inclusion in the ﬁnal cluster runs. These variables covered nine categories of commuter.
The variables included in each category are summarised in Table 2. Each variable is also
given a unique numeric identiﬁer that corresponds to the same variable in the radial
plots. The supplementary online material contains details of data sources, variables that
were excluded, and comments on the trends and distributions of each variable.

The initial focus of the analysis was on deriving an upper-tier classiﬁcation of com-
muting by deriving n clusters that would constitute the Supergroup layer. Once the
Supergroup conﬁguration had been deﬁned, this upper-tier data set was subjected to
partitioning into my clusters which formed a second Group layer (Gale et al. 2016).
Informed by previous research into UK-based geodemographic classiﬁcations, the
Supergroup and Group solutions were constrained by an upper-limit of 10 and 5
clusters, respectively.

Stage 4: evaluating cluster solutions

Another limitation of k-means clustering is that there are no set criteria for deﬁning the
optimum cluster solution (Brown 1991). However, there are procedures that can be used
to inform decisions as to which solution is optimal. One approach is the elbow method,
which can be used to examine variation in the distances between cluster centres. The
smaller the average distance to the cluster centre the more compact the cluster solution.
The most compact cluster solutions are those with the steepest increases in within-
cluster distance minus the solution that creates one fewer cluster (Vickers and Rees
2007). As Figure 1 illustrates, there was no evidence visually of signiﬁcant change in the
gradient of average distance from the cluster centres.

To identify the elbow, the Variance Ratio Criterion (VRC) was employed. The VRC was
introduced by Calinski and Harabasz (1974) as a way of identifying optimum cluster
solutions in hierarchical and k-means procedures. For a solution with n objects and k
segments, the VRC can be written as

(cid:4)
VRCk ¼ SSB
k (cid:2) 1

(cid:4)

(cid:5)
=

SSW
n (cid:2) k

(cid:5)

(2)

where SSB is the measure of between-segment variation and SSW is the measure of
within-segment variation as determined in relation to all clustering variables. The algo-
rithm involves calculating a ‘cumulative’ F-value for each solution which is then used to

identify the number of segments (clusters) that minimise the measure of variance. This
can be written as

ωk ¼ VRCkþ1 (cid:2) VRCk

ð

Þ (cid:2) VRCk (cid:2) VRCk(cid:2)1

(3)

The aim of this procedure is to identify a value for k which minimises the value of
ωk. In applying the VRC approach, it was necessary to identify a maximum number of
clusters that were deemed acceptable (10 for the Supergroups and 5 for the Groups).
It was also necessary to accept that the minimum number of clusters that could be
identiﬁed through the approach was three due to the condition VRC(cid:2)1 (Calinski and
Harabasz 1974).

Alongside the use of the VRC, cluster distances were evaluated using diagnostic
statistics. Tukey post hoc tests were calculated to determine whether the distances
between cluster centroids were statistically signiﬁcant and warranting their reten-
tion as separate clusters. In conjunction, one-way ANOVAs were calculated at each
step of the cluster-run. The subsequent F-values were used in the calculation of the
VRC and ωk. Where cluster distances were found to be statistically diﬀerent and ωk
minimised, the cluster solution was deemed to have been optimised. Having
identiﬁed the optimum number of clusters, a radial graph for each cluster was
created (Figure 2). Here standardised scores were plotted in relation to the grand
mean score for England and Wales. Once the optimum Supergroup conﬁguration
had been identiﬁed, the same approach was applied to the development of the
lower-tier Group solution. Finally, the radial graphs were used to proﬁle individual
clusters and to develop the nomenclature of commuting ﬂows for Supergroups and
Groups.

A geodemographic ﬂow-based classiﬁcation of commuting for England and
Wales

The two-tier classiﬁcation of commuting took the form of a 9-cluster conﬁguration at the
Supergroup level and a 40-cluster conﬁguration at the Group level. The optimum solution
for both levels was deﬁned using a combination of two measures. The ﬁrst was the point at
which the ωk was minimised. The second was the performance of each solution using the
Tukey HSD post hoc test (Table 3). The two-tier conﬁguration and the nomenclature of the
Supergroups and Groups are summarised in Table 4.

The nomenclature was derived to provide a basic signpost to the dominant
characteristics underpinning each cluster. Pen portraits were developed for the
Supergroups and Groups. The pen portraits along with the underpinning methodol-
ogy and nomenclature were opened up to scrutiny via three participatory workshops
with policymakers and academics held in Manchester and Cardiﬀ during 2016. The

What does the geodemographic classiﬁcation reveal about the structure
and patterning of commuting in England and Wales?

This section provides a brief analysis of the structure and patterning of commuting in
England and Wales.
It draws on a selection of trends in the ninefold Supergroup
conﬁguration to illustrate the potential utility of the classiﬁcation. Table 6 summarises
the structure of the Supergroup classiﬁcation with regard to the geography of connec-
tions and the concentration of the workforce within each cluster. The analysis reveals
that three clusters – Friendly Faces; Traders, Movers and Makers; and Supporting Society
– have levels of connections that exceeded the national average of 11.1%. Similarly,
three clusters recorded a level of workforce concentration that exceeds the national
average of 11.1%. Friendly Faces was the top-ranked cluster on this measure accounting
for 21.7% of the total workforce. The Consumer Services cluster was ranked second with
20.4% of the total workforce, and Typical Blue Collar Traits were ranked third with a
workforce concentration of 11.6%. This is in contrast to High Flyers (4.0%) and Techs and
the City types (6.5%), which have the lowest concentrations of workers of any of the
Supergroups. By design, the clustering procedure will have conditioned the underlying
structure of the interactions. However, the extent of the variation in the distribution of
the workforce between the diﬀerent Supergroups is indicative of the way in which

demographic and socioeconomic characteristics shape commuting behaviours and the
geography of interactions (Dargay and Clark 2012, Hincks 2012, McQuaid and Chen
2012).

This is illustrated by the variation in the composition of ﬂows based on the origin and
destination of commuters. This can be examined from the perspective of the volume of
connections (Figures 3 and 4) and the concentration of the workforce within each
In this context, the connections and workforce data

have been aggregated to the Standard Regions of England and the national boundary
of Wales. In Figures 3 and 4, Sustainable Sorts is shown to be predominantly a London-
centric set of connections at both the residential and workplace-end of the commute.
Likewise, there is a notable concentration of Techs and the City Types in London at the
residential-end of the commute. However, the concentration of these ﬂows is signiﬁ-
cantly elevated when considering workplace patterns to the extent that Techs and the
City Types outstrips Sustainable Sorts as the dominant feature of commuting into
workplaces in London.

Much of this inﬂation is seemingly a result of cross-commuting between London, the
South-East and the East of England. Other patterns are equally apparent: the concentration
of Typical Blue Collar Traits in the West Midlands and the concentration of High Flyers in
South East England are notable. However, it is also apparent that much of the commuting
across the regions outside of London and the South East leads to marginal changes in the
commuting proﬁle between the residential and workplace-ends of the commute. The
concentration of the workforce within diﬀerent Supergroups reveals a similar storyline to
the analysis of connections (Figures 5 and 6). Perhaps the most signiﬁcant diﬀerence in this
regard is that the concentration of workers in the Techs and the City Types cluster in
London outstrips that of Sustainable Sorts at both the residential and workplace-end of the
commute and therefore provides an alternative understanding of commuting when com-
pared to an analysis that only focuses on the volume of connections.

The geography of inter-zonal interactions for each of the nine Supergroups highlights the
extent of the variegation in the patterning of commuting in England and Wales (Figure 7).3
The Sustainable Sorts cluster, for instance, has a patterning of commuting that is predomi-
nantly concentrated within and around core urban areas. This reﬂects the dominance of the
likes of cycling and walking as modes of transport which constrain the distances that people
can travel on a daily basis (Hincks 2012, Rae 2016). The Traders, Movers and Makers cluster
exhibits, in contrast, greater spatial dispersion than that of Sustainable Sorts. For this cluster,

commuting extends along key motorway networks and is prevalent in areas that are tradi-
tional industrial heartlands. These include East London, South Wales, North East England, the
urban centres of the West Midlands and the M62 corridor in North West England. At the other
extreme, the Techs and the City Types cluster exhibits a largely London-centric pattern of

commuting with ﬂows extending far beyond the Greater London metropolitan region. To a
more limited extent, this cluster also features in areas outside of London, concentrated
notably on the core urban areas where employment in ﬁnance and technology is a feature
of the local economy. These include the likes of Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester and Leeds.
The ﬁnal component of our analysis considered the relationship between commuting
distance and the composition of the Supergroups (Table 7). Although only a measure of the
average straight-line distance between MSOAs calculated between-centroids, the distance
data provide a number of important insights into the utility of the classiﬁcation as a means
of understanding commuting dynamics. Five Supergroups – Supporting Society; Nurturers;
Traders, Movers and Makers; High Flyers; and Techs and the City Types – have average
commuting distances that are above the median for England and Wales. However, of these
Supergroups, only Techs and the City Types have a level of dispersion above the median for
England and Wales. In fact, with the exception of Consumer Services and Techs and the City
Types, the dispersion of all other Supergroups is below the median. The trend captured here
is consistent with the ﬁndings of previous research which suggests that workers of a higher
socioeconomic status are better able than workers of lower socioeconomic means to oﬀset
the costs of commuting and can therefore accommodate longer journeys (Dargay and Clark
2012). Commuting distance is shortest for Friendly Faces and it is also the Supergroup with
the smallest standard deviation meaning it has the most concentrated set of connections of
any of the nine Supergroups. A notable trend in the distance analysis is found in relation to
the Consumer Services cluster which has the second shortest average commuting distance
of any cluster but the second highest standard deviation. This suggests a propensity for
shorter distance commuting for the majority of commuters but an equally extended
commute for a minority.

Conclusion

This paper applies a geodemographic approach to the development of a new and
novel ﬂow-based classiﬁcation of commuting for England and Wales. The classiﬁca-
tion was derived using origin-destination SWS collected as part of the 2011 census of
England and Wales. Initially, 51 candidate variables were subjected to transformation
procedures, each of which was tested previously in UK-based geodemographic
research: Log, Box–Cox and Inverse Hyperbolic Sine (Cockings et al. 2015, Gale
et al. 2016). An additional transformation approach was also tested which involved

fractionally ranking each variable (Conover and Iman 1981) before an inverse dis-
tribution function was calculated. Each of the transformed data sets were then

Following testing, 49 variables were retained and subjected to k-means clustering.
This produced an upper-tier classiﬁcation of nine Supergroups. These Supergroups
were subsequently partitioned to derive a lower-tier classiﬁcation of 40 Groups. The
classiﬁcation was tested at three workshops with policymakers and academics held in
Manchester and Cardiﬀ during 2016 after which the preliminary nomenclature was
reﬁned in light of feedback from participants. The ﬁnal classiﬁcation incorporates

the 26.5 million workers (70%)
recorded as part of 2011 census of England and Wales.

interaction variables

The 2011 SWS are made available to users in the form of origin-destination
matrices or pairwise listings of locations for individual or simple cross-tabulated
(e.g. sex and age) attributes (Stillwell and Duke-Williams 2003). An important con-
tribution of our research is in demonstrating a novel approach that simpliﬁes these
complex commuting ﬂows by partitioning commuters based on shared similarities
across multiple demographic and socioeconomic attributes.4 The brief analysis under-
taken in this paper demonstrates the potential for the classiﬁcation to be used to
describe and analyse patterns and structures of commuting diﬀerentiated by types of
commuter. This analysis could be extended by aligning the classiﬁcation to area
taxonomies in a modelling framework that integrates local spatial context and
commuting behaviour (Longley 2012, Singleton et al. 2012). This could enable the
identiﬁcation of diﬀerent places and groups of commuters that could conceivably
beneﬁt from the targeting of discrete mobility-related interventions (Ponti et al. 2013,
Lovelace et al. 2014).

In the future, there are possibilities to extend the classiﬁcation to include interna-
tional commuting using the SWS or real-time data (Longley and Adnan 2016). As stated
in the ‘Introduction’ section, we focused on developing a classiﬁcation of commuting
ﬂows that might be used within policy-related research to inform transport investment
decision-making and policy evaluation. Our classiﬁcation excludes homeworking
because, in our view, the unique nature of homeworking – as a part or whole day
activity – and the demands it places on alternative forms on infrastructure necessitates
discrete analytical attention (Haddad et al. 2009). A separate classiﬁcation of homework
‘commuting’ would be a logical development as a complement to the classiﬁcation
outlined here. In addition, when this research was undertaken, cross-border ﬂow-data
between England/Wales and Scotland/Northern Ireland were not available but this data
has since been released through the UK Data Service. Further research could extend the
focus to derive a UK-wide classiﬁcation drawing on the principles outlined in this paper.
Likewise, the approach developed here would be equally transferable to other countries
and contexts where origin-destination data are disaggregated by commuter
characteristics.

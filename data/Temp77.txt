The Error in Longitude in Ptolemy’s Geography Revisited

It is well known that all longitudes in Ptolemy’s Geography are cumulatively overestimated, so that his map is excessively
stretched out from west to east in comparison with the modern map. In recent years, a hypothesis have been advanced that
this stretching can be explained as a result of the change in the value of the Earth’s circumference from a larger one
proposed by Eratosthenes to a lesser one by Posidonius. This explanation has two necessary presuppositions: (1) that
Ptolemy’s map is stretched out by a factor of y1.4 which coincides with the ratio between Eratosthenes’ and Posidonius’
values, and (2) that Ptolemy’s error in longitude grows almost linearly. This article argues that the situation is more
complex and nuanced. In fact, the error in longitude on Ptolemy’s map (and the stretching factor of the map, accordingly)
varies considerably depending on longitude, latitude, and region. In particular, the error grows most slowly in the Eastern
Mediterranean, which is probably due to the fact that this region was the centre of the ancient world. Therefore, Ptolemy’s
error in longitude cannot be explained by one universal cause, but only by a combination of different factors.

A HYPOTHESIS EXPLAINING PTOLEMY’S ERROR IN
ESTIMATING LONGITUDES

It is well known that the values of all
Ptolemy’s Geography (ca 150 A.D.)1 are cumulatively
overestimated, so that his map is excessively stretched out
from west to east by a factor of y1.4 in comparison with
the modern map (Figure 1)2. For example, the longitudinal
difference between the extreme points of Ptolemy’s map,
viz. the Fortunate (the Canary) Islands in the west and the
Sera Metropolis (the capital of China) in the east3, is y180u
instead of the actual y125u4. This error had a profound
inﬂuence on all subsequent history of geography up to the
eighteenth century and, in particular, indirectly inspired
Christopher Columbus’ expedition.

In recent years, a number of scholars (Rawlins, 1985;
Rawlins, 2008; Russo, 2013a; Russo, 2013b; Tupikova and
Geus, 2013; Tupikova, 2013), working independently of
one another, have come up with essentially the same
hypothesis: that the stretching of Ptolemy’s map can be
explained by the change in the value of
the Earth’s
circumference. Admittedly, Ptolemy rejected a larger value
proposed by Eratosthenes (252,000 stades)5 in favour of a
lesser one suggested by Posidonius (180,000 stades). This
change did not affect the latitudes of the key points which
were long-established and traditionally expressed in degrees.

openly points out (Cuntz, 1923, p. 110; Thomson, 1948,
p. 343; Neugebauer, 1975, pp. 667–668, 938; Tupikova
and Geus, 2013, p. 2). As a result, distances that were
previously supposed to be measured on a sphere with
Eratosthenes’ circumference were converted to angular
coordinates on a sphere with Posidonius’ circumference
and became overestimated by 40% in comparison with their
actual (modern) values6. This hypothesis rests on two general
observations. Firstly, the ratio between Eratosthenes’ and
Posidonius’ values for the Earth’s circumference coincides
with the average factor of stretching of Ptolemy’s map in
comparison with the modern one (or, in other words, the
ratio between longitudinal intervals between the same points
on Ptolemy’s map and on the modern), viz. 1.47. Secondly,
the error in longitude on Ptolemy’s map grows linearly (by
‘error’ I mean the difference between Ptolemy’s and modern
values, though this term is not quite correct in a strict sense
because the starting point for the error estimation, viz.
Greenwich, is taken arbitrarily). In other words, Ptolemy’s
map seems to be stretched out surprisingly uniformly8.

The latter observation requires additional explanation.
Why the fact that the error in longitude on Ptolemy’s map
grows linearly seems to be unusual? Firstly, there is a
general reason:
if different
regions showed distortions of different nature, because each
of them had its own speciﬁcity that inﬂuenced the accuracy
of information. Secondly, the peculiarity of Ptolemy’s map
through the juxtaposition with modern
reveals

it would be more natural,

study ‘La¨ngenfehler und Ausgangsmeridiane in alten
Landkarten und Positionstabellen’ (2005, pp. 185–189,
et passim) gives detailed graphs showing the growth of the
error in longitude on various maps of Europe, from Ptolemy

to the atlases of the nineteenth century. These graphs
demonstrate that in most cases the error grows exponen-
tially: the farther from the main meridian, the faster it grows
(regardless of precisely what meridian is accepted – Hierro,
Lisbon, Greenwich, Paris or others). The most conspicuous

exception is, according to Forstners’ observations, Ptolemy’s
map with the linear growth of the error. This peculiarity can
be considered as evidence that Ptolemy’s error in longitude
was determined by the same factor throughout the whole
map, and that this factor was of a speculative nature.

An important modiﬁcation of the considered hypothesis
has been proposed by Tupikova and Geus (2013, pp. 4–9).
All previous researchers (Gossellin, 1790; Rawlins, 1985;
Knobloch et al., 2003; Russo, 2013a; Russo, 2013b) directly

compared Ptolemy’s and the modern longitudes as if it
was longitudes (or, to put it more precisely, longitudinal
intervals) that were recalculated after the change of the value
of the Earth’s circumference. Tupikova and Geus have
pointed out that, most probably, what was recalculated were
not longitudes as such, but distances. Most of distances
known to ancient geographers were oriented at an angle to
the grid of parallels and meridians. Therefore, the recalcula-
tion of these distances would have produced a longitudinal

displacement with the factor less than 1.4, because the factor
of 1.4 is valid only for distances along parallels (i.e.
longitudinal intervals). Besides, such a recalculation of a
distance could also have produced a latitudinal displacement
of at least one of its endpoints, if its latitude was not ﬁrmly
established before. To put it generally, there is a geometric
relationship between displacements in longitude and in
latitude resulted from the recalculation of distances: the less
the former, the more the latter.

COMPARISON OF PTOLEMY’S LONGITUDES WITH
THEIR MODERN COUNTERPARTS

The aim of this article is to test the hypothesis stated above.
My contention is that a more detailed comparison of
Ptolemy’s longitudes with their modern counterparts under-
mines both observations behind it. Firstly, the growth rate of
the error in longitude on Ptolemy’s map turns out to be not
linear, but it varies considerably depending on longitude,
latitude, and region (Figures 3–5). Secondly, the ratio bet-
ween Ptolemy’s and the modern values of longitudes (i.e. the
average factor of stretching of Ptolemy’s map) considerably
diverges from 1.4 in most particular cases (Figures 6 and 7).
it is
methodologically incorrect
to combine in one sample
toponyms from different regions which do not directly

Some preliminary remarks are required. I think,

connect with one another (such as e.g. the opposite coasts of
the Mediterranean), as previous researchers did (Rawlins,
1985; Forstner, 2005; Luka´cs, n.d., de Graauw, n.d., Russo,
2013a). It would be more reasonable to divide Ptolemy’s
data into several groups, each of which constitutes a certain
natural geographical unity. It should also be taken into
account that the most accurate and detailed information
available to Ptolemy (according to his own confession: Geogr.
1.18.6) and other ancient geographers was about the coasts
of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, and, in a lesser
degree, of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. It is reasonable
to suppose that this information, in the ﬁrst place, formed
the basis of Ptolemy’s map. Therefore, the most relevant data
for comparing Ptolemy’s map with the modern one are
capes, the mouths of large rivers, and the best known and
most securely identiﬁed cities. Areas lying too far to the north
or to the south of the most explored zone should be
excluded from consideration (e.g. the north coast of Europe
and the inland parts of Africa, Arabia, India and Indochina).
Given all the above, I single out nine groups of points on
Ptolemy’s map (all latitudes given below are Ptolemy’s):

1. A ‘pivotal’ zone of the Mediterranean between the
latitudes 34 and 41u which embrace the most developed
areas of the Greco-Roman world. This zone adjoins to
the parallel of Rhodes (36u) which ancient geographers
traditionally accepted as a basis for constructing a map.

All materials are given in the appendix. Identiﬁcations of
Ptolemy’s toponyms, with few exceptions, are based on the
Barrington Atlas edited by Richard J.A. Talbert (2000) and
on the last edition of the Geography (Stu¨ckelberger and
Graßhoff, 2006)9. Modern longitudes are based on the
Google Maps. Of course, this sample is rather arbitrary and
may be composed differently. The identiﬁcations and
coordinates may also be amended. However, I believe that
possible improvements will not signiﬁcantly change the ﬁnal
outcome.

A comparison of the whole array of Ptolemy’s longitudes
with their modern counterparts shows that all points are
quite well aligned along the regression line (R250.9874)

described by the formula y51.4279xz16.425. The term
‘16.425’ is the longitude that Ptolemy would have assigned
to Greenwich. But since the reference longitude for the
comparison of Ptolemy’s map with the modern may be
chosen quite arbitrarily, and for different regions, this term
takes quite different values (Table 1), it is of no interest for
our investigation (cf. Tupikova and Geus, 2013, pp. 9–11;
Tupikova, 2013, p. 6).

The result shown on Figure 2 can create the impression
that
the considered hypothesis has been convincingly
conﬁrmed. However, this impression is deceptive. A more
sensitive method is to consider Ptolemy’s longitude error
itself as a function of the longitude of his map (Figures 3
and 4).

First of all, from Figures 3 and 4, it becomes clear that

the graphs
Moreover, the graphs of at least two groups, of the south
and the north coasts of the Mediterranean, distinctly fall
into two parts, the eastern and the western, separated by,
respectively, the cape Brachodes (38Ku on Ptolemy’s map;
today Ras Kaboudia) and the Italian Peninsula. In the
eastern parts, the error grows extremely slowly, but in the
western, the growth is rapid. This divergence becomes even
more apparent if we consider Ptolemy’s error as a function
of actual longitudes from Greenwich (Figure 5).

Therefore, it would be reasonable to consider each group
separately. Table 1 and Figures 6 and 7 compare Ptolemy’s

the factor 1.4, calculated by previous
researchers (see note 7) for the stretching of Ptolemy’s
map, proves to be ‘an average temperature in the hospital’,
i.e. a simple mean between actually much larger and much
smaller values.

The ﬁgures mostly speak for themselves, but some
comments could be helpful. Two groups of places which
play the major role in the organisation of Ptolemy’s map, viz.
groups 1 and 8, have the stretching factor notably greater
than 1.4: 1.5208 and 1.5783. For the coasts of the
Mediterranean (groups 2 and 3) this factor is closest to
1.4. But for the western and eastern parts of each group, the
values differ by 1.5 times: 1.8085 versus 1.1923 and 1.7755
versus 1.1511. Remarkably, the ‘pivotal’ zone demonstrates
considerably higher growth of the error in the Eastern
Mediterranean (i.e. south Italy, Greece, Asia Minor) than
groups 2 and 3, and even than the more northerly latitudes
(42–48u) of Europe (group 4; cf. Figures 3 and 4). It would

be more natural to expect the opposite: the core areas of the
Greco-Roman world should have shown less error than the
periphery.

Interestingly, two groups with the least stretching factor
are the eastern part of the south Mediterranean (2) and the
coasts of the Red Sea (5). It is tempting to explain this fact
by their closeness to Egypt. India most strikingly stands out
from other regions (Figures 3 and 7). On the one hand, its
western extremity is shifted to the west of the neighbouring
countries (Arachosia, Bactria, Sogdiana). On the other
hand, in India, the error in longitude grows much faster
than in the Central Asia.

The most general observation that can be made from the
above plots is that Ptolemy’s error in longitude grows most
slowly in the interval 40–80u longitude on his map or 10–
35u longitude on the modern map. This interval corre-
sponds to the eastern half of the Mediterranean from Sicily
to Syria. Therefore, it comes out that Ptolemy’s map did
not principally differ in this respect from modern European
maps considered by Gustav Forstner (2005): in both cases,

closer to the centre of civilization (the economically,
culturally, and communicatively most developed area), and
the father from this centre, the more accuracy decreased. The
only difference is that in antiquity the centre was situated
in the eastern Mediterranean (cf. similar explanation in
Tupikova and Geus, 2013, pp. 11; Tupikova, 2013, p. 7),

a preliminary nature. It should also be stressed that our
results in no way refute the hypothesis that served as a
starting point for our investigation, but only show that it
is insufﬁcient for the explanation of the deformation of
Ptolemy’s map. In particular, it cannot explain the east-west
stretching of the map with the factor more than 1.4, as, for
example, in the Western Mediterranean. I hope that this
article will become a small step towards better understanding
of Ptolemy’s map, its internal organisation and the history of
its formation.

CONCLUSIONS

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES

Our observations testify against the possibility to explain
the overstatement of longitudes on Ptolemy’s map by one
universal reason. Rather, this overstatement should be
considered as a result of a complex interaction of different
factors, only one of which can be the erroneous value of the
Earth’s circumference. Among other possible factors may
be considered a systematic overestimation of distances and
erroneous conversion of different units of distance mea-
surement into degrees.

Of course,

the results of our

investigation can be
elaborated, corrected, and contested. Rather, this investiga-
tion is intended as an invitation for further discussion and has

NOTES

1. I rely on the recent edition by Stu¨ckelberger and Graßhoff (2006).
2. A good illustration of this stretching is afforded by the maps
prepared by Heinrich Kiepert for the Encyclopaedia Britannica
(1898, Vol. XV, plate VII) and by Elisabeth Rinner (2013, 12
Abb. 1, available online: http://repository.topoi.org/BACP/
BACP0066/BACP0066a.pdf), and a scheme in Stu¨ckelberger
and Graßhoff (2006, p. 47).

3. To be precise, Ptolemy locates the Fortunate Islands either on the
zero meridian (in a unique codex X: Vaticanus graecus 191), or on
the meridian 1u (in other MSS descending from the archetype V).
Ptolemy’s eastern limit of the oikoumene is marked by three points
(1.11.1, 15.9-10) which have the following longitudes: Sera
(either Chang’an, i.e. modern Xi’an, or Lyuoang) – 177u159, Sina
(a city in South China) – 180u, Kattigara (presumably, a harbor at
Hanoi (Stu¨ckelberger and Graßhoff, 2006, p. 18) – 176Ku.

4. Modern longitudes of

the above mentioned points are the
following: Xi’an – 108u549, Lyuoang – 112u279, Canary Islands
lie between –17u219 and –13u259, so that the longitudinal interval
corresponding to Ptolemy’s oikoumene between the Fortunate
Islands and the Sera amounts to 122u199–128u489.

5. Ptolemy arguably accepted Eratosthenes’ value in the Almagest, his
earlier work, as was shown by Schnabel (1930, pp. 218–219).
6. The first one to put forth this hypothesis was Gossellin (1790, pp.
118–124, Tables VII–VIII); the most complete statement of the
hypothesis is given by Russo (2013a, b); see also Rawlins (1985,
2008), de Graauw (n.d.), Tupikova and Geus (2013), Tupikova
(2013); cf. similar observations, but with a different explanation by
Knobloch et al. (2003).

7. Rawlins (1985, p. 264) has obtained the stretching factor to be
1.36¡0.04, with the basis of a sample of 16 Ptolemy’s longitudes
(the most important cities of the Mediterranean). Forstner (2005,
pp. 66, 79, A-3, Table 4-1-1) has obtained the value 1.42, on the
basis of 38 longitudes (29 are the most important cities of Europe,
9 are the cities of the Asian part of the Mediterranean). De Graauw
(n.d.) has obtained 1.339 on the basis of 44 longitudes (harbors,
capes, and mouths of the Mediterranean). Russo (2013a, p. 68)
has obtained 1.4277 on the basis of 80 longitudes (mostly, the
important cities of the Mediterranean, and a few cities east of the
Euphrates up to Merv). Cf. the factors of 1.43 and 1.41 in
Carmody (1976, p. 604). Knobloch et al. (2003) also postulated
the stretching factor of 1.4 for Ptolemy’s longitudes, but explained
it differently.

8. This fact is stressed by Be´la Luka´cs (n.d.): ‘I can only tell that C.
Ptolemy (or a whole research group using the name as a figurehead
as Nicholas Bourbaki in the XXth century) produced a phenom-
enally self-consistent set of latitudes and longitudes, maybe via
intuitive methods completely lost for us’. Other researchers found
the coefficient of determination R2, which indicates how well the
longitudes can be
correlation between Ptolemy’s and the real
described by a regression line, to take the following values:
Forstner (2005, p. 66 & passim) – 0.9329; de Graauw (n.d.) –
0.9935; Russo (2013a, p. 68) – 0.9878.

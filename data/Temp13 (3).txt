Spatial analysis methods used for detecting, interpolating, or predicting local patterns in geographic
data  require  delineating  a  neighbourhood  to  define  the  extent  of  the  spatial  interaction.  Certain  spatial
analysis  methods,  such  as  interpolation,  have  implemented  the  concept  of  directionality  and  barriers.
However,  not  all  approaches  take  into  consideration  geographic  or  environmental  constraints  such  as
impassable mountain ranges, road networks, or coastlines. Specifically, complex marine landscapes and
coastlines  pose  problematic  neighbourhood  definitions  for  standard  neighbourhood  matrices  used  in 
the  spatial  analysis  of  marine  environments.  Here,  we  offer  a  new  approach  to  constraining  spatial 
neighbourhoods when conducting geographical analysis in marine environments. We developed methods
and  open  source  software  (COnstraining  SpatIal  NEighbourhoods—COSINE)  for  modifying  spatial 
neighbourhoods, and demonstrate their utility with a marine study of oil spills. The COSINE graphical user
interface allows users to modify the most common standard spatial neighbourhood definitions such as fixed
distance, inverse distance and k-nearest neighbour.

Les méthodes d’analyse spatiale utilisées pour la détection, l’interpolation ou la prévision des modèles
locaux  dans  les  données  géographiques  exigent  la  délimitation  d’un  voisinage  pour  définir  l’étendue  de 
l’interaction spatiale. Certaines méthodes d’analyse spatiale, comme l’interpolation, font appel au concept
de  la  directionalité  et  des  obstacles.  Toutefois,  les  approches  ne  prennent  pas  toutes  en  compte  les  con-
traintes géographiques ou environnementales comme les chaînes montagneuses impraticables, les réseaux
routiers  ou  les  littoraux.  Plus  précisément,  les  paysages  et  littoraux  complexes  posent  des  problèmes 
de  définition  de  voisinage  pour  les  matrices  standard  de  voisinage  utilisées  pour  l’analyse  spatiale  des 
environnements  marins.  Dans  le  présent  article,  nous  présentons  une  nouvelle  approche  pour  limiter 
les  voisinages  spatiaux  lors  de  la  réalisation  de  l’analyse  géographique  en  environnement  marin.  Nous
avons développé des méthodes et des logiciels ouverts (COnstraining SpatIal NEighbourhoods — COSINE)
pour  modifier  les  voisinages  spatiaux  et  démontrer  leur  utilité  pour  une  étude  marine  des  déversements 
de  pétrole.  L’interface  utilisateur  graphique  de  COSINE  permet  aux  usagers  de  modifier  les  définitions 
de  voisinage  spatial  standard  les  plus  courantes  comme  la  distance  constante,  la  pondération  inverse

Geographical

revolutionized  the  way  we  manage,  visualize  and
interpret  geospatial  data,  leading  to  unparalleled
advancements  in  spatial  analysis.  Spatial  analysis
considers  aspects  such  as  location,  distance,  area
and interaction in geospatial data to quantify patterns
in phenomena, with the objective to understand and

intelligent  selections  of  spatial  neighbourhoods 
to perform analysis. The choice of a spatial neigh-
bourhood  is  somewhat  subjective,  varying  from
testing  several  definitions  and  parameters  to  a 
more rigorous approach, such as semi-variograms.
Choosing  a  particular  spatial  neighbourhood 
definition  should  be  carefully  considered,  as  an
inappropriate  selection  can  generate  misleading
analysis  results  [
2012].
Standard  methods  for  delineating  a  spatial  neigh-
bourhood  may  not  be  suitable  for  all  studies,  as 
they  do  not  take  into  consideration  geographic  or
environmental  barriers  such  as  impassable  moun-
tain ranges, road networks or coastlines. Failure to
not  consider  natural  or  manmade  barriers  when
delineating spatial neighbourhoods may lead to the
assumption  that  unrelated  features  are  linked
despite  being  separated  by  impassable  boundaries
Nelson and Robertson
2012].
[

Nelson  and  Robertson

Where  barriers  exist,  it  becomes  necessary  to
constrain  spatial  neighbourhoods.  For  example, 
Dendroctonus

)  infestation  hotspots,  terrain  data  was
used to constrain spatial neighbourhoods to water-
sheds  since  the  mountains  acted  as  dispersal 
barriers to the beetle [
2012].
Other  approaches  to  constrain  spatial  neighbour-
hoods  have  included  contiguity  or  adjacency

There  are  limited  tools  and  methods  for

Moreover, interpolation techniques, such as Inverse
Distance  Weighted  (IDW)  or  spline  with  barriers,
can limit the area of influence in the interpolation.
Despite previous approaches and specified tools for 
restricting  analysis  by  natural  barriers,  there  is 
still a lack of accessibility to tools for constrained
neighbourhood  definitions  that  restrict  the  utility 
of spatial analysis across disciplines.

Marine researchers are increasingly using GIS

and impacts on marine species (e.g., 
Woesik

Redfern  et  al.

[2011];

Serra-Sogas et al. 

[2013]).  Similarly,
spatial  analysis  has  been  used  to  predict  spatial 
patterns of illegal or accidental oil discharge from
marine commercial vessels [
2008].
Marine  research  has  typically  applied  simple  and
standard  neighbourhoods  for  spatial  analysis  and
may  benefit  from  novel  techniques  for  intelligent
spatial  neighbourhood  delineations.  In  particular,
complex  coastlines  and  currents  act  as  barriers
and need to be considered when delineating marine
spatial neighbourhoods. Though similar issues exist
in terrestrial environments, the presence of complex
coastlines  creates  a  particularly  large  number  of
barriers within a study area.

The  goal  of  this  paper  is  to  propose  methods 
for  constraining  spatial  neighbourhoods  in  marine
environments. To  meet  this  goal,  we  describe  com-
mon  spatial  neighbourhood  definitions  and  propose
two  approaches  for  constraining  neighbourhoods  in
marine environments; the first incorporates land as a
constraint and the second uses current directions. Fol-
lowing, we demonstrate the benefit of our approaches
on a case study using oil spill occurrence data.

Spatial Neighbourhoods in
Marine Applications

Marine  studies  often  consider  the  influence 
of  space  as  a  fixed  distance  to  delineate  spatial
neighbourhoods,  ignoring  barriers  such  as  coast-
lines  or  current  directions.  For  example,  spatial
neighbourhood delineations by fixed distance have
been used to analyze the spatial patterns of ground-
fish distribution [
2013] and to moni-
tor the change in coral reef structures across space
LeDrew  et  al.
[
2004].  Ultimately,  the  choice  and
geographic  extent  of  the  neighbourhood,  which
defines  spatial  relationships  between  objects,  is
determined  subjectively  by  the  analyst.  Typically,
methods  employed  are  simplistic  in  terms  of

of  neighbourhoods  include:  fixed  and  adaptive

K-nearest neighbour is also a standard approach
for  neighbourhood  creation  that  delineates neigh-
bours based on a constant number (k) of locations in
each neighbourhood [

Marine  studies  have  employed  such  methods  to
detect indicators for the assessment of marine envi-
ronmental conditions using methods such as inverse
distance weighted (IDW) [

Spatial neighbourhoods may also be delineated
by  adjacency  or  contiguity.  In  this  approach,  the

COSINE Tool

Standard  approaches  to  delineating  spatial
neighbourhoods may not be suitable when there are
internal  barriers  within  a  study  area  or  when  the
relationship  between  neighbours  is  affected  by
variables and their direction. Here, we demonstrate
COSINE,  an  open  source  software  package  that
integrates  with  ArcGIS  and  allows  delineation  of
spatial  neighbourhoods  constrained  by  ancillary
data on coastlines and ocean current directions. The
COSINE tool requires the analyst define Input File
of point objects to define the neighbourhood for an
Input  Constraint  Feature  Class  (usually  a  polygon
file of the land), a Neighbourhood Type (fixed dis-
tance, inverse distance, or k-nearest neighbourhood)
and, optionally, a raster grid representing the direc-
tion of current. COSINE outputs a modified spatial
neighbourhoods  that  is  either  binary  (default)  or
row-standardized.

Standard  neighbourhoods  were  modified  by
creating  connections  between  observation  points
(Figure 2a–2b). Here, we term connections between
points  “links.”  A  unique  identifier  is  assigned  to
each link, and the distance of each link is calculated
and  saved  in  a  geodatabase.  If  a  distance  based
neighbourhood definition is used, a binary value is
given  to  links  that  are  within  a  threshold  distance
given by the user. To account for the influence of
coastlines on spatial interaction, a link of intersect
land  points  was  excluded  from  being  neighbours
(Figure 2c–2d).

To  account  for  the  influence  of  current  on
neighbourhood  delineation,  a  directional  relation-
ship can also be calculated. If the user chooses to
use  a  directionality  approach,  a  new  binary  value
(i.e., one) is assigned to the angles that are less than

a threshold angle given by the user. Ancillary data
(meridional and zonal ocean currents) were used in
the  directionality  constraint:  meridional  currents
provide  sea  water  velocity  (m/s)  in  a  north/south
direction,  while  zonal  currents  provide  sea  water
velocity (m/s) in an east/west direction. A negative
value for meridional or zonal currents is indicative
of  a  change  in  direction  to  the  south  or  west,
respectively.  Meridional  or  zonal  currents  would
have  similar  implications  for  the  application  of
wind direction over terrestrial environments.

To  calculate  a  directional  relationship  in
COSINE software, we began by assigning the letter
u
(v)  to  meridional  currents  and  letter  (
)  to  zonal 
currents. Whenever an observation overlapped the
raster currents file, the cell values for 
were
extracted  and  saved  in  the  geodatabase.  For  each
observation  point,  a  node  (x,y)  was  created  (xu,xv
or yu,yv). The node is the point at the end of the link
to another observation and was used to store infor-
mation on the distance, currents, and angle between
the two points.

inequality:
the  Cauchy-Schwarz 
Link_id = ‘136’ represents the connection between
Node 1 (or Point 1) = ‘16’ and Node 2 (or Point 2)
= ‘17’; each node has information about meridional
and zonal currents. Node 1 has direction north-west
and  Node  2  south-west,  and  by  calculating  the
Cauchy-Schwarz  inequality,  it  generates  an  angle
divergence  of  41°.  The  angle  divergence  for  each
link  is  then  used  to  identify  if  it  is  under  the
threshold value for the angle provided by the user.
The  selection  of  angle  will  be  subjective  and
depends  on  the  process  being  studied.  If  the 
directionality  influences  are  very  strong,  a  tighter
angle  will  be  preferred.  One  way  to  determine 
the  best  range  of  thresholds  would  be  to  evaluate
the  subjectivity  of  threshold  selection  on  spatial
pattern analysis output.

Output for Spatial Analysis

The  last  step  of  the  process  was  to  create  a
Boolean selection, where only the links that satisfy
all  requirements  given  by  the  user  to  delineate  a
spatial  neighbourhood  (i.e.,  binary  value  of  one)
were  selected.  Depending  on  the  selection  made 
by  the  user,  including  whether  the  directionality
approach  was  used  or  not,  the  output  file  (weight
matrix) may be either in binary or row-standardized
format. The output for COSINE can be used to per-
form spatial analysis using ArcGIS or OpenGeoDa.

Case Study

To  demonstrate  COSINE  and  the  impact  of
constrained neighbourhood delineation, we used a
measure  of  spatial  autocorrelation  to  describe  the
spatial pattern of phenomena. Quantitative measures
of  spatial  autocorrelation  are  used  to  characterize
how similar or dissimilar nearby events are. When
nearby events are similar, the spatial pattern is con-
sidered to have been generated from a spatial process
that exhibits clustering. Clustered events that have
high  values  are  often  termed  hot  spots;  whereas,
clustered  events  with  low  values  are  termed  cold
spots.  Measures  of  spatial  autocorrelation  can  be
evaluated  statistically  to  determine  if  the  level  of
clustering,  or  hot  spot,  is  statistically  unexpected,
O’Sullivan
given a null hypothesis of randomness [
and  Unwin

2002].  The  goal  of  this  case  study 
was  to  determine  how  different  neighbourhood
delineations  impacted  detection  of  clusters. To  do

this  we  used  the  COSINE  tool  and  compared 
clusters  detected  when  neighbourhoods  were  uncon-
strained, constrained, or directionally constrained.

Oil  spill  data  were  provided  by  the  National

part of a mechanism to monitor oil spill pollution

by  NASP  flight  crews  were  collected  on  a  visual

For  each  oil  spill  detected,  time  and  position 
were assigned and the volume was calculated using
remote  sensors,  such  as  synthetic  aperture  radar
(SAR),  that  allowed  monitoring  during  day  and
night. For the purpose of this case study, we only
considered oil spill observations from 2008, given
that  it  was  the  year  with  the  highest  number  of

Larger  values  in  the  magnitude  of  meridional 
currents  (north/south  direction)  are  indicative  of
stronger  equatorial  divergence.  Positive  values 
correspond  to  currents  moving  towards  the  north,
while negative values represent a southern direction
Bonjean  and  Lagerloef
2002].  Zonal  currents  are
[
geostrophic currents that are the result of the pres-
Hwang et al.
sure  gradient  and  the  Coriolis  force  [
2008].  Positive  values  for  zonal  currents  indicate
east  current  directions,  while  negative  values 
represent currents moving west.

Currents  data  were  derived  from  the  AVISO
(Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satel-
http://www.pfeg
lite Oceanographic data) program (
.noaa.gov/products/EDC/EDCdownloads.html

) with
a  0.25  by  0.25  degree  spatial  resolution  and  an
average  temporal  resolution  of  one  month.  To
account  for  missing  data  due  to  cloud  cover  or
proximity to shore, seasonal values of each current
were  extracted,  interpolated  and  rasterized  using
ArcGIS  version  10.1  (ESRI®).  The  cell  value 
nearest  to  the  centroid  of  each  cell  was  used  to
extract the values of each current. For the purpose
of  this  case  study,  only  current  data  from  2008 
was used.

Methods

1992; 

Using a local measure of spatial autocorrelation,
the Getis statistic (Gi*), clusters of large and small oil
Fortin and
Getis and Ord
spills were mapped [
Dale

2005]. Gi* enables detection of local concentra-
tions  of  high  or  low  attribute  values,  in  this  case 
O’Sullivan and
clusters of large and small oil spills [
Unwin

2010].  Gi* is  often  used  to  detect  hot  spots 
and  identify  patterns  that  are  unexpected  based  on
hypotheses, such as spatial processes being random
Nelson and Boots
2008]. One of the benefits of Gi*
[
is  that  it  is  a  local  measure  and  allows  analysts  to
map spatial variation in patterns.

A  feature  with  a  high  value  surrounded  by
Getis

other high values was identified as a hot spot [
and Ord 

O’Sullivan and Unwin

1992; 

2010].

Where  wij is  a  symmetric  spatial  neighbour-

, the remaining links were assigned zero

and  Ord

1xj is the sum of all xj not including xi [

1992].  Gi* generated  an  output  with  a 
Z(Gi* Z) score for each feature; the Z-score repre-
sented  the  statistical  significance  of  clustering  for 
a given distance. High or low Z-score indicated that 
the  neighbours  had  high  or  low  attribute  values,
which we defined as clusters of high or low densi-
ties  of  oil  spill  occurrence.  Clusters  of  high  and 
low values were calculated with a 90% confidence
interval; that is, Z-score values needed to be greater
than 1.65 or less than -1.65.

Clusters  of  oil  spills  were  detected  using  Gi*
with  neighbourhoods  delineated  with  and  without
the use of COSINE software. Oil spill occurrence
data were analyzed using three options:

i) standard spatial neighbourhoods (uncon-

strained),

ii)  land constrained neighbourhoods (con-

strained land) and 

iii)  land and directionality (ocean currents) 

constrained  neighbourhoods  (constrained 
dir).

To assess the impact of contextualizing spatial
neighbourhood  delineations,  we  first  assessed 
how  the  number  of  neighbours  delineated  using
unconstrained  and  constrained  neighbourhoods
impacted  the  results.  Second,  we  quantified  how
that  detection  of  clusters  was  impacted  with  or
without a constrained approach. For the case study
we  used  a  binary  and  distance  neighbourhood 
type.  In  order  to  compare  the  impact  of  the  scale 
in  neighbourhood  delineation  for  unconstrained,
constrained,  and  constrained  with  directionality
approaches,  we  used  distance  thresholds  ranging
from 40 km to 120 km.

Results

There  was  variation  in  the  number  of  neigh-
bour  counts  for  the  unconstrained  and  the  con-
strained  (constrained  land  and  constrained  dir)
approaches  (Figure  5).  Ranges  in  minimum  and
maximum  number  of  neighbours  varied  with 
distance.  For  instance,  in  the  unconstrained
approach  the  values  ranged  from  1  to  35  within

40 km compared to 1 to 81 within 120 km. For the
constrained  land  approaches,  within  40  km  there
were 1 to 14 neighbours while there were 1 to 19
within  120  km.  In  the  directionality  constrained
approach,  the  values  remained  stable  with  18
neighbour counts across all scales. Variation in the
number of neighbourhoods per neighbourhood type
can  be  seen  in  Figure  5.  Trends  in  median  value
varied  for 
the  unconstrained  approach,  but
remained  stable  for  both  constrained  approaches.
The  median  number  of  neighbours  was  15  within
40 km and 54 within 120 km for the unconstrained
approach.  With  both  constrained  approaches,  the
median number of neighbours was 4 (Figure 5).

Variation in the Gi* Z-score values is illustrated
in  Figure  6.  Ranges  in  minimum  and  maximum
values  varied  according  to  the  distance  chosen.
With the 40 km distance range for an unconstrained
approach, the Gi* Z-score values were -1.89 to 2.12,
for a constrained land -1.12 to 1.49, and for a con-
strained dir -1.12 to 0.74. For the 120 km distance,
the  Gi* Z-score  values  were  lower,  from  -1.87  to
1.73  for  the  unconstrained  approach  and  -1.23  to
1.17  for  the  constrained  land  approach.  However,
the  Gi* Z-score  remained  constant  with  the  con-
strained  dir  approach,  with  values  ranging  from 
-1.22 to 0.74, likely due to the localized position of
the oil spills (Figure 7).

The  number  of  spatial  clusters  of  large  oil
spills  identified  using  neighbourhoods  delineated

by  distances  from  40  km  to  120  km  for  the 
unconstrained approach ranged from 6 (40 km) to 
2  (120  km).  For  the  constrained  land  approach,
there were 7 (40 km) to 5 (120 km) clusters of high
values. Finally, for the constrained dir, there were 
4  clusters  of  large  oil  spills  across  all  distances
(Figure 8). The number of spatial clusters of small
oil spills ranged from 18 (40 km) to 1 (120 km) for
an unconstrained approach.

Discussion

In spatial analysis, the area where geographic
features  influence  one  another  is  considered  a 
O’Sullivan  and  Unwin
spatial  neighbourhood  [
2002].  The  neighbourhood  should  represent  the
spatial  interaction  and  dependency  among  fea-
tures;  hence,  a  proper  neighbourhood  definition 
is  important  to  determine  what  the  outcome  of 
the  analysis  will  be.  The  study  of  species  and 
environmental  interactions  in  both  terrestrial 
Wong and 
and aquatic environments is increasing [
Anselin  and  Getis 
Lee

2010];  therefore,  the
need  exists  for  tools  that  delineate  intelligent 
spatial neighbourhoods, taking into account natural
restrictions  on  the  spatial  dependency.  Spatial
analysis in marine environments is a good example
of  how  a  correct  definition  of  spatial  neighbour-
hood  is  required  to  ensure  accurate  results  in  the

analysis.  Neighbourhood  definitions  for  spatial
studies  of  marine  environments  would  benefit 
from  methods  that  integrate  additional  physical
data.  Implementing  constraints,  such  as  coastlines
or  directionality  of  currents,  will  more  accurately
identify spatial relationship among observations.

Standard  approaches  of  determining  spatial
neighbourhoods  do  not  rely  on  geography,  rather
they use a planar environment where impediments
to  the  influence  of  features  are  not  considered. 
The methodology to limit the influence of observa-
tions  by  either  including  barriers  or  analyzing 
the  contiguity  level  has  existed  for  some  time.
However,  accessing  these  approaches  or  imple-
menting them on a broad scale remains a challenge.
For  instance,  commercial  GIS  software  still  lack
options  to  constrain  spatial  neighbourhoods.
Likewise, limitations are faced when using Voronoi
or  CDT  to  constrain  the  interpolation,  due  to  the
dependence on a researcher’s expertise.

In our marine case study we implemented and
compared  spatial  neighbourhoods  delineated  by
distance.  Including  the  geographic  context  in  the
definition  of  spatial  neighbourhoods  provided 
realistic  representations  of  spatial  interaction  as  it
limits  the  area  of  influence  of  a  feature  and  its
neighbour. For instance, the number of neighbour-
hood counts decreased for constrained approaches
compared  to  unconstrained  approaches.  The 
reduction  in  the  neighbourhood  count  was  due  to
the  recognition  of  geographical  barriers  impeding
the relationship among observations.

Implementation of directionality as an additional
component  to  constrained  spatial  neighbourhoods
is useful for research in open waters that are subject
to  different  current  directions.  In  our  study,  there
was  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  locations  with 
surrounding  high  values  when  the  directionality
approach  was  added.  The  directionality  approach 
is useful for oil spills or any kind of study whose
data  is  influenced  by  directionality.  For  example,
directionality  has  a  direct  or  an  indirect  influence

results  of  the  analysis  [
Blanchet  et  al.

1996],  which  in  turn,  influence  the
2006;
2011].  The 
relationship  of  neighbours  may  be  altered  when
currents change as a result of variation in topogra-
phy.  For  instance,  if  the  directionality  at  two 
observations  is  within  a  specific  angle,  both 
observations  may  be  affected  by  currents  heading
in the same direction and would be considered part
of the same neighbourhood.

In spatial analysis, the outcome of an analysis

will be affected by how the data were aggregated as

Edge effects are another factor to be accounted
for  when  performing  spatial  analyses.  Incorpor-
ating  internal  edges  into  the  study  area  requires 
the  implementation  of  an  edge  correction  that 
modifies  the  spatial  neighbourhood  delineation.
Due  to  the  edge  effect,  aggregated  data  that  are 
near  the  centre  of  the  study  area  will  have 
neighbourhoods  in  all  directions,  whereas  closer 
to  the  boundary,  neighbourhoods  can  only  be
defined  in  the  direction  towards  the  study  area 
O’Sullivan 
centre  [
and  Unwin

Goreaud  and  Pélissier

2002].  Edge  corrections  have  been 
suggested  in  previous  research;  for  instance,  it  is
possible  to  implement  weighted  neighbours  near 
a  study  area  edge  [
1977]  or  incorporate  a
guard zone around the edge of the study area that
can  include  data  used  only  for  building  neigh-
O’Sullivan  and
bourhoods  of  other  data  features  [
Unwin

1999; 

Ripley

2010].

A  limitation  of  COSINE  is  that  the  results 
will  have  more  edge  effects  than  unconstrained
analyses, as edges will occur both at the study area
extent  and  within  the  study  area.  Future  research
could include edge corrections within COSINE by
implementing  a  weighted  edge  correction  using 
the  inverse  distance  spatial  neighbourhood  delin-
eation  present  in  the  software.  The  landscape  of 
the  coastline  also  affects  the  results  produced  by
COSINE.  For  example,  observations  located  at 
the end of a cape on the coast could be associated,
yet  the  linking  between  these  observations  is  not
made as the straight distance calculated is truncated
by the coast.

There are many examples where barriers should
be  considered  in  neighbourhood  definitions.  For
instance,  in  ecology  a  constrained  neighbourhood

can incorporate impassable barriers, such as wild-
Poephila  acuticauda
fires  for  long-tailed  finch  (
)
(i.e., 
[2011]),  or  limiting 
animal  movement  in  both  terrestrial  and  marine
environments. Constrained spatial neighbourhoods
in  plant  ecology  (i.e., 
[2011])  can
also  be  used  to  identify  spatial  patterns  and 
interaction of plants over a specific area. In the con-
text  of  environmental  degradation,  wind  direction

ling  [

be  used  to  constrain  the  influence  of  features, 
using  wind  direction,  in  terrestrial  environments.

Conclusions

References

We demonstrated that by using unconstrained
or  constrained  approaches  for  spatial  analysis, 
outcomes  are  altered.  Implementing  constrained
approaches  improves  the  analysis  of  local  obser-
vations,  by  limiting  the  area  of  influence  or 
interaction  among  observations.  Spatial  analysis 
in marine environments is a good example of how
a  correct  definition  of  spatial  neighbourhood  is
required to ensure accurate results in the analysis.
Implementing  constraints,  such  as  coastlines  or
directionality of currents, will better identify spatial
relationships among observations. Further research
on  implementing  terrestrial  applications  will  be
valuable to improve the existing application as well
as to compare it with traditional approaches.

The  case  study  demonstrated  the  ability  of
COSINE  software  to  add  a  new  approach  to  con-
straining spatial neighbourhood definitions in marine
environments.  Among  many  others  applications,
studies of species distribution in terrestrial environ-
ments  can  also  benefit  from  the  constraint
approaches implemented in COSINE. Furthermore,
the directionality approach can be used in terrestrial
environments  to  study  phenomena  such  as  the 
dispersion  of  pollution,  seeds,  or  allergens.  The
development  of  COSINE  using  open  software 
will allow spatial analysts the flexibility to imple-
ment  and  to  create  further  definitions  of  spatial

Authors

Cesar Suarez

received his Bachelor’s degree in
Marine  and  Coastal  Resources  Management  from
the  University  Santiago  de  Cali,  Colombia.  He
joined the SPAR Lab in 2012 as a Master’s student,
interested  in  developing  a  suite  of  tools  to  study
spatial patterns in marine ecosystems. In 2014, he
received  his  Master’s  degree  in  Geography  from
the University of Victoria, Canada. He is currently
working  for  the  industry  as  a  senior  programmer
and GIS analyst at i-Open Technologies Inc.

Dr. Trisalyn Nelson

is an associate professor in
the Department of Geography at the University of
Victoria,  where  she  founded  the  Spatial  Pattern
Analysis  and  Research  (SPAR)  Lab.  In  2010,  she
was  awarded  the  Lansdowne  Research  Chair  in
Spatial Sciences and in 2013 she became Director
of Geomatics. Dr. Nelson and SPAR Lab’s research
develops  and  applies  spatial  and  spatial-temporal
analysis methods to a wide variety of problems in
the natural and human environments. Publications
have  included  research  on  grizzly  bear  habitat,
mountain pine beetle epidemic, biodiversity, crime,
food security, and forestry. A recent research focus
for Dr. Nelson has been the creation of BikeMaps.org
to  employ  volunteered  geographic  information  to
better understand cycling safety and risk.

Karen Laberee

has been a research associate in
UVic’s SPAR Lab since 2007. Ms. Laberee has her
MSc  in  Zoology  from  the  University  of  Western
Ontario  and  her  Bachelor  of  Science  from  the
University of Calgary. She has worked on numer-
ous  projects  in  SPAR  Lab  including  the  study  of
grizzly bear habitat use in western Alberta. Prior to
joining  SPAR  Lab,  Ms.  Laberee  worked  on  stock
identification  and  forensics  in  the  Molecular
Genetics  Laboratory  with  Fisheries  and  Ocean
Canada  (Nanaimo,  BC).  She  is  currently  project
manager for BikeMaps.org.

Abstract

Social connections between villages can represent farmers’ 

interests  and  thus  benefit  participatory  rural  relocation 

planning. With rural development, however, these connec‐

tions will change and may weaken the adaptation of reloca‐

tion plans to future rural systems. As yet, most studies still 

use  empirical  social  connections  to  guide  relocation  plan‐

ning, while a few have incorporated predicted connections 

in  the  context  of  rural  development  into  relocation  deci‐

sions. Meanwhile, spatial optimization approaches have sel‐

dom been adopted to solve this geographical decision issue. 

Accordingly,  our  study  proposes  a  novel  spatial  relocation 

framework  that  incorporates  changed  inter‐village  social 

connections  under  future  rural  development  scenarios. 

Empirical inter‐village connections and their policy‐induced 

changes in central China were explored using social network 

analysis. An integration of particle swarm optimization and 

geographic information systems was adopted to identify the 

relocation solutions with maximum inter‐village connections 

and maximum spatial land use compactness, and to examine 

how  connection  changes  under  different  policy  scenarios 

influenced  relocation  outcomes.  The  results  demonstrate 

the significance of incorporating policy‐induced social con‐

nections into relocation plans, and most importantly, show 

the negative relations between changed social connections

and  the  migration  distance/direction  of  relocated  settle‐

ments. Our study is expected to improve the adaptation of 

relocation plans to future rural development.

Settlement relocation is one of the countryside reshaping measures for rural revitalization (Long, Li, Liu, Woods, &  

Zou, 2012; Long & Liu, 2015; Zhang, Sun, Wu, & Deng, 2016b). With rapid urbanization, worldwide rural decline 

has arisen from boosting population migration from countryside to cities (Bai, Shi, & Liu, 2014; World Bank, 2016), 

which is particularly remarkable in China (Liu & Li, 2017). As a result, numerous distant and scattered villages suf‐

fered from inadequate infrastructure and facilities and widened urban–rural gaps (Sun, Liu, & Xu, 2011; Li, Wu &  

Liu, 2018; Wu & He, 2018). Spatial and socioeconomic restructuring of these villages is urgently needed (Long & 

Liu, 2016). Different from policies of village urbanization and hollowed village consolidation (e.g. rearrangement 

of aging and abandoned settlements) (Long, 2014), rural relocation enables us to move remote/dispersed settle‐

ments to more suitable places with favorable geographical features, sufficient provision of public services, and 

rationalized socioeconomic relations (Tian, Kong, Liu, & Wang, 2016).

A  variety  of  quantitative  approaches  have  been  developed  to  evaluate  candidate  relocating  locations  and 

generate effective rural relocation plans (Tan & Li, 2013; Chen & Liu, 2016; Huang, Liu, Xue, Li, & Shi, 2018). These 

approaches have evolved from the top‐down strategy to the integration of top‐down and bottom‐up strategies 

over the past decades. At the stage of top‐down optimization of rural relocations, local governments and planners 

formulated relocation solutions based on their own demands and local situations (Palmer, 1988). Systems analysis 

of inhabitant status, economic incentives, sociocultural features, agricultural production conditions, and spatial 

accessibility of rural settlements was usually adopted to find suitable relocation alternatives (van Lier, 1998; Kim, 

Woosnam, Marcouiller, Aleshinloye & Choi, 2015; Cao, Bai, Sun, & Zhou, 2017; Sun, Xu, Liu, Liu, & Wang, 2017). 

Since  these  alternatives  mainly  highlighted  concentrated  rural  settlements,  technical  feasibility,  and  economic 

justifiability from a manager/planner standpoint (Li, Liu, Long, & Cui, 2014; Liu, Yang, Liu, Wei, & Yang, 2018), they 

were sometimes inconsistent with the will of farmers and thus difficult to carry out in practice (Dikmen, 2018). To 

solve this problem, extensive bottom‐up strategies have been employed to incorporate farmers’ interests into the 

top‐down relocation decisions (Murray, Greer, Houston, McKay, & Murtagh, 2009; Peng et al., 2018). For exam‐

ple, inter‐village social connections, which are formed based on the spatial movements and non‐spatial contacts 

of farmers for the purposes of working, education, recreation, and so on (Liu, Li, & Breitung, 2012; Milbourne & 

Kitchen, 2014), have proven promising to provide guidance for settlement relocation (Tian et al., 2016; Tian, Liu, 

& Kong, 2018a).

However, most previous studies utilized empirical social connections of farmers to guide relocation planning 

(Tian et al., 2018a), and did not take into account connection changes caused by rural system improvements such 

as balanced/characteristic development or transit‐oriented development (TOD) (Cervero & Day, 2008). The con‐

nection changes may exert an uncertain effect on the applicability of empirical knowledge‐informed relocation 

decisions in the future (Ford & Mouzas, 2010; Han, Yan, Li, Ji, & Li, 2014). On the contrary, the relocation of rural 

settlements is regarded as an optimization issue related to sociophysical environments and multiple stakeholders, 

and  spatial  optimization  is  effective  for  such  geographic  decision  problems  with  multiple  objectives  and  con‐

straints (Ligmann‐Zielinska, Church, & Jankowski, 2008). However, few studies have employed spatial optimiza‐

tion approaches to solve rural relocation problems to the best of our knowledge.

This  article  aims  to  optimize  relocation  patterns  of  rural  settlements  and  analyze  how  social  connection 

changes under different rural development policies affect the relocation outcomes. We proposed a novel spatial 

LIU et aL.    |  3

relocation framework based on the integration of social network analysis and particle swarm optimization (PSO) 

in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. In the framework, social network analysis was first per‐

formed to explore the empirical inter‐village connections and simulate their potential changes in different policy 

scenarios. Then, the relocation of rural settlements was cast into a spatial optimization problem and solved by 

using a GIS‐based PSO algorithm. As a supporting tool for location‐based decisions, GIS was used to prepare data, 

display outcomes, and provide a spatially explicit modeling platform for the relocation optimization issue. The PSO 

algorithm was embedded in the GIS platform to search for relocation solutions with maximum inter‐village social 

connections and maximum spatial compactness of relocated rural settlements. We took Liji Town in central China 

as a case study to test the proposed framework.

2.1 | Study area and data

Liji  Town  is  located  in  central  China,  adjacent  to  Wuhan  City  in  Hubei  province  (Figure  1).  It  consists  of  53 

administrative villages (one ecological conservation area not included) with a total population of 89,600 in 2015. 
The town covers 170.9 km2, 7.69% of which is occupied by rural settlements. With the accelerated urbanization 

of Wuhan City, Liji Town had a great loss of labor forces, caused by many hollowed villages (Tian, Kong, & Liu, 

2018b). The previous biased urban–rural development policy also resulted in inadequate planning of rural set‐

tlements and uneven distribution of infrastructure and public facilities. Farmers expected to promote their living 

standards and production conditions. Optimization of rural relocation considering farmers’ interests will support 

rural development of this area.

The data include an empirical land use map, land use suitability map, survey data of social connections, and 

socioeconomic statistics. The empirical land use map at a scale of 1:10,000 in 2015 was collected from the local 

bureau of land resource management, and classified into six types: cultivated land, orchard, built‐up land, rural set‐

tlements, water body, and other land. The land use suitability map with respect to rural settlements was generated 

F I G U R E   1  Location of the study area

using multiple criteria decision analysis in GIS software (Liu, Cui, Kong, & Zeng, 2016). Based on the understand‐

ing  of  village  formation  and  data  availability,  four  indicators  including  slope,  unchanged  built‐up  region,  farm‐

land protection, and ecological conservation were selected to evaluate land use suitability for rural settlements. 

Socioeconomic data (here referred to as population and land use density) were collected from a statistical year‐

book as well as a questionnaire survey in 2015. According to the average area of a dwelling unit (occupied by one 

household before relocation planning) in Liji Town, we converted the land use map into a grid at a spatial resolution 

of 25 × 25 m. A total of 860 basic grid units to be relocated were selected based on the areas of settlements and 

the total budget for relocation planning, accounting for 0.35% of all grid cells (as shown in Figure 1). All geographic 

data were stored in a database using GIS software for further analysis.

A questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate social connections among the villages in 2015. At least 

15 farmers per village and 1,820 in total were randomly selected from 53 administrative villages. We interviewed 

the sampled farmers face‐to‐face to collect their household information (e.g. population size, family structures, 

residence areas, and daily activities). In total, we derived 1,563 valid observations and grouped them into six cate‐

gories based on contact purposes (i.e. employment, visiting, shopping, entertainment, education, and health care). 

The frequency of activities in the observations was classified into four types: USUALLY refers to a connection 

frequency of more than four times a week; OFTEN denotes one to three times a week; SOMETIMES corresponds 

to one to three times a month; and SELDOM means no more than 12 times a year.

2.2 | Framework of relocation optimization

We integrated social network analysis, GIS, and PSO into a methodological framework to examine whether the 

change of inter‐village social connections will affect the relocation outcomes. As shown in Figure 2, the proposed 

framework consists of three components: simulating social connections between villages, modeling the relocation 

process, and identifying optimal relocation solutions. Each component will be described in the following sections.

2.3 | Simulating inter‐village social connections under future policy scenarios

Social  network  analysis  is  an  indispensable  tool  to  explore  human  interactions  (Mao  &  Bian,  2010;  Verdery, 

Entwisle, Faust, & Rindfuss, 2012). In this study, we represented social connections between villages as a network 

based on orientation–destination theory and field survey data (Borgatti, Mehra, Brass, & Labianca, 2009). The 

connection strength of two arbitrary villages was measured by the frequency of daily activities of farmers (Jin, 

Girvan, & Newman, 2001). Equation (1) calculates the connection strength from village o to d by using a weighted 

aggregation method:

conn(o → d) =

6

4

∑
m=1

∑
n=1

wn ∙ pmn(o → d)
P(o)

(1)

where m represents the category number of farmers’ activities, n denotes the frequency type of observed activ‐
ities, and pmn(o → d) stands for the number of mth‐type observed connections in the nth frequency group from 
village o to d. P(o) is the total number of observed connections out of village o, and wn measures the importance of 
the nth group of connections to the inter‐village connection strength. The weights were acquired using the Delphi 

approach (opinion census of 30 experts on the significance of each frequency group collected and expressed as a 

fraction of 1) and fixed to 0.533, 0.317, 0.094, and 0.056 for each frequency group in the study (Norman & Olaf, 

1963).

Two rural development policies, being carried out by the Chinese government during the period of the 13th 

five‐year plan (2016–2020), were introduced to analyze the potential change of social connections under policy 

interventions. In the past rural system of China, villages were categorized into general villages, central villages, 

LIU et aL.    |  5

F I G U R E   2  Flowchart of the proposed relocation framework

and  town  centers,  and  town  centers  were  usually  given  development  priority  over  the  former  two  types  (see 

Figure 3a). The principle that characterizes the two future policies is the development of central villages besides 

the town center. Policy I underlines the balanced development of central villages and town centers (Li, Li, Yu, & 

Chen, 2017). In this development mode, central villages are identified according to their economic and locational 

conditions. These villages will be evenly distributed throughout the study area and receive sufficient investment 

to  promote  their  economic  growth  and  service  provisions.  These  actions  enable  farmers  from  general  villages 

equitable  access  to  public  facilities  of  central  villages,  thereby  enhancing  the  inter‐village  social  ties  between 

farmers and even changing the isolated status of remote settlements (see upper part of Figure 3b). As a result, the 

connection strength between general villages and the town center will evidently decrease with the development 

of central villages. As for central villages that provide similar public services, only weak ties of kin and friendship 

may exist between them. Policy II highlights the distinguishing characteristics of central villages in addition to the 

balanced development (Wu, Chen, Deng, & Hui, 2018). This policy determines central villages based on economic 

development, geographical conditions, and distinguishing features in terms of culture and industrial structures. 

The characteristic central villages are capable of attracting farmers from all other villages for work, entertainment, 

and other sociocultural pursuits, which can also avoid mutual homogeneous competition with villages offering 

similar services. Therefore, the connections between the central villages and the general villages, as well as those 

between the central villages, are strengthened under Policy II (see Figure 3c).

Potential  networks  under  two  future  policy  scenarios  were  generated  based  on  network  flow  analysis  and 

functional substitution theory, as follows (Berndt & Christensen, 1973; Limtanakool, Dijst, & Schwanen, 2007).

Step 1: Identifying the central villages based on a flow analysis of the empirical network. A node symmetry 

index (NSI) was introduced to measure the significance of each village (Limtanakool et al., 2007). The villages with 

top NSI values (greater than 0.5 in this study) were selected as candidate central villages. To ensure the maximum

Policy II

coverage of service provisions, villages with greater NSI values and maximum average distance away from can‐

didate central villages were also added to the central village set. In total, Policy I selected six central villages (the 

town center included), and Policy II identified 11 central villages (the town center and five villages with distinguish‐

ing features included). Equation (2) calculates the NSI value of node k based on its inflow and outflow connections:

NSIk = ∑
∑

conn(o → k) −
conn(o → k) +

conn(k → d)
conn(k → d)

∑
∑

where  o  and  d  represent  two  arbitrary  villages  with  an  existing  outflow  and  inflow  connection  with  village  k, 
conn(k → d) calculates the sum 

conn(o → k) calculates the sum strength of all inflow connections to village k, and ∑

∑
strength of all outflow connections from village k.

Step 2: Redefining social connections based on functional substitution theory (Berndt & Christensen, 1973). 

A weighted Voronoi diagram was constructed based on selected central villages and the town center and their 

NSI  values  (Aurenhammer,  1991).  Assume  that  each  Voronoi  partition  contains  only  one  central  village  or  the 

town center, then all general villages within this partition connect with the unique center. In two policy‐induced 

networks, a new connection will be established between a general village and its central village if two villages do 

not connect with each other in the empirical network. According to functional substitution theory, the new con‐

nection strength is calculated as follows:

conn(o → c) =

conn(o → t)

NSIc
NSIc + NSIt

connNEW (o → t) = 1 − conn(o → c)

(2)

(3)

(4)

where o denotes a general village, c is the central village of o, and t represents the town center.

2.4 | Modeling relocation of rural settlements

Optimization of rural relocation is a sociospatial reconstruction process of rural settlements, which aims to iden‐

tify the best arrangement solutions for the settlements to be relocated. The optimization process involves many 

stakeholders or planners (e.g. farmers and local governments) who have different preferences. For example, local 

LIU et aL.    |  7

governments  tend  to  centralize  rural  residential  areas  for  better  management,  whereas  farmers  prefer  villages 

with close social relations and feasible services. To satisfy multiple preferences or reconcile the conflicts of stake‐

holders,  relocation  decisions  were  usually  made  based  on  a  comprehensive  set  of  evaluation  criteria,  such  as 

physical status, socioeconomic conditions, and, most importantly, the personal interests of farmers (Cao, Huang, 

Wang, & Lin, 2012; Tian et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016a).

This study selected maximum social connections and maximum spatial compactness of relocated settlements 

as the optimization objectives. Social connections imply the preferences of farmers and their acceptance prob‐

ability for relocation solutions. Maximizing inter‐village connections will enhance the applicability of relocation 

solutions in practice (Tian et al., 2016). In addition, land use fragmentation has caused adverse cumulative effects 

on rural development (Hidding & Teunissen, 2002). Maximizing the spatial compactness of relocated settlements 

encourages the migrated farmers to resettle around the unchanged settlements. It can benefit the concentrated 

management of rural settlements and intensive agricultural production.

Land use suitability and area thresholds of relocated settlements were considered as the constraining condi‐

tions. More specifically, a variety of spatial zones, including farmland protection areas, ecological conservation 

areas, unchanged built‐up land, waterbody, and land parcels with a slope greater than 15°, were regarded as not 

suitable for relocation, while a 200‐m buffer zone around main roads and unchanged settlements was identified as 

suitable for relocation. Moreover, the per capita habitant area of each villager after relocation was restricted. This 

constraint encourages relocated farmers to live in the concentrated residential areas based on the intensive land 

use policy. In addition, the relocation budget was also introduced in an implicit manner to identify the settlements 

to be relocated, as described in Section 2.1.

Let xi be a decision variable indicating whether land cell i accommodates the rural households from the set‐
tlements to be relocated, then the relocation process can be viewed as a spatial combinatorial optimization of a 

finite set of decision variables. Accordingly, a spatial optimization model for rural relocation can be formulated as 

follows:

where Equation (5) concentrates on maximizing the social connections between origin and destination villages of 

relocated settlements; Equation (6) maximizes the spatial compactness of rural settlements in relocation solutions 

and encourages demolished dwelling units to be relocated next to unchanged settlements based on a non‐linear 

neighboring method (Cao & Huang, 2010); Equation (7) defines the value range of decision variables; Equation (8)

relocated residences in an optimization solution; A0 is a constant that represents the ratio of the per capita area 
of rural settlements before relocation to the area of rural settlements to be relocated; and Amin and Amax restrict 
the minimum and maximum per capita area of rural settlements according to the standards for town planning in 
China, equaling 120 and 150 m2 in this study.

2.5 | Searching for relocation solutions using the PSO algorithm

PSO is a population‐based heuristic algorithm inspired by the social behavior of flocks of birds (e.g. cooperation 

and competition for food) (Kennedy, 2011). The algorithm is promising for solving land use allocation problems due 

to its flexible framework and small quantity of adjustable parameters (Liu, Ou, Li, & Ai, 2013; Liu, Tang, Liu, Zhao, 

& He, 2017). In practice, it also exhibits good performance in dealing with combinatorial optimization problems 

involving more than one optimization objective and constraining conditions (Roy, Dehuri, & Cho, 2011).

Let Ω = {X1,X2, … ,XD} be the solution space of the relocation problem. The PSO algorithm utilized a swarm of 
particles to search for relocation solutions (see details in Figure 4). Each particle denotes a candidate solution, 

and has position and velocity to indicate its status and movement in the search space. To improve the algorithmic 

efficiency, we coded a particle as an array of grid coordinates (i.e. the row and column index of each unit) of the 
relocated units, Xi = {(ui,u�
ifxi = 1,∀i = 1,2, … ,I}. The equally weighted aggregation of two optimization objectives 
i )
[Equations (5) and (6)] was employed as a fitness function to evaluate particles and find the best visited location 

|
|

of each particle (the local best, denoted lbest) and that of the entire swarm (the global best, denoted gbest). The 

particles iteratively update their locations based on previous experiences and move toward the optima as follows:

Vnew = w ∙ Vold + c1 ∙ rand ∙ (lbest − Xold) + c2 ∙ rand ∙ (gbest − Xold)

Xnew = Xold + Vnew

(10)

(11)

where X and V denote the location and velocity of a particle, w is an inertia weight to ensure particles move toward 
their previous directions, c1 and c2 are the coefficients to adjust the movements of particles to lbest and gbest, and 
rand is a random number between 0 and 1 that provides randomness for the solution‐searching process.

The PSO algorithm was implemented using Visual Studio C# and the GIS software components in ArcObject 

SDK 10.2. Based on the existing literature (Trelea, 2003; Jiang, Luo, & Yang, 2007), we first specified the value 

F I G U R E   4  Flowchart of the PSO algorithm for relocation optimization

LIU et aL.    |  9

range of each parameter of the PSO and then tested the sensitivity of fitness values in relocation solutions to 

different parameters within the ranges. The parameters that can obtain greater fitness values were selected. In 

detail, the population size was fixed to 50. The inertia weight w was set to 0.6 in the beginning and then gradually 

declined to 0.1 by iterations. Two learning factors, c1 and c2, equal 1.49, respectively. The maximum iteration of the 
algorithm was fixed to 2,000. The initial location of each particle was determined randomly under the constraining 

conditions, and the velocity was initialized to a random value that is close to zero. During the search process, the 

velocity of each particle was clamped within a range of [−12, 12] and would be modified to the near extremum if 

the value exceeded that range. Based on a bound‐handling mechanism (Padhye, Deb, & Mittal, 2013), the value 

at any dimension of a particle that violated the constraining conditions would be replaced by a random value in 

the feasible search space (i.e. the coordination of a random dwelling unit that is suitable for relocation and does 

not include the current particle). The iterative optimization process terminated when the maximum iteration was 

satisfied, and the best particle was decoded into a grid and output as the final relocation solution (Figure 4).

3.1 | Social networks under different development policies

This section examines the effects of two rural development policies (i.e. the balanced development of central vil‐

lages and the town center (Policy I) and the characteristic development strategy of central villages (Policy II) on the 

social communications of Liji Town. Figure 5 presents an empirical network and two simulated networks. It can be 

observed that the spatial patterns of central villages in the two simulated networks are different from that in the 

empirical network. Specifically, central villages in network C exhibit an even distribution in space with strong so‐

cial connections. The average distance from general villages to their nearest central villages or to the town center 

is smaller (1,964.94 m) than in networks A and B (2,732.75 and 2,526.74 m). A small distance to central villages or 

to the town center allows general villages to gain convenient access to public services. Policies I and II are capable

of improving the functions of central villages, which may impose a direct influence on the social connections of 

The differences of the three networks in terms of connection frequency and connection strength were further 

measured. Table 1 reports inflow/outflow frequencies and NSI values of different types of villages. It is evident 

that the town center has the greatest frequency and magnitude of connections in all three networks. The mean 

NSI  values  and  the  average  inflow/outflow  frequency  of  the  town  center  dramatically  exceed  those  of  central 

and general villages, which implies the dominant role of the town center in the rural system of China. Under two 

development scenarios, however, the leading role of the town center will be weakened, whereas the function of 

central villages will be enhanced. In networks B and C, the mean inflow frequency and the mean NSI values of the 

town center decrease compared with those in network A, and conversely, a significant increase of the mean NSI 

values occurs in central villages. As for general villages, a slightly increased magnitude and declined inflows were 

observed in two simulated networks. It is worth noting that the maximum NSI values of central villages are higher 

than those of the town center regardless of policy effects (by approximately 3.70, 14.47, and 20% in networks A, 

B, and C). Our field survey illustrates that this exception is highly correlated with the formation of Paotongdian 

central village. This village used to be the seat of Paotongdian Town and was merged into Liji Town in the year of 

2001. However, the town amalgamation did not cut off the social connections of farmers to Paotongdian.

3.2 | Comparative analysis of relocation scenarios

Three relocation scenarios—RA, RB, and RC—with impacts of the empirical network A, network B, and network C, 

were generated to explore the effect of policy‐induced social connections on relocation outcomes. The PSO with 

the fixed parameters was repeated for 20 runs in each scenario, and the statistics of three groups of fitness values 

are reported in Table 2. The small coefficient of variation of fitness values in each group (less than 0.02) demon‐

strates the stability of the PSO (Malczewski & Rinner, 2015). Furthermore, we performed a one‐way analysis of 

variance (ANOVA) on the grouped fitness values, and a statistically significant difference exists between three 

groups, F(df1 = 2, df2 = 57) = 183.38, p < .001. A Tukey post‐hoc test further suggests the significant difference of 
any two groups at p < .05.

Figure 6 presents relocation solutions in three scenarios. We evaluated three solutions from the aspects of 

spatial  pattern,  migration  distance,  and  migration  direction  of  relocated  settlements.  The  results  indicate  that 

a large proportion of demolished settlements were relocated at the fringe areas of the town center and central 

villages. Of all the villages, the town center attracts the greatest number of relocated dwelling units. The number 

of relocated settlements around the town center in policy‐influenced solutions is less than that in solution RA (by 

9.21 and 17.76%). Conversely, the average number of relocated settlements close to central and general villages 

in solutions RB and RC is approximately 2.69 and 8.06% larger than that in solution RA. Our results indicate that 

rural development policies can significantly change the migration directions of relocated farmers. Farmers tend to 

settle down nearby when the habitant conditions of candidate resettling villages are similar.

Table 3 reports the statistics of landscape pattern and relocation distance in the three solutions. The results 

suggest that relocation can improve the spatial compactness of rural settlements. Compared with the empirical 

land use map of 2015, the relocation solutions have increased mean patch areas and decreased number of patches 

and landscape shape index. Of the three relocation scenarios, the mean patch areas, landscape shape index, and 

mean patch areas of rural settlements only show a slight difference. However, the consideration of two rural de‐

velopment policies results in decreased relocation distance. The average relocation distance in scenarios RB and 

RC is smaller than that in scenario RA by approximately 14.45 and 34.40%, respectively. Meanwhile, the relocation 

distance shows a notable decrease (by 14.84%) under Policy II rather than Policy I.

Furthermore,  Pearson’s  correlation  analysis  was  performed  to  assess  the  relationship  between  the  area  of 

unchanged villages (OriArea), the connection strength (NSI), the inflow frequency (Infow), and the area of relocated 

settlements (RelArea, RelArea1, and RelArea2) in the three scenarios. The results are summarized in a scatterplot

(Figure 7). Overall, there was a strong, positive correlation between the inflow frequency and the area of relocated 

rural settlements in all three scenarios. Meanwhile, the increase in NSI and the area of unchanged villages were 

also  moderately  correlated  with  increased  relocated  rural  settlements.  The  results  suggest  the  significance  of 

connection strength and village size in the resettlement process.

3.3 | Discussion

The social connections between villages depict kin ties, daily movements, and activities of farmers, implying farm‐

ers’ preferences on the physical, socioeconomic, and cultural conditions of rural areas. During the process of rural 

development, these connections face reconstruction under different development policies. In traditional China, 

for example, the town center usually gained a majority of support from local governments and functioned as the 

unique political, economic, and cultural center in a village–town system. Consequently, the villages had to build 

close contacts with the town center for services, while only maintaining weak ties with each other (Murphy, 2002). 

Farmers from remote villages suffered various inconveniences in their daily lives. In contrast, two introduced poli‐

cies emphasized balanced and characteristic development of central villages as a key aspect of rural revitalization. 

The implementation of these two policies will increase capital investment in central villages, thereby promoting 

economic development and improving infrastructure and public services. The connections between remote vil‐

lages and newly developed central villages will be established, while those between remote villages and the town 

center will become replaceable. As an applicable proof of these policies, the TOD strategy maximizing public ser‐

vice provision within walking distance of transportation facilities has changed the way that villagers connect with 

each other (Cervero & Day, 2008). Moreover, social connections are highly correlated with featured destinations 

as well as population distribution, infrastructure, and public services (Smailes, Argent, & Griffin, 2002; El‐adaway, 

Abotaleb, & Vechan, 2017). Policy II aims for village characteristics on the basis of balanced rural development. 

Hence, there is no doubt that the implementation of Policy II can promote inter‐village connections of farmers, 

especially connections in terms of cultural pursuits, entertainment, and tourism.

Relocation planning is an interactive process between local government and farmers (Long & Liu, 2016). Thus, 

scientific relocation solutions should be capable of integrating the top‐down decisions of government with the 

bottom‐up expectations of farmers. Relocation plans that overlook the interests of farmers may run into problems 

in practice. For example, long relocation distance, broken social contacts, or inappropriate service provision would 

drive farmers to move back to their previous settlements. Our study approved the significance of incorporating 

the social connections of farmers into relocation plans (Tian et al., 2016). We found that the relocation solutions in 

balanced and characteristic development scenarios can reduce the migration distance and encourage farmers to 

resettle around central villages instead of the town center (Dikmen, 2018). As the existing literature suggests, un‐

derstanding the changed nature of social connections can provide solid support for farsighted relocation planning 

(Wei, Wei, Cao, & Li, 2016). Notably, the spatial optimization approach can provide diverse relocation options for 

rural planners. By exploring the sensitivity of relocation outcomes to different policies, objectives, and constraints,

F I G U R E   6  The relocation solutions with social network impacts in different policy scenarios (RA, relocation 
solution with impact of empirical network; RB, relocation solution in context of balanced development policy; 
and RC, relocation solution in context of characteristic development policy)

the planner can obtain potential feedback and improve the policies to reduce the implementation risk. To this end, 

our results can be used to examine the significance of the characteristic development policy in rural China.

It should also be noticed that further challenges exist in terms of inter‐village social connections due to incom‐

plete data and regional interactions (Ford & Mouzas, 2010; Han et al., 2014). The construction of a social network 

relies greatly on field survey data, which are usually collected via questionnaire. A variety of driving forces (e.g. 

sampling  method,  survey  cost,  and  skills  of  data  collectors)  may  influence  data  integrity  and  usability  (Haining, 

2003). Existing studies employed the bootstrap sampling approach to enhance data collection so as to avoid the 

effect  of  data  incompleteness  (Han  et  al.,  2014).  Other  approaches  (e.g.  spatial  sampling)  that  can  promote  the

representativeness of observations should also be paid more attention in the future. In addition, regional interac‐

tion remains another challenge for the network modeling of social connections (Smailes, 1995). The effects of ex‐

ternal interactions (e.g. population migration) should be taken into account as a driving force of farmer associations.

Rural relocation benefits rural development acceleration and rural poverty alleviation (Zhou, Guo, Liu, Wu, & Li, 

2018). However, it is usually difficult to carry out in practice because of the conflicts between the government

decisions and the farmers’ interests. Insightful understanding of farmers’ intentions in advance of the relocation 

decision‐making is essential. Social connections representing farmers’ interests are not static, but vary with rural 

decline/development. Different development policies will cause a change in inter‐village communications, which 

will exert uncertain impact on relocation solutions. Thus, a spatial optimization framework for rural relocation was 

proposed to promote the applicability of relocation solutions in this study. Different from previous related studies, 

this model incorporated policy‐induced social connections into the relocation process by using an integration of 

GIS and PSO. Empirical inter‐village connections were modified to adapt two future development scenarios, rural 

balanced and characteristic development policies. Maximum social connections between the origin and destina‐

tion of relocated settlements were taken into account as one of the optimization objectives for rural relocation.

The results of our case study demonstrated the changes in inter‐village connections under different rural pol‐

icy scenarios, and their influence on the spatial distribution of relocated settlements. The major contribution of 

the incorporation of policy‐induced social connections is to improve the adaptation of relocation plans to future 

rural development. In the characteristic development scenario, for example, the migration distance of relocated 

residences exhibits a significant decline but with only a slight variation of spatial land use compactness. Most of 

the dispersed settlements were arranged around central villages rather than around the town center. These ar‐

rangements have the potential to maintain kinship and friendship relations of migrated farmers and improve the 

feasibility of the relocation projects.

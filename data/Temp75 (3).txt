Contemporary  public  buildings  are  becoming  conglomer‐

ates of open, semi‐open and closed spaces, with indoor, out‐

door and underground sections. For humans and robots to 

navigate seamlessly through such environments, new flex‐

ible approaches need to be developed. Navigation systems 

generally rely on a network (nodes and edges) as an abstrac‐

tion  of  underlying  space  availability.  However,  indoor  and 

outdoor networks have different origins. While indoor sys‐

tems rely on indoor space subdivision approaches, current 

outdoor  systems  utilize  road‐based  network  approaches. 

Linking  such  networks  via  particular  nodes  is  possible  but 

restrictive.  Many  spaces  in  the  built  environment  are  not 

strictly  indoor  or  outdoor  spaces  and  are thus  often  omit‐

ted  from  navigation  networks,  further  limiting  navigation 

options.  To  overcome  these  shortcomings,  we  introduce  a 

new space definition framework in which the entire built en‐

vironment is categorized into indoor, outdoor, semi‐indoor 

and semi‐outdoor spaces. We provide strict definitions for 

the four space categories. Our framework allows the same 

navigation  network  extraction  approaches  to  be  used  and 

therefore enables seamless indoor/outdoor path computa‐

tion  for  single  or  combinations  of  locomotion  modes.  The 

notions of semi‐indoor and semi‐outdoor spaces offer new 

options for further tailoring of the navigation path with re‐

spect to environmental factors, which we demonstrate with 

two use cases.

Cities worldwide are expanding in size, height, and depth. Public buildings are growing more complex and incorpo‐

rate a large variety of activities. Citizens can access the buildings on foot, by car or using other wheeled devices. 

They can drive trailers or child buggies or can be in wheelchairs. Robots are increasingly in use for cleaning, guid‐

ance or providing services. This complexity requires an understanding of the implications of building structures 

and their relation to the surrounding environment. New approaches to support this are needed which would allow 

seamless navigation in indoor/outdoor environments and take modes of locomotion into consideration.

In  this  research  we  investigate  the  space  required  for  navigation  of  humans  or  robots,  here  called  agents, 

which have different locomotion modes (i.e., walking, driving or flight) and can vary in size and height. Although 

the indoor and outdoor environments have different characteristics, space constraints and obstacles (Li, 2008; 

Yan, Shang, Yu, Zhiyong, & Tang, 2016) or scale and dimension (Richter, Winter, & Santosa, 2011; Yang & Worboys, 

2011b), navigation aspects are the same: agents move from one space to another, as long as the space is free of 

obstacles and accessible/fit to navigate. Therefore, it is essential to consistently identify and represent spaces 

(Rüetschi, 2007; Rüetschi & Timpf, 2004; Winter, 2012).

Space‐based approaches to defining a path for movement have been well studied in indoor space research. 

Commonly,  spaces  are  represented  (explicitly)  as  closed  volumes,  which  are  bounded  by  physical  or  virtual 

(non‐existing) elements (Isikdag, Zlatanova, & Underwood, 2013). Then the Poincaré duality (Munkres, 1984) is 

primarily  utilized  to  generate  a  navigation  network.  In  particular,  this  method  abstracts  spaces  as  nodes,  and 

represents their spatial connectivity (accessibility) relationships as edges. Several concepts for the derivation of 

navigation networks reported in the literature (Becker, Nagel, & Kolbe, 2009a; Boguslawski & Gold, 2009; Diakité 

& Zlatanova, 2018; Lee et al., 2014; Zlatanova, Liu, & Sithole, 2013) rely on this approach.

In contrast, road and street networks (Millonig & Schechtner, 2007; Vanclooster, Van de Weghe, & De Maeyer, 

2016) are the main sources of navigation networks in current outdoor navigation systems. Such networks con‐

sider only roads, bicycle lanes and pavements. This practice often leads to incorrect or even restrictive paths for 

some agents, such as pedestrians and drones (Bogdahn & Coors, 2009). Commonly, outdoor navigation networks 

derived from roads/streets are integrated into indoor networks by just gluing them together via anchor nodes  

(Li, 2016). This might lead to complications for specific agents because they have to follow paths on networks 

 designed  for  different  locomotion  modes  (Nikander,  Järvi,  Usman,  &  Virrantaus,  2013;  Teo  &  Cho,  2016; 

Vanclooster & De Maeyer, 2012). Furthermore, many spaces, which are neither indoors nor outdoors, are simply 

omitted (e.g., gardens, backyards or passages) and not modeled in any of the networks. As a result many normally 

accessible spaces are excluded from navigation networks, forcing agents to detour. Therefore, we argue that a 

unified space‐based approach would be a powerful mechanism for the entire built environment and would provide 

a uniform method for network derivation.

Outdoor space is commonly perceived as unbounded, connected and unoccupied (https://en.wikipedia.org/

wiki/Space). Objects on the ground such as streets, pavements, squares, and rivers can provide some indications 

for space enclosure, but many spaces would remain unbounded in the vertical direction. In contrast, indoor space 

is limited by physical boundaries (Zlatanova et al., 2013). However, there are many space configurations that are 

difficult to classify sharply as indoors or outdoors. Examples of such cases are overpasses, shelters for bus stops, 

gas  stations,  and  porches.  These  have  both  indoor  and  outdoor  characteristics,  but  cannot  be  seen  clearly  as 

either. Such spaces are referred to by different names in the literature (e.g., semi‐enclosed, semi‐indoor, semi‐out‐

door), and, as shown in the next section, that leads to many contradictions and ambiguities, greatly complicating 

their consideration in a model (Winter, 2012).

New ways to model buildings and cities are increasingly being adopted, supported by international standards such 

as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) or City Geography Markup Language (CityGML, Gröger, Kolbe, Czerwinski, & 

Nagel, 2008). The current versions of these standards include representations of spaces as three‐dimensional objects, 

YAN et al.    |  3

but still this is limited to the indoor environment. With this work, we aim to introduce systematic and robust defini‐

tions of all spaces of the built environment that agents may move in. These definitions will support the development 

of algorithms to enclose open and semi‐open spaces and derive an agent‐tailored network for navigation. As such, we 

aim to ensure a uniform spatial model that enables seamless navigation throughout the environments.

This remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews space definitions and concepts. Section 3 

outlines the generic space definition framework and illustrates it with examples. Section 4 demonstrates the frame‐

work for two use cases. Section 5 concludes with next steps related to further specifications, refinements, and tests.

Generally,  definitions  of  space  share  four  unanimously  approved  characteristics:  they  are  boundless,  extensi‐

ble, three‐dimensional, and can be occupied (Zlatanova, Liu, Sithole, Zhao, & Mortari, 2014). In the current re‐

search, four classifications of space are given: indoor, outdoor, semi‐indoor and semi‐outdoor space. While there 

is  agreement  on  indoor  and  outdoor  space,  semi‐indoor  semi‐outdoor  spaces  are  ill‐defined  and  contradictory 

(Yan, Diakite, & Zlatanova, 2018).

2.1 | Indoor space and outdoor space

Commonly,  outdoor  space  is  perceived  as  unoccupied  space  outside  buildings,  and  no  strict  definitions  are 

found in the literature. By contrast, research dealing with indoor environments has attempted to provide formal 

definitions. Broadly, a physically enclosed space, such as a building or house, is referred to as an indoor space. 

IndoorGML (Lee et al., 2014) defines outdoor space as bounded by architectural components. However, defini‐

tions are found that, in an attempt to be explicit, may lead to contradictions. Afyouni, Ray, and Claramunt (2010) 

defines an indoor space as a built environment (such as a house or a commercial shopping center) hosting human 

activity. Winter (2012) defines an indoor space by analogy to the human body. The body is a container enclosed by 

the skin; similarly, walls, floors, roofs, and fences are skin. According to these definitions a veranda or inner court 

would be an outdoor space. Indoor space in Yang and Worboys (2011a) refers to the built environment rather 

than the natural environment. It covers the enclosed interiors of buildings above and below ground that afford 

platforms for human activities. By this interpretation of space, caves and mines are not indoor spaces.

2.2 | Spaces between indoors and outdoors

Spaces between indoors and outdoors are mostly mentioned in research related to building micro‐climates. Many 

papers have discussed architectural designs to improve residential and building micro‐climates and reduce cooling 

and heating energy requirements (Du, Bokel, & van den Dobbelsteen, 2014; Kim, Kim, & Leigh, 2011). Four kinds 

of definitions can be identified:

etc.

•  Outdoor space (Van Timmeren & Turrin, 2009). A space that is not entirely enclosed by walls, windows, doors, 

•  Semi‐indoor space (Amutha & Nanmaran, 2014; Chengappa, Edwards, Bajpai, Shields, & Smith, 2007; Kim et al., 

2011; Kim, Park, & Kim, 2008; Liu, Chen, Liu, Yu, & Bie, 2013; Monteiro & Alucci, 2007; Turrin, Kilian, Stouffs, 

& Sariyildiz, 2009). A space covered with canopies that is related to a building, and can combine indoor and 

outdoor climate conditions.

•  Semi‐outdoor (Cao, Luo, Li, & Zhu, 2017; Du et al., 2014; Hwang & Lin, 2007; Indraganti, 2010; Lin, Andrade, 

Hwang, Oliveira, & Matzarakis, 2008; Pagliarini & Rainieri, 2011b), semi‐enclosed (He & Hoyano, 2010; Kim, 

YAN et al.4  |    

outdoor conditions.

example.

Kato, & Murakami, 2001), or semi‐open space (Philokyprou, Michael, Thravalou, & Ioannou, 2017). A space that 

is not entirely enclosed, and has some settings, including human‐made structures, that moderate the effects of 

•  Connection/transition zones/buffer areas/transitional spaces between indoors and outdoors (Kray et al., 2013; 

Li, 1994; Slingsby & Raper, 2008; Winter, 2012). These are spaces that are not well defined and given only by 

2.2.1 | Semi‐indoor space

The definition of semi‐indoor space is related to the roof, because it can have a significant influence on the climate 

of the space. Turrin et al. (2009) defined a covered space as a semi‐indoor space which is partially surrounded 

by indoor spaces. Van Timmeren and Turrin (2009) presented research in which a special roof is used as cover 

to create a semi‐indoor space to passively avoid uncomfortable (cold and hot) conditions, thereby reducing the 

energy demand significantly. The semi‐indoor space defined in the research of van Hooff and Blocken (2009) is a 

semi‐indoor stadium, which has a roof that can be used to enclose the indoor volume to a relatively large extent. 

Thus, spectators and equipment are protected from wind, rain, and snow. This space still has direct openings to 

the outside. In contrast, Bouyer, Vinet, Delpech, and Carré (2007) took the stadium as a semi‐outdoor space in 

research to assess the thermal comfort. Indoor and semi‐indoor spaces are also defined as GPS‐denied scenarios 

(Ortiz, Bonnin‐Pascual, Garcia‐Fidalgo, & Company, 2015).

2.2.2 | Semi‐outdoor space

The  literature  also  refers  to  several  definitions  of  semi‐outdoor  space.  Pagliarini  and  Rainieri  (2011a)  took 

the  space  which  is  partially  open  toward  the  outdoor  environment  as  semi‐outdoor  space.  Similarly,  in  later 

research they reinforce the concept that an outdoor space partly enclosed by a semi‐transparent pitched roof 

(e.g., glass roof) is a semi‐outdoor space (Pagliarini & Rainieri, 2011b). Spagnolo and De Dear (2003) defined 

the semi‐outdoors as locations that, “while still being exposed to the outdoor environment in most respects, 

include human‐made structures that moderate the effects of the outdoor conditions.” Examples include roofs 

acting  as  radiation  shields  or  walls  acting  as  vertical  windbreaks.  Hwang  and  Lin  (2007)  defined  the  semi‐ 

outdoors  as  exterior  spaces  that  are  sheltered  and  attached  to  the  building.  The  micro‐climate  of  the  semi‐

outdoor (partially enclosed) space usually has a lower effect of  wind and is less hot than the outdoor space 

(Pagliarini  &  Rainieri,  2011b).  People  may  prefer  to  use  such  spaces  for  drying  laundry,  growing  plants  

(Kim et al., 2011), sheltering from the sun and wind (He & Hoyano, 2010), and similar activities (Kim et al., 2008; 

Lin, 2009; Nasir, Salim, & Yaman, 2014).

Semi‐outdoor  space  in  Turrin,  Von  Buelow,  Kilian,  and  Stouffs  (2012)  refers  to  areas  covered  by  large 

roofs, leaving a direct connection with the outdoor environment. Museums and cultural center gardens, uni‐

versity  campuses,  shopping  and  leisure  areas,  hotels  and  resorts  are  just  a  few  examples  of  built  environ‐

ments where covered semi‐outdoor spaces are commonly integrated. Lin, Matzarakis, and Huang (2006) gives 

bus shelters as an example of semi‐outdoor space, as they offer shelter provided in the form of a roof. The 

semi‐outdoor space in Yang, Wong, and Jusuf (2013) refers to the internal architectural space with maximum  

exposure to the lobbies, corridors, atrium, courtyards, passages, and verandas. In Goshayeshi, Shahidan, Khafi, 

and Ehtesham (2013), semi‐outdoor spaces are defined as the spaces which are partly open in the direction  

of  the  outdoors.  Three  categories  are  introduced:  inside  the  buildings,  such  as  the  entry  atrium;  covered 

spaces; and shaded spaces, situated in an outdoor environment entirely. Covered streets are included in this 

category.

2.2.3 | Space definitions concerning sensor reception

Researchers have also attempted to distinguish between indoor and outdoor spaces from a different perspective. 

Wang, Chang, Li, Shi, and Chen (2016) provides a space classification according GPS signal reception as follows: open 

outdoors, semi‐outdoors, light indoors, and deep indoors (see Figure 1). Areas which are open to the sky and can 

access sufficient numbers of satellites for positioning are open outdoors. Urban canyon and wooded areas are clas‐

sified as semi‐outdoors. Light indoor areas are similar to semi‐outdoor areas, but inside the building. These are areas 

around windows, which still have some satellite availability. Deep indoors refers to places with no satellite coverage.

Another space classification is provided by Zhou, Zheng, Li, Li, and Shen (2012), in which based on their space defi‐

nitions, they used a lightweight sensing service to detect the indoor/outdoor environment more efficiently to provide 

information  for mobile applications. The authors distinguish between indoor, outdoor, semi‐open, and semi‐outdoor 

spaces. The surrounding areas of the building (e.g., paths near buildings) or the semi‐open building spaces (e.g., covering 

corridors) are considered as semi‐outdoor spaces. Figure 2 illustrates the definition and gives examples and representa‐

tive scenes for the three different spaces. This definition approach is application‐specific and unclear in many situations.

2.3 | Discussion

In summary, from previous research, it can be concluded that indoor and outdoor space is well defined to a certain 

degree. The general definition of indoor space is a space (inside a building) bounded by wall, floor, and ceiling, 

while the outdoor space is everything else outside the building, or in the open air (Wang et al., 2016; Zhou et al.,

2012).  However,  the  definitions  reviewed  fail  when  spaces  are  semi‐enclosed.  For  example,  the  gas  station  in 

Figure 3 is neither an indoor nor an outdoor space; it might be seen as a semi‐indoor or semi‐outdoor space or 

could remain unclassified (Zhou et al., 2012) according to the definitions discussed.

Nevertheless, there are still some tendencies that can be observed; for example, spaces with roof(s) are com‐

monly defined as semi‐indoors, although there are a few researchers who consider them semi‐outdoors because 

they are open to the outdoors. In the following sections we present our space definition framework that takes 

into account all the previously discussed notions and comes up with a generic and formal definition framework.

In  our  framework  we  define  four  types  of  spaces,  namely  indoor  (I‐space),  outdoor  (O‐space),  semi‐indoor  (sI‐

space), and semi‐outdoor (sO‐space). Space is then formally defined as the union of I‐space, O‐space, sI‐space and 

sO‐space, expressed as:

where S, I, O, sI, and sO denote space, I‐space, O‐space, sI‐space, and sO‐space, respectively.

S = I ∪ O ∪ sI ∪ sO

3.1 | Assumptions and notions

We rely on two central assumptions in this work:

1.  Everything  is  space.  Agents  move  from  one  space  to  another,  and  each  space  must  belong  to  one  of 

2.  There is no difference between indoor and outdoor space. Agents can move indoors and outdoors in a similar 

the  four  defined  categories.

way, visiting unoccupied and accessible spaces.

YAN et al.    |  7

As seen from the previous section, indoor space definitions rely on two basic building elements: roof and wall. These 

elements play a critical role in defining the structural boundaries for space, because the ground or floor has always 

been assumed to be present. In this work, we will use the generalized notions of top and side instead, which allows 

us to consider more complex boundary configurations. For example, a roof is a top while the opposite is not always 

true. Similarly, a wall is always a side, but a side is not necessarily a wall. Two other notions, top closure and side closure, 

are introduced to quantify the level of closure. While top and side are objects, top closure and side closure have only 

numerical values. We define top, side, and the two coefficients top closure, and side closure as follows.

Top. A top is a structure above the ground, with the ability to cover a space under it. It provides a physical or 

virtual upper boundary to a space. A physical top can serve as protection from weather conditions (e.g., rain, wind, 

cold, heat) or as a limitation to estimate clearance (e.g., for flying or carrying large items). The areas delineated with 

red rectangles in Figures 4a and b illustrate respectively a roof and a top. The top can be a human‐made or natural 

structure/object (e.g., wood, stone, tree).

Side. A side is a structure that encloses a space from the surrounding directions. It stands as a physical or vir‐

tual lateral boundary of a given space. A physical side can act as protection from weather conditions (e.g., wind) or 

as a limitation to estimate entry possibilities (e.g., getting around to find a door, or flying above). To a certain ex‐

tent, a physical side is more like a fence, although it may have similar functions to those of a wall, such as carrying 

a load (e.g., load‐bearing pillars). For example, a side can be used to delimit or prevent people entering or exiting. 

The blue rectangles in Figures 4c and d illustrate respectively a wall and a side. Similarly to a top, a side can be 

human‐made (e.g., wall, fence) or a natural structure/object (e.g., tree, river).

Top closure (CT). The top closure is a coefficient that expresses how much a space is physically bounded from 

its top. It corresponds to the ratio between the substantial (material) area and the entire area of the top boundary 

structure.

Side closure (CS). The side closure is a coefficient that expresses how much a space is physically bounded on its 

sides. It is the ratio between the substantial (material) area and the entire side area of the side boundary structure.

Thus, the closure (C), that is, the ratio between the enclosed area and the total area, can be computed as:

C = Ae∕At(2)

(2)

where C corresponds to either CT or CS, while Ae and At are the area of the enclosed part and the total area of the top/
side, respectively. With all those notions, we can provide the definitions of I‐, O‐, sI‐ and sO‐spaces.

To provide an estimate of CT and CS, we introduce five thresholds: α, β, γ, δ, and η. By controlling these thresh‐
olds, it is possible to classify the spaces. Figure 5 offers a visual clue as to how these thresholds define the bound‐
aries and consequently the different spaces. On the two axes, the values of CT and CS are represented, where 0 

means no closure and 1 means total closure.

3.1.1 | Thresholds related to CT

Three threshold values are related to CT: α, β and η.

•  η allows us to distinguish between indoor and outdoor spaces. A space with a CT ≥ η is either an I‐space or an 

sI‐space. Otherwise, it is an O‐space or an sO‐space.

•  α is a closure value of O‐spaces. Specifically, a space with a CT ≥ α cannot be an O‐space. It must be sO‐space, 

•  β is the lower threshold of I‐spaces. Thus, a space with CT < β cannot be an I‐space. I must be sI‐space, sO‐space, 

I‐space, or sI‐space.

or O‐space.

η illustrates how critical the notion of CT is in determining whether a space is closer to an indoor or outdoor space; see 
Figure 5a. The notion of indoor space is hardly feasible without a quantified value of a top bounding element to space, 
as reflected in the literature. But different constraints apply to CS; see Figure 5b.

Two threshold values are related to CS: γ and δ.

sI‐space, sO‐space, or O‐space.

Unlike CT, which gives the meaning of the boundary between indoors and outdoors, CS is less critical in our framework. 

It provides estimates for the limits to the I‐space and O‐space but does not affect the sO‐space and sI‐space. For this 
reason, only two thresholds are introduced and they must be combined with the three thresholds of the CT. Using the 

closure coefficients and their ranges, we can give a formal definition of the four space types.

3.2 | Space definitions

We define a space S(CS, CT) as being one of the four types of space, as follows:

S(CS, CT) =

Figure 6 illustrates the process of space identification. As mentioned above, CT is critical to distinguish be‐

tween  the  two  indoor  and  two  outdoor  spaces.  More  top  closure  intuitively  leads  from  outdoors  to  indoors. 

Outdoor space is actually never directly physically bounded, but rather indirectly bounded by structures of the

blue‐sky‐lands cape.jpg, respectively

3.3 | Classification of selected examples

A challenging part of the proposed framework relates to the setting of the five thresholds. To provide a sense 

of the types of closure and help understand the selected thresholds, we use a simple rectangular structure and 

provide four example closures; see Figure 8.

The size of the example structure in Figure 8 is At = 2 m2. Ae has different values in the four cases. In case (a), 
Ae = 0.1 m2 and therefore C = 0.05. Similarly, the closure of the remaining cases can be computed. Ae (gray parts) 
for cases (b), (c), and (d) is 1.2 m2, 1.9 m2, and 2 m2, and their C values are 0.6, 0.95, and 1, respectively. Visually, 

cases (a) and (b) give the impression of being not well sealed, while cases (c) and (d) appear better sealed. On the 

basis of this visual inspection, we set the following values for the five thresholds: α = 0.05, β = 0.95, γ = 0.05, 
δ = 0.95, and η = 0.6. This implies that if a space has a top where CT ≥ 0.6, it is an I‐space, otherwise it is an O‐space. 
Then, if CT ≥ 0.95 and CS ≥ 0.95, the space is an I‐space, otherwise it is an sI‐space. If CT and CS are less than 0.05 

the space is an O‐space, otherwise it is ansO‐space:

F I G U R E   8  Structure with four different closure cases, in which the gray parts are enclosed ( Ae), while the 
white parts are open. The size of the example structure (At) is 2 × 1 (m2)

Figure 9 illustrates the effect of these example thresholds on the boundaries between the different spaces. 
The normalization of the coefficients CT and CS gives the wrong impression that I‐space and O‐space are very 

insignificant and most of the spaces can be classified as sO‐space and sI‐space. As will be seen in the examples 

below, many real‐world cases have closure close to 1. This means that the orange and green areas in the figure, 

although showing up as very large, represent a relatively small number of real‐world cases.

Using  the  five  thresholds  introduced  above,  we  illustrate  how  CT  and  CS  are  estimated  in  three  examples; 

see Figure 10. The spaces that have to be classified are sketched as closed boxes. We estimate the area of each 

polygon of the box, compute the closure per polygon and average the closures when more than one polygon is 

involved.

The first case is the pergola structure, which has dimensions 4 × 1 × 2.5 = 10. The total area At of the top 
is 4 × 1 = 4 and Ae is 2.5, because the top has 25 beams (each is 1 × 0.1). Thus, CT = Ae/At = 2.5/4 = 0.625. The 
space  of  interest  has  four  sides  and  one  bottom,  of  which  two  sides  (left  and  right)  are  concrete  walls  with

respectively

dimensions  2.5  ×  1  each.  The  other  two  (front  and  back)  sides  (each  is  2.5  ×  4)  are  entirely  open.  Therefore, 
CS = Ae/At = 5/25 = 0.2, where Ae = 2.5 × 1 × 2 = 5 and At = 2.5 × 1 × 2+2.5 × 4 × 2 = 25. The second case concerns 
the eaves in Figure 10. CT is 1, since it is a completely enclosed. This space has one totally enclosed side (each is 

2.5 × 10) and three open sides (2.5 × 10+2.5 × 1.5 × 2). Therefore, the average of the four enclosures is computed 
and CS = 0.43. The third case is a roof terrace. The space has dimensions (12 × 12 × 3). It has no top, hence its CT = 0 
and CS = 0.67. Considering the proposed values of the four thresholds, we can classify the pergola and eaves both 

as sI‐spaces and the roof terrace as an sO‐space.

Figure 11 shows more examples of built scenes with a number of built environments: (a) room; (b) open air; 

(c) gas station; (d) overhanging roof part; (e) overpass; (f) porch; (g) bus stand; (h) courtyard; (i) roof terrace with 

outside stairs; (j) yard with fence; (k) road with side fence; and (l) stadium. We have estimated their coefficients 
CT and CS following the same approach as explained above. The results of the computations are given Table 1.

As is visible from these examples, many of the cases can easily be classified if their dimensions and closure 

are known. However, the reality might be not that simple: the dimensions might be not available or it might not 

be possible to estimate the closure. A good example is the stadium. In our case we have defined two spaces: one 

above the football field and one (or more) under the stadium roof. However, if we want to consider the entire 

space (football field and audience space) then the stadium space might appear to be an sI‐space. Other examples 

are weakly closed spaces for which it is difficult to conclude on closure. Figure 12 shows more cases of weakly 

YAN et al.top‐bounded spaces for which the top has only a decorative (Figure 12b) or structural reinforcement (Figure 12c) 
function. The spaces below them are O‐spaces, due to the low CT that those structures present. In Figure 12c, the 
space corresponds to an sO‐space, although the CS is made up of vegetation fences and houses.

Furthermore, it  cannot be concluded that specific structures can always be associated with the same type 

of space. For example, Figure 13 illustrates the case of a bridge between two buildings. While the first one is an 

I‐space (Figure 13a), the second one is an sI‐space (Figure 13b), and the third one an sO‐space (Figure 13c). The

Having defined the spaces, we can use the Poincaré duality to derive a network automatically. For this purpose 

the following steps have to be completed. First, sI‐spaces, sO‐spaces and O‐spaces have to be closed with virtual 

boundaries. Second, each space has to be approximated with a node, which is usually a point inside the space. 

Third, the connectivity between the spaces has to be established, and this will be represented by an edge. The 

steps to follow are very similar to the approach for creating indoor navigation networks utilizing primal and dual 

spaces (Becker et al., 2009a; Becker, Nagel, & Kolbe, 2009b; Worboys, 2011).

The  proposed  space  definition  framework  and  its  use  for  seamless  navigation  paths  computation  are  illus‐

trated  by  two  use  cases  using  synthetic  data.  The  synthetic  neighborhood  model  in  Figure  14  consists  of  17 

buildings (B1, …, B17), a street for vehicles only (S1), two zebra crossings (Z1 and Z2), a garden with a fence (G1), a 

river (R1), a bridge (P1), and several trees (green dots). The remaining areas (A1 and A2) are accessible to everyone. 

Three buildings (B2, B12, and B17) contain eaves. B12 also has a yard with a fence. B11 is a courtyard and B15 is 

an indoor parking lot.

4.1 | Closing and classifying spaces for navigation

To apply the same approaches developed for indoor spaces (e.g., space subdivision in Diakité & Zlatanova, 2018; 

Zlatanova  et  al.,  2013)  and  automatically  derive  the  network  for  all  spaces,  the  latter  should  be  geometrically

represented as closed objects. The definitions proposed here allow us to describe the semi‐enclosed and outdoor 

spaces  accordingly.  The  enclosing  methods  simply  rely  on  the  possible  closures  as  illustrated  in  Figure  15.  If  the 

space has sides and tops at the same time, no matter what closures they have, the boundaries of the space can be 

determined by them (see, for example, the sI‐spaces in Figures 15b, d, and e). Otherwise, if the space has only a top, 

the sides can be estimated by projecting the top on the ground (see Figures 15a–c and e–g; see also Yan et al., 2018) 

if the space has sides only, a virtual top can be estimated by a predefined maximum height adapted to the needs of 

the agents, for example, 3 m in this case (see boundaries of the sO‐spaces in Figures 15d, e, g, and i). A possible way 

to get the outdoor spaces is to rely on the geometry of the footprints in data models, and then the necessary height 

can also be estimated (see the O‐spaces in Figures 15h and j).

We calculated the CT and CS of the virtually closed spaces to determine their category according to our frame‐
work, for instance, sI‐spaces in Figure 15a, where CT = 1 and CS = 0.44. Similarly, all spaces in the area can be clas‐

sified as I‐space, O‐space, sI‐space, or sO‐space. There are several sI‐spaces: the eaves of buildings (B2, B12, and 

B17), the roof of the gas station (B3), the porch of a building (B11), the bridge (P1), the building bridges (between 

B9 and B10, between B8 and B14), as well as the trees. The courtyard (B11) and the garden (G1) are sO‐spaces. It 

F I G U R E   1 5  Closing and classifying spaces for navigation

YAN et al.is worth noting that the sides of G1 consist of two parts, the fence and the river. The CS of the garden is an inter‐

esting case and is estimated at 0.85 (see Figure 15i). Indeed, the river is regarded as a fully enclosing boundary, 

which is fair when considering this space for pedestrian/vehicle navigation.

4.2 | Case descriptions

4.2.1 | Pedestrian navigation case

Suppose a pedestrian wants to go to building B7 from B1 on a stormy day and tries to walk under shelter as much 

as possible. From the navigation perspective, a convenient path for this case would include as many I‐spaces and 

sI‐spaces as possible. A second preference would include the sO‐spaces when the sI‐spaces are not available. This 

is because I‐spaces and sI‐spaces have tops that can serve as shelters against rain and wind, while sO‐spaces can 

mostly act as shelters against wind. Figures 16a and b illustrate all the spaces and all the sI‐spaces and sO‐spaces 

a pedestrian can use.

YAN et al.18  |    

4.2.2 | Vehicle navigation case

Suppose, on a very hot day, a car is at the gas station (B3). After refueling, the driver wants to find a free but shady 

place to park. Indoor parking would generally be the appropriate destination for this purpose, but to emphasize 

the  advantages  of  our  framework,  we  will  use  sI‐spaces  for  this  case.  All  spaces  for  a  vehicle  can  be  seen  in 

Figure 16c, and all the sI‐spaces and sO‐spaces are shown in Figure 16d.

4.3 | Space subdivision and navigation paths

After enclosing and classifying spaces, they are subdivided into subspaces. Figure 17 demonstrates the O‐space 

subdivision. For pedestrian and vehicle, the spaces involved are different, such as the sI‐spaces (formed by bal‐

conies) of B5, since the vehicle cannot visit them. We then extracted spaces as navigation nodes based on the 

Poincaré duality.

4.4 | Pedestrian navigation path

Here we show the extraction of the navigation path for a pedestrian wanting to go from B1 to B7 (Figure 18). In 

this case, the paths illustrated in Figure 18a correspond to sI‐spaces, and sO‐spaces will be potentially involved 

in navigation between the starting point and desired destination. Figure 18b is the path that considers the con‐

straints of a given agent, the weather conditions in this case. Rain makes pedestrians prefer the most covered 

way, as they want to be exposed as little as possible. With that in mind, the shortest path with the most sheltered 

spaces (including the eaves of B2, B11, B12, and B17, and even sI‐spaces resulting from trees) is more convenient 

for the agent.

4.5 | Vehicle navigation path

Based on the requirements of the driver, free and shady places are needed for parking. In our definition frame‐

work, the desired destination is either an I‐space or an sI‐space. Current navigation systems, being restricted to 

road networks, cannot offer any navigation path for this case. Our definition framework can address this issue by 

including potential destination candidates, the sI‐spaces in Figure 17b. Finally, adding the shortest distance in the 

constraints of the optimal criteria, the sI‐spaces under the trees can be found. Figure 19a illustrates the spaces 

that are involved in this process, and Figure 19b shows the path and the destination.

In  this  article  we  propose  a  generic  space  definition  framework.  We  have  defined  four  types  of  space:  indoor 

(I‐space), outdoor (O‐space), semi‐indoor (sI‐space) and semi‐outdoor (sO‐space). Following this framework, any 

space can be classified uniquely into one of the four categories, which provides a basis for integrated and seamless 

indoor/outdoor navigation. Based on the proposed definitions, sI‐spaces and sO‐spaces can be used in navigation 

systems, providing the ability to further tune the paths according to the navigating agents’ requirements. sI‐ and 

sO‐spaces are flexible and can be controlled by thresholds. The primary benefit of the proposed framework is 
the  unification  of  the  spatial  definition  of  the  indoor,  outdoor  and  intermediate  environments,  by  their  CT  and 
CS values. Thus, it is possible for any spatial model to rely on it to use the same network extraction approaches 

YAN et al.20  |    

across the built environment, thereby providing a seamless navigation solution. The framework can be used for 

different types of agents, such as walking (pedestrians), rolling (trolleys, wheelchairs), flying objects (e.g., drones) 

or combinations of these.

Future work will concentrate on further elaboration and testing of the current work as follows:

a  Determining the threshold values in the definition of different applications/situations. Quantitative approaches 
could help obtain better estimation of how navigation agents perceive CT and CS, what they consider as open/

closed or closer to the indoor/outdoor environment.

b  Identifying the different spaces automatically in three‐dimensional models; the space identification in this arti‐

cle is reliant on human interpretations, which could be time‐intensive in practical cases.

c  Defining  a  typology  of  agents,  which  will  need  the  same  type  of  path.  Besides  the  seven  types  in  Liu  and 

Zlatanova (2013), new routes can be defined based on sI‐ and sO‐spaces to enable an advanced user‐oriented

door spaces such as streets.

e  Investigating to what extent space subdivision rules/algorithms originating from the indoor navigation domain 

can be readily applied. For example, this could involve a further subdivision of O‐spaces, sI‐spaces, and sO‐

spaces into navigable and non‐navigable spaces, or subdividing them by their functions (Diakité & Zlatanova, 

2018) or access restrictions (Alattas et al., 2017).

ABSTRACT
The paper presents a computationally eﬃcient meta-modeling
approach to spatially explicit uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
in a cellular automata (CA) urban growth and land-use simulation
model. The uncertainty and sensitivity of the model parameters
are approximated using a meta-modeling method called polyno-
mial chaos expansion (PCE). The parameter uncertainty and sensi-
tivity measures obtained with PCE are compared with traditional
Monte Carlo simulation results. The meta-modeling approach was
found to reduce the number of model simulations necessary to
arrive at stable sensitivity estimates. The quality of the results is
comparable to the full-order modeling approach, which is compu-
tationally costly. The study shows that
the meta-modeling
approach can signiﬁcantly reduce the computational eﬀort of
carrying out spatially explicit uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
in the application of spatio-temporal models.

Introduction

Increasing urban population directly aﬀects the pressure on the available urban and
suburban land with negative impacts on biodiversity in favor of urbanization. To represent
these land-use dynamics, a cell-based spatial diﬀusion approach called cellular automata
(CA) has been frequently used for urban growth and land-use change (UG-LUC) modeling
(De Almeida et al. 2003, Torrens and Nara 2007, Clarke 2008, Moreno et al. 2008, Van Vliet
et al. 2016). CA-based models mostly involve many input factors including variables and
structural elements (e.g. transition rules). Any conﬁdence in the results depends highly on
these input factors. It is therefore expected that some of the initial conditions may be the
drivers of model uncertainty (Kocabas and Dragićević 2006, Li et al. 2014, Dahal and Chow
2015). In the same context, it is critical to evaluate the inﬂuence of input factors on model’s
output so as to provide decision makers with conﬁdence in their actionable information. To
this end, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis oﬀer a way forward.

Uncertainty analysis (UA) quantiﬁes the model output variability, and sensitivity
analysis (SA) investigates how this uncertainty is apportioned among the model input
factors (Saltelli et al. 2000, Crosetto and Tarantola 2001). In particular, an uncertainty
and SA (U-SA) approach that is both independent from model structure and capable
of handling interaction eﬀects is important for complex, nonlinear models (Halls 2002,
Chen et al. 2010, Roura-Pascual et al. 2010, Moreau et al. 2013, Xu and Zhang 2013,
Saint-Geours et al. 2014). Moreover, for spatio-temporal models, where the simulation
results are spatially distributed, it is additionally important to identify not only the
source(s) of uncertainty but also its location(s) at a speciﬁc time (Herman et al. 2013,
Abily et al. 2016). The resulting uncertainty maps can assist in locating uncertainty hot
spots, and the sensitivity maps help further in identifying the spatial pattern of
inﬂuential
input factors behind the areas of high uncertainty (Ligmann-Zielinska
2013, Şalap-Ayça and Jankowski 2016). However, the traditional Monte Carlo-based
methods for U-SA require a large number of model evaluations; such a requirement
makes these approaches intractable for computationally expansive models (Saltelli
et al. 2010).

One approach to overcoming the computational bottleneck is high-performance com-
puting in the form of distributed and/or parallel computing (Tang and Jia 2014, Hu et al.
2015). Tang and Jia (2014) and Erlacher et al. (2017) accelerated U-SA with graphics
processing units (GPU) and Ligmann-Zielinska and Jankowski (2014) used a supercompu-
ter to overcome intractable models. Yet another approach without the need of access to
supercomputers or computationally powerful hardware is the use of surrogate or meta-
models (Saltelli et al. 2000). The meta-model, which is ﬁtted to the model by a set of
experiments or model runs, replicates the behavior of the original model in the domain of
its inﬂuential input parameters (Oakley and Hagan 2000, Marrel et al. 2011).

Although it is common to calibrate and validate CA models for achieving a desirable land-
use pattern accuracy, only limited attention has been paid to spatially explicit U-SA. In this
study, we aim to contribute to the body of knowledge on spatio-temporal U-SA by using a
meta-modeling technique called Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), which can reduce the
computational eﬀort of performing a U-SA. We implemented our approach on a CA-based
model, called SLEUTH (Clarke et al. 1997), which has been widely used for simulating UG-LUC.
We also compared the results of PCE to the full-order Monte Carlo (MC) approach to show
how close the PCE reproduces uncertainty measures with fewer model computations than
MC. For the implementation, we ﬁrst analyzed model output uncertainty on UA maps to
observe where and when the range of variations is most inﬂuential. We followed up on the UA
by studying sensitivity maps to identify the most inﬂuential inputs.

In the remainder of the paper, we provide background information on UG-LUC forecast-
ing, including SLEUTH modeling, and on the spatially-explicit approach to integrated U-SA.
In section three, we explain the basis of the PCE method. We then show, in section four, how
PCE can be applied in concert with U-SA to reveal the inﬂuence of the spatio-temporal
variations of input parameters on the model output.

Background

This section provides a brief introduction to CA as a simulation method for UG-LUC
modeling, followed by an introduction to U-SA and meta-modeling.

CA-based urban growth and land-use forecasting

CA, pioneered by Ulam and Von Neumann (Ulam 1952, Von Neumann 1966), is based on
the generated dynamic behaviors under deﬁned rules and constraints for certain con-
ﬁgurations (neighborhoods) (Holland 1999). Due to the similarity between CA and ﬁeld
representations (i.e. a grid), especially for spatial systems based on grid representations,
the applications of CA proliferated in the understanding of complex geographical
systems (pioneering examples include: Tobler 1979, Couclelis 1985, White and Engelen
1993, 1994).

Within a set of regular cells, the cellular automaton, A, is deﬁned by the set of states,
S, that change in discrete time steps based on transition rules, T, within a speciﬁed
neighborhood, N. Therefore, the basic formulation of a cellular automaton can be
written as:

A , leftðS; T; NÞ
For urban growth, the cell’s state is guided by transition rules, which reﬂect the
complexity of the environment. These rules act as a link between the spatial patterns
and the underlying spatial process. The transition rules are applied within the cell’s
neighborhood in temporal increments. The rules are not necessarily applied uniformly to
all cells since the evolution does not encapsulate each land form (i.e. water bodies in
UG-LUC modeling). However, the rules capture the intrinsic variability of the model’s
nature. As a result, CA model design is highly sensitive to the transition rules (White and
Engelen 1993, Torrens and O’Sullivan 2000, Ménard and Marceau 2005, Kocabas and
Dragićević 2006, Samat 2006, Yeh and Li 2006, Pan et al. 2010, Pontius and Neeti 2010).

SLEUTH for urban growth and land-use change modeling

SLEUTH is a widely used CA-based UG-LUC model, which is available along with a data
repository for various cities on the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) aﬃliated,
National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA) Project Gigalopolis
website (NCGIA n.d.). Comprehensive reviews on its usage and application areas can be
found in the literature (Clarke et al. 2007, Clarke 2008, Chaudhuri and Clarke 2013).

SLEUTH is the acronym for slope,

land use, exclusion, urban extent over time,
transportation, and hill-shaded backdrop layers. The model is initialized with these 6
input layers and a scenario ﬁle containing all the necessary parameters for simulation
(i.e. UG forecast parameters and time steps for forecast) (Figure 1). The model is run for
each year of the simulation time frame [t1. . .tT] and the output is the urban growth/land
use for each year.

SLEUTH simulates UG by using four transition (growth) rules, which include sponta-
neous growth FS δ; γ
Þ and road
inﬂuenced growth FRðβ; ρ; δ; γ) where, δ symbolizes a value for diﬀusion, β breed, χ
spread, γ slope resistance, and ρ road gravity coeﬃcients given as UG forecast para-
meters (Candau et al. 2000). Urban growth transition rules are bounded by suitability
deﬁned by the exclusion layer and the slope gradient. The exclusion areas (such as water
bodies, preserved areas, or parks) or slopes greater than a critical level (often 21%) are
considered as less likely to be urbanized. The resulting urban growth, achieved with four

diﬀerent transition rules, serves as the basis for calculating the growth rate expressed by
the ratio of the number of growth pixels to the total urban pixel population in SLEUTH
(Clarke et al. 1997).

Uncertainty and global SA for complex system models

In spatial models, UA is usually referred to as error propagation, and SA is considered as
the analysis which aims to understand the behavior of the error/uncertainty and its
reﬂection on the predictions made by the models (Heuvelink 1989, 1998, Heuvelink and
Burrough 1993, 2002).

For CA-based UG-LUC models, early examples of SA focused on cell by cell inspection
(White et al. 1997), ﬁnding an optimum neighboring size and type (Ménard and Marceau
2005, Kocabas and Dragićević 2006),
investigating the variations in the output by
applying diﬀerent cell sizes and cellular conﬁgurations (Chen and Mynett 2003, Samat
2006, Pan et al. 2010) or comparing diﬀerent scenario maps for land-use change and
validating results with historical data (Pontius and Neeti 2010) . However, relatively little
attention has been paid to the transition rules.

SLEUTH, like any other CA model, is subject to various uncertainties associated with
the transition rules. The model employs a calibration process to deﬁne the best ﬁt range
for each forecast parameter used in the transition rules, however, the parameter values
highly depend on the data and the user’s expertise. The reliability of SLEUTH simulations
depends on the forecast parameters, the model’s sensitivity to these parameters and
their interactions. A simple one-at-a-time (OAT) approach or (mono-looping) approach
to quantifying the inﬂuence of diﬀerent forecast parameter values on simulation results
fails to catch the higher-order eﬀects resulting from parameter interactions nor does it

reveal their partial contribution to the overall variance of the model results. In light of
the above mentioned studies, U-SA is essential to increase the credibility of the UG-LUC
models, as well as to test the model robustness in producing realistic outputs for future
implementations (Jantz et al. 2003, Jantz and Goetz 2005, Kim 2013). Additionally, a
spatially-explicit approach is also crucial for spatial models that do not entirely depend
on scalar inputs but that are also aﬀected by spatial relationships (Herman et al. 2013,
Abily et al. 2016),

Variance, which is a central measure in error propagation and SA, allows partitioning
the eﬀects of uncertainty in the input factors on model output (Kyriakidis and Goodchild
2006). There is a range of diﬀerent theoretical and methodological approaches to
variance-based SA in the literature. Generally, SA is discussed under two categories:
local and global (Saltelli et al. 2000, Helton and Davis 2002). In a local approach, one
investigates the input variations by estimating partial derivatives of model input factors
as varying one and keeping others constant (OAT approach) (Crosetto and Tarantola
2001). OAT is computationally eﬃcient and it does not need a large number of model
executions. However, since it only investigates individual variations, it is mostly applied
when no higher-order interactions are expected (Crosetto et al. 2000, Gómez-Delgado
and Tarantola 2006, Lilburne and Tarantola 2009).

Interactions among model inputs and nonlinear output responses can be addressed
by global SA (GSA) techniques where the sensitivity of the model input factors is not
only determined individually (ﬁrst-order eﬀects), but also as overall interactions (total-
order eﬀects). Speciﬁcally, in variance-based GSA, the model factors inﬂuence on model
output variability is represented by ﬁrst-order (S) and total-order (ST) sensitivity indices.
The ﬁrst-order index (S), sometimes referred to as the main eﬀect sensitivity, estimates
directly the selected single variable’s portion of the overall variance (Sobol’ 2001). The
total-order index (ST) measures the total contribution of pairs of factors, i.e. ﬁrst- and
higher-order interactions of the selected single variable (Saltelli et al. 2010, Saint-Geours
et al. 2014). Since CA models are characterized by interactions among input factors and
non-linear output responses, the variance-based GSA is potentially an attractive SA
method for diﬀerent types of spatio-temporal models,
including for the CA-based
SLEUTH, where higher-order interactions result from the transition rules.

Variance-based global SA and polynomial chaos expansion

(Cukier et al. 1973), Extended FAST (E-FAST)

GSA variance-decomposition-based methods (e.g. Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test
(FAST)
(Saltelli et al. 1999), Sobol
Decomposition (Sobol’ 1993)) use MC simulation (Metropolis and Ulam 1949) as a
sampling method during uncertainty propagation to draw multiple random samples
from a given input distribution. A model is then run for each random sample set to
obtain simulated outputs. The computational cost of
input sample generation
(required to run MC) is insigniﬁcant in comparison to the cost of model simulations
(required to quantify the output uncertainty), especially for complex models with large
input datasets (Crosetto et al. 2000). Consequently, the high number of simulations
results in an expensive uncertainty evaluation and SA becomes impractical (Helton
1993, Heuvelink 2003).

As a practical solution to this problem, meta-models can evaluate a model’s response
by using a mathematical model approximation. SA based on meta-modeling starts with
the selection of the ranges and distribution for each input factor and continues with the
development of the experimental design to deﬁne the combinations of factor values, on
which the model evaluation will be based. Therefore, although the sequence of steps
seems to be exactly the same as in the comprehensive SA, the experimental design that
uses the selection of design points (points representing parameter values in sampling
space) makes the meta-model approach distinct (Saltelli et al. 2000). The approximation
is based on these design points and their selection is determined according to the
presence of higher-order eﬀects, the number of variables under consideration, and the
computational eﬀort required to evaluate the model. Diﬀerent types of experimental
designs are available such as multiple linear, nonlinear regression (e.g. Ratto and Pagano
2012), neural networks (e.g.Villa-Vialaneix et al. 2012), cubic splines (Rutherford et al.
2015), Gaussian processes (e.g. Marrel et al. 2011), and orthogonal polynomials (e.g.
Sudret 2008).

One of the most frequently used meta-modeling techniques, Polynomial Chaos
Expansion (PCE), originally proposed by Norbert Wiener in 1938, propagates uncertainty
(which the ‘chaos’ term refers to) by expanding a complex function into orthogonal
polynomials that could be solved for relatively more easily than the original function
(Wiener 1938). These polynomials are selected from a family of polynomials which are
orthogonal with respect to the probability distribution of the corresponding input
parameter (Burnaev et al. 2017). For example, Legendre polynomials, which are deﬁned
over the range [−1, 1], are orthogonal to a uniform distribution. Therefore, if PCE is
applied for an input parameter set that has a uniform distribution, Legendre polynomials
are used for expansion. PCE is preferable compared to other meta-modeling methods
due to its applicability for dynamic stochastic systems, where there is an unavoidable
uncertainty term in the system parameters. Theoretical studies with diﬀerent polynomial
functions and the applicability of various probability density functions are discussed by
Xiu and Karniadakis (2002), Sudret (2008), and Crestaux et al. (2009).

Since PCE reduces the computational expense of uncertainty propagation, it has
been widely applied in complex environmental problems including water quality
modeling (Moreau et al. 2013), large scale socio-hydrologic modeling coupled with
Agent-Based Models (Hu et al. 2015), groundwater hydrogeological modeling (Deman
et al. 2016) and in other dynamic modeling examples such as crop modeling (Lamboni
et al. 2009) and seawater intrusion (Rajabi et al. 2015). Moreover, an extensive review
of basic principles and applications of PCE in computational ﬂuid dynamics was
conducted by Najm (2009). PCE has also been used in the geostatistical
literature
under the term bivariate isofactorial models in the context of disjunctive kriging
(Wackernagel 2003). The objective in those applications was to decompose a bivariate
distribution into a series of orthogonal polynomials, therefore, ﬁnding isofactorial
representations which help later to determine recurrence relations between factors
(Armstrong and Matheron 1986, Chiles and Delﬁner 1999).

There are only a few studies that have employed PCE in spatio-temporal modeling. In
one study, PCE was applied for a CA-based lava ﬂow forecasting model to evaluate the
model’s input parameters (Bilotta et al. 2012). They improved the use of the forecasting
model by assessing the impact of measurement errors on the results of simulation and

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

subsequently identiﬁed the model’s critical parameters. In another study, a PCE-based
SA was combined with high-performance computational techniques for a spatially
explicit, large-scale socio-hydrological model developed by Hu et al. (2015). The combi-
nation of the PCE with high-performance computing made possible the analysis of the
eﬀect of spatio-temporal variations of the input parameters on the output of a model
even with big multi-dimensional data (Hu et al. 2015). Their result of PCE-based variance
decomposition helped to identify the inﬂuential parameters, quantify their interactions,
and prioritize the factors.

The polynomial chaos expansion method

PCE starts with the selection of input parameters where the largest uncertainty is
expected, or to which the model is suspected to be most sensitive. The number of
selected input parameters is represented by M, which determines the dimension of the
random variable matrix X. The random variables are independently deﬁned based on a
probability distribution (e.g. uniform, normal, log-normal, etc.) and the model output Y is
deﬁned as Y ¼ f Xð Þ. This expansion can be represented by a series of independent
random variables and orthogonal polynomials (Wiener 1938):

SA. A β matrix is calculated as in Equation (2):

applied in this work at the local spatial level, which means calculation is done for each
pixel
independently in matrix Y. Following Equation (2), SA results depend on the
speciﬁc model output type, and presumably, they can be diﬀerent for diﬀerent model
output constituents. Likewise, the order of importance of input factors could vary for
diﬀerent output constituents.

Therefore, to build the meta-model which approximates the full approach and to

calculate the estimated mean and variance for U-SA, there are ﬁve key steps:

(1) Determining the input parameters and the probability distribution functions for

the selected parameters (which also deﬁnes the orthogonal polynomials)

(2) Selecting an experimental design degree, p, and calculating the number of

unknown response coeﬃcients, P

(3) Forming the experimental matrix, A and calculating the unknown response

coeﬃcients, β

(4) Computing mean and total variance for UA
(5) Computing Sobol indices

Orthogonal polynomials

The type of orthogonal polynomials, ψ
j, is derived from the orthogonal bases of input
factor probability density functions (PDFs). This aﬀords the reduced dimensionality by
taking advantage of the resemblance of weight functions (i.e. inner product vector) to
the PDF of certain random distributions (Xiu and Karniadakis 2002). Therefore, depend-
ing on the PDF of input parameters, a corresponding orthogonal polynomial scheme is
selected for PCE. The most frequently used orthogonal polynomials are Legendre for the
uniform and Hermite for the Gaussian (normal) distribution, and these polynomial
functions for a 5th degree model are given in Table 1 (Xiu et al. 2002, Sudret 2014).

Experimental design degree and expansion terms

For a full analytical solution, experimental design degree equals model degree. The
diﬀerence between full-order solution, where P is calculated as M = p, and any p value
where p < M, gives the overall computational gain. Sudret (2008) suggested a two-step
strategy starting with a low-order expansion degree for factor prioritization, then con-
tinuing with a higher-order design degree to compute the main sensitivity indices. The
relative error between the full analytical solution and its approximation can be obtained
by experimenting with diﬀerent p values (several functional model comparisons are
presented in Sudret (2008)). However, increasing p values does not necessarily guaran-
tee that the distribution is well approximated (O’Hagan 2011). Therefore, we checked
the PCE approximation results with MC simulation for estimated mean and standard
deviation surfaces.

Sobol’s variance-based decomposition (usually referred to as Sobol decomposition)
decomposes the output variance into fractions so that the contribution of each input
can be traced with the ﬁrst-order and total eﬀects (Saltelli et al. 2010). Sensitivity indices
derived from PCE are also referred to as PCE-based Sobol indices (SU) (Sudret 2008). First-
order SU and total-order SUT PCE-based Sobol indices can be computed using Equations (3)
and (4). The ﬁrst-order index represents the main inﬂuence of the ith term on the total
variance for all the input parameters from (i1; (cid:6) (cid:6) (cid:6) ; isÞ set and the SUT is the inﬂuence from
higher-order interactions among all the parameters from the integer sequence of

Application of PCE-based GSA in a probabilistic CA-based UG-LUC model

SLEUTH set-up

Santa Barbara, California was selected for the case study due to: (1) availability of data, and (2)
the authors’ familiarity with the study site. SLEUTH produces distributed (spatially-explicit)
output for each time step selected in the forecast scenario. UG in SLEUTH takes place in a three-
step cycle: setting up the growth coeﬃcients, applying the growth rules, and ﬁnally evaluating
the growth rate. The general function governing SLEUTH simulations can be written as:

y tð Þ ¼ f x; ε; t
ð
where x represents the vector of input variables (input layers), ε is the vector of behavior
control parameters (forecast parameters) and t is the time step (each year in time span T).
The input vector (x) is composed of an array of size (486x2074) for the Santa Barbara area
and kept constant for every simulation. ε is replaced by the X quasi random-sample
matrix. The forecast period, T, is set from 1999 to 2016 (18 years).

Þ

The uncertainty-SA

Quasi-random sequences produce random numbers but the selected numbers ‘know’ the
positions of previously sampled numbers and therefore, they do not form clusters or gaps in
the sample space. Since there is no a priori information about the distribution of these
parameters, each is assumed to be uniformly distributed. The lower and upper bounds for
each parameter are used as ranges for the uniform distribution for quasi-random sample
generation. The quasi-random sample matrix is generated based on the ranges in Table 2.
The uniform distribution is also used when selecting the polynomial basis for PCE, which
corresponds to Legendre orthogonal polynomials. The samples generated with the quasi-
random sampling scheme are normalized to a [−1, 1] uniform distribution interval.

The model is run for N times for (mxn) pixels and produce the urban growth land-use
extent for each year of the simulation time frame [t1. . .tT] as output . The model outputs
are collected to analyze urban growth and change by comparing the intermediate
simulation results. Since we are interested in how the forecasted urban growth changes
at each time step, the volume of data required to estimate the Sobol sensitivity indices
at each particular pixel at each time step is T x N. The variance decomposition is
expected to show the inﬂuence of forecast parameters on the urban land-use output.

Calculation of PCE-based Sobol sensitivity indices

ð

ð

Þ!

Since there are ﬁve forecast parameters (diﬀusion, breed, spread, slope and road
gravity), the degree of the model becomes M = 5, and if we select our experimental
design degree as p = 3 and take k = 2, the number of model simulations necessary
Þ!
to solve the unknown coeﬃcients becomes ¼ k (cid:4) P ¼ 2 (cid:4) 5þ3
3!5! ¼ 112 yielding the Y
output matrix of (112*(486(rows)*2074(columns))) size. Therefore, for PCE-based U-SA,
112 runs are enough to calculate the sensitivity indices for the time period (which
yields 18*112 = 2016 model outputs). For a full-order approach, where p = 5, N will
be ¼ k (cid:4) P ¼ 2 (cid:4) 5þ5
5!5! ¼ 504; which requires 78% more computations for each pixel.
Another comparison can be made for the Monte Carlo-based variance-decomposition
(2010), where the number of simulations required to
described by Saltelli et al.
compute the Sobol
indices equals (k + 2) *N where k is the number of uncertain
model factors, and N is the number of factor samples. N is recommended to be large
enough (≥ 1000) to give reliable estimates for the sensitivity indices. However, large
values for N are computationally expensive and require more processing memory
and time. Even for the number of samples N = 112 used in PCE-based approximation,
at least N = 5 þ 2
Þ (cid:4) 112 ¼ 784 simulation samples would be required to perform
the full variance-based decomposition described by Saltelli et al. (2010).

ð

Although 112 simulations were found to be enough to conduct PCE-based U-SA,
SLEUTH was run 1000 times to have enough runs to compare the PCE approximation
with the sample-based MC simulation for the mean and total variance. After solving the
polynomials and calculating coeﬃcients for the ﬁve input parameters, the PCE-based
Sobol decomposition resulted in the calculation of ﬁrst, second, third, fourth and ﬁfth-
order indices, which were summed to yield the total Sobol indices.

Results and discussion

Uncertainty analysis

For PCE, 112*18 simulation outputs were used to compute statistical moments of
estimated mean, total variance, ﬁrst-order and total-order indices. Figure 2 depicts an
example of these outputs for 2016 just showing the urban land-use class extent. Starting
with the initial land-use layer, the urban extent was calculated from the cumulative
result of equally probable growth cycles completed in SLEUTH.

For the mean value comparison, the ﬁrst (1999), middle (2008) and the last simulation
year (2016) were selected to show the PCE-based estimated mean compared with the
mean resulting from 1000 MC model simulations. Figures 3–5 show that the estimated

mean surfaces, calculated from only 112 model simulations, is a very close approxima-
tion to the mean of the 1000 simulations. As can be seen in the diﬀerence maps in
Figure 3 (bottom) to 5 (bottom), the maximum value of the diﬀerence between the two
approaches is 0.4, which is only observable for less than 10% of the urban pixels. Still,
the accuracy of the estimated mean can be enhanced by experimenting with diﬀerent p
values for PCE approximation. Increasing p values will require a higher number of model
simulations, which results in longer computational time. There is a trade-oﬀ between the
computational time required to execute 1000 simulations and the desired accuracy of
PCE-based approximation of mean and standard deviation, which can be assessed.

The comparison can be extended by plotting the model’s forecast accuracy over the
simulation time interval. For this comparison, the diﬀerence between the mean com-
puted with 1000 Monte Carlo samples and the mean obtained with 112 PCE samples
was calculated and plotted against the simulation time interval (Figure 6). The graph
shows that the diﬀerence between the means is converging throughout the forecast
period and ranges from 0 to 0.2. To better understand this diﬀerence, one can examine
the distribution of pixels comprising the study area. The number of pixels with the
observed diﬀerence greater than 0.12 is less than 1000 and for the overall urban area,
this diﬀerence of 1.3% can be considered negligibly small.

Another interesting observation can be drawn from the decreasing pattern of diﬀer-
ences. Neither the parameters nor the procedure to calculate the PCE or MC measures
diﬀer as the simulation progresses. As expected, the diﬀerences occur in places where

650

Figure 6. The comparison of diﬀerence between PCE-based estimated mean and MC-based mean.

SLEUTH forecasts a high probability of a cell changing its state to urban. As discussed in
the methodology section, PCE estimation is based on the produced output to approx-
imate the model. Therefore, the diﬀerences between MC and PCE estimates not only
depend on the characteristics of the methods but also on the model output as well.

The estimated mean maps are helpful to locate the regions where urban growth is
expected to occur. They summarize the forecasting results of all simulations based on
the calculated mean for each pixel. Similar to the mean maps, the simulation years 1999,
2008 and 2016 were selected to depict the uncertainty (represented by standard devia-
tion from the mean) resulting from transition parameters (Figures 7–9). The uncertainty
maps, showing a similar pattern, can be further investigated in concert with the mean
maps.

In order to categorize the study area based on high/low probability of change to
urban land use and high/low uncertainty (standard deviation) of the change, a catego-
rical map can be compiled to show four distinct categories: (1) high probability of
changing into the urban class with high uncertainty (HH), (2) high probability of chan-
ging into the urban class with low uncertainty (HL), (3) low probability of changing into
the urban class with high uncertainty (LH), and (4) low probability of changing into the
urban class with low uncertainty (LL) (Ligmann-Zielinska and Jankowski 2014). The
thresholds for high/low probability and high/low uncertainty can be selected by exam-
ining the logarithmically scaled histograms of mean probability for land-use change
(Figure 10) and standard deviation (Figure 11) for years 1999, 2008, and 2016. A thresh-
old value of 0.5 was selected for the mean probability (Figure 10), and the value of 0.5
was selected for the standard deviation (Figure 11). The selection is based on the
distributions of mean urban land-use change probability and standard deviation of
the mean urban land-use change probability; however, the ultimate selection of thresh-
olds is an arbitrary choice (reﬂecting the mean value of the frequency distribution) made
by the analyst.

The regions (pixels) falling into the 2nd category (HL) are considered as reliable
predictions (low uncertainty) of urban land-use change. The regions falling into the

3rd and 4th categories can be discarded due to low conﬁdence in the result (LH) and
low probability of land-use change (LL). For SA, the analysis continues by investigating
the regions in the 1st category (HH) to establish how the relatively high uncertainty in
these regions is apportioned to the transition parameters.

Figure 11. Standard deviation of mean land-use change probability for years 1999, 2008 and 2016.

After applying the threshold values, categorical maps were produced for three
selected simulation years (Figure 12). The clusters of the high probability of land-use
change accompanied by high uncertainty are depicted in red and these zones are
particularly important when evaluating the results of SA due to the ﬁrst and total-
order interactions of transition parameters. An area in the lower-right of the map
(Figure 12) where the HH category seems clustered, was selected for further investiga-
tion with SA.

Sensitivity analysis

Sobol ﬁrst and total-order sensitivity indices were computed for the ﬁve forecast para-
meters for each simulation year resulting in 90 maps (5 parameters * 18 years) per each
sensitivity index. To reduce the cognitive load of visualizing 90 maps, each sensitivity
index is represented by its mean value with the conﬁdence intervals and plotted for the
simulation period for each analyzed parameter (Figure 13). After having compared these
indices, one can return the produced spatial sensitivity maps for each year for each
parameter to see spatial patterns of sensitivities. For diﬀerent forecast years, the eﬀect of
each input parameter on the model’s output varies. The eﬀect of breed, slope and road
parameters is relatively small (the model is insensitive to these parameters when taken
singly or in isolation from one another) during the simulation time interval. This cannot
be said about diﬀusion and spread parameters, which show much larger and oscillating
inﬂuence on the model’s output. Moreover, one can observe that during the forecast

period, most of the parameters show a steady dispersion after 2010. For the simulation
period before 2010, diﬀusion and spread show a decreasing pattern, whereas breed,
slope and road show an increasing pattern.

To visualize the interaction among forecast parameters and interaction dynamics,
higher-order interactions, calculated as the diﬀerence between total-order indices and
ﬁrst-order indices, were plotted (Figure 14). The relatively high values represent high
interactions among the parameters. For the interval 1999 – 2010, the higher-order
interactions follow an increasing trend for diﬀusion, slope and road parameters and a
decreasing trend for the breed and spread parameters. After 2010, there is no change in
the level of interactions among the parameters. These graphs show that the sensitivity
of slope and road parameters increases as the simulations progress for both SA mea-

In order to understand the spatial pattern of parameter sensitivity, we also examined

model prediction has high uncertainty. The reason of this selection is the HH category
pixel cluster for this region. We mapped the dominant sensitivity indices for years 2005,
2007 and 2010 where the forecast parameters change behavior (Figure 15) (Ligmann-
Zielinska and Jankowski 2014). Out of ﬁve parameters, spread has the major inﬂuence on
the output variability when the ﬁrst-order indices are considered. For higher-order
indices, diﬀusion dominates the other parameters in inﬂuencing output variability.
Spread is a parameter driving edge growth and diﬀusion is eﬀective during spontaneous
growth and road inﬂuenced growth. One possible explanation for the dominance of
spread and diﬀusion is a cyclical pattern of urbanization driven by edge and road
inﬂuenced growth. The road parameter, associated with road inﬂuenced growth, is the

First-Order Dominance Maps in Figure 15).

Following the examination of the sensitivity maps, the contributions of the model
parameters to the model output variance can be considered during model calibration,
especially considering small perturbations in the value range of input parameters
resulting in diﬀerent levels of model output variance. For the HH zones (high probability
of land-use change and high uncertainty – Figure 12), to increase the conﬁdence in the
model output, attention must be paid to the diﬀusion and spread forecast parameters
since they have shown the most variability within the simulation time interval.

Limitations and future work

As discussed in the methodology section, PCE is a model approximation based on
design points. Compared with an analytical solution, which includes every high-order
interaction, PCE approximation only takes into account the subset of
interactions
deﬁned by the design points. Therefore, the decimal accuracy of the indices may be
lower than that for the full-order-based variance decomposition. However, given the
results of tests for various models (Sudret 2008), PCE can be a good guide to prioritize
input factors with smaller computational cost compared to full-order variance decom-
position. For a higher level of accuracy, the experimental design can be reset with higher
p values, resulting in higher-order polynomials in the expansion.

In addition to sensitivity index accuracy, another limitation of the work presented is
the visualization of U-SA outputs for spatio-temporal models. Future research eﬀorts
should focus on eﬀective means of visualizing parameter sensitivity both in space and
time including the capability of examining spatial patterns for any time period.
Additional topics for future research include:

● Further parallelization of the integrated U-SA approach to reduce computation cost

for larger datasets.
Applying the PCE-based Sobol decomposition to a diﬀerent type of CA neighbor-
hood (Von Neumann) to investigate whether there is a neighborhood eﬀect on the
model forecasts.

● Changing the experimental design size (N) and polynomial degree (p) to test the

eﬀect of diﬀerent N and p values on the accuracy of the SA results.

● Comparing the output sensitivity indices of PCE-based Sobol decomposition with
Quasi-Monte Carlo-based Sobol decomposition to examine the convergence of
analysis results obtained with these two model variance decomposition methods.
● Examining in detail the regions with the most and least sensitivity and uncertainty,

to test for and explain spatial autocorrelation in the modeling results.

Conclusions

SA, especially in its global approach, has received much attention in the research
community over the past decade. However, the main challenge lies in the implementa-
tion stage due to the increasing amount of data and model complexity. These issues also
highlight the problem of computational cost, which is especially high for spatially
explicit, integrated U-SA for dynamic models. The proposed meta-modeling approach
based on PCE-enabled model variance decomposition is an attractive alternative to
conducting U-SA for nonlinear, non-monotonic, and high-order spatio-temporal models.
The PCE implementation presented in the paper is also valuable in terms of its applic-
ability to any spatio-temporal model due to its model-independent workﬂow. For high
dimensional models with potentially interacting input parameters that can inﬂuence the
overall model variability,
in particular, PCE can be applied as an initial screening
approach to ﬁnd the most inﬂuential variables. This enables further experiments with
a smaller subset of model parameters.

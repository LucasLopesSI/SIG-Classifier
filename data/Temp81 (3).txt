Temporal Uncertainty in a Small Area Open
Geodemographic Classiﬁcation

Christopher G. Gale and Paul A. Longley

Department of Geography, University College London

Abstract
The 2001 Output Area Classiﬁcation (2001 OAC) is an open source geodemographic classiﬁcation of the
UK built exclusively from 2001 UK Census data. There has been considerable user interest in its applica-
bility to subsequent time periods, particularly given the potential propensity of characteristics and
attributes in some areas to change during inter-censual periods. Users often purchase commercial geode-
mographic classiﬁcation products in the belief that purely census-based classiﬁcations such as the 2001
OAC are uniformly unreliable because there is no temporal updating of input data. Yet there is evidence
to suggest that whilst some UK neighborhoods are prone to sudden changes, many others change very
little over protracted time periods. Using measures that are available at the small area level, temporal
uncertainty indicators can be constructed to identify those areas that are less stable. Using mid-year popu-
lation estimates and dwelling stock data, this article develops three temporal uncertainty indicators. These
provide a reliable means of gauging the stability or otherwise of neighborhood conditions. The conclusion
from this is that while a large number of small areas in the UK do experience change over time, this
change is not uniform in either degree or distribution, or by geodemographic type.

1 Introduction

Geodemographic classiﬁcations are small area measures that provide summary indicators of
the social, economic and demographic characteristics of neighborhoods (Adnan et al. 2010).
The aggregations of individual and household characteristics and neighborhood attributes
have been widely used for resource planning and allocation in both the commercial and public
sectors (Shelton et al. 2006). The intellectual heritage of geodemographics can be traced back
to the work on urban studies by the Chicago School. These conceptual beginnings of urban
ecology and social area analysis provide a framework for social measurement to be empirically
undertaken to better understand neighborhood characteristics (see, for example, Longley
2005). The desire to generalize urban social patterning in the 1970s led Richard Webber to
develop a branch of applied urban studies that would later be termed “geodemographics”.
While initially devised for use in the public sector, successful geodemographic applications
developed most rapidly in the private sector, using proprietary solutions such as CACI’s
(London, UK) Acorn and Experian’s (Nottingham, UK) Mosaic. Despite their cost, commer-
cial products such as these dominate the UK market and are widely utilized across multiple
industries, in signiﬁcant part because ancillary sources are used to enrich and update the clas-
siﬁcations – many users equate “frequently updated” with “best”, despite the fact that the
provenance of some of the ancillary sources is unknown (see CACI 2009, Experian 2010). The
provision of incremental updates over time is much vaunted in the marketing of commercial
classiﬁcations.

An alternative to commercial classiﬁcations is the 2001 Output Area Classiﬁcation (2001
OAC), created for the Ofﬁce for National Statistics (ONS) by Vickers and Rees (2007). This
classiﬁcation is freely available in the public domain and is the outcome of a well-documented
and easily replicable methodology. It however lacks any inter-censual updates and relies solely
on data from the 2001 UK Census. The difference between the public and commercial geode-
mographic products is clear; the 2001 OAC is freely available, but of limited relevance in areas
of the country that have changed rapidly over the last decade; while commercial products have
been “freshened up” using a range of sources that are either of unknown provenance or made
available at coarser levels of granularity than the small neighborhood areas for which the clas-
siﬁcations were devised.

This article seeks to identify an alternative to the temporal updating methods that are used
in commercial classiﬁcations by utilizing small area measures of change to indicate how reli-
able or otherwise the 2001 OAC geodemographic assignments have become. The 2001 OAC
is grounded at the scale of the Output Area (OA) – on average housing 264 individuals and
110 households (Vickers et al. 2005). Table 1 provides an explanation of 2001 UK Census
Geography used in the classiﬁcation. The 2001 OAC assigns each OA to one of seven Super-
groups, 21 Groups and 52 Subgroups in the three-tier hierarchical classiﬁcation shown in
Table 2 (Vickers et al. 2005). While the 2001 OAC provides a benchmark of neighborhood
conditions as of the date of the 2001 UK Census, 29 April 2001, there has been considerable
(actual and potential) user interest in its applicability to subsequent time periods, although this
requires understanding of the distinctive nature of small area change across the UK. A recent
survey of user requirements for such classiﬁcations carried out by the ONS (ONS 2012a) has
suggested that users gravitate towards commercial geodemographic classiﬁcation products
because of the perception that the 2001 OAC is unreliable in the absence of updating or tem-
poral change measures.

At the time of writing (August 2012), the imminent availability in the UK of small area
statistics from the 2011 UK Census provides the opportunity to build a new OAC. But this
alone will not address the inherent issue of the spatially variable degradation in reliability over
time, or counter commercial systems’ edge in the coming years. In fact, much of urban theory
(e.g. Hoyt 1939) posits that the characteristics of most neighborhoods do not change rapidly,
and empirical studies substantiate this view (see Longley et al. 2011). Users nonetheless state
that they would like annual updates to a new OAC (ONS 2012a).

The increasing proliferation of government open data sources appears to offer some solu-
tions – as of August 2012 the government data.gov.uk website offers over 8,500 datasets (see
http://www.data.gov.uk). Yet despite progress in improving the availability and dissemination
of open data, very few government datasets are currently available at the OA level. Additional
complications arise out of the different data dissemination conventions in England and Wales,
in Scotland and in Northern Ireland – something that hinders the creation of a UK-wide Index
of Multiple Deprivation, for example. Recourse to coarse grained open data potentially allows
regular updating of open classiﬁcations, although at the expense of representing local detail.
This is far from ideal in many applications of geodemographic classiﬁcations. The alternative,
explored here, is to use only the small number of measures obtainable at the OA level to con-
struct temporal uncertainty indicators. These can then be compared at national and regional
scales (see Figure 1). Our motivation is to identify areas in which signiﬁcant change in demo-

graphic compositions has occurred at the small area level. These are not designed to update
the classiﬁcation, but rather provide a ﬁrst step to indicate where updating is likely to be nec-
essary. Any area deemed to have experienced signiﬁcant change over time is ﬂagged as being
potentially uncertain and its geodemographic class assignment unreliable. This notion of tem-
poral uncertainty has not hitherto been explored in any detail within the wider discourse of
geodemographics: rather, the main focus of uncertainty within geodemographics has been at
the initial stage of creation of a classiﬁcation, speciﬁcally with respect to the cluster assignment
procedure. For example, there are uncertainties inherent in the assignment of any area to a
supposedly watertight category, especially where clusters are not tightly deﬁned in multivariate
space (Openshaw 1995). The “fuzzy geodemographics” proposed by Openshaw (1989) is a
potential resolution to this type of uncertainty. Slingsby et al. (2011) have sought to visualize
proximity to adjacent 2001 OAC Supergroup clusters. More widely within GIS, the term
uncertainty is used to denote that almost any representation is inherently incomplete. These
problems are compounded when GIS representations seek to accommodate change over time
(Plewe 2002). In the context of geodemographics, we seek to devise temporal uncertainty indi-
cators in order to accommodate these problems. This allows fast changing neighborhoods to
be identiﬁed whilst retaining the small level granularity of conventional geodemographic clas-
siﬁcations for the others. In the majority of locations, we argue that the 2001 OAC remains of
use, avoiding the need for costly and time-consuming updating through ancillary sources that
may be of unknown provenance.

2 Change Since 2001

Consistent with the classic ﬁltering theory of urban geography (Hoyt 1939), Sleight (2004) has
suggested that population change is of little overall consequence for a geodemographic classi-
ﬁcation as most areas will continue to house the same social groups over time – even if the
identities of the individuals themselves change. Where local scale change does occur, however,
annual mid-year population estimates provide one useful indicator of this at the OA level. The
broad picture of change based on 2010 mid-year population estimates is shown in Table 3: the
UK population increased by an estimated 5.33% between 2001 and 2010, with Northern
Ireland experiencing the fastest growth in population, and Scotland the slowest.

Figure 2 illustrates the maximum absolute deviation from the 2001 OA populations for
England and Wales over the period 2001 to 2010. The bimodal distribution becomes more
pronounced over time and by 2010 every OA in England and Wales had experienced at least

1% population change, with 55.1% of OAs increasing in population. This global ﬁgure con-
ceals important local variations: for example, London’s population increased by 9.1% over the
same period (ONS 2011), but the populations of Westminster and Tower Hamlets, both Bor-
oughs of London, saw population increases of 24.8% and 18.3% respectively, while that of
Brent, another London Borough, decreased by 4.8%. Glasgow, in comparison, saw a more
modest increase of 2.4% between 2001 and 2010. Still, local changes in population size
provide an important indicator of changes in social, economic and demographic conditions at
an OA scale. It can be envisaged that in such areas changes should be accommodated in the
use of geodemographic classiﬁcations. The ability to identify such areas becomes more impor-
tant during the life of any geodemographic classiﬁcation as the likelihood of uncertainty in the
continuing validity of the original group assignment increases.

3 Monitoring the Emergence of Uncertainty Over Time

Given that population change in the UK is inherently unevenly distributed geographically,
there is a need for additional measures that seek to quantify such changes and provide a com-
prehensive update of the 2001 OAC (and others like it) between censuses. Traditional meas-
ures of small area estimation (see Rao 2003), such as regression models (Fay and Herriot
1979), Bayesian methods (Congdon 2004) or M-quantile models (Chambers and Tzavidis
2006, Tzavidis et al. 2010) can offer synthetic estimates of change. The beneﬁts of using such
measures, however, are reliant on multiple datasets being made available at the smallest spatial
scale and ensuing updates occur on a regular basis. At present, the lack of these resources pre-
vents the realistic utilization of small area measures.

Here we adopt the more straightforward approach of using the limited data sources that
are currently available at the OA level to construct temporal uncertainty indicators. This has
the beneﬁt of keeping the same geodemographic groups and giving additional information on
how likely it is that these groups still represent an area. Of course, this falls short of any ability
to reassign areas ﬂagged as uncertain to a different class, or any newly created group to best
encapsulate the emergent characteristics of a new group of areas. This situation is likely to be
addressed over time if more open data are made available or modeled at the ﬁnest level of
granularity. Here, our argument is that there are two key factors that impact upon the reliabil-
ity of the 2001 OAC assignments over time: (1) the extent to which the resident population
size is likely to have changed; and (2) (where available) the nature and amount of recorded
changes to the dwelling stock. A dwelling is deﬁned as comprising a single household space or
several household spaces sharing some facilities (see www.gov.uk), and change in the dwelling
stock enumerates the changes in any given area. There is likely to be a strong inter-relationship
between changes in population and dwelling stock: for example, dilapidated housing stock
might be cleared and replaced with new developments at different residential densities. In
other cases there may be no such link – for example, existing housing stock may become occu-
pied at higher residential densities by incomers, or redevelopment may not lead to changes in
residential density. In each of these cases, however, we suggest that changes in either or both of
these indicators is likely to lead to differences in the demographic characteristics of OAs, along
with changes in the numbers of individuals likely to bear these characteristics. While the total-
ity of demographic change is unlikely to be captured by these two measures, we nevertheless
suggest that they provide a measure of the reliability of local level demographic estimates and
also provide an insight into how safe a geodemographic classiﬁcation is to use. For areas for
which the classiﬁcation is rendered unusable because of temporal change, it becomes incum-
bent upon the user to source additional data to augment or replace the classiﬁcation itself.

Mid-year population estimates are produced on an annual basis separately for England
and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England and Wales they are produced at the OA
level by a single age band for both males and females. This is also true of Scotland, save that
they are produced at the Data Zone level. Northern Ireland’s output is different in that esti-
mates are produced at the Super Output Area level for four age bands. While coverage of the
UK is at varying levels of geography the different measures are useful because in each case they
correspond to high granularity census geography. Dwelling stock data, classiﬁed by Council
Tax band, are made available by the ONS for England and Wales at the OA level, but there
are no equivalent open data for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Council Tax levies are based
on the capital value of residential property in England, Wales and Scotland. The Valuation
Ofﬁce Agency (VOA) assigns every residential property to a valuation band and there is a clear
ﬁnancial incentive to maintain an up-to-date register. This is available in the public domain for

OAs in England and Wales. The lack of freely available data for Scotland and Northern
Ireland creates a disparity in coverage if this data source is being used to form a single tempo-
ral uncertainty indicator for the 2001 OAC, with the 21% of UK OAs assigned to Scotland
and Northern Ireland not being represented. This current limitation does not have to prevent
dwelling stock data from being used solely or to form part of temporal uncertainty indicators
for England and Wales. However the disaggregation of total dwelling stock estimates into
Council Tax bands, a means of further differentiating change and also a proxy for changes in
housing wealth (Harper and Mayhew 2012), is hindered by a change in 2005, when a national
revaluation of property in Wales (VOA 2005) rendered them incomparable with their English
equivalents. Nevertheless, while the bands are not compatible between the two countries they
do allow for general changes in the values of property at the small area level to be seen; for
example redevelopment and attendant upgrading of low-cost housing since 2001.

Additional small area change measures might be developed from open data sources in the
future. For example, crime data for Great Britain are made available on a monthly basis by
easting and northing, and by crime type (see www.police.co.uk) in a form suitable for aggrega-
tion to OA level. However, the data do not currently have full UK coverage (the Police Service
of Northern Ireland aggregate data to coarser policing areas) and there is a need to research
the volatility and reporting bias in small area estimates before developing usable small area
measures.

4 Uncertainty and the 2001 Output Area Classiﬁcation

The limitations of the available data to construct temporal uncertainty indicators of the 2001
OAC mean that at present there is no way to produce a comprehensive indicator of uncer-
tainty at the OA level. Accordingly, we proceed here using the best available indicators at the
OA level – annual mid-year population estimates, and annual dwelling stock ﬁgures available
for England and Wales only; Council Tax band data for England and Wales are not used
because of the Welsh revaluation and its implications for data compatibility. Our basic hypoth-
esis is that changes in these indicators of the attributes (dwelling stock) and characteristics
(population size) in each OA provide a reliable indicator of the enduring relevance of 2001
OAC to describing its geodemographic characteristics. For each indicator, we record the
maximum absolute deviation from the 2001 value over the period 2001 to 2010. This allows
us to ﬂag the occurrence of change in circumstances in which an initial increase (or decrease) is
subsequently compensated for by a subsequent decrease (or increase) to a value that might
suggest that little change had occurred over the entire period. Mid-year population estimates
are not available for OAs outside England and Wales, so coarser Data Zones are used for Scot-
land and Super Output Areas are used for Northern Ireland (in Scotland there are an average
6.5 OAs for every Data Zone and in Northern Ireland 5.6 OAs for every Super Output Area).
In addition to using the population and dwelling stock change to form temporal uncertainty
indicators, a combination of the two is utilized for England and Wales. The respective change
shown by each indicator is standardized using z-scores and brought together to form an
overall composite score, where data for each indicator are available (see Table 4).

The reliability of using mid-year population estimates as a change indicator over time is
inﬂuenced by the methodology used to produce them. There are slight differences in the
methods used to calculate the mid-year population estimates in each UK country although the
three responsible organizations each use a common cohort component method (ONS 2010) to
update the population base. Essentially the 2001 UK Census is used as a population base and

Uncertainty in a Geodemographic Classiﬁcation

then each year births are added, deaths subtracted and small area migration estimates are
based on available survey and proxy data. In England, Wales and Scotland data on interna-
tional migration come from the International Passenger Survey (IPS), the Labor Force Survey
(LFS) and Home Ofﬁce data on asylum seekers and their dependants (ONS 2010). In Northern
Ireland the inﬂows are estimated from the list of patients registered with a family doctor and
the outﬂows from the number of people who have de-registered: data from the Irish Quarterly
Household Survey (QNHS) are also used, to estimate migration to the Republic of Ireland
(NISRA 2011). Further issues associated with migration statistics are discussed in ONS (2011)
for England and Wales, in GROS (2010) for Scotland and in Dignan et al. (2010) and IJpelaar
et al. (2011) for Northern Ireland.

The release of 2011 UK Census data provides an opportunity to critique the accuracy of
current mid-year population estimates. At present the ﬁnest level of granularity available for
2011 UK Census data are at local authority level for England and Wales. The ONS has identi-
ﬁed that for England and Wales the population of males aged 10 to 19 and 30 to 39 is larger
than that suggested by the population estimates for March 2011, while the opposite is true for
the male population aged 20 to 29 (ONS 2012b). Amongst other discrepancies, the March
2011 population estimates are too high for the 25 to 29 age group in some university areas
(ONS 2012b). The accuracy of the mid-year population estimates is thus likely to be spatially
variable, with knock on consequences for any temporal uncertainty indicator that utilizes
them. Dwelling stock counts, and their change since 2001 are at present the only viable alter-
native indicator to the uncertainty of the 2001 OAC. Unlike mid-year population estimates,
these provide a deﬁnitive count rather than an estimate, so a greater level of certainty may be
attached to the ﬁgures, although this does not make them more important in evaluating the
broader picture of temporal change. Using change in dwelling stocks as a temporal uncertainty
indicator provides a general overview of how property in an area has changed and provides an
alternative insight to relying on population estimates alone to characterize change at the small
area level. Dwelling stock changes are thus a further indicator of stability in small area geode-
mographic assignment.

In England and Wales a comparison between the two data sources is possible. There are
respective merits of using mid-year population estimates and dwelling stock change as tempo-
ral uncertainty indicators. While there is undoubtedly a strong inter-relationship between the
two, this is not constant across England and Wales. Table 5 presents a confusion matrix of the
areas of change as indicated by the two sources. The data for England and Wales have been
ranked and divided into deciles for each temporal uncertainty indicator. The OAs that share
the same decile for both of the indicators suggest the uncertainty created in these areas derives
equally from population and dwelling stock change. For the OAs where the temporal uncer-
tainty indicator deciles do not match, this would suggest that either population or dwelling
stock is driving the uncertainty in those areas, but not both. Decile 1 contains the OAs that
have experienced the most change from 2001 to 2010 and decile 10 the least. (Because 11% of
OAs in England and Wales experienced no change in dwelling stock over the past decade there
is no decile 10 for dwelling stock change). The relationship between mid-year population esti-
mates and dwelling stock change shown in Table 5 lacks any strong correspondence, alluding
to the conclusion that the two indicators pick up different aspects of change across different
areas in England and Wales. This suggests that in areas where it is possible, using the temporal
uncertainty indicator that combines both mid-year population estimates and dwelling stock
change would be preferable. In part because areas that have experienced change in both popu-
lation and dwelling stock have an increased likelihood of being misrepresented by their current
geodemographic assignment.

Uncertainty in a Geodemographic Classiﬁcation

575

The different aspects of change picked up by population and dwelling stock temporal
uncertainty indicators, along with a combined composite measure, provide an indication of
geodemographic change in England and Wales over the past decade. Figure 3 displays the dis-
tribution of change for each temporal uncertainty indicator, with the additional inclusion of
population change for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for reference.
Table 6 identiﬁes thresholds of change, beyond which the 2001 OAC classiﬁcation is deemed
unreliable. These threshold values, like many decisions in geodemographic classiﬁcation, are
subjective. The thresholds values were based on identifying areas that were within one stand-
ard deviation, around 68.2% of the UK’s OAs, and classing them as certain. Manual interven-
tion was required to decide upon the ﬁnal threshold values (see Table 6) to allow for the
greatest compatibility between the temporal uncertainty indicators possible, but also to limit
the areas classiﬁed as uncertain to locations where the more extreme changes in local charac-
teristics have taken place. Overall, the percentage of OAs classed as uncertain by each of the
three temporal uncertainty indicators ranges from 21% to 29%.

Figure 4 illustrates how the combinations of the three temporal uncertainty indicators
(population change; dwelling stock change; and the composite measure) can be used alongside
threshold values. Each map is a cartogram, in which every OA has been rescaled in direct pro-
portion to its 2010 total population, in order to best visualize where change has happened.
The population temporal uncertainty indicator shows a large number of OAs in the Greater
London area have experienced population change over the threshold value. The remainder of
England and Wales has a fairly even distribution of above threshold values, but other urban
areas such as Manchester and Birmingham dominate their respective local areas. The dwelling
stock temporal uncertainty indicator provides a different picture of change in England and
Wales. OAs that have experienced change greater than the threshold values are predominately
distributed in the South East and South West of England, where 34% of all OAs in these two
regions have experienced dwelling stock change greater than the threshold value. The compos-
ite temporal uncertainty indicator has a different geographical distribution again; although, as
Table 6 indicates it designates fewer OAs in total as uncertain when compared with the two
other temporal uncertainty indicators. Of the population and dwelling stock temporal uncer-
tainty indicators, it is the population measure that has the more even geographical distribution
across England and Wales, albeit with higher concentrations of uncertainty in urban areas.
Change in the dwelling stock indicator is particularly marked in the South East and South
West of England. The composite indicator also suggests greatest incidence of uncertainty in the
South East and South West of England, and also concentrations in urban areas across England
and Wales.

The three temporal uncertainty indicators identify different areas across England and
Wales that have experienced the most change. Table 7 segments these results according to
2001 OAC Supergroup. A third of the OAs identiﬁed as having experienced change above the
population temporal uncertainty indicator threshold are in the “Typical Traits” and “Multicul-
tural” Supergroups, suggesting that the uncertainty of these two Supergroups is heavily driven
by population change. This provides only part of the picture as “Typical Traits” is also inﬂu-
enced by changes to dwelling stock, as over 20% of OAs identiﬁed as having above threshold
change to dwelling stock are located in this Supergroup. Compared to the 10% ﬁgure for the
“Multicultural” and the 21% for the “Prospering Suburbs” Supergroups it is clear that differ-
ent combinations of change drive the uncertainty of geodemographic types to varying extents.
The composite temporal uncertainty indicator provides only a slight variation to the distribu-
tions seen with the dwelling stock measure. While arguably just an artifact of the threshold
values used as the indicator, there is a suggestion that the more extreme change, and therefore

uncertainty, seen across the 2001 OAC Supergroups is driven more by dwelling stock change
than by population change alone.

Table 8 illustrates that across the regions of England and Wales there are variations in the
percentage of OAs that have above threshold levels of change for each temporal uncertainty
indicator. London for example has 46% of OAs classed as uncertain if using the population
temporal uncertainty indicator, but only 19% or 21% if using the dwelling stock or composite
temporal uncertainty indicators, respectively. Similar dominance of the population temporal
uncertainty indicator at identifying uncertainty can be found in Yorkshire and Humberside
along with the East Midlands. Conversely, a different pattern is seen in the South East and
South West of England, with the dwelling stock change indicating greater uncertainty than the
other two measures. The variability seen in uncertainty picked up by the population and
dwelling stock temporal uncertainty indicators between the regions is not repeated for the
composite measure. For the population and dwelling stock temporal uncertainty indicators
there is a range of 19 and 18%, respectively between the regions in the amount of uncertainty
picked up. For the composite temporal uncertainty indicator this is just 5%, indicating this
measure has an increased stability across England and Wales, with just over one in ﬁve OAs
being identiﬁed as uncertain using this measure.

Figures 5, 6 and 7 present the composite temporal uncertainty indicator for London’s Bor-
oughs (see Figure 8), broken down by 2001 OAC Supergroups. Approximately 22% of
London OAs classiﬁed as “Multicultural” exceed the threshold, as do a similar percentage of
“City Living” neighborhoods. The “Multicultural” and “City Living” Supergroups together
comprise over 75% of London’s OAs, and only 15% of OAs assigned to any of the other ﬁve,
more settled, Supergroups exceed the threshold. Figure 5 indicates that the majority of uncer-
tainty in the “Multicultural” group is found in the East of London, in the Boroughs of Tower
Hamlets, Newham, Hackney and Barking and Dagenham. While there are pockets of uncer-
tainty found elsewhere around the capital, these areas are in the minority. Figure 6 suggests the
City of London and the City of Westminster in the centre of London, is where the greatest
uncertainty in the “City Living” assignments are found. The distribution of uncertainty shown
in Figure 7 reﬂects the ﬁve Supergroups being displayed. There is no distinct pattern, with no
single area having a particularly high concentration of uncertainty, with the areas identiﬁed as
uncertain being found in isolated pockets situated around the outer boroughs of London.
These results reﬂect the dominance of the “Multicultural” and “City Living” Supergroups in
London, with over three-quarters of the capital falling into one or other of these two groups.
This dominance in comparison with the other Supergroups means that areas containing a high

concentration of uncertainty, as identiﬁed, have developed over the past decade. This has not
been possible for the other Supergroups because of their more sporadic geographically distri-
bution across London.

The only temporal uncertainty indicator with coverage for Scotland and Northern Ireland
is that derived from mid-year population estimates. Figure 9 highlights the example of
Glasgow and surrounding area for each of the seven Supergroups in the 2001 OAC. “Con-
strained by Circumstances” is the dominant Supergroup in Glasgow, with 55% of OAs
assigned to the group. This dominance does not however translate to an increased propensity

for uncertainty, as only 31% of OAs assigned to this group are classed as uncertain. In addi-
tion, there is no distinct patterning to this uncertainty. It does not appear that particular areas
of uncertainty have developed over the past decade, unlike, for example, the “Multicultural”
or “City Living” groups in London. There is a similar pattern with the other Supergroups in
Glasgow, where no distinct concentrations of uncertainty have developed. The exception to
this is the “City Living” group where the majority of uncertain areas are located in the centre
of Glasgow. This apparent difference between Glasgow and London can in part be explained
by the total proportion of OAs that have been classed as uncertain. London’s dominate “Mul-
ticultural” Supergroup has over half of the OAs assigned to that group classed as “uncertain”

when using the population temporal uncertainty indicator (unlike the 31% previously identi-
ﬁed for Glasgow’s dominant Supergroup). In terms of overall population change, London is a
more uncertain city than Glasgow, having 46%, compared with 27%, of OAs above the uncer-
tainty threshold. A full national coverage of these and results for other parts of the UK is avail-
able at http://www.opendataproﬁler.com.

Analysis of how uncertainty varies between any parts of the UK can only be undertaken
using the population temporal uncertainty indicator. At this level the change in the dis-
tributions of the 2001 OAC Supergroups between 2002 and 2010 is shown in Figure 10.
The limited change in 2002 increases steadily through to 2010, with the “Blue Collar Com-
munities” and “Prospering Suburbs” Supergroups experiencing limited change relative to the
“Multicultural” and “City Living” groups. It is evident that neighborhoods assigned to different
geodemographic groups have differing propensities to change. Table 9 presents the percentage
changes for each of the 2001 OAC Supergroups between 2002 and 2010, broken down into the
constituent parts of the UK. The changes in England and Wales are concentrated towards the
higher population change categories, while those in Scotland and Northern Ireland tend to be
smaller in magnitude. These results suggest that OAs in England and Wales are proportionally
more likely to have changed since 2001. This overall change can be further sub-divided by 2001

5 Conclusions

Geodemographics continue to be widely used as local area discriminators, across a wide spec-
trum of business and service planning applications. Commercial systems remain popular,
despite concerns (particularly in public service applications) about their closed and “black
box” nature. We believe that this arises in no small part because such solutions are known to
be frequently updated, inter alia using commercial data sources that are not widely available.
Many users are concerned that the “best” solutions require the “best” data, and “frequently
updated” is often taken as a surrogate measure for “best”, despite the fact that the provenance
of most commercial sources is largely unknown. There are good reasons, however, to suggest
stability in population and settlement structure – classically espoused in Hoyt’s (1939) notion
of ﬁltering in urban structure, whereby the social, economic and demographic structure of
neighborhoods remains stable over time, even if the identities of the residents themselves turn
over much more rapidly. This article has investigated the extent to which these notions of sta-

bility and change play out in geodemographic terms, using the 2001 OAC. In practice, the
results and the associated website http://www.opendataproﬁler.com provide empirical evidence
of the likely stability or otherwise of the 2001 OAC Supergroups in different parts of the
country. A practical implication of this is that users of the 2001 OAC can have increased con-
ﬁdence in the use of the classiﬁcation in areas where our analysis suggests that change has been
much more muted.

As such, our analysis suggests areas and target groups for which the frequent updating of
commercial geodemographic classiﬁcations may be unnecessary. Our use of mid-year popula-
tion estimates and dwelling stock data to construct multiple temporal uncertainty indicators
provides a reliable means of gauging the stability or otherwise of neighborhood conditions.
The conclusion from this is that while a large number of small areas in the UK do experience
change over time, this change is not uniform in either amount or distribution. Compared
to using the 2001 OAC in isolation, the advantage of knowing which areas may no longer
resemble their initial classiﬁcation designation becomes clear. The user is then aware of the
need to investigate such areas using alternative data sources in order to better understand the
current population and dwelling dynamics and make more informed decisions.

The creation of temporal uncertainty indicators does, in part, address some of the per-
ceived inadequacies of the 2001 OAC when compared to commercial alternatives, and high-

lights stability across the UK and England and Wales. The three temporal uncertainty
indicators reveal that only one in four OAs have experienced change greater than the deﬁned
threshold limits. Despite these OAs being grouped as uncertain the extent of change in the
socio-economic characteristics will vary, to the extent it would seem unlikely that all of these
OAs would require reclassiﬁcation. It is of course important to consider the geographic vari-
ance in what a signiﬁcant change in population or dwelling stock would be. Longley et al.
(2011) suggest that a large proportion of the British population have remained settled for at
least 600 years with the possible exception of urban conurbations, such as London, Birming-
ham and Manchester. Our analysis also provides an insightful analysis of the likely geodemo-
graphic breakdown of change in the UK over the last decade, using subjectively deﬁned
thresholds to identify signiﬁcant change to either population, dwelling stock or a combination
of the two. We also identify the regional variation in change.

These ﬁndings need to be tempered with the qualiﬁcation that mid-year population esti-
mates are themselves inherently uncertain, and that the indicators that we have used are less
comprehensive in scope and application than the 41 census variables that underpin the 2001
OAC. There is also the associated issue that the greater the estimated population change, the
greater the uncertainty associated with the estimate of it. Data issues in Scotland and Northern
Ireland further compound these qualiﬁcations, where updating is only possible at higher levels
of granularity. The problem of data-mismatch between countries in the UK is unlikely to be
resolved in the near future, and new open data sources are not likely to be released at neigh-
borhood levels of granularity either.

Percentage Population Change

Figure 10 UK distribution of the population temporal uncertainty indicator by 2001 OAC Super-
groups in 2002 and 2010

Looking to the futre, we see this work as of value in providing a framework for updating
geodemographic classiﬁcations based largely or wholly upon 2011 UK Census data. The
mapping on the http://www.opendataproﬁler.com site provides a readily intelligible means of
understanding the likely reliability of the 2001 OAC, and similar mapping might be developed
as a means of representing the likely obsolescence of the data underpinning 2011 classiﬁca-
tions across the UK. In particular these uncertainty indicators, and any additional ones that
may develop from the increased provision of ﬁne level open data, can be developed and
applied to the new 2011 OAC when it is released. Moreover, we anticipate extensions of this
work in modeling small area change in the other variables that are integral to geodemographic
classiﬁcations. As increasing amounts of relevant open data become available, so improved
methodologies may be devised in order to update classiﬁcations, and indeed identify the point
at which an entire classiﬁcation needs to be re-engineered. The use of emerging open data in
this way in conjunction with geodemographics is a valuable direction for future research to
take. The analysis reported here is of course itself uncertain, not least in the assumptions that
are made in linking total population and dwelling stock data to a wider range of population
characteristics: but the underpinning methodology is open and transparent and, as such, offers
clear beneﬁts over reliance upon costly data sources of unknown provenance.

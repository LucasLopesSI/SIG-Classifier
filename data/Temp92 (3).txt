Abstract
With  the  advent  of  massive,  heterogeneous  geographic  datasets,  data  mining  and
knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) have become important tools in deriving
meaningful information from these data. In this paper, we discuss how knowledge
representation  can  be  employed  to  signi(cid:222)cantly  enhance  the  power  of  the  know-
ledge  discovery  process  to  uncover  patterns  and  relationships.  We  suggest  that
geographic  data  models  that  support  knowledge  discovery  must  represent  both
observational  data  and  derived  knowledge.  In  addition,  knowledge  representation
in  the  context  of  KDD  must  support  the  iterative  and  interactive  nature  of  the
knowledge  discovery  process  to  enable  the  analyst  to  iteratively  apply,  and  revise
the  parameters  of,  speci(cid:222)c  analytical  techniques.  Our  approach  to  knowledge  rep-
resentation and discovery is demonstrated through a case study that focuses on the
identi(cid:222)cation and analysis of storms and other related climate phenomena embedded
within a spatio-temporal data set of meteorological observations. 

1 Introduction

Advances  in  data  gathering  and  data  sharing  technologies  have  made  massive  geo-
graphic  datasets  readily  available  over  the  past  decade.  Because  of  the  sheer  size  and
complexity of these data, advanced analytical approaches, such as those associated with
data mining and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), are becoming essential tools
in  deriving  useful  information  from  these  data  for  decision  support,  environmental
modeling, and other applications (Openshaw 2000, Ramachandran et al. 2000).

knowledge  discovery  process  involves  a  number  of  steps,  including  data  preparation,
user  interaction,  and  iterative  re(cid:222)nement  of  analytical  methodologies.  The  term  data
mining refers to the speci(cid:222)c step within this process where patterns and associations in
the data are derived through the use of algorithmic procedures. Data mining techniques
can be categorized into four general types based on the type of pattern they attempt to
extract: association rules, data characterization, classi(cid:222)cation, and clustering (Chen
et  al.  1996).  Data  mining  techniques  can  also  be  categorized  along  an  axis  extending
between deductive (expert knowledge-driven) and inductive (data pattern-driven) poles
(Gahegan  2000).  Ideally,  a  variety  of  data  mining  methods  (algorithms)  are  available
within a KDD software environment.

Although most research in KDD and data mining has focused on non-spatial data,
there  has  been  recent  progress  in  the  development  of  geographic  KDD  environments
(Han  et  al.  1997,  Gahegan  et  al.  2002,  Peuquet  and  Kraak  2002)  and  spatial  data
mining  techniques  (Guo  et  al.  2002,  Roddick  and  Hornsby  2000,  Miller  and  Han
2001). If efforts in applying KDD to geographic data and problems are to be successful,
however,  research  in  KDD  must  incorporate  aspects  of  knowledge  representation.  The
integration  of  geographic  knowledge  within  KDD  environments  is  necessitated  by  the
complexity  of  geographic  domains  and  the  subsequent  need  for  domain-speci(cid:222)c
knowledge as a means of guiding the knowledge discovery process (Yuan et al. 2001). In
addition, because the knowledge discovery process is intended to be interactive (Fayyad
et al. 1996), geographic knowledge representation within KDD must support interaction
with,  and  the  iterative  re(cid:222)nement  of,  that  knowledge.  While  there  are  a  variety  of
approaches to knowledge representation that have been developed in the (cid:222)elds of database
modeling and arti(cid:222)cial intelligence (cf. Sowa 2000), the issue of how to store and integ-
rate geographic knowledge into the knowledge discovery process remains a challenge.
The purpose of this paper is to discuss how geographic knowledge can be incorpor-
ated within an interactive KDD environment. We propose an approach for integrating
geographic  knowledge  representation  within  the  knowledge  discovery  process  and
present  a  prototype  implementation  of  a  KDD  environment  that  demonstrates  this
approach.  In  order  to  demonstrate  this  implementation,  we  describe  a  case  study  that
focuses on the identi(cid:222)cation and analysis of storms and other related climate phenomena
from a spatio-temporal data set of meteorological observations. 

2 Knowledge Representation in KDD

In the context of KDD, data are viewed as empirical measurements or observations. As
such,  they  do  not  carry  meaning,  per  se.  Knowledge,  on  the  other  hand,  consists  of
meaningful characteristics or generalized behavioral rules concerning the domain under
investigation. This can also be called the semantics of the data. We consider two types
of  knowledge  that  may  be  represented  within  a  KDD  environment.  The  (cid:222)rst  type  is
knowledge derived from the knowledge discovery process; the second is a priori know-
ledge  that  is  brought  to  bear  on  the  knowledge  discovery  process  by  a  domain  expert/
user. There has been little research on incorporating knowledge, whether derived from
KDD or de(cid:222)ned externally by experts, within the knowledge discovery process. Regarding
the  use  of  knowledge  derived  from  KDD,  a  few  researchers  have  proposed  mining  the
results  of  previous  data  mining  operations  (Schoenauer  and  Sebag  1990,  Spiliopoulou
and Roddick 2000). For instance, Spiliopoulou and Roddick (2000) suggest that association

rules  derived  from  temporal  data  can  be  further  mined  to  produce  (cid:212)meta-rules(cid:213)  that
describe how the initial, data-derived association rules vary over time.

Externally  de(cid:222)ned  expert  knowledge  may  be  used  as  rules  within  a  data  mining
algorithm  to  tune  parameters  and  improve  the  ef(cid:222)ciency  of  data  mining,  or  to  ensure
that the KDD results are meaningful by minimizing the derivation of coincidental group-
ings  and  associations.  One  area  of  spatial  data  mining  research  that  has  incorporated
the  use  of  externally  de(cid:222)ned  expert  knowledge  is  image  segmentation.  Studies  in  this
area  have  sought  to  improve  image  classi(cid:222)cation  accuracy  and  ef(cid:222)ciency  as  well  as  to
automate  the  extraction  of  semantic  content  from  medical  and  satellite-based  imagery
(Ton et al. 1991, Ezquerra and Mullick 1996, Sonka et al. 1996, Zhang et al. 2002). In
these studies, data mining typically takes place via an initial unsupervised classi(cid:222)cation
of  pixels,  which  is  then  re(cid:222)ned  through  the  application  of  expert  knowledge  of  the
domain. This knowledge may be input to the data mining algorithm via user interaction
or  through  the  use  of  pre-programmed  (i.e.  hardwired)  production  rules.  This  area  of
research  is  focused  primarily  on  the  automation  of  image  interpretation  using  data
mining techniques, and has generally not been extended to support the discovery of new
knowledge from imagery.

The effective integration and use of knowledge within KDD demands explicit data-
base  support  not  only  for  data  but  also  for  knowledge,  whether  that  knowledge  is
derived  from  the  knowledge  discovery  process  itself  or  is  derived  from  experts  and
stored  a  priori  in  the  database.  We  suggest  that  research  in  cognition  may  inform  the
development of database support for both data and knowledge representation in KDD.
The high degree of interdependency between data and knowledge in KDD is analogous
to  the  distinction  between  sensory  input  and  conceptual  knowledge  in  the  context  of
cognitive knowledge acquisition. Cognitively, people use stored knowledge to interpret
sensory  information  (e.g.  sights  and  sounds)  in  everyday  circumstances  and  gradually
acquire new conceptual knowledge through this interactive process (Peuquet 2002). The
process of discovering knowledge from observational data in a computational environ-
ment is also typically highly interactive, bringing previously derived knowledge to bear
in  interpreting  and  subsequently  understanding  new  observations  (Fayyad  et  al.  1996,
Mennis et al. 2000). Existing knowledge can then be augmented or modi(cid:222)ed to re(cid:223)ect
any  new  insights,  and  the  process  continued.  Moreover,  the  interaction  of  the  human
and the computer in this process takes advantage of the computational speed, mechan-
ical accuracy, objectivity and persistent memory of the computer and the human(cid:213)s intuit-
ive  powers  and  ability  to  bring  knowledge  from  disparate  knowledge  domains  to  bear
on a problem (Peuquet 2002).

Knowledge  representation  in  KDD  should  support  the  iterative  and  interactive
nature of the knowledge discovery process to enable the analyst to iteratively apply, and
revise  the  parameters  of,  speci(cid:222)c  data  mining  techniques.  Knowledge  representation  in
the  context  of  KDD  should  also  be  (cid:212)(cid:223)exible(cid:213)  in  the  sense  that  the  KDD  system  user
should be able to revise and interpret stored and derived knowledge interactively. As an
approach to this interactivity, Imielinski and Mannila (1996) have suggested that users
of  KDD  environments  should  be  able  to  access  knowledge  elements  (e.g.  classi(cid:222)cation
rules or the results of a cluster analysis) directly as database objects. Such an approach
assumes,  of  course,  that  there  exist  data  structures  to  explicitly  store  these  knowledge
elements persistently in the database.

Over  the  past  decade,  researchers  in  geographic  information  science  have  focused
signi(cid:222)cant attention on improving the representational power of geographic data models

beyond the conventional vector and raster models used in current geographic informa-
tion systems (GIS) (Egenhofer et al. 1999). Many of these advances in geographic data
modeling  have  focused  on  improving  semantic  representation  in  order  to  represent
observational  data,  knowledge  that  may  be  derived  from  those  data,  and  the  mapping
between data and knowledge (Leung et al. 1999, Mennis 2003). Here, we leverage this
previous geographic data modeling research to develop database support for both data
and knowledge and thus integrate geographic knowledge representation into KDD.

3 An Approach for Combined Data and Knowledge Representation

In previous research we have described the derivation and implementation of a semantic
spatio-temporal data model based on the principles of human cognition (Mennis et al.
2000,  Mennis  2003).  This  semantic  data  model  incorporates  many  aspects  of  well-
known  knowledge  representation  strategies  as  discussed  in  the  computer  science  liter-
ature (e.g. Minsky 1975, Booch 1994, Sowa 2000), including object-oriented modeling,
frames, and rules. In the current research, this model is used as the basis for implement-
ing  the  prototype  KDD  environment  used  in  the  case  study.  The  semantic  data  model
and KDD environment are associated with a larger software development project called
Apoala (see www.geovista.psu.edu/grants/apoala for additional details). 

Poet

The semantic spatio-temporal data model is implemented using the object-oriented
 (Poet, Inc.) and the Java programming language, and is divided
database platform 
into  two  primary  parts:  the  Data  Component  and  Knowledge  Component  (Figure  1).
The  Data  Component  is  intended  to  store  observational  data,  represented  by  the  class
ATTVALUE  that  stores  an  observed  thematic  value  and  a  spatio-temporal  reference
for that measurement. The Knowledge Component is intended to store information on
semantic  categories  and  entities,  represented  by  the  classes  CATEGORY  and  THING,
respectively.

The data mining  technique  that is supported by the  data model implementation is
a deductive, classi(cid:222)cation-based algorithm that performs feature extraction. It is similar
to the previously discussed use of expert knowledge for image segmentation (Ton et al.
1991),  and  to  what  has  been  described  as  (cid:212)template-based  mining(cid:213)  because  one  uses  a
template  of  a  pattern  to  (cid:222)nd  instantiations  of  that  pattern  in  the  data  (Roddick  and
Spiliopoulou 2002). In our approach, expert knowledge is encoded as a set of rules that
are stored in a CATEGORY object. These rules are intended as generic characterizations
of objects in a particular domain and are not limited to a speci(cid:222)c image or data set. These
rules are used to construct a query on the Data Component using Poet(cid:213)s implementation
of  the  Object  Query  Language  (OQL).  This  process  distinguishes  between  (cid:222)rst-  and
second-order  properties.  First-order  properties  address  the  composition  of  an  entity
while second-order properties address the descriptive attributes of an entity.

Two  types  of  properties,  called  TProp  and  CProp  properties,  are  prede(cid:222)ned  to
allow storage of general properties of any given entity and category, respectively. While
these properties are prede(cid:222)ned within the stored knowledge base, they may or may not
be  used,  depending  on  the  speci(cid:222)c  observational  data  being  examined.  Examples  of
TProp  properties  include  BIRTH,  when  a  THING  object  begins  its  existence,  and
LIFESPAN,  the  duration  of  a  THING  object(cid:213)s  existence.  CProp  properties  include
those  that  describe  the  criteria  for  membership  within  a  CATEGORY.  For  instance,
while  a  THING  object  may  have  an  observed  LIFESPAN,  a  CATEGORY  has  a

LIFESPANRANGE  (a  maximum  and  minimum  lifespan).  These  prede(cid:222)ned  properties
may be extended through specialization in order to customize properties in a way that
is most suitable for a given application domain.

4 Case Study: Representing and Extracting Storms from a Meteorological 
Data Set

4.1 Background

The  application  domain  used  for  this  case  study  concerns  the  representation  and  ana-
lysis  of  storms  and  related  meteorological  phenomena  in  the  Susquehanna  River  Basin
2
  throughout  central  Pennsylvania,  southern  New
(SRB),  which  extends  70,448 km
York, and a small portion of northern Maryland where the Susquehanna River empties
into  northern  Chesapeake  Bay.  For  the  purpose  of  representing  these  meteorological
phenomena, an observational data set consisting of daily maximum temperature, daily

minimum temperature, and daily total precipitation for the SRB was acquired from the
Environment  Institute  at  the  Pennsylvania  State  University.  Each  day(cid:213)s  observations
 91 cell, four kilometer resolution grid, generated from an inverse
were stored as a 97 
distance  weighted  interpolation  of  National  Climate  Data  Center  (1995)  weather  sta-
tion  data.  The  author  of  the  data  set  checked  for  errors  and  logical  inconsistencies  in
the  data  (e.g.  negative  precipitation  values,  missing  values,  etc.)  and  adjusted  the  two
temperature variables for changes in elevation. 

A time period of three months (June, July, and August 1969) was used for this case
study.  Summertime  data  were  chosen  in  order  to  capture  the  presence  of  local,  con-
vective  thunderstorms  that  typically  do  not  occur  during  winter.  These  thunderstorms
may be contrasted with larger, longer-lasting storms that occur year round in order to
represent a variety of storm types. While a number of different years of summertime data
were available, a visual review of the data showed that the summer of 1969 included a
multiplicity  of  spatio-temporal  patterns  of  precipitation  that  could  be  categorized  as
different storm types.

We  used  expert  knowledge  derived  from  the  meteorological  literature  (Weisman
and  Klemp  1986,  Carleton  1991)  to  create  a  typology  of  storm  types  that  may  be
identi(cid:222)ed  from  the  observational  data.  The  typology  distinguishes  primarily  between
local  storms,  those  brief,  isolated  storms  that  occur  in  small  areas,  and  regional
storms, those larger storms that covered a signi(cid:222)cant portion of the SRB. A secondary
distinction is made between severe storms, those that are distinguished by a comparat-
ively  large  amount  of  precipitation,  and  mild  storms,  those  with  a  lesser  amount  of
precipitation.

In  addition,  the  distinctions  between  different  types  of  storms  and  the  representa-
tions of individual storms are necessarily constrained by the spatial and temporal resolu-
tion of the observational data. For this reason, no individual storm can be represented
as  being  less  than  one  day  in  duration,  since  the  observational  data  have  a  daily  tem-
poral resolution. While we acknowledge that this data resolution may not capture small
or brief storms, we have developed a storm typology that takes the spatial and temporal
resolution  constraints  of  the  observational  data  into  account.  While  it  would  certainly
be useful to have observational data with a (cid:222)ner temporal resolution (in grid form), and
thus be able to support the extraction of other mesoscale storm types that are commonly
addressed in climate analysis (e.g. squall lines), the available data are suf(cid:222)cient for our
purpose  here  of  demonstrating  the  role  of  knowledge  representation  in  geographic
knowledge discovery. 

4.2 Storm Representation

The  typology  of  storms  is  represented  in  the  database  by  extending  the  CATEGORY
class to create a hierarchy of storm types (Figure 2). We (cid:222)rst de(cid:222)ne a generic category
of  storm,  STORMCATEGORY,  by  extending  the  CATEGORY  class.  We  then  distin-
guish  between  local  and  regional  storms  (LOCAL  and  REGIONAL  classes,  respect-
ively). Each local or regional storm may also be categorized as either mild or severe (e.g.
LOCALMILD  and  LOCALSEVERE,  respectively).  Thus,  each  storm  that  is  extracted
from the observational data is categorized according to one of the storm types contained
within this hierarchy.

The STORMCATEGORY class includes those properties that are deemed essential

for representing a type of storm:

Figure 2 UML overview diagram of the classes that represent the storm taxonomy, derived

¥ SIZERANGE 
¥ PRCPVALRANGE 
¥ AVGPRCPRANGE  range in average precipitation value of a storm
¥ MAXPRCPRANGE range in maximum precipitation value of a storm

range in size
range in precipitation value

Note that some of these properties, such as LIFESPANRANGE, are taken directly from
the  CProp  library.  Other  properties,  such  as  PRCPVALRANGE,  are  extended  from
more  (cid:212)generic(cid:213)  CProp  properties  to  capture  a  particular  aspect  of  the  application
domain. All the classes that are subcategories of the STORMCATEGORY class inherit
these  properties,  although  the  properties  are  assigned  different  values  when,  say,  the
LOCALMILD class is instantiated versus the REGIONALSEVERE class. 

This storm typology bears some resemblance to the concept hierarchy idea associ-
ated  with  data  characterization-based,  data  mining  techniques  implemented  using  on-
line  analytical  processing  (OLAP)  data  cubes  (Shoshani  1997)  and  attribute-oriented
induction  (Han  et  al.  1993).  The  storm  typology  is  similar  to  a  concept  hierarchy  in
that  both  are  used  for  classi(cid:222)cation.  However,  the  concept  hierarchy  is  a  classi(cid:222)ca-
tion  of  data  and  consists  of  simply  setting  the  upper  and  lower  bounds  of  a  range  of
data  values.  The  storm  typology,  on  the  other  hand,  is  a  classi(cid:222)cation  of  semantic
entities  (i.e.  storms)  that  are  the  results  of  a  previous  feature  extraction,  data  mining
operation.

Analogous to how the CATEGORY class is extended to represent different types
of  storms,  the  THING  class  is  extended  to  the  STORMTHING  class  to  represent  an
observed, actual storm. The STORMTHING class has a number of property classes that

' Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003

 

 

 
 
 

 

378

are either added as a component of the class directly from the TProp library or extended
from one of those classes. These properties include:

¥ BIRTH
¥ DEATH 
¥ LIFESPAN 
¥ SIZEMIN
¥ SIZEMAX 
¥ SIZEAVG
¥ MAXPRCP the  maximum  precipitation  value  observed  within  a  storm  during  its

when a storm begins its existence
when a storm ends its existence
the duration of a storm(cid:213)s existence
the minimum size of a storm during its existence
the maximum size of a storm during its existence
the average size of a storm during its existence

¥ AVGPRCP 

existence
the  average  precipitation  value  observed  within  a  storm  during  its
existence

Note  that  characteristics  of  size,  duration,  and  severity  are  deemed  important  for  all
observed  storms,  regardless  of  type,  even  though  the  observed  values  for  each  of  the
properties  obviously  differ  among  individual  storms.  The  STORMTHING  class  also
contains  a  method  to  calculate  the  value  for  each  of  its  own  properties  through  an
analysis  of  its  instantiation  in  the  Data  Component.  For  example,  the  value  for  the
property  BIRTH  is  calculated  by  iterating  through  a  given  STORMTHING  object(cid:213)s
collection of ATTVALUE objects to (cid:222)nd the earliest stored time reference.

4.3 A Demonstration of Storm Extraction and Analysis

Here, we present an example of how the user may interact with the KDD environment
in order to extract and analyze storms from the meteorological data. The nature of this
interaction  is  presented  schematically  in  Figure  3.  At  the  top  of  the  diagram  is  the

categorical  hierarchy  (i.e.  taxonomy)  of  different  storm  types  and  their  stored  pro-
perties. This expert knowledge (i.e. part of the Knowledge Component of the database) is
used to interpret the observational meteorological data stored in the Data Component,
represented by the cube in the lower left of the diagram. The result of this interpretation
(through  an  automated  feature  extraction  algorithm)  is  the  identi(cid:222)cation  of  a  set  of
storm entities within the observational data, i.e. speci(cid:222)c storms of a given type, that can
then  be  subsequently  added  to  the  Knowledge  Component  of  the  database  as  derived
knowledge.  Visualization,  as  well  as  other  algorithmic/statistical  methods,  may  be
used to verify the results of this analysis and the categorical properties may be revised,
leading  to  a  new  interpretation  of  the  observational  data,  new  veri(cid:222)cation  procedures,
and so on.

Note that this process of user interaction with the KDD environment is intended to
support the analysis of knowledge derived from the knowledge discovery process itself,
as is suggested by Spiliopoulou and Roddick (2000). As a (cid:222)rst step, the user mines the
precipitation  data  to  extract  individual  storms.  As  a  second  step,  the  user  may  apply
further mining tools, such as visualization and statistical techniques, to detect patterns
among those extracted storms. This approach thus supports the investigation of know-
ledge  not  just  about  patterns  embedded  in  the  precipitation  data,  but  about  patterns
evident among the results of previous data mining operations, i.e. among the storms.

The feature extraction process is a three step procedure implemented through a set
of methods contained in the CATEGORY class and then customized for storm feature
extraction in the STORMCATEGORY class. The (cid:222)rst step retrieves those ATTVALUE
objects that meet the (cid:222)rst-order property criteria of a STORMCATEGORY object, the
presence  of  precipitation,  which  is  speci(cid:222)ed  in  the  PRCPVALRANGE  property.  The
second step organizes the collection of ATTVALUE objects retrieved from the (cid:222)rst step
into spatially and temporally contiguous groups which serve as temporary, (cid:212)candidate(cid:213)
STORMTHING  objects.  The  user  can  interactively  specify  the  nature  of  how  spa-
tially  and  temporally  contiguous  ATTVALUE  objects  are  grouped  into  candidate
STORMTHING objects by setting the contiguity constraint, a parameter that controls

z
the distance that the algorithm searches in the three spatial dimensions (

  dimensions.  Once  these  candidate

the  second-order  properties  of  the  candidate  STORMTHING  objects  (e.g.  LIFESPAN)
to  the  second-order  properties  of  the  STORMCATEGORY  class  (e.g.  LIFESPAN-
RANGE)  to  determine  whether  a  particular  candidate  STORMTHING  object  may  be
considered a member of a particular type of storm.

for the LOCALSEVERE storm type. A (cid:212)null(cid:213) value listed in Table 1 indicates there is no
threshold maximum or minimum value speci(cid:222)ed for that particular property. The values
stored within the PRCPVALRANGE property are used to identify those observations in
the meteorological data where there is the ((cid:222)rst-order property) presence of precipitation
  0.01  inches).  Candidate  storms,  i.e.  regions  of  precipitation  that  are
(precipitation 
contiguous  in  space  and  time,  are  then  identi(cid:222)ed  using  the  contiguity  constraints

)  and  temporal  (
property  values  of  each  candidate  storm  (e.g.  SIZERANGE)  are  then  calculated  and
compared to the values found in the LOCALSEVERE property template given in Table 1
to  determine  whether  a  particular  candidate  may  be  recognized  as  an  instance  of  a
LOCALSEVERE storm.

t

When  the  property  template  listed  in  Table  1  is  used  to  extract  LOCALSEVERE
storms, 398 individual candidate storms are identi(cid:222)ed that meet the (cid:222)rst-order property
that speci(cid:222)es spatio-temporal contiguity of the presence of precipitation. Of these 398,
only (cid:222)ve candidates meet the second order properties speci(cid:222)ed by the SIZERANGE and
MAXPRCPRANGE  properties  and  were  thus  recognized  as  LOCALSEVERE  storms.
Table  2  lists  these  (cid:222)ve  storms,  their  observed  properties,  and  the  group  mean  for  each
property.

It is important to note that nothing was (cid:212)set-in-stone(cid:213) about the criteria listed in the
LOCALSEVERE property template as shown in Table 1, and the property values them-
selves were set somewhat arbitrarily. In fact, it is intended that the criteria listed in the
property templates are gradually modi(cid:222)ed and re(cid:222)ned to support the iterative nature of
the  knowledge  discovery  process.  For  instance,  a  researcher  may  be  interested  in  how
the recognition of LOCALSEVERE storms may be altered if certain criteria are relaxed.
If the minimum value for the MAXPRCPRANGE property is changed from 0.5 inches
to  0.25  inches,  nine  additional  LOCALSEVERE  storms  may  be  identi(cid:222)ed.  One  might
also wish to investigate the effect of relaxing the criteria regarding the size of a storm.
If the property template listed in Table 1 is further altered so that the maximum value

Throughout  the  alterations  to  the  LOCALSEVERE  property  template  thus  far  the
 contiguity constraints have both remained at a value of (cid:212)1,(cid:213) thus ensuring that

each  individual  storm  is  composed  of  a  set  of  ATTVALUE  objects  with  precipitation
values 
 0.01 inches that are directly spatially adjacent to one another. If we continue to
alter  the  property  template  shown  in  Table  1  by  relaxing  the  contiguity  constraint  to
 dimensions, a total of seven individual storms may be identi(cid:222)ed
y
(cid:212)10(cid:213) in both the 
(Table 3). Note that these storms may be thought of as (cid:212)regions(cid:213) in which there may be
spatial  (cid:212)gaps(cid:213)  up  to  nine  cells  wide  between  areas  of  precipitation.  A  comparison  of
Tables 2 and 3 clearly shows that by iteratively revising the de(cid:222)nition of a category and
rerunning the feature extraction algorithm, very different sets of entities may be extracted.
Consider  another  example  which  seeks  to  extract  both  LOCALSEVERE  and
LOCALMILD storm types with the property templates shown in Tables 4 and 5, respect-
ively.  When  these  LOCALSEVERE  and  LOCALMILD  templates  were  used  to  extract
storms  from  the  observational  data,  a  total  of  202  individual  storms  were  identi(cid:222)ed.
Figure 4 shows a map depicting six of these storms that occurred on 15 August 1969.
Note  that  some  contiguous  regions  of  precipitation  were  too  small  to  meet  the  size
criteria  for  recognition  as  a  local  storm,  such  as  those  isolated  cells  of  precipitation  at
the extreme southern end of the SRB.

In order to investigate the character of these local storms a histogram of storm size
was  generated  (Figure  5).  The  histogram  clearly  shows  that  most  of  the  storms  are

LOCALSEVERE  and  LOCALMILD  property  templates  (Tables  4  and  5,  respectively).
A visual display of precipitation (Figure 4) provides insight into the distribution of the
size of storms. On 15 August 1969, six individual local storms can be recognized, many
of which are very close to one another spatially. However, because the contiguity con-
  dimensions,  each  individual  (cid:212)cluster(cid:213)  of  pre-
y
straint  was  speci(cid:222)ed  as  (cid:212)1(cid:213)  in  the 
cipitation was recognized by the clustering algorithm as an individual storm, even if it
was only separated by one (cid:212)non-precipitation(cid:213) cell from another precipitation cluster.

Of course, these individual storms that all took place on 15 August 1969 in the SRB
are  most  likely  dynamically  related  to  one  another.  A  user  may  therefore  wish  to  con-
sider all of these individual local storms as one larger storm system and investigate the
properties of this type of storm and its distribution throughout the observational data.
As an example of this approach, a new property template was interactively de(cid:222)ned for
a  REGIONALMILD  storm  type  with  the  properties  listed  in  Table  6.  Storm  feature
extraction  using  this  template  resulted  in  the  identi(cid:222)cation  of  40  REGIONALMILD
storms. Because all precipitation values on 15 August 1969 are spatially within ten cells
of  another  precipitation  value,  all  of  the  local  storms  together  are  recognized  as  one
REGIONALMILD storm with the following properties:

In order to investigate the character of these REGIONALMILD storms, a scatterplot
of  the  size  versus  the  average  precipitation  associated  with  each  storm  is  generated
(Figure 6). Note that as the size of a storm increases, so does the average precipitation.
This relationship is also demonstrated through further statistical analysis. A regression
of  storm  size  on  average  precipitation  results  in  a  standardized  b   =  0.66  and  an  R2  =
0.44 (signi(cid:222)cance level < 0.0005).

plate similar to Table 6, but in which the minimum and maximum AVGPRCPRANGE
values  were  set  to  0.25  and  null,  respectively.  Interestingly,  there  is  not  a  statistically
signi(cid:222)cant  relationship  between  storm  size  and  average  precipitation  among  these

REGIONALSEVERE storms. These results appear to indicate a difference in the dynamics
between  large  mild  and  large  severe  storms  in  the  SRB  that  is  of  climatological  sig-
ni(cid:222)cance.  The  positive  relationship  between  storm  size  and  average  precipitation  in
REGIONALMILD storms may be due to the ability of large storms in the SRB to tap into
Atlantic  Ocean  moisture.  The  lack  of  such  a  relationship  in  the  REGIONALSEVERE
storms  may  indicate  that  the  genesis  of  large  and  severe,  as  opposed  to  mild,  summer
storms in the SRB are in(cid:223)uenced primarily by local meteorological factors.

The motivation for presenting this information here, however, is not necessarily to
demonstrate  any  speci(cid:222)c  climatologic  principle,  but  rather  to  demonstrate  how  know-
ledge  representation,  and  its  iterative  re(cid:222)nement,  may  aid  in  the  knowledge  discovery
process. Note that the relationship between REGIONALMILD storm size and average
precipitation may be recognized using the knowledge representation and feature extrac-
tion  techniques  described  here,  but  may  otherwise  have  gone  undetected  using  more
standard data mining techniques. Consider, for example, that attribute-oriented induc-
tion  would  allow  for  the  characterization  of  precipitation  observations  summarized
according to various abstraction levels of some prede(cid:222)ned concept hierarchy. However,
because  attribute-oriented  induction  focuses  strictly  on  identifying  patterns  evident
within  the  observational  data,  and  not  on  patterns  that  may  be  observed  among  the
mined features extracted from those data, it would not reveal the relationship between
REGIONALMILD  storm  size  and  average  precipitation  that  is  demonstrated  here.
Simply put, there would be no such thing as a (cid:212)storm(cid:213) represented, and thus capable of
being analyzed, in the attribute-oriented induction of the precipitation data.

4.4 Extending the Demonstration

Thus far in the demonstration, the representation of entities was limited to those entities
with a lifespan of one day, essentially one (cid:212)time-step(cid:213) in the observational data. In order
to  demonstrate  the  representation  of  spatio-temporal  entities  that  last  for  longer  time
periods (more than one (cid:212)time-step,(cid:213) within our example data set), we focus here on the
representation of temperature regions: regions of heat or cold that extend across space
and through time. 

Just  as  the  CATEGORY  class  was  extended  to  create  the  STORMCATEGORY
class  for  the  representation  of  storm  phenomena,  the  CATEGORY  class  was  also
extended  to  create  the  TREGIONCATEGORY  class  for  the  representation  of  temper-
ature  regions.  The  TREGIONCATEGORY  class  may  be  extended  to  represent  a  par-
ticular  type  of  temperature  region  entity,  such  as  a  heat  wave  or  cold  wave.  The
TREGIONCATEGORY class contains the following properties:

¥ SIZERANGE
¥ LIFESPANRANGE
¥ TMAXVALRANGE range in maximum temperature value
range in minimum temperature value
¥ TMINVALRANGE

range in size
range in lifespan

Analogously, the THING class was extended to create the TREGIONTHING class,
which represents an individual temperature region that may be observed in the observa-
tional data. The TREGIONCATEGORY class was then extended to create a class called
HOTREGION, which is intended to represent spatio-temporally contiguous regions of
high  temperature,  i.e.  a  heat  wave.  The  properties  associated  with  the  HOTREGION
class are listed in Table 7.

greater than or equal to 95(cid:176) F. Note that the temporal contiguity constraint (cid:212)t(cid:213) is set to

This  example  of  temperature  regions  may  be  extended  for  the  representation  of
complex spatio-temporal phenomena, those phenomena that are composed of multiple
spatio-temporal components. As an example of the representation of complex phenom-
ena,  we  de(cid:222)ne  and  extract  (cid:212)precipitation-temperature  events(cid:213)  from  the  observational
data, each of which is composed of a TREGIONTHING object and a STORMTHING
object  that  are  coincident  in  space  and  time.  The  motivation  for  this  example  is  to
examine the relationships between temperature and precipitation patterns by identifying
when, and how often, individual types of storms and temperature regions co-exist. The
category and entity aspects of this complex phenomenon are represented in the database
by the PTEVENTCATEGORY and PTEVENTTHING classes, respectively.

To extract PTEVENTTHING objects from the observational data, the PTEVENT-
CATEGORY  class  calls  a  method  that  iterates  through  the  collections  of  STORMTH-
ING  and  TREGIONTHING  objects  and  (cid:222)nds  entities  of  each  type  that  spatially  and
temporally  intersect.  When  such  an  intersection  is  found,  the  coincident  objects  are
stored  as  components  of  a  new  PTEVENTTHING  object.  For  this  example,  a
PTEVENTTHING  was  de(cid:222)ned as the  spatio-temporal intersection of  a  HOTREGION
object and a REGIONMILD object. By altering the properties of the HOTREGION and
REGIONALMILD  classes,  one  can  identify  a  different  set  of  temperature  regions  and
storms and therefore a different set of PTEVENTTHING objects. The properties of the
HOTREGION and REGIONALMILD classes used for this demonstration are listed in
Tables 8 and 9, respectively.

Figure 8 shows a PTEVENTTHING object that was found for 17 July 1969. This
PTEVENTTHING  object  is  composed  of  two  component  objects:  one  HOTREGION
object and one REGIONALMILD object. Note that these two objects partially overlap
in  space.  While  there  are  other  storm  entities  present  on  17  July  1969,  they  are  not
considered part of the PTEVENTTHING object because they are not spatially coincident
with the HOTREGION object.

5 Discussion and Conclusions

This  case  study  demonstrates  how  geographic  knowledge  can  be  represented  and
applied  within  the  context  of  KDD  to  extract  semantic  entities  from  an  observational
data set. The example concerning the representation of storms in the Susquehanna River
Basin  shows  how  a  hierarchy  of  storm  types  de(cid:222)ned  from  expert  knowledge  may  be
formally  represented  within  a  database  context  and  used  to  extract  instances  of  those
storm types from the observational data. The example further demonstrates how the user
may  interact  with  the  Knowledge  Component  in  order  to  build  and  re(cid:222)ne  that  know-
ledge in a (cid:223)exible manner using both his/her own a priori knowledge and new informa-
tion  derived  from  the  data  mining  procedures.  The  example  concerning  temperature
regions  demonstrates  the  representation  and  extraction  of  features  that  exist  across
space and through time, and the example concerning precipitation-temperature entities
demonstrates the representation and extraction of complex entities and categories.

Note that because KDD is an iterative and interactive process, the knowledge rep-
resentation and discovery environment described here is intended to be (cid:223)exible, and to

' Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003

allow  a  researcher  to  revise  the  database  representation  of  the  categories  and  entities
that compose a given domain. The user is thus free to create a property template for a
particular  semantic  category,  extract  the  appropriate  features  from  the  observational
data,  analyze  the  results  using  visualization  or  statistics,  revise  the  property  template,
extract a new set of features, and so on. The representation of knowledge in the data-
base is therefore not  simply the  (cid:212)end-product(cid:213) of the knowledge discovery process, but
also  acts  to  guide  the  researcher  through  the  process  by  providing  multiple  semantic
interpretations of the observational data.

Consider, for instance, the example of storm extraction and the cycle of knowledge
discovery  illustrated  in  Figure  3.  As  a  (cid:222)rst  step  we  de(cid:222)ned  the  LOCALSEVERE  storm
type using the property template described in Table 1 to extract individual storms. Note
that while this (cid:222)rst step demonstrates the ability to represent geographic knowledge in
a  database,  it  does  not,  by  itself,  demonstrate  the  role  of  knowledge  representation  in
KDD.  It  is  only  in  conjunction  with  the  following  steps  in  the  process,  whereby  the
de(cid:222)nition  of  the  LOCALSEVERE  storm  type  is  revised  and  the  results  explored  using
map and statistical techniques, that the iterative process of knowledge discovery is sup-
ported.  While  we  used  mapping  and  regression  to  investigate  the  patterns  associated
with the extracted storms, other statistical and graphical data mining techniques may be
easily incorporated within this cycle of knowledge discovery as part of a KDD process.
For example, within the demonstration domain used here, attribute-oriented induction
or  association  rule  mining  could  be  used  to  extract  relationships  among  the  set  of
extracted  storms,  and  this  information  could  then  be  used  to  revise  the  storm  feature
extraction rules.

While  we  acknowledge  that  the  case  study  presented  here  uses  a  well-established
technique, rule-based reasoning, for purposes of knowledge representation and feature
extraction, we use this technique to extend KDD research in a variety of ways. First, we
have provided a (cid:223)exible and general method for representing stored knowledge within
the context of KDD. Second, we have demonstrated a prototype KDD environment that
allows the user to interact and iteratively revise that knowledge. Third, we have demon-
strated how KDD can be applied to a geographic domain through database support for
geographic knowledge representation and geographic feature extraction algorithms that
utilize  that  knowledge.  In  future  research,  we  plan  to  extend  the  general  approach  we
have  established  here  by  exploring  more  complex  geographic  domains  and  incor-
porating more sophisticated data mining techniques.

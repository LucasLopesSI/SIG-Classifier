Abstract
The recent rise of neogeography and citizen sensing has increased the opportunities for the use of crowd-
sourcing as a means to acquire data to support geographical research. The value of the resulting volun-
teered geographic information is, however, often limited by concerns associated with its quality and the
degree to which the contributing data sources may be trusted. Here, information on the quality of sources
of volunteered geographic information was derived using a latent class analysis. The volunteered informa-
tion was on land cover interpreted visually from satellite sensor images and the main focus was on the
labeling of 299 sites by seven of the 65 volunteers who contributed to an Internet-based collaborative
project. Using the information on land cover acquired by the multiple volunteers it was shown that the
relative, but not absolute, quality of the data from different volunteers could be characterized accurately.
Additionally, class-speciﬁc variations in the quality of the information provided by a single volunteer
could be characterized by the analysis. The latent class analysis, therefore, was able to provide informa-
tion on the quality of information provided on an inter- and intra-volunteer basis.

1 Introduction

Crowdsourcing has become a popular means of acquiring information in a wide variety of
subject areas from astronomy (Raddick and Szalay 2010) to zoology (Dickinson et al. 2010,
Wiersma 2010). The power of the crowd is well known and it can sometimes be used to derive
information that was impossible or at least impractical to obtain by other means. The poten-
tial of crowdsourcing has been noted in geography and associated geospatial sciences with
numerous examples of its use (Basiouka and Potsiou 2012, Davis and de Alencar 2011, Girres
and Touya 2010, Goodchild 2007, Heipke 2010, Neis et al. 2012). There are, of course, major
limitations to crowdsourced data, not least those connected with their quality and the level of
trust that may be placed upon them (Flanagin and Metzger 2008, Hudson-Smith et al.

The accuracy of crowdsourced data is explored here in relation to its potential role in the vali-
dation of land cover maps, especially those derived from satellite remote sensing, although the
methods are of a more general nature and of broad applicability.

Land cover is one of the most important environmental variables. Land cover exerts con-
siderable inﬂuence over a range of environmental and human systems. For example, land cover
change is both a cause and a consequence of climate change, is the greatest threat to biodiver-
sity, and, among other things, can cause soil erosion, ﬂooding and altered local climates, all of
which can also greatly impact human health and well-being (Briassoulis 2003, Feddema et al.
2005, Freitas 2006). Land cover and land cover change, therefore, are key variables, central to
major research priorities such as the strategic research directions for the geographical sciences
identiﬁed by the US National Academies (CSDGSND 2010). That being the case, there is
clearly a need for accurate and up-to-date land cover information.

Fortunately, satellite remote sensing has the potential to provide spatially and temporally
detailed information on the Earth’s surface to inform land cover map production. Indeed, land
cover maps are now widely produced at a range of spatial and temporal scales via remote
sensing. However, for a map to have value it must be accurate and hence the validation of land
cover maps is a major issue. While ‘best practices’ for map validation exist (Strahler et al.
2006) the methods proposed are typically based upon established design-based inferential
methods using rigorous probability sampling which may often be impractical to implement
fully. Many maps, therefore, are either validated not at all or only sub-optimally (Foody 2002,
Olofsson et al. 2013); but it is important that a map be validated otherwise it is no more than
one, untested, hypothesized scenario of the land cover (Strahler et al. 2006).

There is great potential for crowdsourcing to contribute constructively to land cover map
validation activities (Iwao et al. 2006, Fritz et al. 2012). Indeed, contemporary mapping activ-
ity beneﬁts greatly from recent advances in geoinformation technologies beyond remote
sensing, notably through citizen sensors fostered by the proliferation of inexpensive and highly
mobile location-aware devices able to provide spatial data of value to the mapping community.
Mapping, therefore, can draw upon not only the work of authoritative agencies but also the
broader, amateur, community, often through contributions to Internet hosted collaborative
activities (e.g. Iwao et al. 2006). A key problem with the volunteered geographic information
(VGI) provided by the amateur community is that it can be of variable, and typically
unknown, quality. The volunteers providing the data may vary greatly, from enthusiastic but
naïve and untrained hobbyists to highly skilled professionals of considerable expertise. While
the latter group of people may often volunteer (Brabham 2012) the quality of the data pro-
vided may still be a concern given the known concerns with expert labelers (Foody 2002,
2010). There is also a danger that VGI may sometimes be corrupted by errors deliberately
introduced with malicious intent. It is often valuable, therefore, to have data provided by mul-
tiple observers, especially as this enables a consensus-based approach to be used in labeling
cases (Haklay et al. 2010, Tang and Lease 2011). Even with such approaches there are con-
cerns about the variation in quality of data acquired by different contributors as well as varia-
tions within the set of data provided by a single contributor. If VGI are to be used it is
important that information on the quality of the data and of the data sources be made
available.

The aim of this article is to explore the potential to estimate the accuracy of VGI. Speciﬁ-
cally, the aim is to characterize the accuracy of each volunteer or data source, such that the
relative accuracy of each can be determined to help potential users of the VGI evaluate its suit-
ability for the intended application. Attention is focused on VGI collected as part of a major

region contained by the blue box, the centre of which is indicated by the red dot

international open call for data collection via Geo-Wiki (Fritz et al. 2012) to aid the validation
of satellite sensor derived land cover products. Hence the work presented in this article lies at
the interface of remote- and citizen-sensing.

2 Data

The Geo-Wiki project (http://www.geo-wiki.org) was initiated to encourage a global network
of volunteers to help improve the quality of global land cover maps through crowd-sourcing
(Fritz et al. 2012). In brief, an open call for contributions to the project was made in Septem-
ber 2011 and closed in November of the same year. The project invited each volunteer to look
at a series of satellite sensor images and assign a land cover label from a deﬁned list of classes
to each highlighted region as shown in Figure 1; the volunteer is asked to label the area con-
tained within the blue box. More details of the competition can be found in Perger et al.
(2012). The legend comprised 10 classes: tree cover, shrub cover, herbaceous vegetation/
grassland; cultivated and managed, mosaic: cultivated and managed/natural vegetation, regu-
larly ﬂooded/wetland, urban/built-up, snow and ice, barren, and open water. A brief on-line
tutorial was available to aid the volunteers through the labeling process and there were no
constraints on involvement. Hence, the volunteers could vary greatly in their ability to accu-
rately label the land cover from the images presented to them. The volunteers could vary from
enthusiastic amateurs to experts in image interpretation and little or no information about the

nature of the volunteers was available to indicate possible data quality and trust levels. A total
of 65 volunteers contributed to the project and each was presented with up to 299 images for
labeling. The same set of images was used throughout and so the cases contained in the
derived data set were labeled multiple times. Three volunteers labeled all 299 cases and 18
labeled at least 200 cases while others labeled fewer, with one volunteer labeling just a single
case. Thus, not only was the set of class labels derived by the volunteers expected to be of
unknown and uncertain quality, it was also often incomplete.

A subset of the available data was used here. Speciﬁcally, the data were extracted from the
10 volunteers who provided the fullest set of labels. This data set included the set of labels
derived from three experts who also revisited the entire set of 299 images to derive a ground
reference data set. The latter is essentially a set of labels deﬁned by consensus amongst the
experts, similar to that used in the production of reference data in major mapping programs
(e.g. Scepan et al. 1999, Bicheron et al. 2008). The production of the reference data was
undertaken by the experts as a group and after each had undertaken the labeling task individu-
ally. Although derived in a normal way and based on expert opinion, these ground reference
data are still likely to be imperfect as the experts are not infallible. The reference data, there-
fore, do not represent the perfect gold standard reference that should ideally be used in accu-
racy assessment (Foody 2010) but form what is believed to be a very high quality reference. To
maintain a focus on VGI from non-experts, the data acquired by the three experts were
excluded from further analysis, leaving the labels provided by seven volunteers, labeled A-G,
for evaluation. Critically, however, these data were acquired independently of the production
of the ground reference data. The seven volunteers each labeled at least 289 of the 299 cases,
reducing the potential for complications caused by missing data, which is a topic of current
research. The location of the 299 cases and the seven volunteers whose labels are used in the
research are illustrated in Figure 2.

3 Methods

The degree of agreement between the set of labels derived by a volunteer with those from each
other volunteer was assessed and measured using the kappa coefﬁcient of agreement (Cohen

1960). The latter is a popular measure of inter-rater agreement and indicates the level of agree-
ment between a pair of classiﬁcations, speciﬁcally the level of agreement above that which
might be expected by chance; cases with missing values were excluded from the calculations.
Kappa was calculated from:

ˆκ =

where po represents the observed proportion of agreement and pc the proportion of agreement
expected to occur by chance. Although the kappa coefﬁcient is not really suited to accuracy
assessment (Foody 1992, 2008, Pontius and Millones 2011) it was also calculated for each
volunteer relative to the ground reference data to provide an indicator of agreement to the ref-
erence labels.

The accuracy of each volunteer’s labeling was also explored using a latent class analysis.
This type of analysis has been widely used to derive information on the accuracy of classiﬁca-
tion in the absence of a gold standard reference data set (Hui and Zhou 1998). In essence, the
latent class analysis uses the observed associations between the set of labels derived by the vol-
unteers as imperfect indicators of the unobserved (latent) classes of a latent variable that
equate, in this study, to the actual land cover. Here, it was assumed that the true land cover
class was a latent variable T, indexed t, and that the images were classiﬁed into an exhaus-
tively deﬁned set of q mutually exclusive classes.

A standard latent class model is based on the probability of observing the patterns of
class allocation made by the set of volunteers. The set of labels provided by the volunteers
represent the observed or manifest variables of the analysis and are used to provide informa-
tion on the unobserved (latent) variable. The set of volunteers, V, each label the images,
yielding a set of predicted class labels for each case. Here, Mv represents one of the set of V
manifest variables indexed 1(cid:2)v(cid:2)V, and its values are class labels represented by mv which
lie in the range r (1-q). Using vector notation M and m to represent the complete response
patterns (i.e. M denotes (M1, . . ., MV) and m denotes (m1, . . . mq)), the latent class model is
that the probability of obtaining the response pattern m, represented as P(M = m), is a
weighted average of the q class-speciﬁc probabilities P(M = m|T = t) (Magidson and
Vermunt 2004). On the assumption that the labels derived from each volunteer are condi-
tionally independent of those from all other volunteers, the latent class model may be
written as:

(

where P(T = t) is the proportion of cases belonging to latent class t (Yang and Becker 1997,
Vermunt 1997, Vermunt and Magidson 2003); if necessary the model can be adjusted to
allow for violation of the conditional independence assumption. The ﬁt of this model to the
data is typically evaluated with regard to the likelihood ratio chi-squared statistic, L2. The
latter compares the observed frequencies in the multi-dimensional contingency matrix that
illustrates the pattern of class allocation made by the volunteers with those expected from
the latent class model. A perfect ﬁt occurs if L2 = 0 and a model is normally viewed as
ﬁtting the data if the calculated value of L2 is sufﬁciently small to be attributable to the
effect of chance (Magidson and Vermunt 2004). Conventionally, therefore, a model would
be viewed as providing a good ﬁt to the data if the probability of observing the derived L2

statistic by chance was high (i.e. p > 0.05). Further details on latent class modeling may be
found in Rindskopf and Rindskopf (1986), Yang and Becker (1997), Vermunt and Magidson
(2003), and Magidson and Vermunt (2004).

A critical feature of the latent class model deﬁned in Equation (2) is that its only param-
eters are the latent class probabilities. Assuming that the latent classes are identiﬁable and
have been labeled to match the actual land cover class labels, the model’s parameters may be
used to indicate the accuracy of each volunteer’s contributions. For example, the model
parameter P(T = t) represents the probability of a case being a member of latent class t which,
for a simple random sample, directly reﬂects the proportion of that class in the data set which
can be valuable in support of class area estimation applications and non-site speciﬁc accuracy
assessment (Foody 2012, Foody and Boyd 2012, 2013). Additionally, the model parameters
representing the conditional probabilities include measures that equate to the popular site-
speciﬁc measure of producer’s accuracy (Foody, 2010, 2012, Yang and Becker 1997). Note
that the latter is, more formally, described as the conditional probability that a pixel classiﬁed
as belonging to a class is also labeled as a member of that class in the ground reference data
(Stehman 1997, Liu et al. 2009). Thus, when mv = t the expression P(Mv = mv|T = t) repre-
sents the producer’s accuracy for class t in the volunteered data represented by Mv. Thus, the
parameters of a suitable latent class model describe key measures of the accuracy of the vol-
unteer data sources and can even be derived in the absence of reference data (Foody 2012).
Additional measures of accuracy may be derived from the latent class analysis but are not
considered in this work.

The latent class model may also be used to derive a new a classiﬁcation for each case. This
classiﬁcation is derived following Bayes theorem with each case allocated to the class with
which it displays the largest posterior probability of membership (Vermunt and Magidson
2003, Magidson and Vermunt 2004) using:

The basic latent class modeling approach was adapted here to allow for missing cases.
This required the identiﬁcation of volunteers who provided an incomplete set of labels. It
was evident from the contributions received that there were unlabelled cases in the data pro-
vided by volunteers C-G. Additionally, it was observed that a pair of volunteers sometimes
failed to label a case. This latter situation occurred with volunteers C and F, D and F, E and
F, and F and G. As the full pattern of class labels across all seven volunteers cannot be
formed for the cases with one or more missing labels, sub-models that focused on only the
possible set of patterns given the missing cases were deﬁned to enable the analysis to be
undertaken with the LEM software (Vermunt 1997). The latter is a freely available and
widely used software system that allows the modeling of latent variables (the software and
further details can be downloaded from http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/over-tilburg-
university/schools/socialsciences/organisatie/departementen/mto/onderzoek/software/).

The central issue of relevance to this article is that the parameters of a latent class model
that ﬁts the observed pattern of labeling arising from the set of volunteers may be used to indi-
cate the accuracy of the data contributed by each volunteer. To allow a critical evaluation of
the estimates of volunteer accuracy derived from the parameters of the ﬁtted latent class
model, the results were compared against accuracy values derived in the conventional manner
relative to the high quality ground reference data set generated by three experts. The reference
data were also used to help label the latent classes.

Thus the accuracy of the labeling by each of the seven selected volunteers was assessed
relative to the ground reference data via a cross-tabulation of the volunteers’ labels with those
depicted in the ground reference data. The accuracy of labeling was quantitatively described
by the producer’s accuracy estimated from the cross-tabulation matrix and compared against
the corresponding estimate from the latent class model. The mean producer’s accuracy calcu-
lated over all classes was also used as a simple guide to overall classiﬁcation accuracy.

4 Results and Discussion

Although the thematic resolution of the land cover classiﬁcation used contained 10 classes,
only eight were actually identiﬁed within the set of images used; the regularly ﬂooded/wetland
and the snow and ice classes were absent. Additionally, three of the classes were rare, occur-
ring, for example, just once or twice within the ground reference data set. These rare classes
were the urban/built-up, barren, and open water. Given the very low number of cases of these
classes, the absolute magnitude of the producer’s accuracy for each was very sensitive to minor
variations in the number of cases predicted by each volunteer. The other ﬁve classes were much
more abundant, with, for example, 20–119 cases recorded for each in the ground reference
data set.

The 299 cases varied greatly in appearance and labeling challenge. For some, the label was
relatively obvious and all seven volunteers provided the same, correct label (Figure 3). For
other cases there was considerable uncertainty and the volunteers did not agree on the labeling
(Figure 4).

There was a relatively low level of agreement between the labels derived by the set of vol-
unteers, with the value of the kappa coefﬁcient of agreement varying from 0.227 to 0.565
(Table 1). In addition the value of the kappa coefﬁcient derived for evaluations of volunteer
labels against the ground reference data labels were low, ranging from 0.227 to 0.663. These
results indicate low levels of agreement between the different sets of class labels derived. With
no means to distinguish between the volunteers in terms of relative accuracy and with low
levels of agreement to the reference data, the results provide little to suggest, for example, that
information from a single volunteer may have an immensely useful role in aiding the valida-
tion of land cover maps. The potential to enhance the value of the VGI by utilizing the labels
provided by the multiple contributors together with a latent class analysis was evaluated.

The latent class analysis used the inter-relationships between the volunteered data to
uncover the hidden (latent) information on land cover. A latent class model informed by the

labels from the seven selected volunteers was constructed. This model had an L2 = 1341.4
(p >> 0.05), suggesting a good ﬁt to the observed data. The probabilities of class membership
derived from the model were used to allocate each case to one of the latent classes. Cross-
tabulation of the derived labels with the ground reference data provided a means to label the
latent classes.

The parameters from the latent class model that equate to the producer’s accuracy of each
volunteer were derived for each class. These model-based estimates of producer’s accuracy
provided estimates of the quality of the labeling by each volunteer for each class and, when
averaged, overall (Table 2). The model based estimates were compared against the estimates
derived from use of the ground reference data set (Table 3). It was apparent that the model
based estimates for the ﬁve most abundant classes were different in absolute terms, often con-
siderably over-estimating accuracy. However, closer inspection shows that there were strong
relationships between the estimated and actual producer’s accuracies. This was apparent on
both a class-speciﬁc (Figure 5) and overall basis (Figure 6). It was also evident that there was a
tendency for the class-speciﬁc accuracies to be over-estimated for the ﬁve most abundant
classes while the overall accuracies, inﬂuenced by poor estimation in relation to the relatively
rare classes (Tables 2 and 3), was under-estimated.

Focusing on the ﬁve land cover classes for which a relatively large sample was available
and hence the producer’s accuracy not overly inﬂuenced by a small number of cases, it was
evident that there was typically a strong positive relationship between the estimated and
actual accuracy values. Additionally, the model-based estimates typically indicated correctly
the relative performance of a volunteer with regard to the accuracy with which the different
classes were identiﬁed. For example, volunteer A provided the most accurate classiﬁcation of
the tree cover class (Figure 5a) but also the least accurate classiﬁcation of the mosaic class
(Figure 5e). Volunteer D, however, provided extremely accurate labeling of the mosaic class
(Figure 5e) but was much less accurate with the herbaceous vegetation/grassland (Figure 5c).
Additionally, it was evident that volunteer B was, in terms of accuracy, always a good labeler

but never the best. Critically, the accuracy with which a land cover class was identiﬁed varied
greatly between the volunteers. Each volunteer also typically varied in ability to label the dif-
ferent classes; and classes accurately labeled by one volunteer might be inaccurately identiﬁed
by another. These inter- and intra-volunteer variations in labeling accuracy may reﬂect varia-
tions in background education, skills and experience as well as issues connected with the
acquisition of the volunteer’s labels via the website. It is evident that each volunteer typically
found some aspects of the labeling task more difﬁcult than others and so the accuracy with
which each labeled a class varied. It was also evident that this type of information may help
users, for example, to select VGI for an application or perhaps to help identify which volun-
teers to approach for a future study and possibly those who might beneﬁt most from training.
Critically, the approach appears able to indicate the relative performance of each volunteer in
terms of the accuracy of labeling and the performance of a single volunteer with regard to
each class.

The strong positive relationship between the estimated and actual producer’s accuracy
was also evident in relation to the overall accuracy, expressed here as the mean producer’s
accuracy calculated over all classes (Figure 6). Although the sample size was small and the
data points in Figure 6 lie away from the 1:1 line there is a clear trend that suggests an
ability to characterize the relative accuracy of each contributor. Users of VGI may ﬁnd this
useful in sifting large VGI data sets to allow, for example, inaccurate data to be discarded to
allow a focus on the higher quality data and data sources. It should be noted, however, that
the approach presented here is applicable to situations in which multiple contributors are
used in a manner that ensures a set of labels are available for each case. The approach
would not be useful in situations in which only the results of one volunteer (e.g. the most
recent editor of an online system) were presented. In such situations it may be desirable to
make the labels from other contributors available as an aid to assessing the accuracy of the
data provided.

5 Conclusions

An open call for contributions to a land cover class labeling exercise was undertaken. A set of
65 volunteers generously contributed to the project. Attention here was focused on the data
provided by seven of the volunteers who labeled nearly all of the 299 sample cases provided
for labeling plus a reference data set derived from three expert labelers who contributed to the
exercise. The labeling task varied greatly, with some cases relatively straightforward to label

Figure 6 Relationship between estimated and actual mean producer’s accuracy determined over all
classes for each volunteer contributing data to the analysis. A standard regression line (and equa-
tion) is shown to help illustrate the relationship between the estimated and actual accuracy values
and the 1:1 line is shown in grey

while others were more ambiguous and challenging to label. Each volunteer provided a set of
labels that was only poorly related to the reference data (kappa <0.67) but the data from mul-
tiple volunteers could be constructively combined in the latent class analysis to yield useful
information on the quality of the VGI. The key ﬁnding is that the latent class model provided
a means to correctly characterize the relative performance of each volunteer in terms of class-
speciﬁc and overall classiﬁcation accuracy.

The main conclusions of the work reported here are:

• The latent class modeling approach provided a means to directly estimate the producer’s

accuracy of the volunteer data sources without reference data.

• The model based estimates of producer’s accuracy were typically incorrect in absolute
terms, with the accuracy often underestimated on an overall basis or overestimated for the
abundant classes. However, in relative terms the model-derived estimates typically charac-
terized the relative performance of the volunteers correctly in terms of the accuracy with
which they labeled the cases. The latter was evident in relation to both class-speciﬁc and
overall accuracy.

• The model provided a means to evaluate the accuracy of volunteered data both between
and within data sources. For example, the model allowed the relative performance of vol-
unteers to be assessed in terms of the accuracy of their labeling. It also allowed the per-
formance of a single volunteer in labeling the different classes to be assessed.

Critically, the latent class modeling approach applied allowed a means to characterize key
aspects of the quality of VGI. There is potential to estimate additional measures of accuracy
(e.g. user’s accuracy) or to enhance the modeling (e.g. possibility of additional latent classes
and variables or use of additional contributors) and future work is exploring some of the pos-
sibilities to further enhance the value of VGI.

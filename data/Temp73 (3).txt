Abstract
The UCGIS GIS&T Body of Knowledge document provided an opportunity for the GIS educational com-
munity to link course content and curricular sequencing to a catalog of subject matter. Focusing on learn-
ing objectives, a selection of relevant citations, and basic background for each topic, it has been used to a
limited degree for both course topic selection and curriculum development. However, the static format of
the document, lack of an index, and dated nature of the material limit its utility for education. Based on
the success of our research team in developing a virtual platform for a new, more interactive, and collabo-
rative environment to catalogue and interactively add to the body knowledge (Ahearn et al. 2013), this
article describes efforts to develop a multi-user virtual user environment that will add social presence to
the experience. It describes the successes and failures of using Second Life as the initial platform for this
work, illustrates the available interactions and limitations, and depicts ongoing efforts to move beyond
Second Life for this development. Finally it discusses a possible methodology to leverage the power of
virtual crowd sourcing within competitive gaming environments such as Unity to allow for the creation of
on-demand virtual 3-D visualizations of GIS&T concepts in a digital Exploratorium.

1 Introduction

In today’s increasingly cloud-based higher educational environment there is a need for current,
interactive, collaborative, immersive, and ﬂexible disciplinary tools that not only direct and
guide learners, but also engage them directly in the content. The publication of the GIS&T
Body of Knowledge (BoK) (DiBiase et al. 2006), besides introducing the potential of delivering
a benchmark of the discipline’s state of the art, also showed promise of providing such guid-
ance for educators, for both workforce development and disciplinary growth (DiBiase et al.
2009). Some research has already shown that the original BoK document provided certain
limited success in guiding educators with speciﬁc course goals, as well as suggesting overall
curricular direction (Prager and Plewe 2009). However, the original Bok was a static document
that was laborious to update. Furthermore, it did not provide a platform for both learners and
professionals to engage with each other and the issues and concepts that make up the knowl-
edge base of GIS&T. In this article we discuss our efforts in creating an interactive, responsive
platform that will allow users to interact with each other and the BoK in a meaningful and
unrestricted way.

The BoK document was an initial attempt to capture and codify the state of the art of
the GIS&T domain as a collection of learning objectives embedded in a hierarchical content
structure. The BoK’s design served not only as a baseline for existing knowledge throughout
the domain, but also to guide the educational community in its selection of topical material
for GIS&T education (Marble 1998). Originally, one of the primary purposes of the BoK
effort had been to deﬁne a multi-path entry into GIS&T education (Marble 1999). That
portion of the project has yet to be fully realized. The published BoK document was the ﬁrst
major product to come from the combined efforts of an editorial group (8–12 people) and
many outside reviewers and contributors (DiBiase et al. 2006). In short, the project was
developed as part of a community of scholars who interacted variously through e-mail, tra-
ditional mail, and in the case of the core editorial group, face-to-face meetings once or twice
a year.

The efforts of this community of scholars produced the ﬁrst-of-its-kind document for the
discipline, and its publication yielded many intended, and some unintended, consequences
(Johnson 2008). Among its uses are: initial linkages between student knowledge and what
constitutes a compilation of disciplinary knowledge, initial crosswalks between educational
learning objectives and professional skills, and even some utility as a guide for GIS certiﬁcation
(DiBiase et al. 2009, Couclelis 2010, DeMers 2009, Prager and Plewe 2009, Rip 2008, Toppen
and Reinhardt 2009). Despite these obvious beneﬁts the physical product demonstrates limita-
tions as an educational support tool. The current BoK is inherently incomplete, dated, and
biased, in terms of its static form and the process by which it was created. Its current physical
form – whether in print or as a PDF ﬁle (http://www.aag.org/galleries/publications-ﬁles/
GIST_Body_of_Knowledge.pdf) – makes searching, navigating, and exploring difﬁcult. The
role of a small group of in-domain experts as knowledge gatekeepers raises additional con-
cerns surrounding inclusiveness and currency.

If future editions of the GIS&T BoK are to reﬂect domain knowledge in a more organic,
current, accessible, and dynamic manner, then dramatically different core approaches and
enabling technologies are needed. Traditional institutions, for example university libraries, are
no longer the sole source of educational content, nor do they currently provide the most efﬁ-
cient or effective pedagogic instruments for disseminating such content (Katz 2008). Moreo-
ver, like the original BoK, these traditional sources of information are difﬁcult to use as part
of a dynamic, collaborative, and rapid learning environment because they are not universally
available in real-time for all members of the learning community. The cloud-computing para-
digm, where information is readily available over the Internet, suggests a viable alternative.
Links between a cloud knowledge base to more immersive types of interaction makes for a
constructivist form of learning, where students can engage in a community, and sharing an
intellectual landscape is possible . As a solution, we propose a virtual immersive Explorato-
rium as a type of commons for GIS&T knowledge where learners and scholars can interact
both with the content and with each other in real time and over large distances. In this
regard, it is a virtual equivalent of the “The Exploratorium” [http://www.exploratorium.edu]
after which its name is derived. It is an immersive laboratory that provides “. . . an eye-
opening, always changing, playful place to explore and tinker” [http://www.exploratorium.
edu]. In addition, this exploratorium would allow organic discussion of, and interaction with,
established and developing aspects of the BoK, similar to academic meetings and conferences.
However, unlike conferences, the BoK would be free to users and have no temporal or spatial
limitations. The GIS&T exploratorium would also include interactive games and activities
geared towards explanations of concepts. An initial platform within which such a community
can exist is described below.

2 The New BoK Platform

The above discussion suggests the need for a platform that supports a collaborative learning
community that is open access, moderated, ﬂexible, dynamic, and promotes discourse and col-
laboration. In contrast to the process responsible for the initial BoK document, online virtual
communities seem more adapt at providing these opportunities. A well recognized tool for such
collaborative interaction is the wiki, which stemmed from the efforts of Ward Cunningham.
Cunningham’s 1995 WikiWikiWeb (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_wikis) used the
power of the Internet, combined with web browser technology, to allow a select group of com-
puter programmers to collaborate with each other remotely. Current wiki technology employs
interlocked web pages and a simple markup language so that anyone capable of accessing the
web can contribute to ongoing discourse. The more advanced forms of wiki, exempliﬁed by
Wikipedia, provide knowledge management that allows for the identiﬁcation, creation, represen-
tation, and distribution of information. Wikis allow for all of those four characteristics, but are
limited in their ability to control content accuracy, a major goal of this research project. There-
fore, one of our research goals is to develop technology to enable widespread, diverse, and
democratic contributions by the entire GIS&T community while still yielding a high-quality
product. One option is to extend current wiki software to build a “BoK Wiki” as part of a larger
set of prototype web services called the GIS&T BoK RESTful Java web services. The GIS&T
BoK RESTful Java web services will allow for multiple query options, all returned as XML ﬁles.
XML ﬁles are used for output as they are a W3C standard endorsed by software developers and
market leaders. XML is the most common, widely accepted format for web deliverables while
still being easy to read and understand in its native format. The various components of the pro-
totype for the GIS&T BoK RESTful Java web services consist of:

(cid:129) An initial web service option that provides a GIS&T concept mapping and returns triplets
that represent relationships (logical mappings) between pairs of BoK concepts, output as
XML ﬁles (http://www.gistbok.org/gistbok/services/conceptmap) (Figure 1). The following
is an example triplet converted to a statement:

“Analytical Methods is broader than Calculating Surface Derivatives”

This “broader” relationship is hierarchical in that “Calculating Surface Derivatives” is a
subset of the broader “Analytical Methods.” In this way different relationships can be
deﬁned by the user based on speciﬁc query needs. The service also accepts concept-speciﬁc
queries where, for example, a concept query of “Data Mining” returns concepts that are
either broader or narrower.

(cid:129) Because the GIS&T concepts are related to skills, a second web service provided by
RESTful returns a concept-skills mapping that ties GIS&T concepts to skills that a learner
might be expected to know upon their mastery (Figure 2). This concept-skills map provides
a measure of learner progress that is tied directly to the BoK (Ahearn et al. 2013).

(cid:129) A third function of the RESTful service allows the learner to link GIS&T BoK concepts
directly to the references (citations) from which they were noted. This function allows the
user to build a relevant literature review from within the BoK platform itself.

(cid:129) Finally, the RESTful service also returns a list of available course modules submitted by
GIS&T educators, and a cross reference to each of the GIS&T BoK concepts contained in
each module.

While the RESTful environment has proven useful (Ahearn et al. 2013), its primary limita-
tion is that, because it is designed to provide the cyberinfrastructure elements that enable the
creation of end-user applications, it is necessary to build the social presence application neces-
sary for collaboration. During the development process of the original BoK, the ability of the
editorial group to be in the same room, carry on discussions, and provide each other with
nearly immediate feedback was among the more important reasons for in-person meetings.
Beyond the quick response, the formation of a knowledge community necessary to fulﬁll the
task of creating the original BoK was established in part because of the social presence of the
focus group members.

Some solutions to the dilemma of collaboration from diverse remote locations includes
the use of webconferencing tools such as GoToMeeting, Webex, Intercall, Centra, Ellumi-
nate, and Adobe AcrobatConnect. These tools allow for voice and video communica-
tion, slide sharing, and even the sharing of documents and ﬁles. Unfortunately, these tools
also require considerable setup times and equipment checks. Perhaps the most limiting
factor of these tools, however, is that they can be expensive, non-persistent, and suffer from
irrecoverable dropped data packets. In short, this pure approach is non-sustainable, although
it does provide the social presence and immediacy of
face-to-face meetings. Today’s
advanced computational environments, especially those employing serious gaming tech-
nologies such as Multi-User Virtual Environments (MUVEs), have a solution for these
limitations.

MUVEs have the advantage of being virtual, thus not requiring the physical presence of
individuals and incurring the attendant costs of such meetings. They are persistent environ-
ments as well, meaning they will continue to provide a meeting place for participants rather
than relying on set times. The social presence is provided to some degree by the use of avatars
(digital representations of participants) that act as surrogates for the physical presence (Bente
et al. 2008, Durlach and Slater 2000). Examples of well established persistent virtual environ-
ments (PVE) include Second Life, World of Warcraft, and OpenSim, all of which allow thou-
sands of online participants to interact, through their avatars, at any given time. The cost of
such an endeavor is considerably less than what one might expect of either face-to- face inter-
action or webconferencing (ComputerWeekly.com 2008). For instance, compare the free cost

of the PVE Second Life to any kind of travel, never mind travelling to the other side of the
globe for inter-person collaboration.

Examples of the use of PVEs to promote collaboration abound and involve some large
and well-known businesses such as IBM (McDougall 2009) and Volvo (Gardner 2009). Edu-
cation, an early focal point for the Linden Laboratory’s Second Life MUVE, embraced such
environments for collaboration (Waters 2009), knowledge sharing (Schmeil and Eppler
2008), simulation (Yellowlees and Cook 2006), role play (Nikendei et al. 2005), experiential
learning (DeMers 2010), and even content creation (DeMers 2011). These applications focus
on the enhanced social presence over text-based interaction (e.g. through learning manage-
ment systems or Google Docs), but also take advantage of 3-D building tools to provide a
landscape that enhances communication among participants. As with
shared intellectual
webconferencing tools, both text and voice can be recorded to ensure institutional memory.
New tools like Sloodle (Kemp et al. 2009) that emulate the capabilities of learning manage-
ment systems to track participation and provide feedback are already available and suggest
that data management tools will soon be available. Participants in these virtual worlds can
get together from anywhere around the world, use voice and text chat to communicate, and
even share collaborative tools like a spider diagram tool to focus and organize their
thoughts.

3 MUVEs for Exploratorium Development

Deployment of prototype Web services, centered on and driven by the domain ontology, has
shown that a virtual platform for future versions of the BoK is possible (Ahearn et al. 2013).
As a precursor to a second edition BoK (BoK2) that will be new in form and updated in
content, this platform enables visualizations of the existing BoK hierarchy, including an ability
to map new concepts onto the existing semantic web, and tools allowing educators to map
their course content onto the BoK. All these abilities center around an ontology that is meant
to simplify and extend the original BoK hierarchical structure to better express relationships
among concepts. The ontology provides relationships through part-whole hierarchies and
associations, employing Semantic Web standards for controlled vocabularies, notably SKOS
(Simple Knowledge Organization System) (Miles and Bechhofer 2008).

This article discusses the use of 3-D Virtual Persistent Environments (PVE) to extend the
utility of a virtual, collaborative BoK particularly to encourage educational and research col-
laboration, deliver educational content, and eventually to become an integral part of the plat-
form for the next generation of the Body of Knowledge: BoK2. It provides the context of this
work within our larger multi-university NSF-funded research project designed to re-engineer
the BoK. We demonstrate some initial efforts using a readily available commercial PVE called
Second Life. Using Second Life, this article demonstrates how we have been able to provide a
proof of concept for the use of web-scraping technology and intelligent agents within virtual
worlds that can both direct GIS&T learning and to some degree, facilitate it.

4 BoK VPE via Second Life

In many ways, the use of Virtual Persistent Environments (VPE) to explore and virtualize con-
cepts is in line with the constructivist view of education. In VPEs students are able to collabo-
ratively conceptualize, design, and create three-dimensional realizations of concepts using

primitive building objects called prims, and explore them in ways that are not possible in any
other medium. Among these realizations is the ability to interact on a personal level via
avatars. Our initial entry into this environment was based on the now well-established virtual
world known as Second Life©. Within Second Life, we created a virtual environment not
unlike the holodeck technology suggested in the Star Trek Next Generation television series
(Marty et al. 2007, Hill and Hyuk-Jin 2009). When participants’ avatars enter our environ-
ment in Second Life, they are greeted by a digital robot guide, known as a chatbot. The
chatbot uses artiﬁcial intelligence techniques surrounding the ALICE (Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Internet Computer Entity) project (http://www.alicebot.org/downloads/programs.html) and
now implemented via Pandorabots (Wallace 2005). Powered by Pandorabots, our chatbots use
a database of selected GIS&T related questions created outside of the game. By typing queries
in a general chat window with the form “What is a geodatabase?” a chatbot matches the
query to the answers loaded in the Pandorabot site via AIML (Artiﬁcial Intelligence Markup
Language) (Table 1, Figure 3), selects the appropriate response, and returns it as text chat to
the user in-game. The chatbot can build on the previous question asked by the user, engaging
in a topical conversation within limits of its programming. The chatbot can also add leading
questions of the user, further promoting an engaging exploration of GIS&T topics. If an
answer is not programmed into the chatbot, the chatbot, acting as a guide, can direct the user
to another chatbot programmed with answers to a speciﬁc GIS&T knowledge domain. The
chatbot can also use web scraping technology to ﬁnd a relevant answer. Unlike with traditional
Wikipedia queries, the Pandorabot interface allows the user to ask general questions and
obtain speciﬁc answers without the need for extensive reading of lengthy entries. Certain
queries will return responses that are based on the language of the query as well as the key
words often used for Wikipedia searches.

A kiosk near the chatbot acts as a transporter to all 10 of the UCGIS BoK knowledge
areas. Touching a knowledge area, the user is instantly transported to another area of the
simulation that contains a subject-speciﬁc chatbot, as well as a context-sensitive area not
unlike a museum (Marty et al. 2007) or Star Trek-like holodeck (Hill and Hyuk-Jin 2009) con-
taining links to outside websites, videos, and other multi-media sources (Figure 4). In this
ﬁgure, depicting the cartography holodeck, cartographic panels are behind and surrounding
the user’s avatar and the chatbot, each of which is hot-linked to a website containing context-
sensitive topical information. Although in a developmental phase, the process worked reason-
ably well, especially with the newer Second Life Viewer (user interface) software that is
better adapted to multimedia. Unfortunately, much of the interactions in Second Life are based
on user permissions associated with the virtual spaces upon which these simulations reside.
One restriction resulted in the need for each user (avatar) to interact with the multimedia
materials individually. This meant that collaborative learning based on multimedia was
limited.

Beyond the use of holodecks and the Pandorabot database, the chatbots also allowed us to
investigate the use of web scraping or web harvesting. We were able to imbue the digital
robots with the ability to surf the web and answer questions provided in public chat in the
form of “lookup term” where “term” refers to the speciﬁc topic being searched (e.g. “lookup
geography”), which provided a slightly different answer than using the Pandorabot prefab
answers we created. Essentially the chatbot searched for existing wiki information (primarily
Wikipedia), packaged it, and returned a portion of a wiki’s content as chat in-game. As a
proof-of-concept, the implementation was limited in that it required the search to be per-
formed with existing, non-refereed wiki materials. However, the web scraping algorithm can
be easily modiﬁed to take advantage of a refereed wiki that is aimed speciﬁcally at the BoK

knowledge domain. This will be a major improvement over existing web scraping as it will
allow the ﬁnal exploratorium to satisfy the need for content accuracy and for peer review that
does not exist in the Wikipedia environment.

One promising aspect of Second Life is that it provides for the creation of 3-D digital
content within the game itself. We examined, with some initial success, the ability to allow
users’ avatars to query an in-game source (possibly a digital chatbot) and not only receive
answers and/or directions to other information, but also to receive 3-D content that acted as
simulations of what the user requested. We found that we could produce simple models this
way, but there were two difﬁculties that arose limiting the potential. First, the query itself
needed to be of sufﬁcient speciﬁcity to allow us to program an equally speciﬁc model. In short,
one would need to ask for a model that already existed because one could not be produced
on-the-ﬂy. The number of possible models and the permutations on what they were called and
how they would be demonstrated was overwhelming.

Limits off-game interactions, speciﬁcally the RESTful

A second, and more severe limitation, is that all of these objects are based on a basic
building block called a “prim”, or primitive. The more complex the model becomes, the higher
the prim count. Unfortunately, Second Life places limits on the number of prims that can
coexist on a single simulation (sim). In addition, the greater the number of prims displayed at
any one time, the slower the user experience because of computer memory use. As a result,
even if we were able to create and store the nearly inﬁnite number of potential 3-D simulations
and models, the environment itself would restrict how many of these could be demonstrated at
any given time. Thus, this environment does not allow the user to create learning simulations
unless the simulation already exists. Additionally, as the content for any given Knowledge Area
grows, or the relevance of the topic increases, there is no way to easily visualize this knowl-
edge within the virtual world itself, although one can easily link back to the BoK site for this.
While the Second Life implementation provided us with an ability to investigate the use of
persistent immersive environments, we discovered several serious technical ﬂaws with the way
the virtual environment was implemented that directly impacted our ability to interact with
the BoK (Table 2).

The primary non-technical issues regarding the use of Second Life as an environment
within which to host a virtual Exploratorium is the commercial nature and the cost involved in
such a hosting service. While prices are not stable, the estimates for a single sim are well over
$3,000 per year. A functional Exploratorium would require multiple sims in which to operate.
As of February 2013, a full region (sim) that allows up to 15,000 prims would cost $1,000 for
setup and has a monthly maintenance fee of $295. Besides the cost, given the nature of Second
Life as a commercial venture in which the servers are offsite and are controlled by Linden
Research, the control necessary to properly manage an Exploratorium would not be available.
An alternative to Second Life might include the Open Simulator (http://opensimulator.org/
wiki/Main_Page), which operates much like Second Life and uses the Linden Scripting Lan-
guage as well. It has the same limitations as Second Life simulations without the cost, but
requires the user to host the site, adding the cost of large servers and server maintenance to the
Exploratorium.

5 Unity4 and Reaction Grid

While we have not entirely abandoned Second Life as a platform for immersive interaction with
the BoK, a new and much more powerful environment might enable us to accomplish much that

we could not do in Second Life. Recent advances in gaming creation software has resulted in the
development of the powerful Unity4 environment that enables the animation of virtual 3-D
objects, the development of in-game and on-screen user interfaces and the creation of extensive
interactive scenarios using standard transportable languages like Java Script, C#, and Boo (a
dialect of Python) Unity Manual (http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/index.html).

Unity4 (Unity) is a powerful 3-D game development environment that allows for import
of photo realistic game objects, avatars, environments, and special effects much like those
available through Pixar. The Unity tools were recently employed by Los Alamos National
Laboratories to create a realistic nuclear power plant that was used as a training environment
for the International Atomic Energy Commission inspectors (Michel et al. 2008). The Unity
platform by itself adds both realism and ﬂexibility of content, as users can import objects
created with high-end 3-D software such as Maya and open source software such as Blender.
Environments programmed in Unity are adaptable to multiple platforms such as Mac,
Windows, iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. Additionally, Unity provides a robust program-
ming environment that employs Unity Script, a variation of JavaScript, with thousands of pre-
programmed functions that shortens development time considerably over using raw code. This
programming environment, combined with Unity’s extensibility, make it a powerful one in
which to build a virtual Exploratorium.

Integrating the power of Unity with the interactivity of Reaction Grid allows a multi-user
Exploratorium to come to life. Unity’s main limitation, for our purposes, is that it is designed
primarily to create single user environments. This is where Reaction Grid comes into play.
Reaction Grid has recently integrated a number of tools into a package called Jibe (Figure 5),
which leverages several open-source tools to allow up to 200 users to simultaneously interact
in a single simulation. Reaction Grid allows communication both in the form of text and voice
(requiring private hosting), and to interact seamlessly with any 2-D environment that contains
a URL. We are currently exploring this hybrid environment and have begun the process of rec-
reating the Second Life simulation, including Pandorabots integration, using Unity and Reac-
tion Grid. We are also exploring the use of the Unity3D interface to create a set of onscreen
(2-D) menus for interacting with both the 3-D and the 2-D environment. The hybrid interface
eliminates the need for a teleporting kiosk while allowing for easy access to 2-D and 3-D
content. One advantage of the Unity3D environment is that it also eliminates the need for the
use of holodecks. Rather than creating speciﬁc environments for each holodeck and needing to
transport (teleport) to a location in the simulation, a simple button click will completely
change the simulation itself via what Unity3D calls scenes Unity Manual.

Based to some degree on Open Sim technology, the Reaction Grid environment is a hybrid
of multiple open sources components that are compatible with the Unity game engine. Reac-
tion Grid shares many of the characteristics of the Second Life environment but has some sig-
niﬁcant and important differences that make it more adaptable to the Exploratorium we are
prototyping. First, the “sim” is different in that its size can be expanded at will, thus removing
the spatial limitation of Second Life. There is no spatial limit because the world is built, and
interacted with, in the same manner as video games. Second, the content inside Reaction Grid
is based on the Mesh data model rather than the prim model. While in the prim data model,
every object had to be composed of a series of “primitive objects”, each with limitations on
how they can be shaped and manipulated, in the Mesh data model all objects are composed of
a mesh of vertices, edges and faces which can be manipulated into an inﬁnite number of
shapes. This allows the content to be more realistic. Finally, because it is compatible with
standard programming languages, functionality developed outside the Reaction Grid environ-
ment can be imported and used within the gaming environment.

There is a fee associated with Reaction Grid to provide for hosting, but an educational
discount makes it a reasonably inexpensive solution compared to Second Life. A full simula-
tion based on the educational discount is $125 per quarter ($500 per year), including web-
based technical support. Unlike Second Life, the simulations inside Reaction Grid are
extensible. As the user requires more space they enlarge the simulation accordingly. It is impor-
tant to realize that such an expansion, while providing additional resources, places additional
load on the server and thus introduces increased lag.

We procured an account and began re-building the Exploratorium we developed in Second
Life, but with some notable changes. Unlike Second Life there is no longer a need for holodeck-
like rooms – the gaming technology is based on levels or scenes. To gain access to multiple
outside websites, as well as scenes, we introduced an in-game user interface based on a familiar
tool – the iPad. The iPad (tablet)-like in-game interface contains a set of buttons based on what
Unity calls colliders (Figure 6), designed to allow the avatar to collide or touch the object and in

doing so access a website. On the right hand side of this user interface (UI) one sees buttons
related to different knowledge area scenes, 3-Demo spaces for 3-D visualizations, an exhibition
space for poster sessions and displays, and a classrooms button for access to a complete complex
of meeting rooms and small classrooms for discussions and even class sessions (Figure 7). This
UI is the entry point into the Exploratorium environment for the users’ avatars.

To implement this immersive environment requires a direct linkage to the 2-D RESTful
toolkit already established. It also requires links to the individual BoK knowledge areas and a
user interface that mimics its now standard color scheme. Figure 8 illustrates the hierarchical
structure of the UI. The initial in-game UI is a ﬁrst level scene called the BoK UI, which
branches into the 2-D spaces (blogs, information, and RESTful interactive sites). These con-
nections and full interactivity with the RESTful interface have proven to be 100% successful.
As users select 3-D space buttons (colliders), they will be transported to the associated
scene. To provide uniformity of experience, knowledge areas begin with an environment iden-
tical to the ﬁrst scene, and with a tablet-like GUI based on the BoK color scheme (Figure 9).
Each knowledge area will have its own scene, the basic components of which are illustrated in
Figure 10. There will be functionality allowing avatars (users) to travel where they wish from
each knowledge area scene. There will be areas for displays, discussion, work, meeting and
consulting areas (columned space), and an amphitheater (bottom right) for multimedia presen-
tations and seminars. The areas will be left open and spacious to allow for large group interac-
tion. Each of these basic scenes has been developed and is operational.

A user must be able to access the environment easily for the experience to be worthwhile.
This is especially true of non-gamers who are unfamiliar with the use of avatars in a 3-D
gaming environment. We are currently developing a complementary 2-D user interface, but the
3-D interface is active and currently available through Reaction Grid via a URL. There is no
special viewer software needed to access this environment as was required of Second Life.

Instead, each user is asked to enter a name (optional) and select a basic avatar to access the
3-D world from their web browser (Figure 10). Once the user selects the start button, the
avatar is immediately transported to the initial environment from which their Exploratorium
experience begins.

6 Summary

The virtual Exploratorium was reasonably successful within the Second Life environment (cf
DeMers 2010). The simulation could be built, models of GIS&T concepts interacted with, and
content accessed via interactive artiﬁcial intelligence agents. However, the working group
encountered several major difﬁculties with the use of this commercial platform. Despite the
success of web scraping and Pandorabots integration into the Second Life virtual environment,
the aforementioned limitations suggested the need for a more ﬂexible environment in which to
work. We investigated several possibilities and ﬁnally decided upon the use of a hybrid envi-
ronment based on the Unity3D gaming engine, and combined with the virtual environment
Reaction Grid based on a complex but powerful interface called Jibe.

To allow in-game interaction with the major components of the project (e.g. RESTFul
components) we developed an in-game user interface that would be familiar to many – that of
an iPad (Figure 7). The UI allows users to transport to various environments within the overall
game system. The four primary locations are: Knowledge Areas (Figure 9), 3-D Demonstration
Spaces, Exposition Spaces, and Classrooms. The hierarchical scheme (Figure 8) was imple-
mented using the level-based scene development environment of Unity.

We currently have relatively blank but functional scenes developed as place markers for
each of the existing knowledge areas. Each contains a location for consultation (Figure 6), and
will eventually including chatbot guides. As before, the chatbot guides will use web scraping
technology developed for our Second Life approach, and Pandorabots for AI-based content
query. When fully implemented this area could be thought of as essentially an interactive
library.

Each Knowledge Area scene also contains open space for demonstrations or collabora-
tions (Figure 6). These spaces can demonstrate Knowledge Area-speciﬁc GIS concepts in 3-D
that will provide a common intellectual landscape for discussion and collaboration. An amphi-
theater within the scene includes a white board for in-game slide shows, lectures, and semi-
nars. There are also three areas (one in the center and two on each end) set aside for
participants’ avatars to collaborate with each other.

7 Future Considerations

The environments are now in place to develop and test several prototyped functional virtual
persistent environments for their: (1) utility to produce the necessary environment for collabo-
ration; (2) knowledge development and sharing; and (3) accuracy and reliability. Student vol-
unteers will explore the virtual BoK knowledge rooms to search for topics, obtain content,
share information, and verify the accuracy of the information they ﬁnd. Students will be sur-
veyed using a standard survey instrument, and the results will provide an important measure
of the success of this endeavor and the degree to which it can be used to establish a viable plat-
form for developing BoK2.

To date we have been unable to create an environment through which chatbot ﬁgures act
as true intelligent agents for learning. With a grant of RAIN{one} software from RivalTheory
(http://support.rivaltheory.com/documentation), we are investigating the use of behavior trees
to add actions to in-game robots and linking those actions to the chatbot functionality. This is
a novel approach, as these two technologies have not been previously linked in a 3-D learning
environment. We anticipate that the interoperability of Unity and Reaction Grid will allow us
to add true intelligent agents via RivalTheory and behavior trees.

Our most difﬁcult task has been generating on-demand 3-D concept demonstrations for
the BoK. There are several reasons for our inability to do this, but the primary ones are the
vast and growing number of possible concepts to be demonstrated, and the many ways in
which each concept demonstration could be performed. Our future plans include the comple-
tion of a robust ontology from which interactive, reward-based, 3-D, immersive MUVE games
could be developed. The concept envisions a point-based reward structure based on moving
through the 10 knowledge areas (levels) and competing with multiple players throughout the
world to develop demonstrations for different concepts. Our idea is that the game will provide
the incentive for multiple players to compete in developing the best possible simulations and
visualizations. The possibility of having literally thousands of participants develop many pos-

sible concept-based demonstrations might provide sufﬁcient and signiﬁcant concept demon-
stration within a considerably shorter period of time than otherwise possible by gatekeeper
domain experts alone.

The original BoK document provided an opportunity for linking course content and cur-
ricular sequencing to a catalog of subject matter, but was limited by its static format, lack of
index, and dated content. Development of a new, more interactive, and collaborative BoK
environment necessitated development of a multi-user virtual user environment to add social
presence to the experience. Learning from our successes and failures in implementing a BoK
Exploratorium in Second Life, we are moving forward in creating a more dynamic interactive
learning environment using Unity and Reaction Grid. Migrating to a more robust, program-
matic environment allows us to leverage the power of virtual crowd sourcing within a com-
petitive gaming environment to encourage creation of on-demand virtual 3-D visualizations of
GIS&T concepts in a digital Exploratorium. This process will breathe new life into the static
BoK, and create the framework for future 3-D development of the BoK2. Moreover, use of
gaming technology and crowdsourcing will allow the exploratorium learning environment to
persist for years to come because it can adapt to changing platforms and computing environ-
ments. It will also remain current because of its explicit linkages to the RESTful content crea-
tion environment and the BoK2 wiki when it is ﬁnalized. Finally, as we move forward to
develop the virtual crowdsourcing gaming environment, the exploratorium will be able to
create near-real-time 3-D demonstrations of the new content as it become available.

Constraint-based models and models constructing accessibility measures mainly
focus on single agents having only one available transport mode. However,
numerous cases exist where multiple agents or groups of individuals with
different available transport modes want to participate in a joint activity at a
certain location. The aim of
this paper is to provide new insights into
representing and reasoning about feasible space–time opportunities for multiple
agents. Relying on concepts of time geography, we propose a conceptual
framework in order to determine interaction spaces for groups of individuals.
Besides availability of means of transport and the locations of each individual,
minimum activity duration and opening hours of opportunities are taken into
account. The reasoning about space and time is visualized in three dimensions
using a hybrid (CAD/GIS) system.

Introduction

In daily life people are often confronted with various kinds of so-called rendezvous
scenarios. Due to growing time pressure and tightening individual activity schedules,
determining a joint meeting place and time for several participants is not always an
easy task. Individual action spaces are constrained by the fixed activities of the
participants and their access to mobility. Access to mobility is in turn dependent on
where individuals live and work as well as on their mobility resources (Berglund
2001). Since the individualized agendas of all participants need to be taken into
account, verifying the feasibility of a joint activity in space and time is an elaborate
process. However, despite its complexity, research focusing on joint activity
planning is vital to gain sound insights in how, where, and when groups of people
can interact with one another in order to make proper appointments.
trips was

studied by
Chandrasekharan and Goulias (1999). They argued that joint trip-making is
particularly influenced by household size, household lifecycle, age, number of
vehicles, and accessibility measures. In recent years, the study of joint activities has
received increased attention from the field of activity-based modelling and transport
geography, in particular with respect to within-households interactions (e.g. Ettema
and Van der Lippe 2006, Gliebe and Koppelman 2005, Roorda et al. 2006,

Srinivasan and Bhat 2005). In transport system analysis and travel behaviour
research, the problem of how individuals schedule their activities as a function of
available time, transport mode, etc. has been extensively studied. Agent-based
micro-simulation systems which simulate the dynamic behaviour of an individual
over both space and time have been applied with increasing frequency over the past
decade or so. Examples of such activity scheduling systems include DYNASMART
(Hu and Mahmassani 1995), DynaMIT (Bottom et al. 1999), ALBATROSS
(Arentze and Timmermans 2000), TRANSIMS (Nagel and Rickert 2001), ILUTE
(Miller et al. 2004), and AURORA (Joh et al. 2001). From a time–geographic
perspective sensu strictu, however, the treatment of multiple agents with several
means of transport is often neglected. Research that seeks to enhance space–time
accessibility measures for instance, mainly concentrates on individual motorists
(Kim and Kwan 2003). There have been few attempts to analyse travel interaction
spaces between agents who are at different places and times, but who want to carry
out a joint activity. The intersection of geospatial lifelines was studied by Hariharan
and Hornsby (2000). They defined a general method for testing the intersection of
two (right or oblique) beads. Miller (2005) identified necessary conditions for both
physical and virtual interaction by introducing new time–geographic objects such as
portals (ICT access locations) and message windows (communication events).

Using time geography as a point of departure, the purpose of this paper is to
model and visualize the interaction possibilities of multiple individuals. The
concepts proposed aim to support agents to select appropriate opportunities in
order to conduct a joint activity in space and time. Unlike other geocomputational
algorithms (see e.g. Kim and Kwan 2003, Kwan 2000a,b, Miller and Wu 2000,
Weber and Kwan 2002) which use a conventional GI system, the present paper
intends to explore the possibilities of a hybrid* (CAD/GIS) system such as Autodesk
MapH for representing and reasoning about spatio-temporal concepts. Applying
such systems enables a three-dimensional approach to analyse the interaction
possibilities between multiple agents. Useful thoughts are provided for the study of a
group-based accessibility measure which could offer a criterion to obtain appealing
insights in a group’s ability to participate in certain events. In this paper, travel
parties are not merely restricted to households but must be seen in a broader
context. The term ‘group’ thus refers to each set of individuals willing to conduct a
joint activity. In conformity with classical time geography, it is not our intention to
explain or predict preference and choice among facilities or transport modes.
Rather, we only want to set up a conceptual framework that deals with multiple
agents with multiple available transport modes. Also in tradition to classical time
geography, the travel environment of the agents is assumed to be a homogeneous
space in which travel speed remains constant. The method described herein focuses
on the identification of facilities with known location and opening hours at which
individuals could participate jointly and uninterruptedly for at least the full required
minimum duration of the activity meaning that they should synchronize the start
and end time of the activity. Furthermore, only the activity is subject to coupling
constraints; the transport modes are not. In other words, participants are assumed
to travel separately instead of meeting at some point and travel jointly from there.

* The term ‘hybrid’ usually refers to the integration of raster and vector GIS, but can also be applied to define a dual
(CAD/GIS) functionality of software. The latter is used here.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, after providing
background knowledge about time geography (2.1), we demarcate and categorize
the possible interaction space for a group of individuals by partitioning space–time
prisms (2.2). Then, in subsection 2.3, we present a technique to identify feasible
facilities for multiple agents. Subsequently, in section 3, an implementation of the
proposed concepts is developed and the use of hybrid systems is briefly discussed. In
the fourth section, we elaborate two random space–time scenarios as an illustration.
The paper concludes with an overview of the major findings and outlines some
avenues for further research.

2. A constraint-based approach to joint trip making

2.1 Time geography

In 1970, the Swedish geographer Torsten Ha¨ gerstand introduced the concept of time
geography as a useful conceptual framework for understanding human spatial
behaviour. Ever since, his seminal paper (Ha¨ gerstrand 1970) has inspired many
researchers in the domain of activity-based analysis and travel behaviour (Arentze
et al. 2001, Burns 1979, Kitamura et al. 1981, Lenntorp 1978). Time geography
essentially provides a foundation for recognizing paths through space and time
(Hendricks 2004, Wachowicz 1999) and measuring accessibility (Kim and Kwan
2003, Miller 1991, 1999, Weber and Kwan 2002, Wu and Miller 2001). As a
modelling framework,
time geography can be considered a constraint-based
approach not attempting to predict exact travel behaviour, but instead indicating
individual travel possibilities (Pred 1977). Both space and time are considered to be
scarce resources. To represent their mutual relationship, a space–time prism can be
constructed, delimiting all possible locations an individual can reach within a certain
time budget (available time for travel and activity participation). Three well-known
types of spatio-temporal constraints which restrict the shape of this prism can be
distinguished: (i) Capability constraints refer to physical limitations of an individual
such as eating or sleeping or the fact that an individual can only be at one location at
a particular point in time; (ii) coupling constraints restrict travel by the requirements
to meet other people in space and time. This means that space–time paths of co-
workers must temporarily be bundled to conduct a joint meeting; (iii) authority or
‘steering’ constraints relate to the institutional context, and refer to laws and other
regulations which imply that particular activities are only available or accessible at
certain times. Shop acts, for example, impose regulations on the opening hours of
stores and thus they dictate when shopping activities can be pursued.

To analyse rendezvous scenarios, space–time prisms yield a powerful tool. As time
progresses, an individual describes a space–time path from origin to destination,
which can be modelled as a geospatial lifeline thread (Hariharan and Hornsby 2000,
Hornsby and Egenhofer 2002). The faster the individual travels, the more sloped the
path segment will be. Given a certain maximum speed, a starting point and an end
point, a lifeline bead can be constructed, containing all points an individual could
have occupied within a certain time budget. The bead is formed by the intersection
of two inverted half cones: the lower half cone marks all space–time points where an
individual could have been if he/she leaves from the origin, while the upper half cone
delimits all possible space–time points an individual could have come from if he/she
is to arrive at the destination. Successive lifeline beads form a lifeline necklace
(Hornsby and Egenhofer 2002). The area that a specific individual can cover given

the set of constraints is called the potential path area (PPA) (Wu and Miller 2001); it
is the projection of the potential path space (PPS5the interior of the prism) to a two-
dimensional geographic plane (Miller et al. 2004). The basic notions of time
geography (space–time path, space–time prism, and PPA) are depicted in figure 1a.
The apexes of the cones are collocated in space but shifted in time. Figure 1b
represents an extension of the prism depicted in figure 1a, in the sense that an
activity with certain duration is now being pursued within the available time budget.
The cylindrical body between the cones represents the minimum required activity
duration. We now extend figure 1b by permitting multiple transport modes for a
single individual. Figure 1c shows the intersection of the space–time prisms of two
individuals willing to conduct an out-of-home activity; both individuals have the
same three means of transport available. Possible human interaction space* can be
found within the intersection of the beads of both individuals. Note that in figure 1c
we assume the minimum time budget an individual is willing to spend on the activity
depends on the travel time and thus on the transport mode. After all, people are
usually not willing to travel long distances just to undertake a very short (non-
obligatory) activity. Hence, a certain amount of activity participation time is needed
to make travel worthwhile (Kim and Kwan 2003). These travel time thresholds
reduce the size of the space–time prisms related to each vehicle.

2.2 Determination of interaction spaces

In order to determine (the nature of) possible interaction spaces of multiple agents,
their space–time prisms are partitioned in qualitative categories (Hendricks et al.
2003). To describe these partitions properly, some notations are introduced.

Suppose A denotes the finite travel party set, i.e. a group of n people willing to

conduct a joint space–time activity:

Let V be the finite set of k transport modes to travel to where the activity takes
place:

A~ a1, a2, . . . , ai, . . . , an

f

g

(cid:1)

V ~ v1, v2, . . . , vj, . . . , vk

(cid:2)

Each mean of transport is characterized by a maximum speed. Consequently, a set
of corresponding speed values S can be defined with every set of available transport
modes V ai for ai:

(cid:1)

S~ sv1 , sv2 , . . . , svj , . . . , svk

(cid:2)

The subset of V containing the available means of transport for individual ai is
denoted as V ai . Analogously, we define Sai as the set of speed values corresponding
to the transport modes in V ai .

Next, we need space–time anchor points of mandatory activities, i.e. start and end
points of activities which are relatively difficult to re-schedule such as home and
work (Miller 2005). These anchors limit physical accessibility by compelling start
and end points of discretionary activities (Miller 2005), and thus they can be utilized

* Two types of interaction exist: virtual and physical interaction. It should be noted that only physical interaction,
which requires coincidence in both space and time, will be addressed in this paper. This type of interaction
corresponds to synchronous presence, one of the four communication modes specified by Janelle (1995).

the possible interaction space of the travel party can now be created. Once
interaction spaces are distinguished, it is possible to solve a number of well-defined
spatio-temporal queries with respect to joint activities. For example, it is then
possible to unravel all feasible space–time facilities of, say, three persons that would
like to engage in a joint sports activity on a Saturday afternoon, given their
particular transportation options.

To solve these kinds of questions, we need to determine the intersection of
different space–time prisms constrained by oai
for all n agents.
Confining and representing space–time intersection volumes can be done using a
computer-aided design (CAD) system. For each individual ai, a lifeline bead is
created by uniting two half cones. This is done for each vj in V ai . Then, the
intersection space of all beads of the different agents is created. If the intersection is
empty, then interaction is impossible within a given time window. A cross-section of
the intersection of the two prisms depicted in figure 1c (see subsection 2.1) is shown
in figure 2. Note that various regions can be distinguished in terms of means of

transport by which they are accessible. The total interaction space is delineated by
the thick grey line.

In figure 3, a tree-like representation illustrates all possible kinds of interaction
spaces between two individuals. Although other authors
(e.g. Raper and
Livingstone 1995) have explored four-dimensional models, we opt for the traditional
three-dimensional depiction where time is represented as a dimension orthogonal to
a two-dimensional travel space. Let the individual’s three-dimensional space–time
container (denoted as STC3) be the space–time volume bounded by the limits of the
studied space and time. Figure 3 gives a schematic representation of the situation
considered in figure 2 (but without taking into account the minimum activity
duration constraint).* As in figure 2, for each individual three available means of
transport are assumed. The left-hand side of figure 3 depicts the travel possibilities
of a1; the right-hand side depicts the travel possibilities of a2; the centre of the
drawing visualizes the interaction space by taking the intersections between different
kinds of travel spaces. The notations M1, M2, and M3 define the potential path
spaces (PPS) that can be reached by an individual using sv1 , sv2 , and sv3 , respectively.
M1–M2 thus denotes the travel space that an individual can only reach by using
transport mode sv1 and M2–M3 denotes the travel space that cannot be reached
using transport mode sv3. The possible travel space M ai of individual ai can be
obtained by taking the union of travel spaces attainable by all available means of
transport of ai.

Note that M ai also equals travel space corresponding with the maximum speed

value, if all transport modes are available within the same time window.

The distinct categories of interaction volumes shown in figure 3 are only fully
applicable for two agents. However, if more than two agents are involved (n.2),
then a more general approach is desirable. Therefore, we denote the total interaction

The space–time volume that can be reached by all individuals, using transport

As will be shown in the next sections, the intersections and unions described in
equations (5)–(7) can be put in practice by using modify commands for three-
dimensional solids. The result will be a complex space–time prism.

2.3 Confronting interaction spaces with facilities

The next step in solving the envisaged joint activity problem is to identify all
facilities which lie within a particular interaction space. Although throughout the
literature the distinction between facilities and opportunities often remains unclear,
we consider only those facilities which are feasible as true spatio-temporal
opportunities. The set* of available facilities F is denoted as:

F ~ f1, f2 . . . , fr, . . . , fm

f

g

ð7Þ

Feasible facility selection can be done by constructing three-dimensional
cylindrical solids, which enables the use of Boolean operators to create intersections
between volume models in casu the interaction spaces and the facilities. Successive
opening hours determine the height of the cylinder. The centre of the base circle is
given by the coordinates of the geocoded address of the considered facility. By
choosing the radius of the base circle equal to the square root of 1/p, the volume of
each cylinder will represent the opening hours of a facility. To select those facilities
available for all agents, an intersection between the facilities and the total
interaction space I has to be realized.

the original space–time settings of

In figures 4a–d, the selection of feasible facilities is illustrated. For simplicity
reasons, we assume only two agents (a1 and a2) each having three possible travel
options to reach a set of seven (m57) potential facilities. Figure 4a is a frontal view
of
two individuals planning a meeting.
Figures* 4b, 4c, and 4d are three-dimensional representations of complex space–
time prisms, derived from Figure 4a by applying intersection-commands in CAD
software. They illustrate the interaction spaces delimited by sv1 , sv2 , and sv3 ,
respectively. Clearly, a decreasing travel speed svj results in a diminishing amount of
available facilities and a shortening of the opportunity in time.

In the case where more than two agents are considered, an identical approach as

described above has to be performed, but then repeated for all ai.

* The set F contains all possible activity locations and encompasses the feasible opportunity set (FOS) as defined by
Kwan and Hong (1998).
* For reasons of clarity, no attention has been given to the relative sizes of the interaction spaces.

Implementation of the proposed concepts

b , Sai

Using the Visual Basic programming environment of a CAD system, a
geocomputational method has been set up to determine the space–time opportu-
nities for a joint activity. First, several appropriate layers are automatically created
in order to classify similar time–geographic objects that will be shaped in the
following steps. Next, a subroutine is implemented which creates lifeline beads
directly from an external worksheet containing the triplets of constraints
(cid:6) of all participants ai within the time window of interest. The different
(cid:5)
oai
b , d ai
beads formed by two intersecting cones are drawn, rotated, and put at the exact
coordinates. These beads represent potential path spaces according to individual
activity schedules and possible means of transport. In the third step, a subroutine
has been programmed to visualize possible space–time facilities as cylindrical
objects. These facilities are constructed with respect to their location and openings
hours. Subsequently, the interaction space can be determined by selecting the
intersecting beads interactively on the screen. The interaction space and the facilities
are put in the predefined layers, resulting from step one. Finally, the intersection
between the facilities and the interaction space is determined and the maximum
possible activity duration at each opportunity is written to a worksheet.

The implementation comprises a valuable time–geographic visualization tool for
representing possible interaction spaces of multiple agents. In contrast to other
geocomputational algorithms which employ conventional GIS packages, we opted
to use a hybrid CAD system which offers significant advantages with respect to
visualization. Among other applications, the field of use of such a system consists of
(landscape) architecture, civil engineering, electronic design automation, manufac-
turing process planning, development of software applications, and cartography.
With respect to the latter, CAD is mainly used in the production of plans and
sketches for a variety of purposes (such as land registry and surveyor’s plans) and
for the handling of geospatial information. The term hybrid refers to the GIS
component which can be integrated in the system. It should be noted, though, that
the GIS tools embedded in this component are (currently) restricted to the base
functionalities of traditional GI systems. In the Autodesk MapH 3D 2006 software,
for example, some basic map algebra commands that allow for the buffering,

dissolving, and overlaying of topologies are present. The overlay functions include
intersect, union, identity, erase, clip, copy, and paste. Topology generation can be
done for nodes, links, and polygons. Regarding network analysis in Autodesk
MapH, tools are restricted to shortest path calculation and flood trace analysis.
Complicated and intensive computations
like generating service areas and
determining closest facilities, however, cannot be performed. Nevertheless, CAD
offers robust three-dimensional design tools which are unavailable in present-day
GIS packages, and fits, therefore, perfectly well for the simultaneous performance of
time–geographic analysis and visualization.

Besides geovisualization aspects, the presented approach also hands interesting
perspectives for the analysis of joint trip making. Several spatio-temporal queries
concerning multiple agents with different means of transport can be handled. On the
one hand, the method enables to compare accessibility between groups (i.e. inter-
group differences). For example, what influence does the incorporation of additional
intra-group
participants have on the group’s accessibility? On the other hand,
differences can be detected. For example, to what extent does an increased
availability of means of transport affect the group’s accessibility; what is the effect of
a smaller individual time budget on the size of the interaction space? Accessibility
can be measured by means of differences in the interaction space volumes, the
amount of opportunities, the total possible activity durations or combinations of
these factors with criteria measuring the attractiveness of the facilities.

4. An illustration

In the previous sections we introduced the conceptual framework and developed an
implementation of the concepts proposed. Now, we want to illustrate our model
using a real-life example. At first, we will briefly describe the spatio-temporal
settings of the considered day-to-day situation and point out the individual access to
mobility. Then, two random rendezvous scenarios are developed. Finally, we make
use of the GIS component of the hybrid system to create depictions of the
interaction spaces and areas.

Assume five teenagers want to conduct a particular joint activity (e.g. swimming,
shopping, going to the cinema) on a Wednesday afternoon, and they would like to
identify all feasible facilities they can reach given their individual activity schedules
and available means of transport. Apart from their fixed activities on Wednesday,
they must also bear in mind that their transport modes can be lacking or can be
restricted in time. The overall transport mode set V is given by three predominant
transport modes:

V ~ foot, bicycle, car

anchor points are georeferenced and can be derived by geocoding the addresses of
the participants. Note that the first agent’s earliest departure time for leaving home
is 2 p.m. At 4 p.m., however, he/she must arrive somewhere else for another fixed
activity. As a result the anchors of a1 are dislocated in space and shifted in time. The
situations of agents a2, a3, a4, and a5 are more or less similar but here, origin points
equal destination points, implying a home–facility–home chain. Due to independent
scheduling of different mandatory activities,

conducting the out-of-home activity varies among the individuals.

the available time budget

Next, a facility set F is simulated, containing different facilities situated within an
urban district. Table 2 gives an overview of the location and the opening hours of
the facilities. These data allow for the construction of the facility objects.

We will now take a closer look at two rendezvous scenarios with different

transport conditions. The agent’s transport modes are tabulated in table 3.

Making use of the implemented algorithm described in the previous section, we
determine those facilities within the group’s potential interaction space. As depicted
in figure 5a, only four facilities (fac2, fac4, fac6, and fac10) are eligible for
conducting the activity in scenario 1. The maximum possible activity duration at
these facilities amounts to 20, 42, 17, and 43 min, respectively. Figure 5b shows the
same process for the second scenario. In this case, only facility 4 (18 min) and facility
10 (52 min) are feasible. Due to different transport mode settings, the amount of
opportunities has been reduced in the second scenario. Nevertheless, the maximum
possible activity time has become larger at facility 10.

So far no typical GIS functionalities of the hybrid system have been applied. For
visualization purposes, however, we need to integrate the presented concepts with
representations of maps. Figure 5c (scenario 1) and 5d (scenario 2) depicts a
southeast isometric view of the interaction spaces with respect to the urban district.
Figure 6 shows the group’s potential interaction area (PIA), which can be defined
as the spatial footprint of the potential interaction space. The facilities and the
homes of the agents are also depicted. Clearly, the PIA resulting from the second
scenario is smaller which is due to the transport mode (foot) of a2 in scenario 2.

5. Conclusions and future research

this paper is to model

the feasible space–time interaction
The objective of
possibilities of multiple agents. The starting point is Ha¨ gerstrand’s theory on time
geography which provides an understanding of how a single agent’s space–time
prism is constructed. The simple case is then extended to multiple agents interacting

in space and time trying to have a joint activity. The conceptual model
implemented in a hybrid system and illustrated using a day-to-day example. It has
been shown that hybrid systems can be a valuable alternative for conventional GIS
packages. Since (hybrid) CAD systems offer powerful tools to calculate intersections
of complex three-dimensional objects, they are particularly useful for the study of
interaction spaces.

The current paper presents an innovative approach in that it uses new techniques
to delimit
interaction spaces and to identify feasible opportunities. Several
interesting related topics that are worth analysing come to the fore. First, an
analysis is needed to determine to what extent our approach can contribute to the
study of accessibility measures. The idea of developing a group-based accessibility
measure is an interesting avenue for further research and could offer appealing
insights in the easiness of meeting each other by revealing intra-group (based on
individual travel conditions) and inter-group differences. Second, the incorporation

and representation of vagueness within the scope of time geography is also
interesting. Here the application of rough set theory, as introduced by Pawlak
(1982), offers potential. The use of broad boundaries has been explored before by
Hendricks et al. (2003). It could be interesting to extend his approach for multiple
agents by introducing (rigorous definitions for) rough approximations of space–time
prisms in a CAD environment. Third, the issue of joint decision-making should be
addressed as well. Such a process differs quite a lot from an individual decision-
making process because it
involves making compromises, dealing with joint
constraints, and more complex behaviour. In this respect, rule-based expert and
decision support systems can be deemed helpful. Fourth, generalizing our scheme
with respect to recent and continuing advances in information and communications
technologies (ICTs) offers a challenge for future research (see Kwan and Weber
(2003) for a discussion of the impact of ICTs for accessibility research and
geographical analysis). Since CAD systems allow—as shown in this paper—the
detection of intersections in a dynamic three-dimensional environment, they are a
interaction of people in the

relevant because it

(a)synchronous interaction using the Janelle (1995) framework. Fifth, we are aware
that the illustrations, given in section 4, do not take into account the geometry of the
transport. However, this does not alter the fact that the key concept provided in the
paper remains clearly expounded. Quite the reverse, the use of classical three-
dimensional prism representations enables an easy explanation of the concepts.
Several researchers have done important work to incorporate the effects of the
transportation system into the analysis of space–time accessibility (among them
Kwan and Hong (1998) and Wu and Miller (2001)). Our ongoing research is
currently focusing on this issue and attempts to create a three-dimensional object in
a CAD environment that captures anisotropic movement and is based on existing
network algorithms and editing techniques for three-dimensional solids. Research
that seeks to improve the uncompromising conical representations using CAD could
yield new opportunities, certainly within the light of the narrowing gap between GIS
and CAD.

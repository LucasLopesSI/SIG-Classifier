pose a significant threat to both public health and national 

security. Growing networks of radiation sensors have been 

deployed by a number of offices within the U.S. and inter‐

national  agencies.  Detecting  such  threats  while  minimiz‐

ing  false  alarm  rates  presents  a  considerable  challenge  to 

homeland security and public health. This research aims to 

achieve a higher probability of detection with a lower prob‐

ability of false alarms. It focuses on the local spatial instabil‐

ity of radiation levels in order to detect radioactive materials 

based  on  robust  outlier  detection  methods.  Our  approach 

includes  a  three‐step  abnormality  detection  method  con‐

sisting  of  one‐dimensional  robust  outlier  detection  for  all 

gamma‐ray counts, a density‐based clustering analysis, and 

a two‐dimensional robust outlier detection method using a 

bagplot, based on spatial associations. The effectiveness of 

the method proposed is demonstrated through a case study, 

wherein  radioactive  materials  are  detected  in  urban  envi‐

ronments, and its performance is compared with alternative 
methods employing a k‐sigma approach, local Getis–Ord (G∗

statistic, and the goodness of fit of the Poisson distribution.

Radiation detection is a global concern for homeland security, counter‐terrorism, and emergency response agen‐

cies. Terrorist organizations desire to use nuclear devices as a tool for spectacular high‐impact attacks. Recent

research has investigated the effects of nuclear weapon detonations regarding the vulnerability of populations 

and urban health systems (Bell & Dallas, 2007). Although it is unlikely that sufficient weapons‐usable materials 

can be obtained for constructing weapons of mass destruction, the threat of radiological dispersal devices, such 

as dirty bombs, is genuine.

A dirty bomb utilizes conventional explosives with radioactive materials to broadcast non‐fissile but highly ra‐

dioactive particles over a densely populated area. A number of incidents of lost or stolen radioactive materials have 

been reported (Panofsky, 2003; Ristic, Morelande, & Gunatilaka, 2010). Terrorists are interested in using radiological 

dispersal devices because they can create public panic by subjecting a large number of victims to radiation effects, dis‐

rupt normal activities within an area, and incur costs for recovery and cleanup (Casson et al., 2006). Therefore, there 

is a need to identify illicit radioactive materials in urban environments. This article presents an efficient and accurate 

method for analyzing radiation sources using geo‐tagged mobile sensors. Methods for identifying the signatures of 

such sources are based on simultaneously considering the global and local radiation levels of urban environments.

The detection and estimation of radiation sources have been an active area of research. A single fixed sensor 

array, such as a portal monitor, is employed to screen individuals, vehicles, or cargo at borders (Jarman, Smith, 

Carlson, & Anderson, 2003). Distributed sensor networks have been deployed to detect and locate illegal radioac‐

tive materials with the ability to process data in real time within a network (Brennan, Mielke, Torney, & Maccabe, 

2004; Mielke et al., 2005). However, owing to the inherent spatial granularity of static radiation sensor networks, 

such systems suffer from the inverse square law of radiation (i.e., the source intensity is disproportional to dis‐
tance as 1/r2). It is impossible in practice to deploy numerous static sensor networks everywhere.

Furthermore,  a  source  would  have  to  be  reasonably  close  to  a  stationary  detector  to  have  any  significant 

probability of detection. With the introduction of GPS‐enabled devices, mobile radiation sensor networks have 

been regarded as an alternative for alleviating the limitations of static sensor networks coverage (Hochbaum & 

Fishbain, 2011). In this paradigm, a hybrid approach using static and mobile detectors is exploited to detect and 

track radiation threats (Chandy, Bunn, & Liu, 2010; Liu, Bunn, & Chandy, 2011). This study focuses on detecting 

low‐level radiation sources in urban environments using geo‐tagged mobile sensors.

However, the detection of nuclear threats is a challenging problem using such sensor networks, because the 

normal background fluctuates considerably in urban environments owing to naturally occurring radioactive mate‐

rials (NORMs), and the multitude of weather contributions, such as precipitation.

Therefore, this article provides a new method which obtains a higher probability of detection with a lower 

probability of false alarms. The method requires no prior knowledge of background radiation. It is based on three 

robust abnormality detection steps. It starts by identifying suspicious measurements on the global level by em‐

ploying  univariate  outlier  detection.  Based  on  the  identified  measurements,  it  applies  a  density‐based  cluster‐

ing method to detect spatial clusters of outliers. Finally, the method employs a robust two‐dimensional outlier 

detection method, based on spatial associations for each cluster. The performance of our method is evaluated 

using the F1‐score and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the results are compared with those of 

traditional radioactive source detection methods.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the characteristics of our approach in 

the context of related work. Section 3 presents the basis of our method for detecting radioactive sources. The 

experimental design and evaluation of the method proposed are presented in Section 4. The results and accuracy 

are discussed in Section 5. Section 6 concludes with a summary and suggestions for future work.

Background radiation is present everywhere and originates from the soil, cosmic rays, or building materials. It is 

essential to separate dangerous radioactive materials from reliable sources such as background radiation or legal 

medical shipments.

JEONG Et al.862  |    

A variety of methods have been presented to detect radioactive sources in highly fluctuating backgrounds. In 

general, sensor networks set up a baseline threshold, based on the mean and standard deviation of background 

radiation measurements (i.e., a “k‐sigma” approach). If the strength of measurement is greater than the threshold, 

then a sensor network triggers an alarm.

Furthermore, a recursive nonlinear least squares estimator is used to minimize the expected values of the dif‐

ference between the detector measurements and count rates predicted by the model (Howse, Ticknor, & Muske, 

2001). Bayesian methods (Brennan, Mielke, & Torney, 2005; Liu et al., 2011) and maximum likelihood estimates 

(Gunatilaka, Ristic, & Gailis, 2007) are also frequently exploited to detect sources. However, these approaches 

assume  that  the  background  radiation  is  known.  Further,  they  are  computationally  intensive,  which  is  unfeasi‐

ble when rapid detection is required. Bai, Heifetz, Raptis, Dasgupta, and Mudumbai (2015) present an efficient 

algorithm, based on maximum likelihood estimates. However, this method requires a number of sources as prior 

knowledge. The Wald statistics method is employed to identify radioactive sources within the shortest time with‐

out any prior knowledge (Sen et al., 2016). However, this assumes that radiation measurements follow a normal 

distribution. This approach is sensitive to outliers because radiation measurements in urban environments often 

fail to follow identifiable statistical distributions. In contrast, our approach not only requires no prior knowledge 

but also employs robust statistics, which are non‐sensitive to the distribution of radiation measurements.

In addition, Alamaniotis, Mattingly, and Tsoukalas (2013) consider gamma‐ray spectra rather than gamma‐ray 

counts to detect radioactive sources. However, it is difficult to measure nuclear spectra in short acquisition time 

intervals (i.e., of the order of 1 second) using human‐portable detectors, owing to noise and the limited efficiency 

of sensors (Bai et al., 2015). The method proposed in this article is based on total gamma‐ray counts, allowing the 

use of inexpensive counting detectors.

Furthermore, topological structure similarities (Jeong, Wang, & Sullivan, 2016) and geographically weighted 

approaches  (Jeong,  Sullivan,  Cheng,  &  Wang,  2016)  are  used  to  identify  regional  variations  in  radiation  levels. 

Similarly, this study utilizes spatial analytical approaches to understand changes in radiation levels.

The proposed method of detecting radioactive materials consists of three steps to detect radiation outliers, as 

3 |  M E TH O DS

described in this section.

3.1 | Univariate outlier detection

The first step toward a better detection performance for radiation sources is to detect outliers by considering 

total  gamma‐ray  counts.  The  traditional  method  (the  k‐sigma  algorithm)  compares  a  measurement  against  the 

average background radiation level (Fehlau, Pratt, Markin, & Scurry, 1983). However, the k‐sigma approach to de‐

tecting outliers is based on the sample mean and variance under a normal distribution. Unfortunately, heavy‐tailed 

distributions inflate the sample mean and standard deviation, which masks the presence of outliers. Therefore, a 

substantially improved approach is required to deal with non‐normality.

Robust statistical techniques (e.g., the interquartile range, Carling's modification or the median absolute de‐

viation (MAD)–median rule) have achieved a marked improvement over conventional techniques because robust 

methods are resistant to a wide range of distributions (Wilcox, 2003).

The standard boxplot for detecting outliers is based on the interquartile range. One criticism of the boxplot 

rule is that it is somewhat unstable for small sample sizes. Thus, Carling's modification proposed in Carling (2000) 

determines whether Xi is an outlier based on the inequality:

Xi > M + k(q2

− q1),

(1)

JEONG Et al.where M is the usual sample median, q1 is the lower quartile, q2 is the upper quartile, and

where n is the sample size.

The MAD–median rule for detecting outliers suggests declaring that Xi is an outlier based on the inequality

k =

17.63n − 23.64
7.74n − 3.71

,

|Xi

− M|

MAD∕0.6745

> K,

    |  863

(2)

where K is approximately 2.24 (Davies & Gather, 1993).

Selecting an outlier detection method is a non‐trivial problem, because there is no single dominant method 

(Wilcox, 2017). One method of choosing an outlier detection method is to consider the breakdown point—the pro‐

portion of contamination that an outlier detection method can handle before generating an arbitrarily incorrect 

value (Donoho & Huber, 1983). The breakdown points of the MAD–median rule and interquartile range approach 

are 0.5 and 0.25, respectively (Rousseeuw & Croux, 1993). Although the breakdown point of the MAD–median 

rule is better than that of the interquartile range method, the higher breakdown point is likely to increase the false 

positive rate—the swamping effect (Davies & Gather, 1993).

Thus, this study adopts the MAD–median rule when data sets have statistically significant skewness or kur‐

tosis (see Grosjean & Ibanez, 2014). Skewness is related to the lack of symmetry and kurtosis is related to having 

heavy or light tails relative to the normal distribution. Significant skewness and kurtosis confirm that data sets are 

not normal. In contrast, our method also employs the interquartile range method (i.e., Carling's modification) when 

data sets have non‐significant skewness or kurtosis.

For clarity, Figure 1 illustrates one of the experimental data sets around the University of Illinois at Urbana‐

Champaign  (UIUC)  campus.  Figure  2  presents  the  distribution  of  the  measurements  in  Figure  1,  as  well  as  the 

thresholds for each outlier detection method. The skewness and kurtosis of the measurements in Figure 1 are 

both statistically significant. Significant skewness and kurtosis appear to indicate that the distribution of measure‐

ments is not normal. Thus, the MAD–median rule threshold was employed to detect suspicious measurements 

(outliers) for the next steps.

3.2 | Density‐based clustering analysis

This subsection explains how to determine the measurements that are closer to radiation sources by detecting 

spatial clusters of outliers detected from the previous step. As described in Section 3.1, one‐dimensional solutions 

(univariate outlier detection) may have a higher chance of increasing false positive rates. Thus, we examine where 

high gamma‐ray measurements are spatially clustered. A cluster of high gamma‐ray measurements may be linked 

to radioactive materials. However, a high gamma‐ray measurement outside a cluster is more likely to be a false 

alarm. Therefore, we utilize clustering analysis to identify patterns within data sets.

Clustering analysis has been comprehensively studied. There are a number of established methods for clus‐

tering algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering (Johnson, 1967), k‐means clustering (Hartigan & Wong, 1979), 

model‐based clustering (Fraley & Raftery, 2002), graph‐based clustering (Zhong & Duckham, 2016), and density‐

based clustering (Ester, Kriegel, Sander, & Xu, 1996).

Density‐based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) has been widely employed for spatial 

data because it can detect arbitrarily shaped clusters. This method requires two parameters: the maximum radius 

of the neighbors (eps) and the minimum number of points (MinPts) within the radius of the neighbors. Based on 

these two parameters, it is possible to define the reachability among observations. For example, a point p1 is di‐
rectly density‐reachable from a point q if p1 is within the eps, and MinPts is greater than a user‐defined threshold. 
Then if there exist a chain of such points, p1,p2,…,pn, we can say that pn is density‐reachable from the point q.

the k‐sigma threshold, the dashed line indicates Carling's modification threshold, and the solid line indicates the

This study set eps to 30 m, in consideration of the general horizontal error of mobile phone GPS (Zandbergen, 

2009),  and  set  MinPts  to  2.  We  tried  several  parameters  by  varying  values  (e.g.,  eps  =  10,30,50,100  and 

MinPts = 2,4,8,12). The most important factor is MinPts. The higher the velocity of sensors, the lower the chance 

JEONG Et al.    |  865

of detection for higher radiation counts. In other words, if a sensor operator passes radioactive materials at high 

speed (velocity), then the mobile sensor is more likely to miss the detection of radioactive materials due to the 

efficiency of sensors. Thus, we set MinPts to 2 in order to avoid missing radioactive materials. Further, the pa‐

rameterization process is required once at the beginning of radiation monitoring. It is not necessary to repeat the 

parameterization process every time.

Figure 3 illustrates the high gamma‐ray measurements, shown among the complete set of measurements in 

Figure 1 (i.e., gamma‐ray count higher than 56.26 cps based on the MAD–median rule threshold). The measure‐

ments within the normal range of gamma‐ray counts are not shown in Figure 3. There are seven clusters and one 

instance of noise (shown by the red point on the lower left‐hand side). The next subsection describes how radio‐

active materials are detected in each cluster.

3.3 | Multivariate outlier detection

This subsection describes how to detect the presence of a source from clusters identified using DBSCAN. This 

study  uses  the  multivariate  outlier  detection  method—a  bivariate  boxplot  (bagplot;  Rousseeuw,  Ruts,  &  Tukey, 

1999)—to robustly detect radioactive materials through the spatial dependency of identified clusters.

Spatial autocorrelation statistics measure the spatial dependency for spatially referenced data. Moran's I co‐

efficient is commonly employed for the level of spatial autocorrelation (Moran, 1948). In particular, the Moran 

scatterplot is used as an exploratory data analysis tool to indicate spatial associations (Anselin, 1995). The Moran 

scatterplot represents not only global spatial autocorrelations, but also local similarities or dissimilarities. It is a 

that indicates the degrees of linear relationships between observed values y and spatial lagged values Wy. The 

slope of the least squares regression reflects the I coefficient.

However, Moran's I has limitations under non‐normal distributions (Griffith, 2010; Zhang & Lin, 2016). The 

Moran  scatterplot  may  provide  a  misleading  reflection  of  observations  for  non‐normally  distributed  data.  For 

F I G U R E   3  High gamma‐ray measurements from Figure 1, colored according to the cluster label

JEONG Et al.866  |    

example, outliers can significantly distort the power of the least squares regression. Heteroskedasticity can also 

give rise to standard errors in the least squares regression, even under normality (Wilcox, 2003).

Therefore, this study utilizes the concept of data depth, which measures the centrality of a point in the data 

(Mosler, 2013). In particular, a bagplot is used to detect radioactive materials (i.e., outliers). A bagplot has three 

components (Rousseeuw et al., 1999): a depth median (i.e., Tukey median) indicating the point of maximal depth; 

a bag surrounding the median, which is a depth contour surrounding half of the observations; and a fence, which 

is a bag magnified by a factor of 3.

Figure 4 presents the bagplot from one of the clusters (cluster 7) in Figure 3. The x‐axis indicates gamma‐ray 

counts per second for each measurement, and the y‐axis represents the lagged gamma‐ray counts per second: this 

is a plot of the value of the gamma‐ray count for each measurement i against the mean of the gamma‐ray count 

for the neighbors of i. Thus, the lagged mean gives a spatially weighted value. A standardized weight matrix W 

was employed for the experiment. The depth median is indicated by a red star. The area colored blue indicates the 

bag, and the area colored light blue indicates the fence. The two points outside the fence are outliers (red dots). 

This cluster includes measurements from radioactive sources. That is, these two observations were made around 

radioactive materials.

However, it is necessary to check the number of observations within each cluster. The outlier detection prob‐

lem in two dimensions emerges as a result of a small number of observations. The variability of the fence is so large 

that  outliers  cannot  be  reliably  detected  (Rousseeuw  et  al.,  1999)—for  example,  the  threshold  for  the  smallest 

number of observations was 15 in Rousseeuw et al. (1999). Thus, if there are fewer than 15 observations within 

each cluster, we increase the number of observations by including observations within 10 m of the observation 

with the maximal gamma‐ray count within a cluster. The rationale behind choosing 10 m is that people generally 

walk at about 1.4 m/s. Thus, based on our sensor operators’ trajectories, more than 15 measurements were re‐

corded within each 10 m distance, because mobile sensors recorded the gamma‐ray counts per second.

For example, the initial detected number of observations in cluster 7 in Figure 3 is 2. Figure 5a and b increase 

the number of observations to 8 and 50. respectively. Figure 4 increases the number of observations by 15. As 

can be seen, Figure 5a cannot detect the outliers due to the small number observations. However, Figures 4 and 

5b can identify the outliers.

I don’t understand the sequence here. And the relative sizes of the figures are strange too.

F I G U R E   5  Effects of the number of observations in the bagplot

In addition, in certain special cases, some observations may have very low gamma‐ray counts compared to 

other measurements. These observations may be outside the fence. Thus, this study considers not only the loca‐

tion of each measurement in the bagplot but also the gamma‐ray counts. The gamma‐ray counts of observations 

outside the fence should be higher than the thresholds at the global level (see Section 3.1) and the local level. The 

threshold at the local level (all measurements from each cluster) is determined by the process detailed in Section 

3.1. If observations satisfy these three conditions (i.e., the location of each measurement in the bagplot and the 

gamma‐ray counts at the global and local level), then they are regarded as outliers.

For example, Figure 6 presents the bagplot of cluster 3 in Figure 3. One measurement is classified as an outlier 

although its gamma‐ray count is low (see the point on the left‐hand side in Figure 6). In fact, measurements in this 

cluster  were  taken  around  a  nuclear  research  laboratory  building.  The  overall  gamma‐ray  counts  are  relatively 

high, resulting in the identification of an outlier despite its low value. Thus, we can remove this outlier by consider‐

ing the global and local levels of gamma‐ray counts in addition to the structure of the bagplot. Finally, it is possible 

to present alarms from all measurements on a map as in Figure 7.

4.1 | Data

A small network of six Kromek D3S detectors was placed around the UIUC campus. These detectors can identify 

37 isotopes, which is 17 more than the ANSI N42.34 standard. The detailed specifications are provided in Kromek 

(2014). The detectors were worn by sensor operators, and collected gamma‐ray counts and GPS coordinates once 

per second. The strength of radiation from a source is not only isotropic, but also disproportional to the distance 

from the source. Kromek D3S detectors are omnidirectional. Thus, sensor operators can detect a source based on 

the efficiency of the sensors (i.e., the detection variations compared to the distance from the source). Therefore, 

we assume that sensor operators pass the source within a detectable distance from the source (e.g., 10 m for cae‐

sium‐137 Bare/mCi Kromek (2014)) and there are no obstacles between sensors and sources.

Regarding the GPS coordinates, we employed the GPS of mobile phones of which maximum and median hori‐

zontal errors are generally 12.6 and 7.7 m (Zandbergen, 2009). Using a dual‐frequency GPS, it is possible to resolve 

the  identification–location  ambiguity.  However,  our  purpose  is  to  achieve  low‐cost,  highly  efficient  and  more 

capable radiation detection capabilities, which is a similar approach to the SIGMA program of the US Defense 

Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA,  2014;  Kromek,  2014).  Over  10,000  low‐cost  detectors  with  the 

same  types  of  equipment  in  our  experiment  have  been  deployed  by  the  New  Jersey  Port  Authority  and  field‐

tested in Washington, DC. In this research, we take advantage of a large number of small, inefficient yet mobile 

devices. Thus we utilize a large quantity of cheaper sensor technology to provide much more spatiotemporal detail 

about the monitoring area.

Kromek D3S detectors send gamma‐ray counts to a paired mobile phone via Bluetooth. A dedicated Andriod 

app merges the gamma‐ray counts and GPS coordinates. The data collected by these sensors were delivered to 

the Amazon Cloud in near‐real time. The stored data were imported to the ROGER supercomputer in the CyberGIS 

Center at UIUC. The analysis of the data was conducted on ROGER. Figure 8 illustrates the system architecture 

employed in this research. Real‐time and streaming processing are are outside the scope of this article, and con‐

stitute valid future directions of this work.

F I G U R E   8  System architecture

To test the performance of the method in detecting the presence of radioactive materials, small sources of 
NORMs , such as 232/238Th, 40K, 238U, and 226Ra, were utilized. We placed these on pedestrian pathways. The circle 

in Figure 9 indicates the location of sources. Furthermore, it is important to consider the background radiation

measurements. Red dots indicate simulated measurements (black rectangle area). The black circle indicates the

when collecting gamma‐ray counts. The paths taken by our sensor operators were designed to include a wide 

range of land features that may influence the background radiation, such as granite buildings.

We conducted nine field experiment runs over two days. The location of the source was the same during all 

experiment runs. Six sensor operators walked along the same path. However, one sensor operator intentionally 

stayed increasingly longer in front of the church indicated by a triangle in Figure 9. The material of the church is 

granite, which is a NORM, thereby differentiating the distribution of gamma‐ray counts between all experimental 

runs. Figure 10 presents the different distributions of gamma‐ray counts for Tests 1–5 by varying the sensing time 

in front of the church.

In addition to the nine field experiments, we simulated some parts of the data (see the rectangular area in 

Figure 9) to increase the source intensity (i.e., 100, 150, 200, and 1,000 cps). Using high gamma‐ray radioactive 

materials in a field experiment is impossible. Therefore, we replaced the previous measurements within the rect‐

angular area with new values based on the inverse square law of radiation (i.e., the source intensity falls off as 
1/r2).

The simulated data were merged into the four previous measurements from the field experiments. Based on 

the source intensity, each simulated data point was merged with the four different measurements. There were 16 

simulated data sets (four sets of simulated data × four different measurements). Therefore, there were a total of 

25 data sets (nine field experiments and 16 simulated experiments (i.e., laboratory experiments)).

4.2 | Procedure

The performance of the proposed method was compared with the state‐of‐the‐art k‐sigma method (Fehlau et al., 
1983) and local Getis–Ord (G∗
i ) statistic (Getis & Ord, 1992). In addition to the traditional k‐sigma method, local 
spatial  autocorrelation  analytics  are  employed  to  detect  the  presence  of  radioactive  materials.  The G∗
i   statistic 
(Getis & Ord, 1992) and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) (Anselin, 1995) have been widely employed 
to detect spatial anomalies in multi‐disciplinary fields. In particular, the G∗
i  statistic often provides a good predic‐
tor of hotspot identification. This study utilized the G∗
i  statistic for source detection. In our experiment, clusters 
of  high  gamma‐ray  counts  are  easily  detected  using  the G∗
i   statistic,  because  background  radiation  is  spatially 
correlated (e.g., building materials). Such clusters can be regarded as outliers in the experiment. Thus, we applied 

three approaches to detect the presence of radioactive materials based on the 25 data sets. None of the methods

discussed require knowledge of the background radiation level. That is, they can be applied to any areas, without 

existing measurements.

Furthermore, this research employed the Poisson distribution to detect the presence of radioactive materials. 

This approach cannot be applied in all cases, because it requires the previous background measurements. Thus, 

we collected more than 37 million background measurements (approximately 30 GB of data) over four months 

around the UIUC campus without any radioactive sources. These measurements were only used for the Poisson 

distribution test. Using these measurements, we created a raster map using inverse distance weighted (IDW) in‐

terpolation. This interpolation map was employed as the mean for the Poisson distribution in order to predict the 

probability of detecting radioactive materials according to a known local baseline background measure.

Therefore, the performance of the proposed method was juxtaposed with three alternatives (i.e., the G∗

i  statis‐

tic, k‐sigma method, and Poisson distribution) for benchmarking.

The  proposed  method  was  evaluated  with  respect  to  two  primary  features:  the  F1‐score  and  ROC  curve.  We 

marked  some  observations  around  radioactive  materials  as  the  ground  truth  for  each  test  set  to  evaluate  the

methods’ performances.

4.3.1 | F1‐score

The F1‐score was adopted as a performance measure for classification tasks. The F1‐score is the harmonic mean 

of the precision (positive predictive value) and recall (sensitivity) (Buckland & Gey, 1994).

Figure 11 presents the F1‐scores of each method. These are grouped into field and simulation experiments. 

The details of the field experiments are shown in Figure 12 for each test. The results for the F1‐scores for the

proposed method (i.e., robust outlier) in the field experiment are slightly better than those in the simulated exper‐

iment. The reason for this is that the recall was not good at high source intensities in the simulated experiment.

Furthermore, Figure 13 illustrates the details for the F1‐score, which is bounded by the precision and recall. 

Although the proposed method (i.e., robust outlier) detected all the sources for all tests, the recall is lower: a per‐

fect recall value is 1.0. The reason for this imperfect recall is that the proposed method can detect the presence 

of radioactive materials, but it cannot flag all high gamma‐ray measurements around the radioactive materials as 

being radioactive.

As  demonstrated  in  Figures  11–13,  the  proposed  method  outperformed  the  other  methods.  The  visual  im‐

pressions were confirmed using robust ANOVA (Wilcox, 2017), because variances are not equal across methods.

The bootstrap of the trimmed mean revealed statistically significant differences between all methods in the 

field  (Ft  =  12.31,  p  <  0.05)  and  the  simulation  experiments  (Ft  =  21.50,  p  <  0.05).  The  robust  heteroscedastic 
measure of the effect size (ξ) yielded a large value (1.17 for the field experiments and 0.68 for the simulation ex‐

periments). For the field experiments, the robust post‐hoc tests revealed that there were statistically significant 

differences (p < 0.05) between the robust outlier detection method and all other methods. Similarly, there were 

statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the robust outlier detection method and the other methods 

for the simulation experiments, except for the k‐sigma method.

4.3.2 | ROC curves

While the F1‐score is a single‐threshold measure, the ROC considers multiple possible thresholds. Figure 14 illus‐

trates the performances of the ROC curves for all approaches based on the field experiments. The robust outlier 
and Poisson distribution methods performed better than the others. The G∗

i  statistic performed the worst.

F I G U R E   1 5  ROC curves for simulation experiments with AUC values

Furthermore, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated as another performance measure (Bradley, 

1997). In particular, the AUCs were compared based on the permutation test to compare the similarities of the 

ROC curves (Robin et al., 2011; Venkatraman, 2000). There is no statistically significant difference between the 

robust outlier and Poisson distribution methods (p = 0.166). However, there are statistically significant differences 

between the robust outlier method and the other methods (p < 0.05).

Concerning the simulation experiments, Figure 15 shows the performance of the ROC curves based on the 

source intensity. Broadly, the Poisson distribution method performed the best. There were statistically significant 

differences in the AUC between the Poisson distribution method and the other methods, with the exception of 

the 100 cps source intensity (i.e., there was no statistically significant difference between the Poisson distribution 

and  the  robust  outlier  methods).  However,  the  Poisson  distribution  method  requires  background  information, 

which is not always available. The background radiation may also be incorrect or biased because of NORMs or 
weather. Furthermore, the G∗

i  statistic performed adequately as the source intensity increased.

Our  results  demonstrate  that  the  proposed  method  (robust  outlier  detection)  outperforms  the G∗
i   statistic,  k‐
sigma, and Poisson distribution methods in terms of F1‐score. Although the proposed method detected the pres‐

ence of radioactive materials in all tests, its recall was not perfect, because it could not detect the presence of

radioactive materials in all measurements around radioactive materials (true positive). The Poisson distribution 

method also detected the presence of radioactive materials in all tests. However, its F1‐score was poor, owing to 

its low precision, indicating that the Poisson distribution method generated a high false positive rate (Type I error). 
Furthermore, the G∗
source strengths of radioactive materials were low.

i  statistic and k‐sigma method failed to detect the presence of radioactive materials when the 

The ROC curves indicate that the Poisson distribution method performed the best. Although the robust outlier 

detection method matched the performance of the Poisson distribution for low‐level radioactive materials, the 
latter performed better as the strength of the radioactive material increased. Interestingly, the G∗
i  statistic and 
k‐sigma  method  performed  effectively  at  the  high  levels  of  radioactivity.  However,  they  performed  poorly  for 

low‐level radioactive materials. This means that both methods are sensitive to outliers (relatively high gamma‐ray 

counts).

In addition, the performance of the Poisson distribution method was better than that of the proposed method 

in terms of ROC curves. However, the proposed method outperformed the Poisson distribution method in terms 

of F1‐score. The reason for this is the imbalanced data sets: the number of negatives in the confusion matrix is 

substantially  higher  than  the  number  of  positives.  Although  the  Poisson  distribution  method  generated  a  high 

number of false positives (low precision), its false positive rate is relatively good, owing to the high number of true 

negatives in the confusion matrix. Thus, this discrepancy should lead to a more cautious interpretation of the ROC 

curves on unbalanced data sets.
With regard to the G∗

i  statistic, it is worth noting that the spatial sampling design is important for the spatial 
autocorrelation analysis (Brus & De Gruijter, 1997). The observations in our experiment are based on sensor oper‐
ators’ paths. The linear observations may have an impact on the analysis results for the G∗

i  statistic.

6 |  CO N C LU S I O N S

This study investigated methods of detecting the presence of radioactive materials without previous background 

measurements, especially when the source intensity is low. The proposed three‐step outlier detection approach 

includes univariate outlier detection, a density‐based clustering analysis, and multivariate outlier detection based 

on  spatial  associations.  This  article  has  demonstrated  that  our  proposed  method  can  achieve  a  superior  per‐
formance compared to the state‐of‐the‐art local Getis–Ord (G∗
i ) statistic and k‐sigma method. Furthermore, our 
approach can achieve a better (F1‐score), and similar performance (ROC curves) compared to the Poisson distribu‐

tion method that requires previous background measurements.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that our approach can be applied to detect the presence of radio‐

active materials where there are no previous radiation measurements, and can handle high background radiation 

fluctuations such as in urban environments. Thus, our approach can help to obtain a higher probability of detec‐

tion with a lower probability of false alarm.

Ultimately, further investigations should focus on cases involving multiple and moving radiation sources. The 

proposed method can be applied to detect moving radiation sources using time windows. It would also be inter‐

esting to apply our approach to the sensing and monitoring of environments, for better and more reliable anomaly 

detection.

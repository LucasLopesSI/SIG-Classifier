Abstract
Forested  areas  in  the  United  States  have  been  altered  since  the  time  of  European
settlement. There is increasing interest in comparing present day vegetation with that
of the Pre-Euroamerican era to understand what changes have occurred in some of
our more outstanding natural areas. Studies have been conducted using Government
Land Office (GLO) notes to understand historic vegetation surveys, but past studies
focused on species present/absent lists. The GLO surveys included information about
tree  species,  tree  diameter  and  other  physical  features.  This  study  used  indicator
kriging to interpolate the probability of tree species on the landscape using the GLO
data  from  62  townships.  Once  continuous  probability  models  were  developed,
vegetation spatial patterns were analyzed throughout the sub-basin. This technique
provided  insight  into  what  the  vegetation  pattern  (spatially)  was  like  prior  to
Euroamerican  settlement  within  the  Buffalo  River  sub-basin.  It  provided  the  base
information necessary to quantify vegetation change and the spatial extent of that
change.  Based  on  this  research  it  appears  that  post-Euroamerican  fire  suppression
and agricultural practices with other human activities have been major contributors

1 Introduction

In 1972 Congress established the Buffalo River as the first National Scenic River in the
United  States.  It  is  one  of  the  few  remaining  free-flowing  rivers  in  the  lower  48  states

beginning  in  the  Boston  Mountains  of  Arkansas,  and  emptying  into  the  White  River
near  Buffalo  City,  Arkansas.  The  watershed  currently  consists  of  open  farmlands,
forests,  cleared  land  that  is  returning  to  native  vegetation,  abandoned  home  sites  and
small urban areas.

European settlement in the Ozarks began in the late 1820s and is evident by place
names and by many abandoned settlements. Native Americans have lived in the area for
over  10,000  years  (Delcourt  and  Delcourt  1991).  It  is  believed  that  the  present  tree
species occupying the watershed were established approximately 5,000–6,000 years ago
after  stabilization  of  climate  following  the  last  ice  age  (Delcourt  and  Delcourt  1991).
Fire suppression, which began in the early 1900s is believed to have altered tree species
composition  by  favoring  less  fire  tolerant  species  (Schroeder  1981,  Guyette  and
McGinnes 1982). Agricultural practices and other human activity since settlement have
also significantly impacted tree species composition (Abrams 1998, USDA 1999).

The Buffalo River sub-basin represents one of the few remaining pristine waterways
in this country. As a result it is an area of great concern. By incorporating Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) spatial modeling with Pre-Euroamerican and present vegetation
conditions it will be possible to provide a precise method of what changes have occurred
in relation to spatial location. Without knowing the Pre-Euroamerican condition of an
area it is impossible to fully understand the ecology of the area and develop management
plans that would address resource concerns. Historical perspectives increase our under-
standing  of  the  landscape  and  provide  a  frame  of  reference  for  assessing  the  current
landscape.  For  this  reason  we  implemented  a  study  which  analyzes  Pre-Euroamerican
Landscape within the Buffalo River sub-basin. The objectives of the study were to create
continuous probability models for each major Pre-Euroamerican species group found in
the Buffalo River sub-basin using Government Land Office (GLO) Surveys and to analyze
to what extent predicted species distribution has changed over time.

1.1 Previous Work Using Government Land Office Surveys

Numerous  studies  in  other  locations  of  the  United  States  have  used  GLO  notes  to
analyze and compare present day vegetation with pre-settlement vegetation. An incomplete
listing of studies includes those conducted in Ohio (Whitney 1982), Texas (Schafale and
Harcombe  1982),  Iowa  (Anderson  1996),  Pennsylvania  (Abrams  and  Ruffner  1995),
Wisconsin (Dorney and Dorney 1989, Manies and Mladenoff 2000, Sickley et al. 2000),
Illinois  (Fralish  et  al.  1990,  Leitner  and  Jackson  1980),  Michigan  (Palik  and  Pregitzer
1992,  Zhang  et  al.  2000),  Louisiana  (Delcourt  1976),  New  York  (Loeb  1987),  New
Jersey (Russel 1981, Loeb 1987), Vermont (Siccama 1971) and West Virginia (Abrams
and  McCay  1996).  The  majority  of  these  studies  used  the  GLO  notes  to  develop  tree
lists to determine pre-settlement tree species composition and did not take into account
the spatial distribution of trees species.

In Michigan, Palik and Pregitzer (1992) found great differences between pre-settlement
and  present  day  vegetation  among  two  different  landscapes.  These  included  areas  that

were  fairly  similar,  but  disturbance  frequency  was  thought  to  be  quite  different  based

Another  study  conducted  in  Michigan  (Zhang  et  al.  2000)  investigated  vegetation
change  in  the  Upper  Peninsula  of  Michigan.  The  authors  found  there  was  very  little
difference  between  the  composition  of  the  pre-settlement  forests  and  those  of  the
present. Although the species mix was not found to be significantly different, differences
in  stand  density  were  found.  In  addition,  there  was  more  fragmentation  of  remaining
forestlands and more open lands due to human settlement (Zhang et al. 2000).

Little  research  has  been  conducted  in  Arkansas  using  the  GLO  surveys.  Foti  and
Glenn  (1991)  used  the  GLO  notes  in  the  Ouachitas  and Tucker  (1990)  used  the  GLO
notes  in  the  Ozarks  to  analyze  pre-settlement  vegetation  and  compare  it  to  present
conditions. However, no research has been conducted specifically for the Buffalo River
and none of these studies have taken into account spatial attributes of trees in a systematic
way.

1.2 Accuracy of Government Land Office Surveys

Accuracy and detail of the GLO notes varied depending on the surveyor. Occasionally,
there were cases of fraud where surveyors would supposedly survey areas in the time it
would normally take a person to walk that distance (sometimes even faster). One example
of this problem was reported by Lucious Lyon, who was the Surveyor General for Ohio,
Indiana, and Michigan. Lyon is quoted as saying the returns for many townships were
“grossly fraudulent – the greater portion of the field notes there being wholly fictitious
or descriptive of lines and corners that were never established.” Lyon stated that at least
150 townships in Lower Michigan would need to be redone due to fraud (Stewart 1935).

More  common  problems,  however,  were  caused  by  inadequate  documentation,
equipment malfunction, ineptness, and carelessness, where resurveys showed that corner
and line trees were not where they were described in the notes. There are many examples
of negligent work in the field notes. In Michigan for example, quarter corners on east-
west  lines  were  required  to  be  run  at  random  from  a  section  corner  to  the  corner
1.6 km east (1 mi) and then run back for correction. There are many instances reported
where  surveyors  merely  set  the  new  corner  directly  without  going  back  and  offsetting
the random line appropriately based on the error (Bourdo 1956).

There  are  other  factors  that  affect  the  accuracy  of  the  GLO  notes,  especially  for
ecological interpretation. One is that selection of bearing and witness trees was subjective.
In  Michigan,  for  example,  Bourdo  (1956)  reported  that  surveyors  chose  healthy  trees
generally,  from  25  to  40 cm  in  diameter,  as  it  was  believed  these  trees  provide  more
permanent marks than smaller or larger trees. There is also some suspicion that certain
types of trees may have been favored by some surveyors. This was the case in northern
Louisiana where it was found that the average distance from section corners to pine tree
species was greater than the average distance from tree to section corner for hardwood
tree species (Delcourt 1976).

Finally, there were great differences in how surveyors recorded what they observed.
Some  surveyors  provided  much  more  detail  than  did  others  (Hutchinson  1988,
Tucker  1990).  Despite  these  problems,  the  GLO  notes  provide  us  with  one  of  the  most
systematic on-ground surveys, and in most cases the only inventory of vegetation prior
to Euroamerican settlement.

2 Material and Methods

2.1 Study Area

The  study  area  consists  of  the  entire  Buffalo  River  sub-basin,  which  includes  347,073
ha. The Buffalo River is 189.8 km long and begins in the Boston Mountains of Arkansas
and  empties  into  the  White  River  near  Buffalo  City,  Arkansas  (Figure  1).  Of  the  total
area,  38,447  ha  are  owned  by  the  National  Park  Service  under  the  National  Scenic
Rivers Act of 1972. The sub-basin is located in north-central Arkansas and encompasses
most  of  Newton  and  Searcy  counties  as  well  as  portions  of  Marion,  Boone,  Madison,
Pope,  Van  Buren,  Stone  and  Baxter  counties.  The  study  area  consists  of  62  survey
townships,  which  are  approximately  9.67  by  9.67 km  (6  by  6  mi).  The  townships
selected that overlapped any area within the Buffalo River sub-basin.

2.2 Developing the Government Land Office Survey Point Layer

Surveys  of  Arkansas  were  originally  conducted  between  1815  and  1850,  shortly  after
Arkansas was acquired from France by means of the Louisiana Purchase. Surveys in the
Buffalo  sub-basin  were  conducted  between  1830  and  1847  by  18  different  surveyors.
These  surveys  include  descriptions  of  topographic  features  and  vegetation  cover.  The
GLO  notes  give  bearing  and  distances  to  witness  trees  from  every  section  corner  and
line trees along with common species names and diameter estimates of the witness trees.
A script was written in ArcView to enter the GLO plat map and field notes into a
GIS layer referenced to a Cartesian coordinate system. An example of GLO field notes
is  shown  in  Figure  2.  The  script  used  a  quarter  section  GIS  data  layer  created  by  the
authors.  The  fields  that  are  associated  with  the  tree  data  included  Diameter,  UTM  X

and Y coordinates, Species, Quadrant, Azimuth Angle, Distance, Surveyor, Survey Date,
Township,  Slope,  Elevation,  and  Aspect.  The  GLO  GIS  database  for  the  sub-basin
included more than 25,000 trees (points).

In  order  to  test  for  surveyor  bias  it  was  necessary  to  determine  if  the  average
distance  to  each  surveyed  tree  species  group  was  statistically  similar  or  different  from
the  average  distance  of  other  species  groups.  In  order  to  accomplish  this,  only  trees
demarcating section corners were used. Trees along section lines were excluded as they
had a fairly predictable intentional spacing of approximately 400 m. Surveyor bias was
analyzed using an Analysis of Variance with Completely Randomized Design and multiple
comparison tests. All tests were analyzed at an alpha level of 0.05. Multiple comparison
tests were performed, including the Bon Ferroni Approach, Fisher’s LSD, Tukey’s HSD,
Student-Newman-Keuls and Duncans Multiple Range Test.

2.3 Developing the Present Vegetation Point Layer

To determine the present vegetation types in the Buffalo River sub-basin, Forest Inventory
and  Analysis  (FIA)  data  from  1999  was  used.  The  USDA  Forest  Service  FIA  program
(initially  known  as  the  Forest  Survey)  was  conceived  over  eight  decades  ago  by  the
Congress of the United States. The Forestry Research Act of 1928 directed the Secretary
of  Agriculture  to  keep  and  maintain  a  comprehensive  inventory  and  analysis  of  the
nation’s forestry resources (Smith 2002). Data from 1999 were used because they were
available  at  the  time  of  this  study  and  included  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)
positions  for  the  plots  in  which  tree  locations  could  be  calculated  in  a  GIS.  This  data
layer had more than 1,800 trees.

2.4 Interpolating GIS Point Layers

Both the GLO and FIA data are point GIS layers, requiring the use of spatial interpolation
to decide which tree species potentially occupied an area. Kriging was used to develop
30 m raster surfaces from the point layers. Kriging is dependent on spatial autocorrelation
hence  the  closer  things  are  to  one  another  the  more  “related”  they  are  to  each  other,
this often makes biological sense for vegetation, and it accounts for distance, direction,
and redundancy of neighboring points.

Prior to kriging, the data were separated into the most prevalent taxonomic groups
in  both  the  FIA  and  GLO  data  layers.  Only  the  most  abundant  groups  were  used  and
included,  white  oak,  red  oak,  walnut/hickory,  sweetgum,  pine,  maple,  dogwood,  Eastern
redcedar, and ash (Figure 3). Other species groups were not included for kriging due to the
small number of trees recorded. A shade tolerant group was created by grouping blackgum,
dogwood, and maple groups for some analyses. A shade intolerant group was also created
by combining ash and sweetgum. This was done for both the GLO and FIA data.

TM

Indicator  kriging  was  implemented  with  the  ArcGIS

  Geostatistical  Analyst
because it had the best validation results with the least error for this dataset and did not
assume that the data follow a particular distribution. Indicator kriging has been used in
prior  tree  species  composition  studies  using  FIA  data  (Riemann  et  al.  1997,  Hershey
1998). Indicator kriging uses binary logic (presence/absence) and the probability of a value
(for example tree species) exceeding a certain threshold, otherwise, it is very similar to
ordinary  kriging,  including  using  the  same  fundamental  equations.  Data  maps  created
with  indicator  kriging  range  from  zero  to  one,  which  indicates  the  probability that the
threshold has or has not been exceeded (Cressie 1991, Burrough and McDonnell 1998).

Before  implementing  kriging,  it  is  necessary  to  develop  a  semivariogram  for  the
data. The first step, in semivariogram plotting, is to create an experimental variogram,
which  is  then  followed  by  fitting  a  model  variogram.  An  experimental  variogram  is  a
simple plot of variance versus distance:

range (a) where points are spatially correlated. Lag is defined as the actual distance from
)  where  the  semivariogram  levels  off  is  known
the  points  to  the  origin.  The  distance  (
as the sill. Beyond the sill the points are uncorrelated. The nugget represents the variance
or error which is found in the semivariogram model. The second step is to fit a model
semivariogram based on the experimental semivariogram. There are several semivariogram
models  which  can  be  used  to  represent  a  particular  dataset.  The  most  commonly  used
models include the spherical, exponential, linear and Gaussian.

(Burrough and McDonnell 1998). Cross validation uses all of the data to find autocorrelation
by removing one point at a time and predicting the associated data value for that point
using  the  points  around  it  (Isaaks  and  Srivastava  1989,  Cressie  1991,  Stein  1999).
Validation  removes  10%  of  the  data  to  create  a  validation  dataset  (Rossi  et  al.  1993).
The GLO and FIA datasets were then analyzed and the predicted values were compared
with  the  known  values  of  the  validation  dataset.  From  this  information  (in  both  the
cross  validation  and  validation)  the  mean  prediction  error  for  each  species  group  was
determined.

Success  of  cross-validation  and  validation  are  determined  through  analysis  of
prediction  error  statistics.  These  error  statistics  include  Mean  Prediction  Error  (MPE),
Root Mean Square Predicted Error (RMSPE), Average Standardized Error (ASE), Mean
Standardized  Error  (MSE)  and  Root  Mean  Square  Standardized  Error  (RMSSE)
(Johnston et al. 2001). MPE assumes the model:

(Burrough  and  McDonnell  1998).  Mean  prediction  error  for  cross-validation  and
validation  is  the  mean  error  for  the  entire  model  based  on  the  previous  equation.  The
closer  the  mean  prediction  error  is  to  zero,  the  more  accurate  the  model  (Cressie
1991,  Isaaks  and  Srivastava  1989).  This  is  true  both  in  the  cross-validation  and
validation.

RMSPE assumes the model:

It  is  similar  to  MPE  with  the  exception  that  by  squaring  it  eliminates  negative
values  and  thus  accounts  for  large  error  fluctuations  which  could  potentially
counterbalance  each  other  if  there  are  large  negative  and  positive  errors.  ASE  is
represented by:

and represents the standard deviation of error (Johnston et al. 2001). It is important that
the values for ASE and RMSPE for the probability model are similar (Isaaks and Srivastava
1989).  In  other  words,  the  standardized  true  value  minus  predicted  value  and  the
standardized true value minus mean value should be similar.

MSE adjusts for scale of the data by dividing the prediction errors by their prediction

standard errors and is represented by the model:

where Z(xi) − z(xi) is the prediction error and s(xi) is the prediction standard error (Johnston et al.
2001).  MSE  should  be  close  to  zero  since  they  are  dependent  essentially  on  MSE  and
ASE. Root mean square standardized error analyzes whether the model is overestimat-
ing or underestimating variability and is represented by:

RMSSE

where Z(xi) − z(xi) is the prediction error and s(xi) is the prediction standard error (Johnston
et  al.  2001).  The  root  mean  square  standardized  errors  should  be  as  close  to  one  as
possible. If the root mean square standardized is greater than one, you are underestimating
the variability and if the number is below one then you are overestimating the variability
(Isaaks and Srivastava 1989).

3 Results

3.1 Government Land Office Surveyor Biases

Bourdo (1956) identified possible biases against really small and really large trees as well
as bias against certain tree species. According to Bourdo (1956) and Delcourt (1976), if
the distribution of trees is random, then the mean distance to all dominant tree species
should  be  similar.  If  a  species  has  a  significantly  larger  distance  on  average  then  there
may be a favoring of that particular species.

After  running  an  Analysis  of  Variance  with  Completely  Randomized  Design  as
suggested  by  Delcourt  (1976)  for  distance  bias,  the  only  species  group  with  a  signifi-
cantly  smaller  average  distance  was  walnut/hickory.  All  other  groups  were  statistically
similar  to  each  other.  This  may  suggest  either  a  bias  for  selecting  walnut/hickory  as  a
witness tree, or it may indicate a greater density for this particular group.

3.2 Species Group Interpolation

Each  major  species  group  was  modeled  using  indicator  kriging  to  produce  probability
estimates that a certain species was in a certain location. Overall the percentage of area
for oaks has decreased dramatically. Area of white oak with a probability greater than
or  equal  to  50%  (threshold)  decreased  from  95,557  to  25,916  ha  in  1999,  which  is  a
72.9% decrease (Table 1). This is reflected in the other probability groups displayed in
Table 1 as well. The red oak group area decreased from 44,098.7 ha (probability greater
than or equal to 50%) to 17,322.7 ha in 1999 which is a 60.7% decrease. The area for
the  Pine  group  decreased  slightly  when  the  probability  was  greater  than  or  equal  to
50%, from 4,572 ha down to 3,767 ha in 1999 (17.6% decrease).

Walnut/hickory  increased  in  area  from  pre-settlement  times  with  an  area  of
390  ha  (probability  greater  than  or  equal  to  50%)  prior  to  settlement  and  an  area  of
6,822  ha  in  1999  (1,651.5%  increase).  Finally,  cedar  (and  to  a  lesser  extent  maple)
increased  in  area.  Cedar  and  maple  both  had  no  area  prior  to  settlement  (detected  by
the  kriging  model)  with  a  probability  greater  than  or  equal  to  50%.  However,  in
1999 cedar had 6,373 ha greater than or equal to 50%, while maple had increased to
237 ha.

In addition to analyzing species group specific probabilities, it is also useful to create
models that take information from each species dataset and outputs the maximum species
value for each 30 m grid cell within the sub-basin. In this way it is possible to create a species
prediction map for both time periods and then compare the changes. Figure 4 shows the
maximum species prediction map for the Pre-Euroamerican landscape created from the
GLO data. Areas of no change comprised the single largest group at 95,864.3 ha (27.6% of
total sub-basin area) while 65,665.9 ha (18.9% of total sub-basin area) went from forested
to non-forested (Table 2). The two most common groups of trees (white oak to red oak
and red oak to white oak) had fairly large changes in area. Oak species had a cumulative
loss of 17.4% to areas of no forest at the present and lost 14.5% of the sub-basin area to
walnut/hickory. Additionally 6.1% of the sub-basin area appears to have converted to cedar.

3.3 Kriging Accuracy Assessment

The Mean Predication Error for cross-validation ranged from −0.07 to 0.003 for GLO
species groups with Cedar being closest to zero at −0.0002 and from −0.51 to 0.18 for
the FIA interpolation with Dogwood being closest to zero. The Mean Predication Error
for  validation  ranged  from  −0.52  to  0.71  for  GLO  species  groups  and  from  −1.64  to
2.42 for the FIA interpolation. Despite some sample variation inherent in the data due
to differences in sampling frequency all modeled values are fairly close to zero. Generally,
the GLO data has smaller statistical prediction errors, which are likely due to more evenly
distributed  and  frequently  occurring  sample  points.  The  difference  between  GLO  and
FIA data might be caused by differences in sample size and due to fluctuations in scale
inherent in the FIA. The FIA plots have trees within one meter of each other at one scale
and  trees  separated  by  thousands  of  meters  at  another  scale.  Nevertheless,  average
standardized  and  root  mean  square  errors  were  fairly  similar.  Generally,  these  models
produced slight underestimations of variability, except in the case of cedar and sweetgum
in the FIA data and sweetgum again in the GLO.

4 Discussion

The probability maps produced by indicator kriging had a Mean Predication Error for
cross-validation near zero for all species groups and support observations made of the
raw  data  themselves.  Although  oak  species  have  maintained  their  dominance  as  the

most common species, there have been dramatic drops since the early 1800s. The white
oak group area had a 72.9% change and the Red Oak group had a 60.7% change since
Pre-Euroamerican era for the Buffalo River sub-basin (Table 1). Some of this change is
based  on  replacement  of  the  oaks  to  other  species,  but  7%  of  the  Red  Oak  areas  and
10.4%  of  the  White  Oak  areas  were  converted  to  non-forest  (Table  2).  The  Buffalo
River  sub-basin  has  lost  18.9%  of  its  forest  areas  since  Euroamerican  settlement.  The
increases  in  Cedar  since  Euroamerican  settlement  were  mostly  at  the  expense  of  Red
Oak and White Oak, with 3.5% and 2.6% of the area lost in the sub-basin respectively.
The area of Walnut/Hickory area also increased 14.5% at the expense of the Oaks.

Factors contributing to this situation are thought to be fire suppression, outbreaks
of the red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus), and various agricultural practices that favor
other tree species (Abrams 1998). Recent declines in the red oak group can be at least

partially attributed to the red oak borer (Heitzman 2003). In 1999 the US Forest Service
estimated that severe damage (greater than 75% mortality) existed on 7,800 ha of the
Ozark National Forest with an additional 9,800 ha experiencing moderate losses (50–
75% mortality) (Smith and Stephen 2001). One of the main contributors to the success
of the red oak borer was years of drought in the late 1990s which weakened populations
(Smith  and  Stephen  2001).  It  is  also  possible  that  cultivation  and  harvesting  in  the
Ozarks led to the decline of larger diameter oaks. Tucker (1990) stated that oaks were
preferred for use as railroad ties and that many oaks were harvested for this purpose in
the late 1800s.

Another dramatic change displayed in the Buffalo River sub-basin is the increase in
Eastern  redcedar.  Prior  to  Euroamerican  settlement,  cedar  accounted  for  less  than  1%
of the trees in the sub-basin whereas Cedar accounted for more than 7% of the trees in
1999. Part of this increase may have been due to surveyor bias against smaller diameter
trees.  However,  it  is  difficult  to  prove  or  disprove  bias  against  cedar.  The  number  of
cedars used as GLO corner trees was so small that using average distance to determine
bias against cedar was not viable. The increase in cedar could be that the thin bark of
redcedar offers little protection against fires. Dey et al. (2002) stated that fire frequency
declined in the Ozarks ending circa 1990. This provided favorable growing conditions
for redcedar establishment due to fire exclusion. Eastern redcedar is also an aggressive
pioneer species that invades old fields, which were common in the 1930s in the Ozarks.
Redcedar  also  grows  well  in  soils  with  high  limestone  rock  content,  which  is  common
in the Buffalo River sub-basin (Fergusion et al. 1968).

Based on these observations it seems likely that many areas that were once predom-
inantly one species have now become more intermixed with less dominance of any one
particular  species.  This  should  not  be  surprising  considering  the  fire  history,  which  in
the past would have prevented increases in such species as hickory, cedar and maple that
have been observed in the Buffalo sub-basin over the last couple of centuries (Strausberg
and Hough 1997, Abrams 1998).

Additionally,  a  substantial  portion  of  the  sub-basin  is  now  in  pasture  and  is  used
for agricultural purposes (Scott and Udouj 1999). This factor combined with increased
competition from other tree species due to fire suppression could be the key contributors
to loss of oak species in the sub-basin.

5 Conclusions

Information on biodiversity of landscapes is available for many areas since the twentieth
century, but prior to this time period little is known over large areas. The GLO survey
notes  provide  us  with  the  only  systematic  on-ground  survey  from  1815  to  1850  in
Arkansas and predate most formal botanical investigations. Using indicator kriging, we
can  use  known  values  at  sample  locations  to  estimate  the  probability  of  tree  species
groups  for  unsurveyed  areas.  By  exploring  characteristics  such  as  spatial  patterns  and
variation  we  can  gain  insight  into  the  Pre-Euroamerican  landscape.  The  methodology
developed  in  this  research  provides  us  with  the  first  probabilistic  map  of  the  Pre-
Euroamerican landscape for the Buffalo River sub-basin. This research gives us insight
into  the  changes  that  have  occurred  in  the  last  150+  years,  which  is  important  for
understanding  the  ecology  of  the  present  landscape  and  provides  a  frame  of  reference
for assessing modern patterns and processes.

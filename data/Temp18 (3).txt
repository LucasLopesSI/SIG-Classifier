The understanding of the effects of error on Mobile Terrestrial LiDAR (MTL) point clouds has not
increased with their popularity. In this study, comprehensive error analyses based on error propagation
theory and global sensitivity study were carried out to quantitatively describe the effects of various error
sources  in  a  MTL  system  on  the  point  cloud.  Two  scenarios  were  envisioned;  the  first  using  the
uncertainties for measurement and calibration variables that are normally expected for MTL systems as
they exist today, and the second using an ideal situation where measurement and calibration values have
been well adjusted. It was found that the highest proportion of error in the point cloud can be attributed
to the boresight and lever arm parameters for MTL systems calibrated using non-rigours methods. In
particular, under a loosely controlled error condition, the LiDAR to INS Z lever arm and the LiDAR to
INS roll angle contributed more error in the output point cloud than any other parameter, including the
INS position. Under tightly controlled error conditions, the INS position became the dominant source of
error in the point cloud. In addition, conditional variance analysis has shown that the majority of the
error in a point cloud can be attributed to the individual variables. Errors caused by the interactions
between the diverse variables are minimal and can be regarded as insignificant.

La compréhension des effets des erreurs sur les nuages de points du LiDAR terrestre mobile (MTL)
n’a pas augmenté avec sa popularité. Dans le présent article, nous avons effectué des analyses globales
des erreurs fondées sur la théorie de propagation des erreurs et une étude globale de la sensibilité dans
le but de décrire quantitativement les effets, sur le nuage de points, de diverses sources d’erreurs dans
un  système  MTL.  Nous  avons  envisagé  deux  scénarios,  le  premier  utilisant  les  incertitudes  dans  les
variables  de  mesure  et  de  calibration  qui  sont  normalement  attendues  pour  les  systèmes  MTL  qui
existent actuellement et le second utilisant une situation idéale où les valeurs de mesure et de calibration
ont été bien ajustées. Il a été établi que la proportion la plus élevée d’erreurs dans le nuage de points
peut être attribuée aux paramètres de visée et de levier pour les systèmes MTL calibrés en utilisant des
méthodes non rigoureuses. Plus particulièrement, dans une condition d’erreurs mal contrôlées, le levier
entre le LiDAR et l’axe Z du INS (système de navigation par inertie) et l’angle de roulis entre le LiDAR
et  l’INS  ont  contribué  à  des  erreurs  plus  grandes  dans  le  nuage  de  points  résultant  que  tout  autre
paramètre,  y  compris  la  position  du  INS.  Dans  des  conditions  d’erreurs  fortement  contrôlées,  la
position du INS est devenue la principale source d’erreurs dans le nuage de points. De plus, l’analyse
de la variance conditionnelle a démontré que la majorité des erreurs dans un nuage de points peut être
attribuée aux variables individuelles. Les erreurs causées par les interactions entre les diverses variables
sont minimes et peuvent être considérées comme négligeables.

Introduction

Achieving high accuracy surveys using Mobile
Terrestrial  LiDAR  (MTL)  systems  is  a  challenge
faced by many surveyors. Many factors contribute to
the outcome of the final product, from base station
locations and local GPS conditions to MTL system
calibration  and  LiDAR  measurement  capabilities.

In fact, the accuracy of an MTL survey can greatly
depend  on  factors  as  variable  as  the  weather.
Controlling  as  many  of  these  factors  as  possible
would  seem  to  be  called  for;  however,  too  much
attention and care in collecting the data can become
costly in both time and money. A surveyor therefore

needs  to  know  what  factors  to  spend  time  and
effort controlling and by how much they should be
controlled. A balance between controlling the error
sources  and  producing  results,  as  always,  must  be
struck. 

An MTL system usually consists of a LiDAR
sensor  integrated  with  an  Inertial  Navigation
System (INS). The parameters used to convert raw
MTL data into a georeferenced point cloud include
both fixed parameters and measurements. The fixed
parameters  include  the  LiDAR  calibration,  the
boresight and lever arms between the LiDAR and
the INS. The measurements made by the MTL sys-
tem include the position and orientation determined
by the INS and the angles and ranges measured by
the LiDAR. Some measurements are external to the
MTL system, such as those made at the GPS base
station,  while  others  are  confined  to  the  moving
platform on which the MTL system operates. This
paper  will  focus  on  the  error  sources  contained
within  the  MTL  system,  specifically  the  measure-
ment sources used to produce a point cloud and the
errors that occur because of the integration of these
measurements.

The calibration and measurement sources used
in  MTL  are  similar  to  those  used  by  Mobile
Airborne  LiDAR  (MAL).  Similar  to  MTL,  MAL
collects  INS  positions  and  orientations  and  com-
bines  them  with  raw  angles  and  ranges  measured
by  the  LiDAR.  MAL  also  requires  boresight  and
lever parameters between the LiDAR and INS to be
determined.  Unlike  MAL,  MTL  is  far  more
immersed in the target scene. This means that, gen-
erally, MTL systems have a larger range of possible
boresight parameters between systems, the field of
view of the LiDAR is much larger, and the ranges
are generally much shorter.

Measurements for the position and orientation
of the MTL system are generated by the INS for any
time  t  along  the  vehicle’s  path.  The  INS  usually
provides  estimates  of  the  errors  for  these  position
and orientation measurements. These error estimates
are calculated in real time by the INS and are usual-
ly  given  in  the  form  of  root  mean  square  (RMS)
errors or one sigma standard deviations ( ), depend-
ing  on  the  INS  system  in  question.  On  the  other
hand,  the  measurements  made  by  the  LiDAR  pro-
vide  information  on  the  location  of  any  point  p  in
range  of  the  system.  It  is  usual  for  the  LiDAR  to
have fixed error quantities determined by the manu-
facturer or the surveyor in a controlled environment.
These  error  estimates  are  almost  always  given  as
one sigma standard deviations. Many of these tech-
niques have been well documented in static LiDAR
systems [Reshetyuk 2009]. 

The errors associated with the integration of the
LiDAR  with  the  INS  are  usually  the  least  under-
stood  and  generally  the  hardest  to  quantify. While
multiple methods have been proposed for LiDAR to
IMU  boresighting,  few  offer  a  reliable  or  rigorous
approach  for  determining  error.  The  documented
methods  for  determining  sensor  to  INS  calibration
parameters include manual visual methods [Optech
Inc.  2008],  software  assisted  visual  methods
[Hypack  Inc.  2007;  Reson  B.V. 2011;  Virtual
Geomatics Inc. 2010; Jeeninga 2012; Dix et al.
2011] and algorithm based methods [Rieger et al.
2010; Picard et al. 2012; Chan et al. 2013]. Only
the  algorithm-based  methods  really  give  a  means
for  determining  error  estimates  for  the  LiDAR  to
INS calibration parameters.

Some work has already been done to analyze
the errors inherent in MTL systems. Sources, such
as  Alshawa  et  al. [2007],  Glennie  [2007a],
Glennie [2009], Glennie [2007b], discuss current
works  on  the  development  of  an  error  model  for
MTL  systems  that  incorporate  modified  static
terrestrial  LiDAR  systems  in  their  design.  In
addition,  overall  performance  data  with  respect
to a control field can be found in Leslar [2009]. 
Despite  the  work  that  has  already  been
published,  the  error  sources  for  MTL  remain
under-analyzed. A  comprehensive  study  of  error
sources involved with MTL systems is needed to
understand  and  identify  which  factors  can  be
better  controlled  for  the  purpose  of  producing
high accuracy MTL point clouds. This paper pres-
ents the results of a comprehensive error analysis
conducted on data collected with the Lynx Mobile
Mapper [Optech Inc. 2008]. The Lynx system lends

itself  to  this  type  of  testing  since  the  calibration
numbers are provided by the manufacturer in ASCII
text file format. Unlike some other systems, where
the  calibration  is  stored  in  proprietary  binary
formats, the Lynx calibration values are open to
the end user.

The Mathematical Models

The LiDAR Equation

Mobile LiDAR systems consist of two distinct
components, the INS and the laser ranging system,
as  shown  by  a  typical  system  configuration  in
Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, the coordinates of
point  p  in  the  Earth  Centered  and  Earth  Fixed
(ECEF) coordinate system 
are a function of
the laser range vector, the relative location and ori-
entation  of  the  LiDAR  sensor  to  the  INS  system
and  the  position  and  orientation  of  the  INS.  The
base equation of this relationship can be expressed
by Equation 1.

LiDAR instrument.

Each  of  the  18  aforementioned  variables
have  an  associated  error  estimate,  usually  in  the
form of an RMS or standard deviation. It is usual
to  assume  that  each  of  the  measurements  is
normally  distributed  and  that  the  RMS  values
reported  by  the  INS  can  be  considered  equal  to
one  sigma  standard  deviations  (σ).  These  18
standard  deviations  can  be  assigned  to  the  same
groups previously discussed. 

Error Propagation Analysis

The error propagation analysis is a standard
technique  used  to  estimate  errors  in  calculated
values  propagated  from  the  errors  of  the  meas-
ured parameters based on a known relationship.
The  equations  for  linear  error  propagation  are
fairly  well  understood  and  used  across  many
disciplines  [Glennie 2007b;  Goulden 2009;
Tellinghuisen  2001].  Performing  linear  error
propagation first requires the non-linear equation
presented  in  Equation  1  to  be  linearized  as
shown in Equation 4.

Conditional Variance Analysis

Conditional  variance  analysis  is  a  method  of
global  sensitivity  analysis.  Global  sensitivity
analysis  is  primarily  used  to  study  how  the  uncer-
tainty in the output of a model can be apportioned to
different sources of uncertainty in the model inputs
[Saltelli et al. 2008]. First order sensitivity indices
are a quantitative measure of the importance of the
input variables on the calculated results. They apply
to additive models. The more sensitive the calculat-
ed  results  are  to  small  variances  in  any  particular
input variable, the greater the first order sensitivity
index. The total effect indices are also a quantitative
measure of the importance of the input variables on
the  calculated  results.  Unlike  first  order  indices,
however, they are applicable to all types of models
their  model  characteristics
independent  of 
[Schwieger 2004]. 

Performing  conditional  variance  analysis
involves rewriting the terms of Equation 1 in terms
of  generic  variables;  Equation  1  can  be  expressed
as shown in Equation 8.

Implementation and Testing

The  error  propagation  described  above  was
implemented in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and the
conditional  variance  analysis  was  implemented  in
Matlab R14. For testing purposes, MTL data were
collected  using  the  Lynx  Mobile  Mapper.  These
data were collected in a mostly empty parking lot
to  allow  the  LiDAR  to  reach  its  maximum  range.
The data used is shown in Figure 2.

The northern section of the data contains a tree
line  that  is  located  approximately  50  m  from  the

random samples according to a specific probability
density function for each of the variables [Glen and
Isaacs 2012;  Bowyer  and  Danson 2004].  Starting
with  the  estimated  values  and  their  estimated
standard deviations that we have for the 18 variables,
these  random  samples  can  be  generated  based  on
the normal distribution.

ECEF

Holding variable (Xi) fixed at the mean value
of its randomly generated samples, while allowing
the  other  variables  to  vary,  N  random  values  can
be generated from Equation 8. The variance of the
(
(
V P
outputs of Equation 8
can be cal-
culated. If we then average this variance over all
possible values of Xi we get the expectation of the

Computing all the higher order terms becomes
inefficient due to the large number of combinations
for  models  with  a  large  number  of  variables.  For
example, the 18 variables in Equation 1 will gen-
erate  48,620  9th  order  Sobol  indices  alone.  It  is
therefore desirable to calculate the total effect for a

LiDAR  sensor;  the  southern  section  of  the  data
contains an open parking lot with some hedges and
a  lamp  post. A  building  and  two  cars  exist  in  the
parking  lot  at  long  range  for  the  LiDAR  sensor.
They are not seen in Figure 2 as they are at extreme
long  range  for  the  LIDAR  system,  but  random
shots were collected off of them.

To  analyze  the  effect  of  errors  in  the  18
parameters  on  the  output  point  cloud,  it  is  first
necessary  to  collect  the  error  estimates  for  each
parameter.  The  error  estimates  concerning  the
position and orientation of the Lynx system in the
ECEF  mapping  frame  are  generated  in  real  time
by  the  INS.  In  the  case  of  the  Lynx  system,  the
INS used is an Applanix POS. 

Out of the five variables related to the position
of the INS, it was found that the latitude and longi-
tude contribute less than a millimetre of error to the
final  solution.  For  the  purposes  of  testing,  they
were therefore excluded from further consideration
since  their  contribution  to  the  overall  error  is
insignificant.  The  LiDAR  errors  are  published  by
Optech, the manufacturer of the Lynx sensor head.
They state that the one sigma range accuracy of the
LiDAR  is  0.008  m.  Examining  planar  surfaces  in
multiple points taken by the Lynx system reveals that

the range accuracy of the system is generally better
than  this,  usually  around  0.003  m.  Therefore  these
numbers will be compared to see the effect of each. 
That  leaves  the  six  errors  associated  with  the
integration of the LiDAR and INS system, the so-
called  boresight  and 
lever  arm  parameters.
Typically, boresight operation for many MTL and
multibeam  sonar  systems  is  done  using  non-
rigours methods such as the so-called “Patch Test”
[Hypack  Inc.  2007].  Multiple  manufacturers  of
this  equipment  and  the  software  used  to  process
the data use these methods for determining bore-
sight  parameters  for  MTL  [Optech  Inc. 2008;
Hypack  Inc.  2007;  Reson  B.V.  2011;  Virtual
Geomatics  Inc.  2010;  Jeeninga  2012;  Dix  et  al.
2011].  Table  1  gives  a  breakdown  of  these
parameters,  their  groups,  expected  error  values
and  the  ideal  error  values  for  these  parameters
obtained by accurate calibrations.

Some literature sources agree that the expected
lever arm uncertainties listed in Table 1 are typical
for  most  systems  [Glennie 2007b].  However,  the

sight  method  should  facilitate  an  uncertainty  of
0.005°  for  roll  and  pitch  and  0.008°  for  heading
[Glennie 2007b].  The  same  source  further  states

adjustment  should  have  a  typical  uncertainty  of
0.001° for roll and pitch and 0.004° for heading.

The  values  from  the  manual  boresight  seem
optimistic. When performing a manual boresight, a
more  likely  value  for  the  boresight  roll,  pitch  and
heading uncertainty is 0.02°, as reflected in Table 1. 

Results and Discussion

The  Lynx  data  was  run  through  the  error
propagation  model  for  both  the  expected  error
estimates  and  the  ideal  error  estimates.  The
results  were  converted  to  a  colour  scale  and

G   E   O   M   A   T   I   C   A

applied  to  the  point  cloud.  The  results  from  the
error propagation analysis for the expected error
estimates are shown in Figure 3.

The colour scales applied to the point clouds in
Figure 3 show that the largest source of error in the
resultant point cloud is consistently caused by the
INS positional errors. The poor quality of the lever
arm  estimates  in  this  case  makes  the  lever  arms
between  the  LiDAR  and  the  INS  the  second  most
consistent source of error in the system. The angular
errors from the INS orientation variables, as well as
the  LiDAR  to  INS  boresight  variables,  take  on
increasing  significance  as  the  range  from  the
LiDAR  sensor  increases.  The  LiDAR  measure-
ments themselves comprise the least source of error
in the point cloud. 

The  colour-mapped  data  from  the  first  order
conditional variance analysis for the expected error
estimates are shown in Figure 4. The colour maps
in  Figure  4 show  that  when  the  expected  error
estimates  exist  in  the  point  cloud,  the  largest  pro-
portion of the error in the MTL point cloud is given
by the LiDAR to INS lever arm values in Group 3.
The  rotations  between  LiDAR  coordinate  frame
and  the  INS  coordinate  frame  (Group  4)  in  turn
take  on  increasing  significance  as  the  range  from
the LiDAR sensor increases.

Since  the  color  maps  in  Figure 4  refer  to
groups of variables instead of individual variables,
the Sobol indices for each variable were calculated.
It was found that the lever arm almost exclusively
responsible  for  this  result  is  the  Z  lever  arm. The
scatter plots in Figure 5 show that at close ranges
the Z lever arm from the LiDAR to INS contributes

up to 90% of the error in the point cloud. Figure 5
also  shows  that  as  the  range  from  the  sensor
increases, the significance of the Z lever arm tapers
off and is replaced by the LiDAR to INS roll angle.
At  the  maximum  range  of  the  LYNX  sensor,  the
effect  of  roll  under  these  conditions  becomes  the
single most significant source of error in the point
cloud. Figure 5 shows that at the maximum range of
the Lynx sensor, the error generated by the LiDAR
to INS roll angle is upwards of 70%.

In  addition  to  the  first  order  indices  of  the
conditional  variance  analysis,  the  total  effect
indices  for  the  five  groups  were  also  computed.
These  total  effect  indices  were  converted  to  a
colour scale and applied to the point cloud. Figure
6 shows  the  total  effect  indices  for  the  expected
error  estimates.  Figure  7 shows  the  two  most
important scatter plots of the total effect indices for
the  expected  error  estimates.  The  colour-mapped
data in Figure 6 show that when the expected error
estimates  exist  in  the  point  cloud,  the  total  effect
indices  from  the  conditional  variance  analysis  are
practically identical to the first order effect.  

Breaking  down  the  groups  into  individual
variables  as  we  did  with  the  first  order  indices,
again  we  see  that  the  LiDAR  to  INS  Z  lever  arm
and  the  LiDAR  to  INS  roll  angle  are  the  most
significant parameters in terms of their proportional
effect on the point cloud. The scatter plots shown in
Figure  7 indicate  that  the  LiDAR  to  INS  Z  lever
arm  contributes  upwards  of  90%  of  the  error  at
ranges close to the LiDAR sensor and decreases as
the  range  increases.  Figure  7 also  shows  that  the
LiDAR  to  INS  roll  angle  has  little  significance
close  to  the  LiDAR  sensor,  but  makes  up  almost
70% of the error at maximum range.

For  this  MTL  point  cloud,  error  propagation
with the expected error estimates (Figure 3) indicates
that  the  largest  source  of  error  in  the  point  cloud
comes from the INS position. The first order condi-
tional variance analysis tells a different story. Figure
4  indicates  that  the  INS  position  only  accounts  for
about 12% of the total error in the point cloud. The
largest source of error is actually the LiDAR to INS
lever  arm,  not  the  INS  position. The  fact  that  both
Figures  5  and  7  show  the  Z-lever  arm  and  the
LiDAR  to  INS  roll  angle  contributing  upwards  of
90% and 70% of the total error at various times high-
lights the significance of these two parameters. This
was apparent from the error propagation model.

The fact that the first order sensitivity indices in
Figure 4 add up to one, and that the first order indices
closely  mirror  the  total  effect  indices  shown  in
Figure  6,  indicates  that  Equation  1  is  an  additive
model.  This  implies  that  the  majority  of  the  total

effect  can  be  attributed  to  the  individual  variables,
i.e., the first order effect. Cross-effects caused by the
various variable combinations are minimal and can
be  regarded  as  insignificant.  The  higher  order
indices  from  Equation  11  can  therefore  be
disregarded from further error analysis.

The results from the error propagation for the
ideal error estimates are shown in Figure 8. Figure
8 shows  that  using  the  ideal  error  estimates,  the
error  in  the  resulting  point  cloud  will  be  heavily
influenced by the errors inherent in the INS system.
The most significant source of error in Figure 8 is
in the INS position (Group 1) at a constant 3–4 cm.
The  second  largest  source  of  error  according  to
Figure  8 is  given  by  the  INS  orientation  data

(Group  2). This  error  is  insignificant  at  the  LiDAR
and  increases  as  the  range  from  the  LiDAR
increases.  The  LiDAR  to  INS  lever  arms,  the
rotations of the LiDAR coordinate frame in the INS
frame and the LiDAR measurements themselves are
shown to contribute an insignificant amount of error
in Figure 8. 

The  colour  maps  in  Figure  9  show  that  when
the ideal error estimates exist in the point cloud, the
largest proportion of error in the MTL point cloud is
given by the INS position parameters of Group 1.
The LiDAR measurement parameters of Group 5
contribute the next highest percentage of error in
the  MTL  point  cloud,  while  the  other  groups
disappear into insignificance.

Figure 11: Results of total effect conditional variance
analysis using the ideal error estimates. Each of the
five identified groups of variables was isolated and
the Sobol indices computed.

The  scatter  plots  for  the  ideal  error  estimates
were calculated and it was found that the Z coordi-
nate of the INS position, the LiDAR range and the
LiDAR  vertical  angle  were  the  most  significant.
Figure 10 shows that the Z coordinate from the INS
contributes  up  to  45%  of  the  total  error  at  close
ranges  under  ideal  error  conditions.  The  LiDAR
range contributes another 40% of the error at these
same ranges. In some spots where laser saturations
occur, spikes can be seen in the LiDAR range scat-
ter plot in Figure 10; however, the general trend of
the data is for the laser range to contribute less error
to  the  overall  solution  as  range  increases.  As  the
significance  of  the  LiDAR  range  decreases,  the
vertical angle of the LiDAR takes over as the major
source of error from the LiDAR, peaking at around
40% at long ranges.

The  colour-mapped  data  in  Figure  11 show
that when the ideal error estimates exist in the point
cloud, the total effect indices from the conditional
variance  analysis  are  also  very  similar  to  the  first
order  effect.  The  INS  position  (Group  1)  consis-
tently contributes the largest proportion of error to
the MTL point cloud, with the LiDAR measure-
ments  (Group  5)  contributing  the  next  largest
proportion  of  error  to  the  MTL  point  cloud.  The
other groups vanish into insignificance. 

Looking at the total effect Sobol indices for the
ideal case, we see similar results as those found with
the first order Sobol indices. Figure 12 shows the total
effect Sobol indices for the same parameters that were
shown in Figure 10, namely, the Z coordinate of the
INS  position,  the  LiDAR  range  and  the  LiDAR
vertical  angle. As  expected,  the  results  for  the  total
effect Sobol indices show results identical to the first
order Sobol indices of Figure 10. Just as in Figure 10,
Figure 12 shows that the INS Z coordinate contributes
up  to  45%  of  the  overall  error  and  that  there  is  a
reciprocal relationship between the amount of error
contributed  by  the  laser  range  finder  and  the
LiDAR encoders. 

Figures 9, 10, 11 and 12 reinforce the implication
that the majority of the total effect can be attributed to
the  first  order  effect.  The  higher  order  effects  from
Equation 11 can therefore be treated as insignificant.
Contrasting  the  result  obtained  using  the
expected  error  estimates  in  the  error  propagation
model,  we  see  that  the  ideal  error  estimates  in  the
error  propagation  model  clearly  give  us  the  INS
position  as  the  main  source  of  error  in  the  point
cloud (Figure 8). In Figure 8, these three groups of
variables show error estimates less than 1 cm for all
the points in the point cloud. Only the INS position
and orientation errors play a significant role in the
final  point  cloud  error.  The  conditional  variance

analysis  bears  this  out,  showing  that  the  INS
position errors make up more than 50% of the errors
throughout  the  point  cloud  (Figure  9).  Figure  9
shows that the INS orientation, LiDAR lever arms
and  the  LiDAR  boresight  collectively  make  up  a
small  percentage  of  the  total  error. We  also  see  in
Figure 9 that the second most significant source of
error is from the LiDAR and that it occurs directly
along the MTL system’s path. This is due to effects
in the LiDAR receiver caused by the extreme short
ranges measured by the system. The rest of the error
from  the  LiDAR  increases  as  the  range  increases.
This  indicates  that  the  angular  uncertainties  in  the
LIDAR’s  encoder  combined  with  range  and  zero
error uncertainties become more pronounced in the
resulting point cloud at range. 

Conclusions

The  nature  of  error  in  MTL  is  still  being
discovered. While research into the nature of error
generated  by  Airborne  LiDAR  systems  has  been
conducted for several years, research into errors in
MTL has just begun.  

Conditional  variance  analysis  has  shown  that
the  contribution  by  the  interactions  among  the
measured parameters to the variances of the points
in an MTL point cloud is insignificant. The sizes of
the variances for the measurements used to produce
a point are the primary source of error in the output
point cloud. In particular, under a loosely controlled
error condition, the LiDAR to INS Z lever arm and
the LiDAR to INS roll angle contributed more error
in the output point cloud than any other parameter,
including  the  INS  position.  Under  tightly  con-
trolled error conditions, the INS position becomes
the dominant source of error in the point cloud. 

Therefore,  MTL  systems  that  have  been
mounted  and  boresighted  using  non-rigorous
methodologies provide the greatest source of error
in the resulting point cloud. It is therefore essential
that high quality rigours methods be used to derive
the  integration  parameters  so  that  high  quality
LiDAR data may be collected with an MTL system.

Abstract. An approach to simulating land-cover patterns based on historical
land-use maps and forecasts based on models and planning documents is
described and demonstrated. The approach uses stochastic spatial simulation to
generate land-cover patterns on the basis of a land-use map and stated
translation rules. The translation rules take the form of (1) a table that
summarizes the proportions of each land-cover type within each land-use type
and (2) a description of the spatial arrangement and/or pattern of land-cover
types. In a demonstration of the approach, we calibrated the translation rules
using aerial photo observations and simulated current and future land-cover
maps for Livingston County, Michigan, USA. We tested the approach in a test
area that was not used in calibrating the translation. The proportions of land
cover within each land-use type were reasonably well estimated, except where the
amount of the same land use was small in the calibration site. The use of
location rules signiﬁcantly improved the ﬁt of estimated land-cover patterns
with observed patterns for the test area. The paper discusses how the method
can be used to bridge land-use scenarios and their ecological impacts based on
land-cover patterns.

Introduction
This paper addresses the need to translate between the semantics of land-use
and land-cover categories, such that available information about possible land uses
can be used to infer and map possible patterns of land cover. Cihlar and Jansen
(2001) outlined the conceptual and methodological issues involved in interpreting
land-use categories based on their relation to mapped land-cover categories. Their
work facilitates large-area mapping of land use based on remotely sensed imagery.
Our work approaches the relationship between land use and land cover from the
opposite direction. Given a map of land use, for example from a spatial land-use
model or plan, what does a possible map of tree-cover look like? Similarly, given a
map with a hybrid use/cover classiﬁcation scheme, what is the likely distribution of
impervious surfaces? A semantic translation approach should make it possible to
generate land-cover maps that can be used as input to biophysical or habitat
models for evaluating the ecological consequences of forecast land-use changes, for
which land-cover data are not available. Multiple possible land-cover maps could

planning approaches, and/or (b) different land-cover patterns that connote different
translation assumptions or alternative landscape designs.

Land-use and land-cover categories have important semantic differences that
information,
can serve as barriers to the integration of social and ecological
perspectives, and models. The widepread use of geographic information systems
(GIS) in land management and planning and the increasing demand for land-use
and -cover scenarios call our attention to these differences and the need to bridge
them. Land use can be deﬁned as human activity on, and intention for, the land,
whereas land cover refers to the biophysical characteristics of the landscape. The
inﬂuence that land-use change has on natural ecosystems, e.g. wildlife habitat or
downstream aquatic environments, is of great interest but is manifested primarily
through physical changes made to the landscape, i.e. land cover. The distinctions
between land use and land cover are particularly important in urban environments,
where the terms ‘developed’, ‘urban’, or ‘residential’ indicate the actual or intended
use of the land but can include a full range of possible land-cover combinations and
patterns (e.g. trees, impervious, grass, wetlands).

In order to evaluate possible future land-use scenarios, planners increasingly
invoke GIS-based land-use models and planning tools to produce possible maps of
future land use (e.g. Clarke and Gaydos 1998, Klostermann 1999, Malczewski
1999). Similarly, modern planning methods call for the creation of mapped plans
and zoning that can guide the spatial patterns of land-use change. In order to
evaluate the environmental consequences of these scenarios and plans, however, the
resulting land-cover patterns need to be considered. Each land-use category in a
map of forecast land use has the potential, depending on the scales of deﬁnition, to
take in multiple land-cover types in some spatial arrangement. In addition to
planning or designing land-use conﬁgurations, planners and landscape architects
have some inﬂuence on the arrangement of land-cover types, e.g. through landscape
designs, setbacks, or restrictions on the amount of impervious surfaces (Nassauer
1997). Lack of careful attention to the semantic differences between land use and
-cover has made it difﬁcult to evaluate the ecological consequences of land-use
scenarios resulting from these models and plans and the effects of possible
alternative land-cover patterns.

Semantic translation can also be useful when working with historical land-use
data. Maps created through interpretation of aerial photography often use
combined categories in hybrid land-use/cover maps (Anderson et al. 1976). Where
the combinations and patterns of land covers are suggestive, certain land-use
categories (e.g. low-density residential) can be deﬁned based on those combinations
of cover-types as determined through remote sensing (e.g. grass–trees–impervious;
Cihlar and Jansen 2001). Where land uses are impossible to ascribe on the basis of a
remote image, these hybrid classiﬁcation schemes usually designate a cover type
(e.g. forest). Such hybrid maps intentionally obscure ﬁne-grained variations in land
cover within polygons representing land-use categories. Yet, these ﬁne-grained
variations in land cover may have signiﬁcant implications for natural ecosystem
processes (e.g. habitat quality, hydrologic ﬂow, or natural productivity). Moreover,
land cover, of the hybrid-map
the speciﬁc meanings,
categories often vary from one mapping effort to the next. This semantic drift
complicates efforts to make multi-temporal comparisons and discern land-cover
change. Though satellite remote sensing has facilitated rapid, direct mapping of

land cover, many historical maps of land use exist from which translation to land
cover might be useful for comparison purposes.

We developed a simulation-based approach to semantic translation between
land use and land cover. This paper describes the approach and the results of a
demonstration project carried out within Livingston County, Michigan, USA, that
supports a study of the inﬂuence of urbanization on aquatic integrity within
watersheds (Allan et al. 1997). The goal was to both validate the translation
land
approach and illustrate the method by comparing current patterns of
development with those that are possible in the future.

trees, grass,

The semantic translation approach requires, ﬁrst, the deﬁnition of land-use
classes in terms of the areal proportions of each category that are in each of a set of
impervious, and
more carefully speciﬁed land-cover classes (i.e.
wetlands) and, second, a formal description of the spatial arrangement of those
cover types. Stochastic spatial simulation is used to generate realizations of possible
land-cover maps given land-use class (or parcel) boundaries and the descriptions of
their cover type compositions and spatial arrangements. To calibrate the translation
process, i.e. determine the land-cover proportions of the source maps and their
spatial arrangements, we use additional aerial photo data classiﬁed to represent the
target land-cover categories. To validate the approach, we measured and evaluated
the improvement in the ﬁt of the estimated land-cover map to the observed land
cover, within both the calibration site and an adjacent test site.

We then apply the approach to map potential future land use that was compiled
from the master plans of local governments in the area. A master plan is a mapped
plan for the physical development of the municipality made by municipal planning
commission through careful and comprehensive surveys and studies of present
conditions and future growth of the municipality. The map speciﬁes zoning for the
control of the height, area, bulk, location and use of buildings and premises. The
master plans serve as a ‘build-out’ scenario, assuming that all land that can be will
be developed. Our discussion addresses the potential applications and limitations of
the approach presented.

2.

Interoperability of land use and land cover
Semantic mismatch complicates the interoperability of geographic data sets
(Buehler and McKee 1998). Land-use and land-cover data have three major
semantic differences that affect their interoperation. First, the category deﬁnitions of
‘undeveloped forest’ and
land use and land cover are different. For example,
‘developed urban’ categories in a land-use classiﬁcation are not synonymous with
the land-cover classes ‘tree-cover’ and ‘impervious’. A case of the former is a clear-
cut area that continues to be used for forestry and would typically retain the forest
use designation, even with no tree cover. Land cover may be deﬁned as the
observed physical cover including the vegetation (natural or planted) and human
constructions which cover the Earth’s surface. Land use, meanwhile, involves both
the manner in which the biophysical attributes of the land are manipulated and the
intent underlying that manipulation—the purpose for which the land is used
(Turner et al. 1995: 20). Land-use dynamics are a major determinant of land-cover
changes. Land use involves considerations of human behaviour, with particularly
initial conditions of land

cover, and the inter-level integration of processes at one level with those at other
levels of aggregation (McConnell and Moran 2001).

The second difference is that land use and land cover have different geometric
expressions, which is at least partially linked to the semantic differences. Land cover
refers to biophysical condition at a location (i.e. grid cell) or in a homogenous
landscape patch (i.e. polygon). Land use refers to the economic function of a spatial
unit, within which the tenure may (i.e. ownership parcels) or may not (i.e. polygons
or grid cells) be uniform. Land-use features are often composed of multiple land-
cover features (e.g. patches of tree, impervious, grass, wetlands; Cihlar and Jansen
2001). For
reason, a classiﬁcation cross-walk approach to semantic
interoperability, which deﬁnes interrelations between classiﬁcation schemes without
redeﬁning spatial objects and like that proposed and implemented for alternative
vegetation/land-cover classiﬁcations by the IGBP (Loveland et al. 2000), may be an
inadequate solution for translation between land use and cover (i.e. the spatial
objects might need to change in addition to the class deﬁnitions).

this

Finally, land use and land cover have different spatial rules to assign attributes
to land-use/cover features (Bishr et al. 1999). The class deﬁnitions of land use tend
to integrate information about activities taking place within a spatial unit (e.g.
parcels or zone), while those of land cover assess only the static and in situ

conditions. Thus,

both maps are compiled based on sources of the same level of detail.

the mapped entities of a land-cover map (i.e.

Semantic mismatch can be both (1) indicative of deep differences in the
understanding two information communities have about the world and (2) severely
limiting in attempts to bridge those information communities. An information
community has been deﬁned as ‘a community of geodata producers and users who
share a common set of feature deﬁnitions and other semantics that structure their
data’ (Buehler and McKee 1998: 74). Broadly speaking, land-use dynamics models
and land-use planning documents apply social science principles to forecast or
guide future land use, whereas models of biophysical processes employ natural
science principles to forecast the functioning of natural systems and require land-
cover information as input. Therefore, at least where the modelling of process and
forecasting is concerned, land use is more centrally located within an information
community of social scientists and land cover within an information community of
natural scientists. Several modelling approaches exist within the social sciences to
forecast land-use patterns (see Briassoulis 2000; table 1(a)), and within the natural
sciences to estimate environmental effects given land-cover patterns (table 1(b)). The
semantic mismatch between the outputs from socio-economic land-use change
models (i.e. land use) and the land inputs of biophysical models (i.e. land cover)
presents a substantial challenge to the multi-disciplinary assessment and projection
of human impacts on the environment.

We propose a conceptual framework to facilitate the interoperability between
land-use and land-cover data in an interdisciplinary setting (ﬁgure 1). We
acknowledge, on the one hand, the different modelling approaches of social and
natural scientists and, on the other hand, the limitations of data acquired from
remote sensing or population census. By bridging the different but related semantic

interoperability of land-use/cover data between social and natural scientists can be
better achieved.

An ultimate goal of this work is to establish semantic and data links between
models of land-use change and models of biophysical process (as shown in the
fourth column of ﬁgure 1). Because of the semantic mismatch issues described
above, direct input of the land-use scenarios from land-use models and plans into
biophysical models is inconsistent with the meanings assigned by the two
information communities. Therefore, land-use information, which is the product
of land-use scenarios and supported by input data from socio-economic, cadastral,
and remote-sensing sources (bottom row of ﬁgure 1), must be translated to land

cover. Many biophysical models actually require
input data representing
biophysical landscape properties (e.g. leaf area index), that land cover correlates
strongly with, and can be used to estimate, these properties. Remote-sensing
scientists are developing direct inputs to biophysical models from remote sensing in
the form of biophysical parameter estimates (top row of ﬁgure 1; e.g. Defries et al.
1999). Such an approach can be used to evaluate historical environmental impacts
of human activity but cannot be used to evaluate possible future impacts. For this
purpose, the outputs from land-use models are required to derive land-cover classes
and properties for input to biophysical models (second column in ﬁgure 1). By
developing a semantic translation approach between land use and land cover, we
can explore two different types of scenarios (third column in ﬁgure 1): land-use
scenarios that generate alternative patterns of land development and use, and land-
cover scenarios that generate alternative patterns of land cover (i.e.
landscape
design) within the broader patterns of use and development. The translation
approach, therefore, can be used in the assessment of both land-use and landscape
futures.

3. Simulation-based semantic translation approach

land-use/cover maps and address

The semantic translation approach introduced in this paper uses stochastic
spatial simulation to create possible land-cover maps from forecast land use or
historical
semantic discrepancies. Spatial
simulation allows for the incorporation of geometric, as well as semantic,
information into the translation process and for addressing the discrepancy of
geometric description between land use and land cover. A semantic translation
table that expresses land-use categories using land-cover categories addresses the
discrepancy of category deﬁnitions. Additional expert knowledge of the spatial
characteristics of land cover is used to generate the land-cover arrangements that
are not revealed by the land-use map because of the discrepancy of class deﬁnitions.
The semantic translator is implemented in Visual Basic (MicrosoftTM).

We translate a rasterized land-use map to land cover using stochastic spatial
simulation, which reproduces land-cover patterns following predeﬁned simulation
the
rules. The grid cell size is usually deﬁned by the spatial resolution of
input rasterized land-use map and/or the resolution required for biophysical
modelling. The semantic translator is capable of generating, from a land-use map, a
land-cover map that meets two types of constraints: (1) land-cover proportions for
each land-use polygon, as speciﬁed in a use-cover translation table; and (2) the
densities of land-cover types conditioned on the distance to a speciﬁed landscape
feature.

To condition the simulation to the ﬁrst constraint, we place land-cover types
proportionately within each land-use polygon based on the input translation table.
The translation table deﬁnes the relationship as a vector of numbers (e.g. low-
density residential land use has a land-cover composition of 30% tree, 50% grass,
and 20% impervious) or a vector of random variables with deﬁned probability
distributions for percentage cover (e.g. low-density residential land use has a land-
cover composition of 30¡10% tree, 50¡5% grass, 20¡10% impervious at 90%
conﬁdence intervals). The land-cover types are assigned to grid cells, the locations
of which are drawn randomly within each input land-use polygon. When land-cover
proportions are speciﬁed as probability distributions, the semantic translator uses a

41

conditional random number generator to produce a land-cover composition. The
distribution of the random variable is speciﬁed in the translation table as a discrete
cumulative distribution function (cdf),
i.e. a vector of percentage cover values
with associated cumulative probabilities that the random variable is no greater
than the percentage cover value. Linear interpolation is used to assign proba-
bility values to percentage cover values unspeciﬁed by the cdf. Once the percen-
tages for all
land-cover categories in a land-use polygon are generated, the
percentages are rescaled to ensure that they add up to 100%. Land-cover pixels are
then put into the land-use polygons proportionately to the derived land-cover
composition.

After randomly placing the land-covers in correct proportion within each land-
use polygon, the second constraint (i.e. location relative to spatial features) was
imposed on the initial land-cover map with the stochastic spatial simulation. The
simulation ﬁrst prioritized the pixels of the targeted then the other land-cover types
in a land-use polygon, respectively, based on the distance to a speciﬁed landscape
feature, e.g. a road network. Both priority lists are sorted in descending order. A
higher priority is given when a pixel is closer to the landscape feature (in the case of
collocation) or vice versa (in the case of avoidance). Then, when collocation is
speciﬁed, the simulation selects a calculated number of pixel pairs with one pixel
selected toward the tail of the priority list (i.e. the low-priority end whose pixels are
further from the landscape feature) of the targeted land-cover type and the other
pixel selected toward the head of the priority list of the other land-cover types. The
land-cover types of each pair are swapped so that the intended proximity properties
are approximated. In the case of avoidance, pixels toward the tail (i.e. with pixels
closer to the landscape feature) of the priority list of the targeted cover type are
swapped with pixels toward the head of the priority list of the other cover types.
Two parameters in the simulation, i.e. effective proximity distance and the target
proportion of the targeted land-cover type within the effective proximity distance,
are adjustable to approximate speciﬁed or observed spatial proximity properties.
All pixels located beyond the effective proximity distance are treated as having
equal distance priorities. The target proportion was compared with the proportion
of the targeted land-cover type, and their difference was used to calculate the
number of pixel pairs selected to be swapped in each land-use polygon. To prevent
ties in the location priority, a small random number was added to the entries in the
priority list. These random numbers were so small that they did not alter the
priority deﬁned by the difference in distance. We used the conditional random
number generator to simulate a linear distances decay function for the frequencies
of swapping at various distance and allow swapping to occur at locations other
than those with highest priority.

For our demonstration project (described below), we used this approach to
generate simulations that reproduced distance relationships between the land-cover
proportions and each of three landscape features: water bodies, wetlands, and
roads. These features were selected based on speciﬁc hypotheses about
the
relationships between these features and land cover, and because they inﬂuence the
ecological impact of land-cover change. It is worth noting that the method used
here is similar to the multi-criteria evaluation and multi-objective land allocation
(MCE/MOLA) procedures used for allocating land covers given various mapped
criteria (e.g. Eastman et al. 1998). Though we do not present such results here, an

important rationale for using the simulation approach is its ability to incorporate,
in addition to location-speciﬁc priorities, spatial pattern criteria, such as patch size
distribution or connectivity requirements. Resulting simulations can, therefore, be
made to optimize both multiple mapped criteria and global spatial pattern
constraints.

4. Demonstration project

The semantic translation approach is demonstrated in the context of a study of
the ecological effects of land-use change in south-eastern Michigan, USA. The
application presented here generates recent and possible future land-cover maps
from existing land-use maps and master plans. In order to generate realistic rules to
guide the translation process, the relationships between land-use and land-cover
categories are calibrated by comparing the existing land-use map with remote-
sensing-based maps of land cover collected for a small subset of that area. The
approach is then validated by comparing simulated maps with observed land-cover
patterns within a test area. Alternative approaches to developing translation rules,
including approaches to using the tool for assessing alternative landscape designs,
are outlined in the Discussion and conclusions section.

4.1. Study area and data

Livingston County (ﬁgure 2) is located on the north-western edge of the
Detroit–Ann Arbor–Flint consolidated metropolitan statistical area (population
5.45 million in 2000). The population of Livingston County increased by almost
36% during the 1990s (to 156 951 in 2000), the highest rate of growth in the State of
Michigan during that period (US Census Bureau 2001). Crop and pasture land
in the county made up about 24% of land use in 1997, but it was declining (USDA
1997), forest was 26% in 1993 and increasing (Leatherberry and Spencer 1996), and
urbanized area was 17% in 1995 and increasing (Liu 1999). The remaining lands
were mostly in water, wetland, and non-forested natural uses.

Much of the population growth and land development are occurring in the
south-eastern portion of the county, which includes the intersection of two major
highways (Interstate 96 and US 23) and the city and township of Brighton. This
part of the county sits within the Huron River watershed, which drains to Lake
Erie. The rest of the county is divided between the Shiawassee and Grand River
watersheds. In all of these watersheds, concern for the quality of surface waters
continues to be an important issue that drives interest in land-use/cover change. The
concerns are driven by both human and ecosystem health concerns.

We used two land-use maps of the study area to demonstrate the semantic
translation to land cover. Both maps were compiled by the South-eastern Michigan
Council of Governments (SEMCOG). The ﬁrst is a 1995 update of land use
interpreted from 1:24 000 scale aerial photography, and the other is a compilation
of 20 different city and township master plans. The land-use categories vary, as do
the deﬁnitions of mapping units. The 1995 land-use map originally had more than
50 hybrid land-use/cover categories, while the map of master plans had 122 unique
names for land use within the county. In the master plans, different cities or
townships used identical names to describe slightly different future land use. For
example,
‘Low Density Residential’ has three different maximum development
densities, 0.5, 1, 1.5 dwelling units (DU) per acre. The maximum development

USA (inset).

densities of ‘Multi-Family’, ‘Multiple Family’, and ‘Multiple Family Residential’
vary from 0.3 to 10 DU per acre. The combination of unique land-use category
name and maximum development density, as indicated in the master plans, yielded
142 land-use categories. Both maps use aggregate polygons as mapping units, but
because the categories are different, the mapping units differ as well. We regrouped,
through class aggregation, the original land-use categories of both maps into nine
categories for demonstration purposes (table 2; ﬁgure 3).

The original classes in the 1995 land-use map followed a classiﬁcation scheme
that was fairly similar to an Anderson et al. (1976) three-level classiﬁcation. The
classes in table 2 and the map in ﬁgure 3 resulted from class combinations. High-
density residential includes all forms of multi-family housing, strip residential, and
mobile homes. Low-density residential includes single-family housing and farm-
steads. The urban class includes all other developed uses, including commercial,
industrial, public assembly, infrastructure, and transportation. Agriculture includes
all crop, pasture, and conﬁned feeding operations. Non-forested natural represents
outdoor recreation, cemeteries, rangeland, and shrubland. Forested natural lands

are all forested areas, including plantations. The wetlands and water categories
include all areas classiﬁed as such in the original map. Barren includes beaches,
sand dunes, and exposed rock, as well as any mining activities (which are open pit
in this region).

To create our future land-use categories from the community master plans, we
grouped categories such as commercial, urban, central business district, or
industrial into the urban category. For residential categories, any non-urban uses
with maximum development densities higher than 6 DU per acre were grouped as
high-density residential use, and non-urban uses with maximum development
densities between 0.2 (includes 0.2) and 6 DU per acre (include 6.0) and all
residential uses with maximum development densities less than or equal to 6 DU per
acre as low-density residential use. The use of 6 DU per acre to distinguish low-
density and high-density residential is based on the deﬁnition used in the 1995 land-
use category, while the density of less than 0.2 DU per acre (i.e. larger than 5 acres
per DU) is more like the density in a rural/agricultural setting. Thus, several future
categories designated as agricultural use have been reclassiﬁed as low-density
residential use because their maximum development densities are higher than or
equal to 0.2 DU per acre. None of the master plans included a forest land-use
class. The closest categories to forest use are conservation-related categories. There
is no indication of how these conservation areas will be managed in the future.
We reclassiﬁed them all to non-forested natural use. Although this means that
some forest will be lost in our future scenario as a result, the non-forested
natural use still had a substantial amount of tree cover (as described in the Results
section).

The land-cover categories (table 2) are intended to be all-inclusive of cover
types. The herbaceous category has a broad deﬁnition and includes grass, row
crops and other herbaceous cover. The impervious cover category refers to roof
tops, driveways, sidewalks, paved streets, and any other hard surface. Tree refers to
large woody plants and includes both coniferous and deciduous trees. The wetland
and water categories are taken directly from the 1995 land-use map, and we,
therefore, do not attempt
these use/cover
categories.

4.2. Calibrating the translation rules with high-resolution land cover

We demonstrate one of several possible approaches to determining the semantic
and spatial translation rules, by summarizing an existing land-cover map (e.g.
derived through remote sensing) by land-use categories. The 1995 SEMCOG land-
use map was overlaid with two high-resolution land-cover maps, created from
sampled aerial photography within the region (ﬁgure 4). The north photo was used
to generate a translation table and to describe the spatial patterns of each land-
cover type relative to several landscape features (i.e. roads, wetlands, and streams/
lakes). Then, a set of translation parameters was calibrated to best reproduce the
observed land-cover proportions and spatial pattern. The degree to which simulated
land-cover patterns matched the observed in the south photo was measured to
validate the simulation model and its parameters.

The aerial photos were taken near Brighton in Livingston County, Michigan, on
23 April 1998, on colour-infrared ﬁlm, and at a nominal scale of 1:58 000. Each
photo covers an area of about 15 square miles (3900 ha). The photos were scanned
and geo-rectiﬁed to 2 m spatial resolution. A land-cover map was created for each
of the aerial photographs using unsupervised classiﬁcation with the original three
colour layers as input, plus two texture layers to improve the separation of
agricultural from residential (Gong and Howarth 1990) and to help differentiate
between bare-soil (i.e. the major non-vegetated cover in agricultural area) and
impervious surface (i.e. the major non-vegetated cover in residential area). We
manually corrected remaining misclassiﬁcations between impervious and soil classes
on the classiﬁed land-cover map. In addition, 1995 land-use polygons that did not
match the land use interpreted from the 1998 photos were excluded from the
estimation. Presumably, these polygons have undergone land-use change during the
same period. Because the aerial photo classiﬁcation was conducted for demonstra-
tion purposes only, we did not invest in a quantitative accuracy assessment of the
results. However, because of the spectral information in the photos (i.e. colour-
infrared), the ﬁne spatial detail (i.e. 2 m), the relatively simple target classes, and the
manual editing of particular misclassiﬁcations (i.e. impervious and barren), we are
conﬁdent that the classiﬁcation is sufﬁcient to illustrate the semantic translation
methods.

To measure the proximity effects of land cover to certain landscape features,
graphs of distance versus land-cover percentage (i.e. within each distance) were
generated for each land-use type and with respect to each of three landscape
features: roads, wetlands, and streams/lakes. Based on the graphs, we determined
which land use, land cover, and landscape feature combinations exhibited non-
uniform distance functions. For those situations, we used stochastic spatial
simulation to reproduce as well as possible the observed distance relationships
between land-cover proportions and distance to landscape features and derive a
set of parameters for the model. Distance relationships observed in the simulated
land-cover maps were quantitatively compared with those observed in the remotely
sensed land-cover maps to iteratively assess and improve the degree of ﬁt.

4.3. Validation

The land-cover proportions in each land-use type and spatial proximity rules,
derived from the calibration on the north site, were used to simulate 15 land-cover
maps for both the north and south sites (i.e. 15 realizations of the stochastic process

embedded in the translation approach) for each of two cases: (a) using only
proportion parameters and (b) using additional spatial proximity parameters. The
simulated maps had resolutions of 30 m to reduce computation time compared with
2 m resolution. Though the calibration data had 2 m resolutions, the distance
functions were summarized by 30 m increments to facilitate simulation at 30 m. The
results were compared in an effort to validate the applicability of the translation
approach in reproducing the spatial proximity effect.

involves

type. Standardization of SMAEs

Two indices, standardized mean absolute error (SMAE) and mean error (ME),
were used to measure the goodness of ﬁt of graphs of proximity effects between
observed and simulated land-cover maps in both sites. SMAE is the mean absolute
error of ‘standardized’ proportions between data pairs in a graph for each land-
subtracting the cumulative
cover
proportion at an arbitrarily assigned lag range (10 lags, each representing one
pixel in a distance of 30 meter, were used in our analysis) from that at each lag for
each graph. The standardization method was intended to ﬁlter out the discrepancies
in the proximity graphs caused by not having identical proportions in translation
tables. ME is the mean error of proportions of all paired lags between graphs of
observed and simulated maps. Both indices were aggregated from individual
SMAEs and MEs of land-cover types to calculate area-weighted arithmetic means
of their absolute values across all land-cover types. SMAE measures the shape
similarity between proximity effect graphs, while ME measures the magnitude of
offset (bias) of these graphs. ME is a more comprehensive index, because the
difference in shapes could contribute to the difference when measuring the offset of
two graphs. We tested the SMAEs and MEs from maps with and without spatial
proximity effects for signiﬁcant
improvements in those adjusted with spatial
proximity parameters.

4.4. Recent and future land-use scenarios using community master plans

for

the semantic translator

To demonstrate an application of

scenario
generation, two land-cover maps were generated at 30 m resolution from the two
sources of land-use information: (1) the 1995 land-use/cover map and (2) the
compiled community master plans. The ﬁrst simulation simply applies the semantic
translation approach to the 1995 map. For the second, a change map was created
by overlaying the 1995 SEMCOG land-use map and community master plan maps
for future development (ﬁgure 5). This change map was used to represent the ‘build-
out’ as represented in the community master plans. The build-out map was used to
identify those places that are expected to change, and therefore require simulation
to represent future patterns and was classiﬁed into several categories, representing
the combination of 1995 land uses and master plan classiﬁcations:

a. No change area: polygons where 1995 and future land use are of the same

land use type.

b. Intensiﬁed urban area: developed polygons whose 1995 land use is less
intense than future use. Urban, high-density residential, and low-density
residential are the developed land use types, in order of decreasing land use
intensity.

c. Developable area: undeveloped polygons in 1995 that become developed in

the future.

f. Isolated developable areas smaller than 2 acres (0.809 ha), i.e. are reclassiﬁed

g. Sliver areas created by overlay analysis: small polygons emerging during
overlay analysis because of boundary mismatch between the 1995 and future
land use maps. Polygons with areas smaller than 2 acres (0.809 ha) are
treated as slivers and reclassiﬁed as no change areas.

h. Uncertain change areas: developed polygons in 1995 change to undeveloped
in the future. Because this type of land-use transition is less likely to occur,
we treated polygons with this transition pattern as no change area.

Future land cover was simulated in polygons identiﬁed as intensiﬁed urban,
developable, or rural change areas. Remaining portions of the future land-cover
map are based on land cover simulated from the 1995 land-use/cover map. Land
cover was simulated within the change areas using the classiﬁcation of future land
use and identical land-cover proportions and spatial rules as those used in the
original simulation based on the 1995 land-use map. Land cover was simulated at
30 m resolution to match the resolution of available digital elevation data, which,
together with land-cover data, can be used as input to hydrological models. The
application of the same translation table to both recent (i.e. 1995) and future (i.e.

Downloaded by [Northeastern University] at 11:10 09 October 2014 Translation from land use to land cover

49

based on community master plans) land use generates a land-cover scenario under
the assumption that future patterns of land cover, relative to land-use patterns, will
mimic current, observed patterns. In addition to presenting the results of applying
such a scenario below, we discuss alternative approaches to applying semantic
translation.

5. Results
5.1. Calibrated relationships between land use and land cover

The proportions of each land-cover type within the 1995 land-use types (table 3)
are derived from those observed on the sampled and classiﬁed north 1998 aerial
photograph. Because roads are usually lumped with the other land-use types, except
in the case of the larger roads that are included in the urban class, all land uses have
some degree of impervious cover. The exceptions are water and wetland, which we
assumed for this demonstration to be both uniform in land cover and unchanging.
Impervious was most evident in the urban and high-density residential classes,
followed by barren and low-density residential classes. The percent impervious in
the barren class may be artiﬁcially high, due to a tendency within many remotely
sensed classiﬁcations to confuse impervious with bare soil. Although we manually
edited the land-cover image to correct the most obvious areas of confusion, there
may still remain some confusion.

Tree cover was highest (about 50%) in the forested natural class, followed by the
non-forested natural class. Because of openings, forest management, and other
activities in forested area, other cover types (especially herbaceous and soil) were
also fairly common in the forested land-use class. All other land-use classes had
between about 11 and 18% trees. Herbaceous was most common in the agriculture,
residential, and non-forested natural land-use classes, where it was the dominant
cover type. The herbaceous cover type included crops, which explains the high
(55%) proportion in agricultural land use. The second most common cover type in
the agriculture class was bare soil, likely reﬂecting the early date of the sampled
aerial photographs (April). All land-use classes had greater than 30% herbaceous
cover, reﬂecting the relatively inclusive nature of this category. This empirical
approach to determining land-cover proportions within each land-use type (i.e.
using remote sensing) is a reasonable way to reproduce the actual relationships.
However, it relies on the assumption that the north photographs selected for this
purpose are representative of the land-cover proportions within land-use classes of
the south site and throughout the entire county. There is some reason to believe
that land-cover proportions in a given land-use class (e.g. low-density residential)
will vary depending on the age of the development represented. Because of this
variability and because the areas of some of the classes (e.g. high-density residential

and barren) were relatively small (i.e. v4%) in the northern photo (table 4), the
parameters estimated for these land-use types might not be universal. The simulated
land-cover proportions had relatively high levels of disagreement in the land-use
types that were more rare (tables 3 and 5). The translation table could also be
created using best-guess estimates of land-cover proportions or by developing target
land-cover proportions based on landscape design principles.

5.2. Calibrated spatial arrangement of land cover

The relationships between the distance to landscape features (i.e. water, wetland,
roads) and land-cover proportions, based on analysis of the classiﬁed aerial
photographs, provided an indication of the spatial arrangement of land covers
within each land-use type (ﬁgure 6). The most consistent patterns in ﬁgure 6 were
interpreted to identify the conditions under which a land-cover class was more or
less common near the landscape features than at locations that are further away.
We used these observed relationships to guide the reorganization of land-cover
types within each land-use polygon and to create a simulated land-cover map with
patterns that mimic, as closely as possible, those observed in the classiﬁed aerial
photographs. The outcome is a set of spatial proximity rules that provides guidance
for which land-cover types to rearrange in relation to which landscape features. Our
goal for the stochastic spatial simulation was to generate land covers with distance
functions, for those situations, that were as nearly similar as possible to those in
ﬁgure 6.

A mask of wetland and no-data land-use categories was superimposed on the
observed 1998 land-cover map.

5.3. Validation

One set of maps resulting from the simulation is shown in ﬁgure 7. High-density
residential and barren land-use types were excluded from the analysis because their
areas were too small to produce meaningful and general spatial proximity patterns.
Also, because there were no noticeable spatial proximity effects to water in
agricultural use and to wetland in forest use, we did not adjust them for proximity
effects and excluded them from the validation.

The results show signiﬁcant improvements in the ﬁt of simulated to observed
patterns for all calibrated spatial proximity rules in the northern site (table 6),
indicating that including these proximity parameters signiﬁcantly improved the
similarity of the simulated maps with the observed maps. On average, there were
47% and 36% reductions of SMAE and ME for land-cover types adjusted for
spatial proximity effects in a simulated map. Although ME is designed to measure
the offsets of the proximity graphs, instead of their similarity, the result suggests
improvement of MEs in all cases.

When applying the same set of parameters for the south site for validation, we
found that only six out of 13 proximity parameters produced signiﬁcantly smaller
SMAEs, and nine produced signiﬁcantly smaller MEs (table 7, ﬁgure 8). Those cases
that did not represent signiﬁcant improvements in the proximity relationships for
the south site were cases where (1) the land-cover proportions within land-use types
were noticeably different from those deﬁned in the translation table, e.g. in forest
use, or (2) the areas for effective swapping to reproduce spatial proximity effects
were too small, e.g. distance to water and wetland in urban use, seeing that urban
use was rarely right next to either water or wetland in the south site. This suggests
future improvements to the approach and the indices used in assessing the goodness
of ﬁt of spatial proximity graphs.

5.4. Future land-use scenario

By generating a future land-cover map on the basis of the land-use scenario
determined by the community master plans, we were able to compare current and
future maps that are semantically identical and improve our ability to evaluate the
implications of the scenario. The recent (ﬁgure 9A) and future (ﬁgure 9B) land-cover
simulations follow the same semantic translation table (table 3) and spatial
proximity rules (table 8). The future land-cover scenario makes a number of

*Distance refers to the effective proximity distance of land cover to landscape features in
different land-use types (cell size~30 m). Target proportion indicates the percentage of the
cover type expected within the effective proximity distance. Land-cover types listed in the
ﬁxed land cover were not swapped when applying that rule.

assumptions about future land-cover patterns. First, it assumes that land covers will
be distributed among land-use types in the same proportion as the average
distribution observed currently. Therefore, it does not take account of changing
regulations or landowner preferences that might lead to changes in cover-type (e.g.
decreases in impervious cover among residential uses). Second, the simulation
assumes that the future land-cover types will be distributed relative to proximity to
three landscape features (i.e. roads, water, and wetlands) in the same way that they
are currently. Therefore, no changes in setbacks of impervious cover, for example,
are assumed. Finally, the simulation assumes that parcels that do not change land
use also have unchanged land cover. Therefore, the simulation does not take
account of any natural changes in vegetation cover, e.g. regrowth of forest on
unforested areas.

The assumptions described above simplify our implementation of the scenario
presented in ﬁgure 9, which is presented to illustrate the potential application of the
semantic translation approach, but are not necessary limitations of the approach
presented. In fact, because the simulation approach requires explicit rules about the
semantic and spatial aspects of the land-cover types within each land-use type, these
rules can be changed to reﬂect alternative development scenarios, even within
the same build-out scenario (e.g. ﬁgure 5). Land-cover proportions could be
changed to evaluate, for example, the effects of allowing less impervious cover in
certain land-use types. Spatial rules could be changed to reﬂect alternative spatial
conﬁgurations within certain land-use types, e.g. for cluster development or riparian
habitat protection or setback legislation. Of course, the future land-use plan could

also be modiﬁed with the same land-cover rules to evaluate the implications of
alternative land-use plans.

6. Discussion and conclusions

Because land-use information that represents either historical,

i.e. based on
data, or possible future conditions, i.e. based on models or plans, does not directly
address physical landscape conditions, we have argued that land-use information
should be converted to land cover prior to ecological or environmental assessment
based on that information. Successful implementation of this conversion, termed
semantic translation, improves the operational basis for collaboration between the
social and natural sciences. The outputs from land-use models and plans, which
forecast future land-use patterns that cannot be observed, can be used as inputs to
biophysical models, thus incorporating possible future human modiﬁcation of the
environment into ecological and environmental assessments. We recognize that
some information about human impact on the land, e.g. land-management practices
with fertilizers and pesticides, may be best represented using land-use data.
However, this information might be most proﬁtably used in combination with
spatial land-cover information generated through semantic translation.

the approach is that

We have described an approach to semantic translation that uses stochastic
it requires little
spatial simulation. An advantage of
information to generate plausible land-cover patterns on the basis of input land-
use data. Information about the land-cover proportions within each land-use type
and the spatial pattern and arrangement of the land-cover types can be speciﬁed to
land cover with those properties. The potential utility of
produce maps of
translating category deﬁnitions is not just limited to the translation of land-cover
and land-use categories. It could be used to translate any category deﬁnitions as
long as they are geographically and semantically correlated. However, in different
the translator might apply different rules and descriptions of spatial
cases,
characteristics.

An obvious limitation of the approach is that the results represent only possible
land-cover patterns and cannot be construed as true maps of the landscape. For
this reason, application of simulation for semantic translation should involve
generation of multiple realizations of the simulated landscape. Each realization will
be different, because the initial placement of land-cover types is made at random,
and cells selected for swapping in the application of the spatial constraints are
drawn at random. By generating multiple realizations, a range of possible
landscapes can be evaluated for ecological or environmental impact. This should
provide information about the distribution of possible effects, rather than a single
value assessment of impact. A further limitation is that the simulations are only as
good as the translation table and spatial rules used to generate them.

We used aerial photos to generate observed relationships between land use and
land cover and performed a validation to assess the ﬁt of the simulated land-cover
patterns to those observed in a landscape that was not used in establishing the rules.
In general, the rules worked well for the land-use types that had sufﬁcient area in
the calibration (i.e. northern) site. Applying the spatial rules improved the ﬁt of
distance-proportion relationships signiﬁcantly over the random map.

This paper demonstrates application of only one set of spatial constraints to the
simulated land-cover pattern, i.e. distance functions relative to landscape features.

Given the importance of patch sizes in landscape ecology theory, it will be worth
while also to develop an approach to optimizing the ﬁt between the observed and
simulated distribution of land-cover patch sizes.

Although we mentioned that it is possible to incorporate multiple sets of
translation semantics in the translation, critical issues arise in how to calibrate the
translation rules. Intuitively, jurisdictional variations can affect the relationships
between land use and land cover. Other research has shown that soil types can also
affect land-cover arrangements (LaGro 1998). Thus, a set of translation semantics
calibrated in one area might not be appropriate for use in another area, unless
the major factors that affect translation semantics are equal in both areas. If the
translation semantics are not constant, a sophisticated scheme involving the
partition of study area to allow separate calibration of the translation rules is
necessary.

In our demonstration project, we were able to generate comparable land-cover
maps, based on the application of the same translation table and spatial rules to
land-cover
both the recent and future land-use maps. The relationships of
proportions with distance to several
landscape features (i.e. roads, water, and
wetlands) were generally well reproduced using the stochastic spatial simulation
approach, thereby arranging land-cover types reasonably across the landscape. In
future work, we will be developing alternative translation rules to evaluate the
effects of alternative landscape design approaches, within the same land-use
patterns.

The  trajectory  reconstruction  from 
a  collection  of  anonymized  spatio-
temporal  locations  is  a  challenging 
process.  Focusing  on  the  application

example is shown in Figure 1. The prob-
lem of trajectory reconstruction could be
repaired by several sophisticated methods
already  available  in  the  domain  of 
Blackman  and  Popoli
tracking  systems  [
1999]. On the other hand, vessel proper-
ties (e.g., maximum velocity, maneuvering
limitations)  and  their  interaction  with
the environment (e.g., a trajectory should
never cross an island; departure and des-
tination  is  always  a  sea  port)  introduce 
some

useful  in  the  trajectory  reconstruction
process.

This paper examines various anony-
mization  scenarios  in  the  domain  of 
vessel  trajectories  and  introduces  an 
algorithm  that  applies  semantic  knowl-
edge 
from
anonymized  mobility  datasets.  Sec-

describes  the  anonymization  scenar-
ios,  while  Section  4  introduces  the 
basic concepts  of  the  algorithm.
Finally,  Section  5  will  conclude  the
discussion.

1. Introduction 

With rapid developments in mobile
positioning  technologies,  a  series of
new  applications  (e.g.,  fleet  manage-
ment systems, location based services)
have  emerged,  which  produce  vast
amounts  of  spatiotemporal  (mobility)

data  [
Raw  mobility  data  typically  include 
the  spatio-temporal  locations  of  either 
concrete objects (e.g., humans, vehicles,
animals and goods) or abstract concepts
(e.g.,  spreading  diseases).  One  typical
process, in the preparation of mobility
trajectory recon-
data collections, is the 
struction

2012], which
generates the trajectories of those indi-
vidual objects.

Mobility  data  collections  may  be
identification  information
of
missing 
moving  objects  and  there  are  various
reasons for this to occur: (a) the sensor
may not be recording moving objects
(e.g.,  mobility  data  extracted  from
remote  sensing  images,  detection  of
cars  on  highway  images);  (b)  the
objects may not be releasing this type
of information (e.g., vehicles or vessels
report  anonymously  their  location  in
space-time); or (c) although recorded,
information  might  be  removed  to
assure privacy. 

Understandably,  when  identifica-
tion information is missing, the trajec-
tory  reconstruction  (i.e.,  the  grouping
of points describing the movement of
a single object to form a trajectory) is
not straightforward or even feasible. A
collection  of  mobility  data  that  lacks
identification  information  is  called
anonymized

.

The following three

datasets:

scenarios

Scenario 1

Scenario  2

: The vessel identifier is
removed. In this scenario, the MMSI is
not available. The records still contain
all the other fields shown in Figure 3b. 
:  The  vessel  identifier
as well as the vessel type is removed.
Hence,  both  MMSI  and  SHIPTYPE
are  hidden.  In  this  scenario,  only  the
locational  and  movement  properties
(speed and heading) in time of the ves-
sel are available.
Scenario  3

:  All  fields  except  the
locational  data  of  the  vessels  in  time
are removed. In this scenario, only the
fields  LON,  LAT  and  TIMESTAMP
are  available.  Hence,  the  dataset  con-

description.

4. Trajectory 
Reconstruction 
Algorithm

The  trajectory  reconstruction  algo-
rithm  applies  the  following  concept:
starting from a single record, represent-
ing  the  spatio-temporal  location  of  a 
vessel, the algorithm tries to find, ideally,
the next spatio-temporal location of the
same vessel or locations that qualify, based
.  This  is  accom-
on  a  set  of 
steps
plished through the following 

constraints

:

1) Starting  from  a  spatio-temporal 
location  STo,  that  describes  the 
location  So,  of  a  vessel  v  at  time, 
To,  all  posterior  spatio-temporal 
locations  STi  (i=1…  N)  in  the 
dataset  within  a  distance,  d  from 
So and time interval, t after To, are 
retrieved.  The  values  of  the  para

meters  d, 
advance,  based  on  the  AIS  speci-
fications.  Depending  on 
the 
anonymization  scenario,  the  STi 
locations  are  filtered  further  to 

t  are  specified 

meet additional conditions. Speci-
fically,  in  Scenario  1,  only  the 
STi locations/records with a ship 
type (SHIPTYPE) amount to one 
of STo that are considered. How-
ever,  this  does  not  apply  to 
Scenario 2 or 3.

2) After  the  set  STi  is  found,  the 
con-
algorithm applies a series of 
straints

to eliminate all irrelevant 
records.  Examples  are  these  are: 
(a) maximum speed, (b) violation 
of topological relations and (c) ves-
sel  maneuvering  (see  below  for 
further details). 

3) The  process  is  repeated  for  the 
remaining 
in  STi. 
locations 
Obviously, the algorithm will not 
always  provide  a  solution  to  the 
trajectory  reconstruction  problem,
unless  the  constraints  in  Step  2 
are able to result in a single loca-
tion  or  a  small  number  of 
locations.  In  regards  to  the  latter 
case,  some  of  the  locations  will 
be eliminated in subsequent itera-
tions as they lead to a stalemate.

and  a  point  k  in  STi  is  greater  than 
the  product  of  the  maximum  speed

as  Vmax  (Tk-To),  then  STk  must  be

considered as well. A vessel, especial-
ly a large one (e.g., tanker), is not very
flexible  in  changing  directions.  This
can be seen in the simplified example

(speed  and  heading)  in  STo  and  the
potential  successors,  are  considered  by
the  algorithm,  whenever  available  (e.g.,
in  Scenarios  1  and  2).  For  example,  a
vessel heading west with a high speed is
not likely to head east shortly thereafter.

constraints

This  paper  discusses  an  ongoing
research  in  the  trajectory  reconstruction
of  anonymized  vessel  spatio-temporal
anonymization
locations.  Obviously,  the 
scenario
and the 

applied dur-
ing  the  reconstruction  are  critical.  An
algorithm  has  thus  been  developed  and
tested  for  a  small  set  of  historical
records,  collected  by  MarineTraffic  in
the  Aegean  Sea  over  the  summer  of
2012. 

Current  research  is  focusing  on  the
development of sophisticated constraints
that  can  lead  to  a  more  narrow  set  of
points  in  Step  2  of  the  algorithm.
Extensive  experimental  tests  on  the  his-
torical  records  are  being  performed  to
assess  and  improve  the  efficiency  of
these  constraints.  Future  plans  include
the  development  of  appropriate  index
mechanisms  to  accelerate  the  perform-
ance of the algorithm for large datasets.

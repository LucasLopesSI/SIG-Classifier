A generalized conceptual framework for regional carrying capacity evaluation along with
its implementation approaches is introduced in this article, demonstrated by the case
study in the Yangtze River Delta region, China. Following the data preprocessing,
assimilative capacity, supportive capacity, and loading, the three essential aspects of
regional carrying capacity, have been evaluated by principal components analysis and/or
ecological footprint method. In terms of the characteristics of the results, sustainability
criteria are established and used to determine the developmental states from 1997 to 2005
in the study area. Future states from 2006 to 2015 are predicted by a modified cellular
automata model, into which an artificial neural network is incorporated to fit the transi-
tion rule. As revealed from the results of evaluation and prediction, the overall develop-
mental states are worsening. For the sake of the sustainable development in this region,
more attention should be paid to these results.

Introduction

Since Malthus (1798) expressed concerns on population growth versus food supply, numer-
ous researches have been dedicated to planning sustainable development in terms of carrying
capacity. Due to various aims and conditions, different definitions of carrying capacity and
evaluation methods have been brought forward, such as ecological footprint method (EFM)
for ecological carrying capacity evaluation (Rees 1990, 1992, 2000), tourism carrying
capacity evaluation in terms of the maximum visitors that can be tolerated environmentally
(Mathieson and Wall 1982), livestock carrying capacity evaluation for range management
(Thapa and Paudel 2000, Burke 2004), water resource carrying capacity evaluation (Edward
2000, Feng et al. 2008), and agricultural carrying capacity regarding the ecological dete-
rioration associated with the yield growth of major cereal crops in agriculture (Harris and
Kennedy 1999). All these studies illustrate that carrying capacity evaluation is essential for
sustainable development planning, and therefore for ecosystem integrity and human
survival.

Yu (2000), Mao and Yu (2001), and Yu and Mao (2002) extended the concept of carrying
capacity and used representative economic indicators to evaluate regional carrying capacity
(RCC). In this contribution, we present an evolved conceptual framework of RCC evaluation
and its implementation approaches, aiming at providing comprehensive evaluation on
ecosystem’s carrying capacity of socio-economic activities and therefore helpful revelations
about sustainability for policy makers. Demonstrations are done by a case study in the
Yangtze River Delta region, the most important economic complex in China. With the aid of
geographic information system (GIS), spatio-temporal evolutionary features are incorpo-
rated into the evaluation. Moreover, the artificial neural network (ANN)-based cellular
automata (CA) model (Li and Yeh 2000) is, for the first time, applied to RCC evaluation
to predict future developmental states.

2. Concept of regional carrying capacity
Originally, carrying capacity is defined, for biological species, as the maximum population
of the species that is able to sustain in a long term, in a given habitat with limited food,
light, water, and other necessities, without impairing its productivity (Khanna et al. 1999,
Yue et al. 2008). RCC, according to Yu (2000) and Yu and Mao (2002), is defined as the
magnitude of human population and their socio-economical activities that can be supported
by the limited resources without deteriorating the ecological environment in a predictable
time span, within a confined region. As referred to previous researches (e.g., Khanna et al.
1999), elements for RCC evaluation composed of supportive capacity, assimilative capacity,
and socio-economic ‘loading,’ and their inherent relationships are delineated in Figure 1.

Supportive capacity depends on resource reserves and can be complemented by allocat-
ing resources. From a socio-economic point of view, resources consist of natural and human
resources (Khanna et al. 1999), both of which are exchangeable inside a regional system or
among systems. The ability to communicate resources, which is presumed to import lack and
export surplus, is referred to as resources allocation ability. The transportation ability and the
governmental allocation policy are two key factors regarding the resources allocation ability
(van den Bergh and Verbruggen 1999).

Assimilative capacity is the maximum pollutant discharge that can be endured by the
environment without affecting its natural functions and is determined by the ability to dilute,
disperse, and remove pollutants by natural processes. Climate properties, such as wind and
precipitation, and physico-chemical properties of pollutants receptors, for example air,
water, and land, are critical factors for the natural processes (Khanna et al. 1999).

Loading represents the magnitude of overall socio-economic activities that are operating
on a regional system (Khanna et al. 1999). In other words, it represents the pressure exerted
by the socio-economic activities on the regional system.

Besides, the impacts of technology progress should be considered, because it is a

positive factor in improving efficiency of utilizing resources and energy.

Study on RCC aims to evaluate regional sustainability and direct developmental planning.
In a regional system, the ideal developmental state is to attain a trade-off between loading and
carrying capacity, the latter of which depends on the combination of supportive capacity and
assimilative capacity. Hereby, the sustainability criterion can be given as follows: if loading
exceeds carrying capacity (overloading), the regional system is developing in an unsustainable
state; otherwise (non-overloading), the regional system is in a sustainable state. According to
specific developmental state, policy makers should design corresponding developmental
strategy, which aims at rationally exploiting resources, enhancing or, at least, not declining
quality of human life, and avoiding deterioration of environmental integrity.

Via the aforementioned conceptual framework and referring to previous researches
(Mao and Yu 2001, Yu and Mao 2002, Zeng et al. 2006), a systemic indicator system for
RCC evaluation has been constructed and is presented in Table 1. Data of these indicators in the
study area have been collected and processed using ecological and statistical methods based on
GIS, and the detailed data processing procedures will be introduced in the following sections.

3. Methodology
This section introduces methods used in this research, for evaluating historical/current
situations and predicting future states. The general conceptual diagram, illustrating all
involved processes and their interrelationships, is shown in Figure 2.

3.1. Methods for evaluation

3.1.1. Ecological footprint method

Ecological footprint method (EFM) has been applied worldwide to estimate the sustain-
ability of development by comparing human’s demand on ecosystem (i.e., ecological
footprint) with the biocapacity (i.e., natural capital) that can be regenerated by productive
land (Rees 1990, 1992, 2000, Wackernagel and Rees 1997, Monfreda et al. 2004).

Even though EFM does not cover factors related to socio-economic activities compre-
hensively but mainly in the ecological aspect, which is the main point that has been under
criticism (e.g., van den Bergh and Verbruggen 1999), it is still the most popular method for
sustainability assessment. In this article, biocapacity calculated upon the EFM is an impor-
tant indicator to reflect supportive capacity (Table 1). Besides, the ecological footprint is one
of the indicators in the loading class (Table 1).

3.1.2. Principal components analysis

For evaluation of assimilative capacity and loading, data sets of the corresponding indicator
class or subclass need to be integrated to reflect the overall state. On this purpose, principal

components analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe 2002), a common statistical method for integrating multi-
variable data, is adopted (Bi and Zhang 2005, Zeng et al. 2006). PCA is designed to reduce the
dimension of data set by replacing with fewer principal components and has been successfully
applied in environmental and ecological indicator integration (e.g., Berg et al. 1994, Yu et al.
1998, Jollands et al. 2004). Even though ,80% accumulative proportions of variances are
generally used as the criterion to choose lower-order principal components, the criterion may
vary according to actual data characteristics of specific studies (e.g., Yu et al. 1998, Massolo et al.
2009).

3.2. Method for simulation and prediction – ANN-based cellular automata model
Cellular automata (CA) is a model suitable for simulating and predicting the evolution of
complex system (Luo 2004, Guan et al. 2005). With its five essential elements, namely
state, space, time step, neighborhood, and rule (van Vliet et al. 2009), configured appro-
priately, the CA model has been demonstrated to be applicable for simulating geographic
phenomena and ecological evolution, such as urban expansion (e.g., Li and Yeh 2000,
White and Engelen 2000, Guan et al. 2005), forest fire behavior (e.g., Karafyllidis and
Thanailakis 1997, Yassemi et al. 2008), and vegetation dynamics (e.g., Balzter et al. 1998,
Colasanti et al. 2007). Among the elements of a CA model, the transition rule is the kernel,
which is difficult and time-consuming to determine, and even more difficult for complex
systems such as ecosystem. As a solution, the ANN has been incorporated into the CA
model (so-called ANN-based CA model) to obtain the parameters of the transition rule
automatically (Li and Yeh 2000, Guan et al. 2005, Zeng et al. 2006) (Figure 3). Herein,
historical data are inputted to train the ANN until the training goal, in terms of training
error, is met, and the consequent ANN can represent a multivariable function f1 to serve as
the transition rule:

f1 : Stþ1

i ¼ f1 St

i ; St

N; At

i; At

where St
t, At

i is the state of cell i at time t, St
i the attribute aggregate of cells, and At

N the state aggregate of neighborhood cells at time
N the attribute aggregate of neighborhood cells.

the dashed box illustrates how to acquire the transition rule through training process of ANN and the
lower part shows the simulation/prediction process of CA. The denotations have the same meanings as
in Equation (1), and what should be pointed out is that t0 means historical time step for ANN training,
whereas t the time steps for prediction and can be both historical and future time steps.

The ANN-based CA model, which takes advantage of ANN’s ability in dealing with
nonlinear and complex system, can calibrate the relevant parameters without heavy comput-
ing overhead and subjective inference and fit the transition rule to be consistent with the
actual ongoing trend.

3.3. Database and preprocessing
The Yangtze River Delta region is located in the middle of China’s eastern coast and comprises
Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang provinces, from north to south, in a broad sense. It is one of the
most important economic complexes in China and encompasses more than 20% of the national
economy. As the economic development spreads out, Fujian province, which is located to the
south of the Yangtze River Delta, has been influenced substantially and is becoming an important
backup area for the Yangtze River Delta economic region. Hence, Fujian province is also
included in this research. The boundary of the study area is marked by the white line in Figure 4b.
According to the indicator system (Table 1), a database is constructed for the area of

interest. Data sources and original formats are also listed.

As the raw data do not have the same resolution, a meshing operation (Zeng et al. 2006),
which aims at unifying the resolution of all indicators, has been performed before further
procedures. First, the study area is meshed into cells with the dimension of 20 km · 20 km,
upon which a base map with 991 cells is generated (Figure 4b). The dimension of
20 km · 20 km is chosen for each cell which is approximately the intermediate resolution
of all raw data. More specifically, the raster data possess much higher resolution as
1 km · 1 km. As opposed, available data of the economic indicators are annual statistical
data of cities, which can be linked to city polygons as attributes using the common GIS
function, and their resolutions are represented by city areas that are on the order of
100 km · 100 km or more. Because no urban–rural differentiation is available in the

original statistical data, 20 km · 20 km is a rather feasible unified resolution. For raster data,
such as cropland proportion, arithmetic average of all 400 pixels falling within a cell is
calculated during meshing (Figure 4). On the contrary, meshing polygonal vector is con-
ducted by calculating weighted average, for which the normalized area of every polygon
overlapping a cell is used as the polygon’s weight. Exceptions are railway line density and
road line density, whose original format is linear vector, and the cell’s values calculated as
the summed lengths of all line segments falling within a cell. Thereby, all data are trans-
formed into the same resolution at 20 km · 20 km, which is necessary for further analysis
such as PCA and the ANN-based CA modeling. Cells resulting from the meshing operation
are regarded as samples or observations, and indicators as variables.

In this article, spatial analyses, database construction, and geographic visualizations are
performed on GIS via the Arcgis/Info software, and statistical analyses and the ANN-based
CA model are implemented on Matlab of Mathworks, Inc (founded in 1984 and head-
quartered in Natick, Massachusetts).

4.1. Carrying capacity evaluation

Only spatial distributional characteristics are considered for the carrying capacity evaluation.
In other words, temporal changes of the carrying capacity are not taken into account in this
research. This is owing to the following reasons: (1) some of the data, that is wind velocity

178

J.-P. Chen et al.

and precipitation amount, are the mean value of the past tens of years; and (2) the other data,
for example hydrogeological characteristics, barely change in the studied period, especially
for the data with the resolution at 20 km · 20 km. Therefore, the evaluated carrying capacity
is regarded to be constant during the studied period.

Supportive capacity evaluation

4.1.1.
Biocapacity is considered as the main indicator to reflect supportive capacity. It is calculated,
according to EFM, via the formula (Monfreda et al. 2004)

EC ¼ N (cid:2) ec ¼

rjSjyj

ðj ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; 5Þ

(2)

n
X

j¼1

where EC denotes biocapacity, ec the biocapacity per capita, N the population; Sj the area of
land category j, rj the equivalence factor of land category j, and yj the yield factor.

The equivalence factors and yield factors are quoted from Monfreda et al.(2004). With
reference to the conventional EFM (Rees 1992), five land categories, comprising cropland,
woodland, grassland, fishery, and built-up land, are counted in the calculation. With
proportion of each category derived from the meshing operation, the area can be simply
calculated by multiplying the proportion with the area of a cell, that is 400 km2. The
geographical distributional characteristics of biocapacity are shown in Figure 5a, in which
the brighter cell indicates greater biocapacity. The general pattern of biocapacity distribution
indicates the northern part of the Yangtze River Delta region, which covers Jiangsu,
Shanghai, and northern Zhejiang, has higher value and thus better support for development.
The line densities of highway and railway are summed up to estimate the transportation
ability, which can, to some extent, represent the allocation ability (Figure 5b). The cells
covering Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou have apparently high transportation ability and
should have advantages of resource circulation and thus a better supply of resources.

In all, the central part of the Yangtze River Delta region possesses high biocapacity and
transportation ability, and thus high availability of recourses that are essential for develop-
ment. The northern part, mainly in Jiangsu province, with higher biocapacity, can act as the
bio-resource supplier of the central part.

4.1.2. Assimilative capacity evaluation
Assimilative capacity is evaluated by integrating relevant indicators via the PCA method.
According to the assimilative capacity subclass (Table 1), a 991 · 6 matrix, formed from the
six indicators of the 991 cells within the study area, is used for the assimilative capacity
evaluation. First, each column is standardized by dividing its standard deviation, to eliminate
the influence of different units of the indicators (Yu et al. 1998, Zhao 2004). Afterward, the
991 · 6 matrix is transformed, in terms of the PCA method, into a new matrix, which has the
same dimension and consists of six PCs as columns. Table 2 presents the eigenvalues
(variances) and Table 3 the eigenvectors.

With respect to pertinent natural processes, high values on the first five indicators,
consisting of wind velocity, precipitation amount, surface water proportion, woodland
proportion, and grassland proportion, should be favorable for the assimilation of pollution
(Khanna et al. 1999) and, thus, indicate high assimilative capacity. Because of lack of
quantitative relationship of the sixth indicator, hydrogeology, with pollution assimilation,

the abundance of groundwater is used to weight the indicator and is considered as positively
correlated with assimilative capacity too.

Table 3 shows that the first principal component ACPRIN1, which accounts for 40.8% of
the total variances, has high positive coefficients on wind velocity and woodland proportion
(area) and is favorable for dispersion of air pollutants and absorption of carbon dioxide.
ACPRIN1 represents the assimilative capacity of air pollution. In Figure 6a, which shows
the spatial distributional pattern of ACPRIN1, high scores locate in the south of the study
area in Fujian province and southern Zhejiang province.

The second principal component ACPRIN2 has high positive coefficients on surface
water proportion and hydrogeology and is in favor of dilution and dispersion of water
pollution. ACPRIN2 represents the assimilative capacity of water pollution, whose spatial
distribution is presented in Figure 6b. It shows the high scored cells are spreading out and
blended with the low scores, over the study area.

Figure 6. Assimilative capacity of the Yangtze River Delta region. (a) and (b) show the distributional
patterns of ACPRIN1 and ACPRIN2, respectively. The gray scale represents relative value and brighter
cells have greater assimilative capacity.

Four coefficients of the third principal component ACPRIN3 are negative, whereas the
rest two are positive but small (Table 3), therefore, no apparent indication of assimilative
capacity can be inferred from ACPRIN3, which is not retained for the analysis. Thus, just
ACPRIN1 and ACPRIN2 are analyzed, although their accumulative variance contribution is
64.1%.

4.2. Loading and developmental state evaluation

4.2.1. Loading evaluation

Loading, which reflects the magnitude of pressure exerted on the regional system by socio-
economic activities, is also evaluated by the PCA method. All 14 indicators of the loading
class are considered positively correlated with loading, and the raw data are mainly annual

statistical data from 1997 to 2005 (so-called time series data) (Table 1). Herein, each sample
corresponds to a ‘cell’ with data set of the 14 indicators in each year, and each year has 991
samples. Accordingly, the input matrix with the dimension of 8919 · 14 for PCA is
generated. The data are processed together rather than year by year to preserve the compar-
ability of data from different years after the transformation (e.g., Berg et al. 1994); in other
words, the effect of sampling year is neglected (Massolo et al. 2009).

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors that resulted from PCA are shown in Tables 4 and 5,
respectively. The first principal component LPRIN1 accounts for 60.2% of the total variance
(Table 4) and 12 indicators out of the 14 have positive coefficients (Table 5). The mostly
positive coefficients of LPRIN1 and its high variance contribution suggest that LPRIN1
basically reflects the overall loading integrated from all aspects. LPRIN2 accounts for 10.5%
of the total variance (Table 4) and has high coefficients on liquid waste output, gaseous waste
output, and ecological footprint (Table 5). LPRIN3 accounts for 7.9% and has high coeffi-
cients on population growth rate, liquid waste output, and gaseous waste output. Thereby,
both LPRIN2 and LPRIN3 seem to mainly reflect the loading of waste outputs. In sum, the
three PCs account for almost 80% of the total variance. However, considering overall loading
rather than loading in specific aspects is preferred for further analysis; the score of LPRIN1 is
employed to represent the overall loading and LPRIN2 and LPRIN3 are not retained.

The loadings of 2000 and 2005 are exemplified in Figure 7. The triangle area connecting
Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou is generally the area with the greatest loading every year.
From 2000 to 2005, increase in loading is significant, especially in the central part of the
Yangtze River Delta region enclosing the triangle area. However, the west part of Fujian
province shows mild increase.

Sustainability criterion and development state

4.2.2.
The key of evaluating sustainability is to rationally determine the critical value among the
loading values that can represent the boundary separating overloading and non-overloading
states. However, as the loading values are integrated from the socio-economic indicators and
the indirect relationship – spatial
are not directly related to the carrying capacity,

have same loading value intervals corresponding to the same gray scale, and, thus, the temporal
variations of loading are also shown.

distributional similarities between the loading and the ecological deficit – is used to
determine the critical value.

The ecological deficit is calculated by ecological footprint subtracting biocapacity
(Monfreda et al. 2004). Negative ecological deficit means that biocapacity surpasses con-
sumption, or biocapacity surplus (Monfreda et al. 2004), and the exploitation of ecological
resources is sustainable. The cells with negative ecological deficit in 2000 and 2005 are
shown in Figure 8 in white, whereas the positive deficits are shown in gray and black.
Compared with the loading distribution in 2000 and 2005 (Figure 7), negative ecological
deficits are falling in the areas with the lowest magnitude of loading. In addition to 2000 and
2005, the other seven years all share the same character. The geographical superposition of
negative ecological deficit and low loading value demonstrates the feasibility of using the
ecological deficit as the sustainability criterion which is defined as follows: the cells with
negative or zero ecological deficit are regarded as non-overloading whereas those with
positive ecological deficit as overloading.

By putting together loading values of all overloading cells from all nine years, which are
separated from the non-overloading cells according to the sustainability criterion specified
above, and examining their statistical parameters (see the histogram in Figure 9), the
statistical characteristics are noticeable: (1) the overall distribution resembles logarithmic
normal distribution; and (2) most values are concentrating around the mean value near zero
except some larger values arranging from 6 to 28, which can be regarded as ‘outliers’ from
the perspective of statistics. Curve fitting of these data are executed to estimate the distribu-
tion feature, as shown in Figure 9. Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (Eadie et al. 1971) is
conducted to testify the goodness of the fitting and shows that it cannot be rejected under
the significance level of 0.05. The 95% quantile of the lognormal distribution, 5.2489,

separating continuously distributed data from those outliers, is taken as the lower limit of the
outliers. These outliers are classified as a group of cells with severe overloading state.

In summary, all cell samples in the 9 years are separated into non-overloading and
overloading states in terms of ecological deficit; according to the critical value 5.2489, the

overloading cells are further divided into normal overloading and severe overloading states.
The developmental states in 2000, 2004, and 2005 are shown in Figure 8. The Yangtze River
Delta region are mostly in overloading states, whereas the non-overloading cells only locate
in west side of Fujian province (Figure 8). The developmental state only varies weakly from
2000 to 2004 with slightly expanded severe overloading around Shanghai and Xiamen and
mildly shrinked non-overloading area. However, from 2004 to 2005, severe overloading
suddenly emerges in Nanjing and Wuxi of Jiangsu province. Overall, the temporal variation
reflects the tendency toward worse developmental state, although the non-overloading state
can keep its main territory.

4.3. Simulation and prediction

4.3.1. Model configuration
Four elements of the CA model, including space, state, time step, and neighborhood are
configured as follows. (1) Space, consisting of 991 cells, is shown by the base map in
Figure 4b, and each cell has the dimension of 20 km · 20 km. (2) Cell state can be one of the
three types of state aforementioned, that is non-overloading, normal overloading, and severe
overloading. (3) The time step is set as 1 year, which is compatible with the original
statistical data. (4) The Moore neighborhood (Chopard and Droz 2005), which comprises
eight square-shaped neighborhood cells around the central cell, is adopted here.

As introduced in Section 3.2, an ANN is used to learn the transition rule via training
historic data. In this case, a back-propagation (BP) network is chosen, and it is configured as
a two-layer network, with 15 inputs, a hidden layer with 10 neurons and an output layer with
4 neurons. To avoid over-fitting, the Bayesian regularization (Foresee and Hagan 1997,
Anctil et al. 2004, Anctil et al. 2009) has been incorporated into the training process. The
inputs and outputs are listed in Table 6. Except that the proportions of land categories
(I10–I14) are considered as constant, the rest varies with time.

During the training process, data of the 15 input variables from 1997 to 2003 and that of the
4 output variables from 1998 to 2004 are set as input and target, respectively. The data of 2005
are excluded from the training data set but used to compare with the predicted result in 2005
and to testify the effectiveness of the simulation. After over 10,000 times of calculation, the
training error reaches 0.001 (Figure 10), which is good enough for this study, and then the BP
network serves as a multivariable function to represent the transition rule of the CA model.

Table 6.

Input variables and output variables of ANN.

Inputs (value at time t)

Outputs (value at time t + 1)

I1*: state of cell
I2–I9: states of eight Moore neighborhood cells
I10: cropland proportion
I11: woodland proportion
I12: grassland proportion
I13: surface water proportion
I14: built-up proportion
I15: loading value

O1*: non-overloading
O2*: normal overloading
O3*: severe overloading
O4: loading value

Note: *As for inputs, only one variable (or neuron from the special term of ANN), I1, is used to represent the state,
and I1 denotes non-overloading, normal overloading, and severe overloading states as zero, one, and two,
respectively. In contrast, three boolean variables (neurons), that is O1, O2, and O3, are utilized to represent the
output state, and among outputs O1, O2, and O3 there is one and only one is real (equal to one), and the other two are
false (equal to zero).

4.3.2. Prediction
With the well-configured CA model, the prediction starts with inputting data of 2004, and
the outputs generate the predicted states and loading of 2005; then, the predicted data of
2005 are transformed into inputs for the CA model to predict the states and loading value of
2006. This process is iterated until 2015. The predicted states in 2005, 2006, 2010, and 2015
are shown in Figure 11.

Comparing the predicted states with the actual pattern in 2005 is used to validate the
prediction. First, correlation test (Guan et al. 2005) is performed. According to the

correlation test method (Guan et al. 2005), the larger the correlation coefficient between the
real data and the predicted data, the more credible the prediction. The correlation between the
predicted state (Figure 11a) and the real state (Figure 8c) in 2005 is 0.7816, which means a
relatively good prediction. Then, the cell-on-cell overlay method (Li and Yeh 2002, Liu et al.
2008), by making comparison at the exact location between the predicted and real states, is
conducted, and the result is shown in Table 7. The total accuracy is 94.65% and also
indicates good validity.

The prediction in 2005 attains the general trend toward worse developmental state.
However, by visual inspection, in the predicted state in 2005, the sudden change into severe
overloading state in Nanjing and Wuxi, which is the major feature of the variation from
2004 to 2005 in the real situation, has not shown up. As shown in Table 7, the prediction
accuracy of severe overloading state is only 51.85% and also reflects the deviation. This
deviation suggests that the simulation has not caught the main variation. However, the
predicted state in 2006 (Figure 11b) shows the above features that should have been shown
in the prediction in 2005 and justifies the deviation to some degree. The interpretation for
this deviation is that Nanjing and Wuxi are approaching severe overloading state, and the
increase in loading has accelerated in real situation and deviated slightly from the general
trend. Thus, the effectiveness of the simulation and prediction is verified.

From 2005 to 2015, according to the prediction (Figure 11), the conjunction area of
Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, and Hangzhou would turn into severe overloading
successively; the severe overloading state would then spread out to all the central part of
the Yangtze River Delta region. Moreover, Xiamen in Fujian and its surrounding area are
very likely to expand afterward. The non-overloading area, in contrast, would constantly
locate in the west side of Fujian province, mainly in Nanping and Sanming.

5. Discussion

This article introduces the integrated methods for RCC evaluation and prediction, which are
conducted by applying PCA, EFM, and the ANN-based CA model based on the spatial
analysis functions of GIS. The major purpose of study on RCC is to provide information
about the regional sustainability to help produce well-informed strategic planning and
natural resource management. The case study has demonstrated the effectiveness of the
RCC framework. Moreover, if the RCC evaluation and prediction are carried out periodi-
cally with updated data, it is capable of revealing information for sustainability monitoring
and evaluating strategic planning.

Based on the RCC concept (Yu 2000, Mao and Yu 2001, Yu and Mao 2002) and the
pertinent elements for RCC evaluation in a regional system (Figure 1; Khanna et al. 1999),

188

J.-P. Chen et al.

the practical approaches presented in this article have enhanced their applicability to realistic
study, as demonstrated by the case study. The RCC evaluation system links human activities
with environment, which makes it useful for raising public awareness about sustainability.
Especially when spatial information is incorporated with the aid of GIS, sustainability
information is not just restricted to be numeric but geographically presented with relatively
good resolution, and the management of resources or industries in a region can be better
planned or directed.

The essential elements of RCC, including supportive capacity, assimilative capacity, and
loading, are evaluated separately. This fashion facilitates further applications to any region
given the availability of data. Although an indicator system is proposed, no constraint is
imposed on the data type. Moreover, if more advanced technologies are available for data
integration and/or more accurate relationships are applicable to represent the respective RCC
elements, the RCC framework has good potential for future adaptation.

EFM is embedded in the evaluation process, supplemented with more socio-economic
indicators integrated by PCA. Therefore, more comprehensive evaluation results can be
acquired. For the prediction of future developmental state, the ANN-based CA model
generates good fits on ongoing tendency and predicts the overall worsening developmental
state in the study area. In the course, the ANN training is used to simulate the transition rule
that involves quite a few parameters, such as loading, developmental state, and land-use
information. The ANN illustrates its advantages on dealing with complex systems, but the
transition rule cannot be expressed explicitly. Thus, the intrinsic relationships among the
parameters, which are also important for sustainable planning, are not revealed. A refined
method that can explicitly determine the transition rule needs to be applied in future research.
The principle followed in the evaluation and prediction processes is data-driven, which is
proposed for further applications. However, compromises have been made in the case study,
mainly because of lack of data and quantitative relationships. The assimilation of pollution
involves rather complicated physico-chemical reactions, so statistical analyses regarding
abundance of receptors such as water and forest and simple atmospheric processes such as
wind velocity are far from enough to evaluate the overall assimilative capacity. Moreover,
for the determination of sustainability criteria, some subjective processes have been adopted,
and the utility would have been impaired. Even though the evaluation and prediction results
exemplified by the case study still show the usefulness of the RCC framework, if better data
and more sophisticated quantitative relationships are available, the RCC system can be
adapted to fit the realism better.

6. Conclusion
The RCC system introduced in this article, including the conceptual framework and the
operational approaches, provides a practical tool for regional sustainability evaluation and
development planning. The intrinsic links between human activities and environment implied
in the RCC framework can provoke public awareness about sustainability. As shown by the
case study in the Yangtze River Delta region, the results of the evaluation, from the aspects of
supportive capacity, assimilative capacity, and loading, can provide useful information for
regional sustainability assessment. Future developmental states are predicted by the ANN-
based CA model, which is demonstrated to be valid and effective for future applications. With
the aid of GIS, the evaluation and prediction results are revealed by more specific and detailed
illustrations with spatio-temporal information and good resolution. The geographic presenta-
tion of the results can be easily understood by the policy makers and therefore help produce
well-informed strategic planning and resource management.

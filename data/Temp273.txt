ABSTRACT
Time-geographic density estimation (TGDE) is a method of movement
pattern analysis that generates a continuous intensity surface from a
set of tracking data. TGDE has recently been proposed as a method of
animal home range estimation, where the goal is to delineate the
spatial extents that an animal occupies. This paper tests TGDE’s eﬀec-
tiveness as a home range estimator using simulated movement data.
First, an agent-based model is used to simulate tracking data under 16
movement scenarios representing a variety of animal life history traits
(habitat preferences, homing behaviour, mobility) and habitat conﬁg-
urations (levels of habitat fragmentation). Second, the accuracy of
TGDE is evaluated for four temporal sampling frequencies using
three adaptive velocity parameters for 30 sample data sets from
each scenario. Third, TGDE accuracy is compared to two other com-
mon home range estimation methods, kernel density estimation (KDE)
and characteristic hull polygons (CHP). The results demonstrate that
TGDE is the most eﬀective at estimating core areas, home ranges and
total areas at high sampling frequencies, while CHP performs better at
low sampling frequencies. KDE was ineﬀective across all scenarios
explored.

1. Introduction

Recent advances in animal tracking technologies, such as ARGOS satellite transmit-
ters (Amstrup et al. 2004, Costa et al. 2010), improved GPS transmitters (Gagliardo
et al. 2011) and wireless sensor networks (Juang et al. 2002), coupled with a marked
impetus towards greater data sharing through open-source platforms like Movebank
(www.movebank.org) and CRAWDAD (crawdad.org), have made animal tracking data
more accessible to researchers interested in studying movement (Kranstauber et al.
2011). This, in part, has contributed to recent innovations in computational move-
ment analysis, sometimes called movement pattern analysis (Dodge et al. 2008,
Long and Nelson 2013, Purves et al. 2014, Dodge et al. 2016). One of the recent
research trends in both computational movement analysis and animal ecology has
been the development of new ways to analyse tracking data towards better

understanding of animal space-use patterns (Long et al. 2014, Long and Nelson
2015), habitat usage (Downs et al. 2014) and interactions (Long 2015, Miller 2015).
One of the most common analyses performed on animal tracking data is home range
analysis. An individual animal’s home range is described as the spatial area it occupies
during its typical day-to-day activities (Worton 1987). The home range itself is a subset of
the total area occupied by the animal. The home range is most commonly deﬁned as the
smallest area containing 95% of the animal’s spatial activity. Core areas of more intense
activity are often similarly deﬁned as the minimum area containing 50% of that activity.
Although these particular percentages are somewhat arbitrary in nature – with other
benchmarks occasionally used – this approach remains the dominant way that home
ranges and core areas are deﬁned in practice. Regardless, home range analysis involves
estimating the size and delineating the boundary of one or more of these three spatial
extents. Accurately estimating total areas, home ranges and core areas is vital for
characterizing animal movement patterns and understanding species requirements for
conservation purposes.

One of the newest home range analysis methods that arose out of computational
movement analysis is time-geographic density estimation (TGDE, Downs 2010). TGDE
blends basic elements of time geography with statistical density estimation to produce a
continuous intensity surface from tracking data; core areas, home ranges and total areas
can be delineated with isopleths extracted from the resulting density surface. Though
TGDE shows promise for home range estimation (Downs et al. 2011), the accuracy of the
method has yet to be tested with trajectory-based data or systematically compared to
alternative approaches.

Existing home range estimators are usually tested using simulated animal locational
data that are used to deﬁne ‘known’ home ranges. Historically, animal locational data
were simulated using bivariate normal mixtures, Poisson clusters or other statistically
generated point patterns (e.g. Gitzen et al. 2006). The disadvantage of this approach is
that the locational data are not generated with explicit time stamps, meaning that
consecutive points in the data set are not modelled as trajectories, rendering the data
less representative of animal movements. Although not routinely used to test home
range estimators, correlated random walk (CRW) models provide an alternative method
for simulating animal tracking data. There are a variety of CRW models, such as those
based on Lévy and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, that generally simulate movement
based on statistical distributions of turning angles and step lengths (Miller 2012, Plank
et al. 2013, Breed et al. 2017). However, a criticism of this approach is that turn angles are
not always good predictors of animal movements (Nams 2013, Holloway and Miller
2014). This may be because habitat preferences and landscape conﬁguration play larger
roles in determining how animals move about space or because angles are an artefact of
sampling procedures (Plank and Codling 2009, Laube and Purves 2011).
Agent-based modelling oﬀers a third option simulating animal

locational data.
Agent-based models (ABMs) are routinely used in GIScience to simulate complex
geographical processes that involve movement of humans, vehicles, animals, goods
or other objects across space and time (Brown and Xie 2006, Benenson 2013). Some
recent examples include modelling evacuation behaviour (Tan et al. 2015), disease
diﬀusion (Mao and Bian 2011), urban dynamics (Vermeiren et al. 2016) and land use
planning (Ghavami et al. 2017). ABMs of animal movements have been developed to

simulate population dynamics (Morrison and Allen 2017), collective behaviour
(Murakami et al. 2017), inter-species interactions (Wallentin and Neuwirth 2017) and
other landscape-level processes (Bennett and Tang 2006). One advantage of using
ABMs to simulate animal movements is that they directly incorporate environmental
context, such as the composition and arrangement of habitat features, which have a
large inﬂuence on individual activity patterns (Tang and Bennett 2010, Anderson et al.
2017). Although ABMs are often used to model animal movements, animal tracking
data generated by ABMs have not been used to systematically test home range
estimators. Therefore, this research has three primary goals: (1) to develop a move-
ment-based approach to simulate realistic and varied animal tracking data, (2) to test
the accuracy of TGDE as a home range estimator using that data, and (3) to compare
the accuracy of TGDE to two other popular home range estimation approaches:
kernel density estimation (KDE) and characteristic hull polygons (CHP). The next
section provides a background on the computation of TGDE, KDE and CHP. Section
3 details an agent-based modelling approach to simulate animal tracking data with a
variety of spatial characteristics representing 16 scenarios, as well as the procedures
for applying and testing the home range estimators. Section 4 presents the results of
the tests, while Section 5 provides a discussion of the results and implication of the
ﬁndings.

2. Background

2.1. Time-geographic density estimation

TGDE, detailed by Downs (2010) and Downs et al. (2011), blends the fundamental elements
of time geography with statistical density estimation. TDGE is used to create a continuous
probability density surface for an animal or other moving object over time given a set of
temporally ordered tracking data. The technique operates in a manner comparable to KDE
(Silverman 1986) except instead of applying a kernel to each data point, a distance-
weighted geo-ellipse function is ﬁt to each consecutive pair of points in the tracking
sequence. The geo-ellipse maps all of the possible locations the animal could have visited
between two consecutive points, given their spatial coordinates and time stamps (Miller
2005). The size of the geo-ellipse is determined by the animal’s maximum velocity (speed,
sensu strictiore) which can be constant over the tracking duration (ﬁxed-velocity TGDE) or
can vary for each pair of points (adaptive-velocity TGDE). The adaptive-velocity version is
more suitable for home range estimation, as it allows a smaller velocity to be speciﬁed when
the animal is at rest and a larger one when it is actively moving. Mathematically, adaptive-
velocity TGDE can be formulated as:

where ^ftðxÞ is the time-geographic density estimate at any location x in a map, || is a
distance operator, n denotes the number of data points which are indexed consecu-
tively as i and j, t records the timestamp for a data point, v is the object’s maximum
velocity and G is a distance-weighted function of the geo-ellipse.

(cid:6)

In practice, locations x in a map occur as grid cells in a raster, where all calcula-
tions are performed at the cell’s centroid. The time-geographic density estimates,
^ftðxÞ, are calculated for each grid cell individually. First, the distance between track-
ing point i and the speciﬁed location x plus the distance from location x to the next
is calculated (x (cid:2) xi þ xj (cid:2) x). Then, this value is divided by the
tracking point j
maximum distance the animal could have travelled during the elapsed time, which
is calculated by multiplying the time diﬀerence by the object’s maximum velocity, or
(cid:5)
tj (cid:2) ti
vij. Next, this value is weighted according to the geo-ellipse function, G. The
geo-ellipse function must be a bounded distance-weighting operator, such as a
quartic, triangular, or clipped Gaussian function, which assigns higher values to
those closest to the shortest path between the two data points. The resulting
value is then multiplied by the amount of elapsed time,
, so that the density
assigned is relative to the amount of time between points. This process is repeated
for each pair of consecutive points in the data set, and the resulting values are
summed. The total is multiplied by 1 divided by n (cid:2) 1 geo-ellipses times the square
of the maximum possible travel distance; this converts the values to a mathematical
density. The maximum possible travel distance is calculated by summing the max-

imum distance values for each pair of points, that is,

vij. The result is the

density estimate at that particular location x in units of points per area. The process
is then repeated for all other grid cells in the map in order to generate a continuous
density surface of the animal’s spatial position during the tracking interval. Higher
values occur in areas of the map where the animal could have spent the greatest
amount of time. Once the density surface is generated, core areas, home ranges and
total areas can be delineated from the 50, 95, and 100% cumulative contours, or
isopleths.

2.2. Kernel density estimation

KDE has long been the standard and most widely accepted method of home range
estimation (Borger et al. 2006). KDE, a popular data smoothing methodology in
statistics and GIScience, generates a continuous intensity surface of an animal’s
spatial distribution by smoothing the point pattern of animal locations. Smoothing
is achieved by ﬁtting a kernel, or distance-weighting function, to each data point
(see Silverman 1986 for details). The magnitude of smoothing is controlled by its
bandwidth or smoothing parameter. Home range estimates computed by KDE are
highly sensitive to the choice of bandwidth (Scott 2012); a value too large will
oversmooth the points and overestimate home ranges, while one too small will
have the opposite eﬀect. Consequently, bandwidths are generally speciﬁed using
an algorithm, such as least-squares cross validation, or LSCV, which seeks to ﬁnd
the optimal value for a given dataset. Formulations of the LSCV algorithm can be
found in (Horne and Garton 2006). Once the density surface is generated, core
areas, home ranges and total areas can be delineated from the 50, 95 and 100%
cumulative contours, or isopleths. Though numerous studies have argued KDE is
inappropriate as a home range estimator, noting poor performance because its

assumptions are violated for trajectory-based data (Blundell et al. 2001, Hemson
et al. 2005, Row and Blouin-Demers 2006, Downs et al. 2012), KDE remains a
popular home range method and a benchmark for other estimators because it is
easy to implement and is well studied.

2.3. Characteristic hull polygons

Duckham et al. (2008) developed characteristic hulls as a method to delineate geometric
regions occupied by a set of points. CHPs are created from the Delaunay triangulation (DT)
constructed for a set of points. The DT is a graph that is created by connecting neighbouring
points to form triangles. Though multiple possible triangulations exist for a set of points, the
DT is special in that it maximizes the minimum angle in any given triangle. In other words, it
favours triangles that are more regularly shaped. A CHP is constructed by extracting some
number of triangles from the DT to create a hull from the remaining ones. Diﬀerent rules can
be used to determine which triangles are removed from the DT, although the most common
is to remove the largest triangles in terms of perimeter. Downs and Horner (2009) proposed
using CHP as a method of home range analysis, whereby core areas are delineated using the
smallest 50% of triangles, home ranges 95% and total areas 100%. Note that the 100% CHP
is equivalent to the minimum convex polygon. The CHP method is becoming more popular
as a home range estimator as it is easy to apply, is less prone to home range overestimation
and can be applied to small sample sizes (Olsen et al. 2011, Downs et al. 2012, Jose-
Dominguez et al. 2015).

3. Methods

3.1. Tracking data simulation

3.1.1. Agent-based model
A spatially explicit ABM of animal movement was used to generate tracking data (see
Tang and Bennett 2010 for a review). This study used the approach described by
Anderson et al. (2017). The ABM uses three components to simulate animal move-
ment: agents, environment, and behaviour. In this case, an agent represents a single
animal. An individual animal navigates and interacts with the environment according
to a set of behavioural rules. The model environment consists of a grid of cells
representing habitat patches of varying cover types. The animal’s movement is
controlled by three sets of behavioural rules: habitat transition, step length and
return time. The set of habitat transition rules determines the relative frequency at
in one habitat type will either remain in that type or move into
which an animal
another. The step length rule determines the relative frequency at which the animal
moves within particular ranges of distances, or alternatively numbers of cells. The
return time rule speciﬁes whether or not the animal displays homing behaviour,
where it must return to a pre-speciﬁed location (such as a roost, nest, or den site)
at a particular time interval. Operationally, the ABM simulates the movement of a
single animal based on the three behaviour rules within a habitat map over a
speciﬁed time duration (expressed as a number of model ticks), as outlined in
Figure 1 and detailed below:

tat situation.

(b) If the ﬁnal number of ticks has been reached, the model ends.

3.1.2. Tracking data scenarios
The general framework described in Section 3.1.1 was used to simulate animal tracking data
(Figure 1). Tracking data were simulated at 15-s intervals (i.e. 1 tick) for 15-h active periods
over the course of 28 days for a total of 100,800 points per model run. Inactive periods of 9 h,
when the animals were assumed to be sleeping or resting in a single location, were not
modelled. Multiple scenarios were used to generate tracking data representing a wide range
of movement patterns to test the robustness of each estimation method. Scenarios included
two variations of model environment, two step length distributions, two habitat transition
matrices, and two return time frequencies. All combinations of these variations in model
environment and behavioural rules produced 16 scenarios. Thirty runs were generated for
each scenario, resulting in 480 unique tracking data sets.

Tracking data were generated in two model environments that reﬂected contrasting
levels of habitat fragmentation: one with physical barriers impeding animal movement
(A) and one without (B), as shown in Figure 2. Landscape A consisted of a habitat mosaic
of ﬁve accessible habitat cover types (water, shoreline, grass, tree-shrub and urban) and

one inaccessible type (buildings and major roads). Landscape B was identical to
Landscape A except that the inaccessible type was reclassiﬁed into tree-shrub habitat.
The landscapes comprised spatial areas of 0.28 km2 divided into 5-m grid cells arranged
in 86 rows and 132 columns. A more thorough description of the modelling environ-
ment can be found in Anderson et al. (2017).

Two habitat transition distributions were created to represent species with diﬀerent
types of habitat preferences: generalist and specialist (Figure 3(a)). Habitat generalists
are deﬁned as those that have the ability to utilize multiple habitat types. The habitat
generalist matrix assigned relatively uniform preferences to water, shoreline, grass and
tree-shrub habitats and slightly lower preferences to urban. In contrast, habitat specia-
lists are deﬁned as those that have well-deﬁned preferences and may not be able to
utilize all cover types within a landscape. The habitat specialist matrix assigned strong
preference to tree-shrub, moderate preference to grass, slight preference to shoreline
and urban, and total avoidance to water.

The two step length distributions represented species with diﬀerent types of mobility:
terrestrial and ﬂying. The terrestrial distribution assigned movements at each model tick
to either staying at its current location (i.e. non-movement) or moving within its current
cell or to a neighbouring cell. This represents species restricted to movements on or

under the ground surface, such as for animals that walk, run, swim or burrow. The ﬂying
distribution added the possibility of ﬂights up to eight cells in length to the step length
distribution while keeping the relative frequency of non-movement
the same
(Figure 3(b)).

The two return time rules represented animals with and without homing behaviour
(Figure 3(c)). In the homing scenario, a daily return time of 3600 ticks required the
animal to return to its starting location at the beginning of each model day. These return
movements to the starting location were not explicitly modelled but were assumed to
occur at the start of the inactive period. The non-homing rule did not specify a return
time, so the animal began each day at the previous day’s ending location. Collectively,
all combinations of these variations produced 16 scenarios labelled A through P
(Table 1) with diﬀerent physical features in terms of size, shape, point density and
hardness of edges. Relative to one another, scenarios using landscape A tended to
produce tracking data with harder edges and larger holes than landscape B, since
movement in the inaccessible areas was prevented. The habitat generalist scenarios
had softer edges than the specialist ones, since movement between adjacent habitats
was less restricted. Terrestrial scenarios produced tracking data over smaller spatial
extents than the ﬂying ones, as longer ﬂights expanded the ranges of movement.
Inclusion of homing behaviour tended to produce smaller spatial extents as well as
increased the density of points near the starting location. A sample data set for each
scenario combining these features is shown in Appendix 1.

3.1.3. Determination of known areas
Known core areas, home ranges and total areas for each simulated tracking data set
were calculated using Cressie’s binning method (1993) as per Downs and Horner (2008).
In this process, a regular grid was overlaid the study area, in this case a grid with the
same dimensions as the habitat layer. The total occupied area was extracted as the
collection of grid cells containing at least one tracking data point. Likewise, the known
home ranges and core areas were delineated as the smallest sets of grid cells that
comprised 95% and 50%, respectively, of the tracking points. Although the binning
method is based on points rather than trajectory segments, with a sampling interval of

only 15 s, the points essentially model complete movement trajectories aside from
relatively negligible movements between consecutive points. For the terrestrial scenar-
ios, all movements between points occur within single cells or among neighbouring grid
cells, so the areas encompass all portions of the trajectories. For the ﬂying scenarios, all
movements occur within single or neighbouring cells, with the exception of occasional
longer ﬂights that skip over a number of cells. If occupancy is assumed to occur only
when the animal is located directly on the terrain, then it is not problematic to exclude
longer ﬂight segments from the total occupied areas, home ranges or core areas since
they are travelled across and essentially unused. However, it should be noted that most
ﬂights occur over already occupied cells and would have little impact on the determina-
tion of known areas. Known total areas, home ranges and core areas are illustrated for a
sample tracking data set in Figure 4(b).

3.2. Home range analysis

The accuracy of TGDE, KDE and CHP was tested by estimating total areas, home
ranges and core areas from samples of data points extracted from each model run
and comparing them to their corresponding known values. Four sample sizes were
tested in order to also assess each method’s robustness to sampling frequency.
Sample sizes of 140, 420, 480 and 1,640 points were used. Respectively, these
equate to sampling frequencies of 1 point every 200, 64, 32 and 16 min, or
alternatively, 4.5, 14, 28 and 56 points per diurnal period. One sample of each
size was systematically selected from each 100,800-point data set in order to mimic
sampling procedures of modern GPS trackers. The systematic samples of points
began at least 15 min after the start of each day in order to avoid any bias
associated with the starting locations.

Next, TGDE, KDE and CHP were applied to each sample of points. Adaptive-velocity
TGDE was applied using three scalar maximum velocity factors that were chosen based
on an initial exploration of the data: 1.05, 1.1 and 1.2. The scaling factors are multiplied
by the minimum possible velocity for each pair of consecutive points in order to specify
the maximum velocity parameter. The minimum velocity is calculated by dividing the
distance between two points by the amount of time elapsed. Then, this value is multi-
plied by the scaling factor to generate maximum velocities that vary over the tracking
interval. Relatively smaller maximum velocities are speciﬁed when points are located
closer together, such as occurs when an animal is resting. Relatively larger velocities are
then speciﬁed when points are located further apart, when it is apparent the animal was
moving. TGDE calculations were performed with a quartic distance weighting function
and a spatial resolution of 1 m using a custom toolbox developed for ArcMap v 10.1
(ESRI, Inc.) as per Section 2.1. Once TGDE was applied to a sample, core areas, home
ranges and total areas were delineated from the 50%, 95% and 100% isopleths, as is
standard protocol in home range analysis.

KDE was applied using a bandwidth selected by LSCV with a 1-m spatial resolution
using the Geospatial Modelling Environment by Beyer (2012), as per Section 2.2. A
Gaussian kernel was used, as the LSCV algorithm is developed for that kernel, and it is
also the most common approach used to estimate home ranges. Core areas, home
ranges and total areas were delineated from the isopleths in a similar manner to TGDE.
However, the 99.9% isopleth was used in lieu of the 100% isopleth for the total occupied
area, since the Gaussian kernel is unbounded. CHP was applied using a custom toolbox
developed for ArcMap, where the 50, 95, and 100% of the smallest triangles measured in
terms of perimeter were used to map the core areas, home ranges and total areas,
respectively, as per Section 2.3.

To evaluate the performance of each method, the estimated size of each area was

compared to the known area by calculating the percent diﬀerence, or bias, as:

A positive value of bias is computed if the estimated area is larger than the known area,
indicating the proportion of overestimation. For example, a value of 1.0 indicates that
the estimated area is 100% larger, or double the size, of the known area. If the bias is

negative, then the area is underestimated. A value of 0 indicates a perfect estimate.
Mean bias and standard error for each method were calculated for each combination of
scenario, sample size and area estimate, as well as for the scenarios combined.

4. Results

TGDE, KDE and CHP diﬀered in their abilities to estimate core areas, home ranges and
total areas for the four sampling frequencies. Mean bias and standard errors are reported
in Table 2 for the highest sampling frequency. Results for the other three sampling
frequencies are included in Appendix 2, as they show the same overall trends. For all
scenarios combined, TGDE performed best at the lowest scalar velocity (1.05) with
estimates of mean bias ranging from 0.66 to 1.08 for core areas, 0.35–0.39 for home
ranges and 0.32–0.37 for total areas, depending on sampling frequencies. Bias was lower
at higher sampling frequencies. For example, at the highest sampling frequency, mean
bias ranged from 0.37 to 1.20 for core areas, 0.10–0.85 for home ranges and 0.11–0.71
for total areas. At the lowest sampling frequency, mean bias ranged from 0.69 to 1.70 for
core areas, 0.13–0.81 for home ranges and 0.10–0.81 for total areas. Although the overall
means were larger than zero, indicating overestimation of spatial extents, they varied
substantially by scenario. TGDE produced unbiased home ranges (i.e. 95% conﬁdence
intervals contained zero) and total areas at the highest sampling frequencies for scenar-
ios E and G, the terrestrial, generalist scenarios in the landscape without barriers, which
were the data sets with the softest edges. TGDE performed worst for scenarios J and L,
which were those for ﬂying, habitat specialists in the landscape with barriers, which had
the hardest edges and large amounts of open space within the point patterns. Levels of
bias were relatively low for home ranges and total areas across most scenarios, although
core areas were consistently overestimated, especially at lower sampling frequencies. In
general, performance was generally better for generalist scenarios compared to specia-
list ones, better for the landscape without barriers than with and better for terrestrial
mobility than ﬂying. Homing behaviour had no eﬀect on the results, as levels of mean
bias were similar when holding all other factors constant. Applying TGDE with increased
scalar velocities increased the levels of bias, as would be expected mathematically,
though the same general trends across scenarios and sampling frequencies were
observed (see Appendix 2 for detailed results).

KDE using LSCV to select the bandwidth consistently produced the largest levels of bias
across all sampling frequencies and scenarios. For all scenarios combined, mean bias
ranged from 0.82 to 1.58 for core areas, 0.85–1.37 for home ranges and 2.13–3.21 for
total areas, with estimates improving as sampling frequency increased. Levels of bias did
vary by scenario, although they were always greater than zero. For example, at the highest
sampling frequency, mean bias ranged from 0.58 to 1.26 for core areas, 0.62–1.45 for
home ranges and 1.75–2.77 for total areas. At the lowest sampling frequency, mean bias
ranged from 1.23–2.34 for core areas, 1.03–2.19 for home ranges and 2.71–4.09 for total
areas. KDE did perform relatively better for scenarios E and G and worse for J and L. Similar
to TGDE, KDE also performed better for generalist scenarios compared to specialist ones,
better for the landscape without barriers than with, and better for terrestrial mobility than
ﬂying. Performance did not vary by homing scenario. Overall, overestimates were quite

substantial for total areas, while overestimates for home ranges and total areas were
relatively smaller but still greater than those for TGDE.

CHP produced estimates that were the most sensitive to sampling frequency but the
most robust to scenario. For all scenarios combined, mean levels of bias were relatively
slight, ranging from −0.19 to 0.13 for core areas, 0.19–0.44 for home ranges and 0.22–0.44

for total areas. At the highest sampling frequency, mean bias ranged from −0.26 to −0.12
for core areas, 0.11–0.37 for home ranges and 0.25–0.71 for total areas. At the lowest
sampling frequency, mean bias ranged from −0.03 to 0.23 for core areas, 0.30–0.81 for
home ranges and 0.10–0.50 for total areas. Like TGDE and KDE, CHP performed relatively
better for scenarios E and G and worse for J and L, showing similar trends between
diﬀerent landscape, habitat preference, mobility scenarios and homing behaviour, though
the variance among scenarios was relatively lower (see Appendix 2).

5. Summary and discussion

The ABM of animal movement allowed for the generation of diﬀerent scenarios for
testing home range estimators. The combinations of diﬀerent landscapes, mobility
types, habitat preferences and homing behaviours produced tracking data with a variety
of physical characteristics. TGDE, KDE and CHP performed relatively better in scenarios
that produced tracking data that lacked hard edges and holes, in other words for point
patterns more closely resembling parametric distributions. Performance was relatively
worse for data sets with hard edges and holes. These results are consistent with other
studies that show how KDE and CHP, in particular, are aﬀected by point pattern shape
and edge type (Blundell et al. 2001, Row and Blouin-Demers 2006, Downs and Horner
2008). This suggests that the characteristics of a species should be considered when
computing home ranges and interpreting the results, since the methods tested per-
formed better for terrestrial and habitat-specialist types of animals in less fragmented
landscapes. For example, caution might be used when computing home ranges for
habitat specialists that occupy highly fragmented habitat, since the results may be
biased.

In comparing the three methods, TGDE at the lowest scalar velocity performed
relatively well as a home range estimator. Though TGDE did tend to overestimate core
areas, especially at lower sampling frequencies, it did produce accurate home ranges
and total areas for many scenarios. KDE grossly overestimated all three spatial extents in
all cases, although more so for total areas than home ranges and core areas. CHP tended
to produce similar levels of bias compared to TGDE for home ranges and total areas but
lower levels for core areas, although the direction of bias was related to sample size. At
the lowest sampling frequencies, CHP produced accurate to slight overestimates of core
areas and home ranges and slight to moderate overestimates of total areas. As sampling
frequency increased, core areas were underestimated. Based on these results, it is clear
that KDE should not be applied as a home range estimator and that both TGDE and CHP
show potential.

Though TGDE and CHP performed similarly to one another overall, in practice they
are best used in diﬀerent situations. TGDE is preferable at higher sampling frequencies,
because slight overestimates would be preferred to underestimates. Negative levels of
bias shown by CHP pose a concern in terms of animal conservation, as the amount of
habitat required by a species could be underestimated. TGDE has the advantage of
directly incorporating an animal’s movement trajectory into home range analysis, for
which estimates improve with sampling frequency as uncertainty about the animal’s
movement decreases. CHP, however, is better suited for situations where the sampling
frequency is relatively low and trajectories cannot be easily modelled. CHP also has the

15

advantage that the total area is bounded at the minimum convex polygon, so extreme
overestimates are less likely to occur except for unusually shaped areas. The results of
this study suggest that CHP might be selected when the sampling frequency is less than
5 points per day, while TGDE is more suitable for higher sampling frequencies. As
movement trajectories tend more toward straight lines or narrow turning angles over
relatively short sampling intervals (Laube and Purves 2011), TGDE using a scaling factor
of 1.05 is able to encompass unsampled locations at these sampling frequencies and is
recommended for high temporal frequency tracking data. For a more thorough discus-
sion of the impacts of spatial resolution, extent, and other factors on TGDE, please see
(Downs and Horner 2014).

In terms of the broader implications of this work outside of animal tracking, there are two
main contributions. First, the agent-based modelling approach for simulating diverse sets of
tracking data for testing home range estimators is novel. This approach might be used to
test new methods of home range estimation, such as T-LoCoH (Dougherty et al. 2017) and
area-corrected kernel methods (Fleming and Calabrese 2017), or related methods like step
selection functions and interaction measures. Second, the results of the study are helpful for
understanding the performance of TGDE for tracking data more generally. Variations of
TGDE have been used to study vehicle movements (Downs and Horner 2012) and measure
people’s accessibility (Horner and Downs 2014) and map activity spaces (Downs 2016), so
the work might lend insights about how sampling frequency and other factors might impact
the results. Future work might explore the performance of TGDE in these other contexts.

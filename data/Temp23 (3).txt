This  paper  investigates  the  hierarchical  structures  of  29  selected  European  countries  from  the
perspective  of  blocks  and  natural  cities  and  makes  an  across-country  comparison  among  the  countries.
Blocks are minimum cycles consisting of road segments in the road network of a whole country; natural cities
are defined as the aggregations of small blocks. We test the size distributions of blocks and natural cities at
the country level and find that both exhibit heavy-tailed distributions. The power law distribution of city sizes
indicates the presence of the scaling property. Therefore, the cities in a country can be repeatedly grouped
into a similar two-tier structure of head and tail via the head/tail division rule. The ascending tiers represent
the small, medium, large and mega cities. Accordingly, a simple model is developed to evaluate and cross
compare the degree of similarity and stability of the scaling properties and hierarchical structures of cities.
Moreover,  cities  and  blocks  are  the  functional  units  of  a  country,  and  the  correlation  coefficient  values
between city sizes/number of blocks and economic factors (i.e., gross domestic product and population) are
up to 0.87. We further conjecture that the compared results of hierarchies can serve as an indicator to assess
a country’s economic system.

Le présent article examine les structures hiérarchiques de vingt-neuf pays européens sélectionnés sous
l’angle de blocs et de villes naturelles et fait une comparaison entre les pays. Les blocs sont des cycles
minimaux formés de segments de routes dans le réseau routier d’un seul pays; les villes naturelles sont définies
comme étant des regroupements de petits blocs. Nous avons vérifié la distribution granulométrique des blocs
et des villes naturelles au niveau des pays et nous avons constaté que les deux présentent des distributions à
queue lourde. La distribution, selon la loi de puissance, de la taille des villes indique la présence de la
propriété de mise à l'échelle. Par conséquent, les villes d’un pays peuvent être groupées itérativement dans
une structure similaire à deux niveaux de tête et de queue par le truchement de la règle de division tête/queue.
Les  niveaux  ascendants  représentent  les  petites  villes,  les  villes  moyennes,  les  grandes  villes  et  les  villes
géantes. Par conséquent, un modèle simple est développé pour évaluer et faire une comparaison croisée du
degré de similarité et de stabilité des propriétés de mise à l’échelle et des structures hiérarchiques des villes.
En outre, les villes et les blocs sont les unités fonctionnelles d’un pays et les valeurs du coefficient de
corrélation  entre  la  taille  des  villes  et  le  nombre  de  blocs  et  les  facteurs  économiques  (c.-à-d., produit
intérieur brut et population) peuvent atteindre jusqu’à 0,87. Nous émettons de plus l’hypothèse que les résultats
comparés des hiérarchies peuvent servir d’indicateurs pour évaluer le système économique d’un pays.

1. Introduction

Scaling  refers  to  the  special  non-linear,
mathematical  relationship  between  sizes  of  entities
and their probabilities (i.e., a heavy-tailed distribution,
especially the power law in statistical physics) in a
complex system. Extensive literature has been ded-
icated  to  exploring  the  scaling  properties  of  urban
systems  from  different  perspectives,  such  as  urban
morphologies,  road  networks,  cellular  structures,

urban  economies  and  city  sizes  (e.g.,  Batty  and
Longley [1994],  Chen  and  Zhou [2003],  Pumain
[2004],  Lämmer  et  al. [2006],  Kalapala  et  al.
[2006],  Shalizi  [2011]),  while  other  studies  have
emphasized  modeling  the  dynamics,  mechanisms
and fundamental drivers behind the scaling laws in
urban systems (e.g., Alperovich [1993], Blanter et
al.  [1997],  Pumain  et  al. [2006],  Isalgue  et  al.

[2007], Barthelemy and Flammini [2008], Chen and
Zhou [2008]). These studies agree on the fact that the
urban or geographic systems exhibit scaling laws and
bear hierarchical structures. The shared feature of the
distributions  (i.e.,  scaling)  describes  the  division  of
inner  elements  into  groups  [Adamic 2011]  that
constitute what we call hierarchies. The smaller inner
elements  are  interactive  components  with  physical
meanings, and the hierarchies indicate different geo-
graphic  implications  in  different  environmental
contexts. Nevertheless, most of these previous studies
were limited to the description of scaling phenomena,
and a few of the studies attempted to develop quanti-
tative approaches to obtain hierarchical structures for
application in urban studies. 

Jiang  and  Liu [2011]  illustrated  the  scaling
phenomenon by showing that there are more numer-
ous small geographic entities than large entities from
the perspective of blocks (i.e., the minimum cycles
decomposed from a road network). The authors also
proposed a quantitative way to differentiate the hier-
archical  structures:  if  the  sizes  of  all  entities  (e.g.,
blocks)  follow  a  heavy-tailed  distribution,  then  the
mean value clearly divides them into a high percent-
age of small entities and a low percentage of large
entities.  This  regularity  is  termed  as  the  head/tail
division  rule,  which  has  also  been  successfully
applied  in  several  urban  studies  (e.g.,  Jiang  et  al.
[2011], Jiang and Jia [2011]). However, blocks are
generated only in the three largest European countries
(France, Germany and the UK), and the hierarchical
structures of blocks are identified only at the first level
to delineate natural cities in a country from a geospa-
tial perspective. Comparisons among countries are not
conducted due to the small number of countries. 

such 

(VGI), 

information 

Motivated  by  previous  work  [Jiang  and  Liu
2011]  and  the  increasingly  available  volunteered
as
geographic 
OpenStreetMap data, we expand the study area from
three to 29 European countries. We extract blocks as
basic geographic representations and generate nat-
ural  cities  for  each  country.  We  test  the  scaling
properties of blocks and natural cities and iteratively
apply the head/tail division rule to the cities in each
country. In this way, we can obtain a serial of such
two-tier head/tail hierarchical structures at different
levels, where the ascending tiers can be represented
as  the  small,  medium,  large  and  mega  cities.  The
cities in each level will follow a power law distribu-
tion if the number of cities is at a reasonably large
scale.  The  percentages  of  the  cities  in  the  tail  and
head should also be near 80% and 20%, respectively
(i.e.,  numerous  small  cities  and  fewer  large  cities).
Therefore,  whether  cities  in  each  level  follow  a
power law distribution and how close the percentages

are  to  the  80/20  rule  are  set  up  as  the  standard  for
assessing  and  cross-comparing  hierarchical  struc-
tures among the countries. We also find that there is a
strong  correlation  between  city  sizes/number  of
blocks  and  economic  factors  (i.e.,  gross  domestic
product (GDP) and population), which suggests that
the hierarchies can serve as an indicator for assessing
a country’s economic system.

The  major  contributions  of  this  paper  are
multi-fold. First, the city system is naturally catego-
rized into small, medium, large and mega cities at
the country level and a uniform standard is set up to
assess and cross-compare the hierarchical structures
(i.e., cities) at the country level from the bottom up.
Second,  the  iterative  application  of  the  head/tail
division  rule  proves  to  be  successful.  Third,  the
generated  blocks  and  natural  cities  are  as  large  as
tens  of  gigabytes  and  will  be  of  value  to  further
urban  studies.  The  data  sets  and  the  source  code
developed  in  this  paper  are  released  online  at
http://fromto.hig.se/block.

The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  organized  as
follows.  Section  2  briefly  introduces  the  study
area and the data sets we use as well as the con-
cepts  of  border  number,  block  and  natural  city
according to previous studies. Section 3 provides
the  identification  of  heavy-tailed  distributions,
with a particular focus on the scaling property. A
specific  example  using  real  data  is  given  to  pro-
vide  an  intuitive  explanation.  In  Section  4,  the
results  from  29  selected  European  countries  are
visualized and analyzed. The model for comparing
hierarchical  structures  across  countries  is  pro-
vided  and  discussed  in  detail.  Section  5  draws
conclusions and points to future work.

2. Study Area and Data
Processing

Two  types  of  data  sets  are  involved  in  this
study:  the  main  data  set  from  the  OpenStreetMap
(OSM)  database  and  the  statistical  data  set  from
GDP and population reports by the United Nations
[2010].  The  OSM  data  are  used  to  generate  the
blocks and natural cities, while the statistical data
set is mainly used for comparisons. OSM is a type
of VGI that refers to numerous people voluntarily
creating, assembling and disseminating geographic
information with the support of Web 2.0 technolo-
gies  [Goodchild 2007].  VGI  collects  geographic
data  from  the  bottom  up,  which  is  a  new  method
compared  with 
top-down
approach.  OSM  is  perhaps  the  most  successful

the  conventional

example of VGI. OSM inherits the features of VGI
and aims to create a set of free and editable maps
[Haklay and Weber 2008]. 

Founded  in  July  2004  by  Steve  Coast  at
University College, London, OSM has experienced
rapid  growth  and  now  covers  most  of  the  world.
However, spatial heterogeneity exists in the quality
of the OSM data in terms of positional and attribute
accuracies, completeness and consistency. As stat-
ed  above,  OSM  originated  in  Europe  and  most
European  countries  are  open  and  easy  for  imple-
mentation of the OSM project. Thus, the OSM data
in Europe possess higher data quality than in other
areas,  and  the  data  quality  among  the  different
European countries is similar. Moreover, the social,
economic and cultural backgrounds of these coun-
tries are similar, making the countries suitable for a
cross comparison. Therefore, the study area (Figure
1)  covers  the  European  Zone  countries  as  well  as
Ireland,  Norway  and  additional  countries  due  to
their  geographic  proximity.  Countries  such  as
Andorra, Gibraltar, Monaco, San Marino, Holy See
(Vatican  City)  and  Liechtenstein  are  neglected
because  their  geographic  area  is  too  small  to  be
treated at the country level.

As a VGI project, the OSM data set possesses
many  types  of  spatial  and  non-spatial  data.  OSM
data  are  a  type  of  extensible  markup  language
(XML), which means the database is self-explanatory
and easily extended. The road network is character-
ized by key “highway” and can be easily extracted
by traversing all of the items of OSM XML data in
a country. Although there are many ways to down-
load and process OSM data, most of these ways are
time-consuming  and  may  require  large  hard  disks
and  large  amounts  of  memory.  Fortunately,
websites, such as Cloudmade.com, divide OSM data
by  country  boundaries  and  regions  for  end-users.
We  download  the  OSM  data  country  by  country
directly  and  generate  blocks  and  natural  cities  for
each country. This process has been well documented
in the literature [Jiang and Liu 2011]. 

Here,  we  briefly  describe  the  process  from
Jiang  and  Liu  [2011]  (Figure  2).  We  begin  by
extracting  the  road  network  from  OSM  data  and
building the road network into a topological format
using ArcGIS  coverage  (i.e.,  road  segments). After
the  extraction,  we  track  blocks  from  the  outermost
road segment until all road segments are traversed.
Correspondingly,  the  outermost  blocks  possess  a
designation  of  border  number  one,  and  the  neigh-
bours inward by one step are assigned with border
number two and so on, as necessary. Next, we divide
these  generated  blocks  into  small  and  large  groups
using the head/tail division rule: the small blocks are

those with areas less than the mean value of all of the
block areas and vice versa for the large blocks. Next,
for  all  of  the  small  blocks,  we  start  from  any  small
block  and  search  its  neighbours  and  its  neighbours’
neighbours for small blocks until no such small neigh-
bour  blocks  can  be  found.  The  traversed  blocks  are
adjacent and form groups, which constitute what we
call natural cities (red rectangle in Figure 2). We can
see  that  the  natural  cities  are  generated  in  a  natural
way, which is the reason for the term “natural city.”

The  above  process  is  applied  to  29  European
countries. The total data volume is up to 40 giga-
bytes, and the processing time is several days with
a  2-terabyte  disk  and  42-gigabyte  memory  server
computer.  To  implement  the  blocks  with  border
numbers and generate natural cities, some isolated
islands  are  removed,  including  the  islands  of
Portugal and Greece. We directly cite the data from
the  three  largest  European  countries  (France,
Germany and the UK) from Jiang and Liu [2011]. 

3. Scaling and Heavy-Tailed
Distributions

In this section, we briefly introduce the concepts
of  the  scaling  law  and  heavy-tailed  distributions,
with  particular  emphasis  on  their  relationships.

Generally, the term “scale” has different meanings
in  different  fields.  For  instance,  in  cartography,
scale  refers  to  the  ratio  of  distances  between  map
and  earth,  whereas  in  the  physical  sciences,  scale
indicates  the  characteristic  length  (e.g.,  size  or
extent)  of  physical  phenomena  [Mark  2003].  The
scale-free concept refers to the idea that regardless
of  the  scale  used,  the  power  law  distribution
remains the same [Newman 2005]. This concept is
similar to the concept of a fractal in geometry: the
spatial form of an object is irregular, and the irregu-
larity  is  maintained  from  scale  to  scale  [Batty  and
Longley  1994].  Both  the  concepts  of  scale-free
phenomena  and  fractals  refer  to  the  self-similarity
of  hierarchies  in  a  man-made  or  natural  process.
The question encountered here is how to determine
the  scale  in  different  contexts.  In  cartography,  we
can  define  the  scale  as  1:500,  1:1000  and  so  on,
which appears a bit arbitrary; fractality in geometry
is validated by strict formulas, which can be difficult
to observe in natural phenomena. Therefore, finding
a  meaningful  scale  among  a  series  of  variables  is
crucial to understanding the hierarchical structures. 
Newman [2005] noted that the 80/20 rule is best
maintained if the median of the variables is used to
divide  the  variables  into  a  two-tier  structure.
Similarly,  Jiang  and  Liu [2011]  proposed  that  the
head/tail division rule be used to obtain the two-tier
hierarchical structure, which can also be found with

the  80/20  rule.  To  understand  this  process,  we
examine a series of data sets that use actual roads in
Texas, USA (Table 1). The data are for the number
of  dangling  road  segments  inside  each  block  [Liu
and Jiang 2012]. We repeatedly apply the head/tail
division rule to the data set, and we obtain the two-
tier hierarchical structures at different levels of detail
(Table 1). We plot the head part (where the values
are greater than the mean value) in a rank-size plot
(Figure 3a) and a power law distribution (Figure 3b)
at different levels of detail. We note that the scaling
property  and  hierarchies  are  very  well  maintained.
More importantly, there are always meaningful geo-
graphic  implications  behind  the  hierarchies  when
the  information  is  viewed  from  the  appropriate
urban  context.  To  this  extent,  we  believe  that  the
head/tail division rule provides deep insights into the
hierarchies of scaling phenomena.  

Now  the  question  is  how  to  mathematically
detect the presence of a heavy-tailed distribution. As
mentioned  previously,  a  heavy-tailed  distribution
describes 
the  special  nonlinear  relationships
between  a  variable  and  its  probability.  There  are
many  probability  distribution  functions  to  fit  the
data,  such  as  the  power  law,  power  law  with  an
exponential cutoff, exponential, stretched exponential
distribution  and  lognormal  [Clauset  et  al.  2009].
Clauset  et  al.  [2009]  also  provide  the  models  and
source  code  in  different  versions  to  detect  heavy-
tailed distributions, which also have been extended by
Jiang and Jia [2011]. Next, we briefly introduce the
models  adopted  to  detect  heavy-tailed  distributions
(see Clauset et al. [2009] and Jiang and Jia [2011] for
more information). To explain the parameters of these
five distributions, we first provide their mathematical
formulas below, where x denotes the given variable,

The above formulas denote (1) the power law
distribution,  (2)  power  law  distribution  with  an
exponential cutoff (i.e., the degenerated version of
the power law distribution), (3) exponential distri-
bution,  (4)  stretched  exponential  distribution  (i.e.,
the degenerated version of the exponential distribu-
tion) and (5) lognormal distribution. The detection
methods  can  be  described  as  follows.  First,  maxi-
mum  likelihood  estimation  (MLE)  is  adopted  to
calculate the parameters (xmin, α, β, λ, σ and μ) in
the  five  mathematical  functions  above  to  describe
or  define  the  functions.  Next,  the  Kolmogorov-
Smirnov (KS) [Chakravarti et al. 1967] test is used
to  verify  the  validation  of  the  distributions  in  the
form of the p value. For example, if the p value is
greater than a threshold (e.g., 0.05), we can assume
that  the  variables  follow  the  distribution  [Clauset
2009].  The  complete  process  is  illustrated  by  the
flow chart in Figure 4.

First of all, we calculate parameters for each
distribution  by  MLE  and  then  do  a  KS  test  for
each type of distribution. If only one distribution
passes the KS test, this indicates that the distribu-
tion fits the data best, and we will certainly select
this  distribution.  Secondly,  if  more  than  one  dis-
tribution passes the KS test, then we calculate LR
for the passed distributions to decide the best one.
If not any distributions pass the KS test, then LR
calculation is the only way to decide the best-fitted
distribution.  Other  methods  could  be  used  to
decide the best-fit distribution when there are no
passes for the KS test. The reason why we use LR is

because this method is popular and frequently used
in literature with the support of open source codes.
In  the  process  of  identifying  whether  the
sizes  of  blocks  and  natural  cities  follow  basic
heavy-tailed  distributions,  in  most  instances
we  depend  on  the  calculated  parameters  of
their  functions.  However,  when  a  serial  of
blocks  or  natural  cities  follow  more  than  one
type of heavy-tailed distribution, we generally
only  compare  the  likelihood  ratio  (LR)  rather
than calculating the parameters of their degen-
erated  versions  such  that  the  computing  com-
plexity  is  dramatically  reduced.  We  use  this
method  because  the  degenerated  versions  are
in accordance with their basic distribution to a
certain extent.

4. Results and Discussion

We  first  individually  extracted  the  blocks
from each of the 29 European countries. Next, we
conducted  the  mathematical  detection  for  each
country  and  found  that  they  all  follow  heavy-
tailed  distributions  (Table  2).  For  Cyprus  and
Malta, both countries follow exponential and log-
normal distributions. According to the method in
Section  3,  we  calculated  the  LR  for  exponential
versus  lognormal  distributions.  The  results  show
that the exponential distribution is a better fit for
the  block  sizes  in  these  two  countries.  For
Germany and the UK, which do not follow any of
the three basic heavy-tailed distributions according

to  obtained  parameters,  we  calculate  their  LR  to
compare among the three distributions and found
lognormal to be the best distribution.

According  to  the  strategy  in  Section  2,  we
divide the blocks into small ones and large ones for
each  country  using  the  head/tail  division  rule,
because  the  blocks  in  each  country  exhibit  heavy-
tailed distributions (Table 2). We then generate natural
cities based on the small blocks for all of the coun-
tries  one  by  one.  Figure  5 shows  the  blocks  and
cities for all of the selected 29 countries. All of the
natural cities and border numbers for the blocks are
generated at the country level. Jiang and Liu [2011]
illustrated the spatial pattern in a single country as a
mental  image  of  the  country  for  different  people,
which is quite different with geometric media axes
inside  the  polygon  boundary  of  a  country.  In  this
study,  the  patterns  of  visualized  natural  cities  and
blocks  with  border  numbers  in  Figure  5  provide
some insights into the spatial patterns from a special
perspective at the continental level. 

A  closer  look  at  the  distributions  of  sizes  of
natural  cities  showed  that  the  natural  cities  at  the
country  level  demonstrate  a  power  law  distribution
(Table 3), which is in agreement with previous stud-
ies, but it is difficult to differentiate and assess these
cities  in  terms  of  their  statistical  distributions.
However,  as  stated  above,  the  scale-free  property
allows us to use any scale for the power law distribu-
tion. Consequently, the scaling property will also be

well maintained in the two-tier hierarchical structures
that are obtained via the head/tail division rule. If we
apply the head/tail division rule to the head part of the
natural  cities  in  each  country  iteratively,  we  will
obtain the two-tier hierarchical structures at different
levels  in  a  natural  way  (Table  3).  This  hierarchical
structure is easy to understand; however, three ques-
tions arise: (1) why do we use cities instead of blocks,
(2) why do we use three levels, and (3) how do we
assess and make sense of the hierarchical structures?
To  answer  the  first  question,  although  blocks
and cities indicate the geographic carrying capacity
in a country (because human activities are mainly
constrained within blocks and cities), cities are the
real functional units for a country when compared
with blocks. Moreover, on average, 85% of blocks
in a country belong to cities. Therefore, the hierar-
chical  structure  of  cities  at  the  country  level  can
better represent a country than blocks. In response
to  the  second  question,  the  scaling  property  (e.g.,
the power law distribution from the perspective of
statistical  physics)  and  80/20  rule  in  cities  cannot
be well maintained after the third level in most of
the countries. Moreover, three levels of division are
in  agreement  with  the  common  concept  of  small,
medium,  large  and  mega  cities  in  a  country.  The
cities  in  the  tails  of  three  hierarchies  are  called
small, medium and large cities, and the cities in the
head  of  the  third  level  correspond  to  mega  cities
(Table  3).  The  physical  meanings  behind  the

obtained  hierarchies  of  cities  correspond  to  the
levels of cities, and this finding is undoubtedly cor-
rect. For example, cities such as Paris, London and
Berlin are all included in mega cities. 

For  the  third  question,  previous  studies  show
that  urban  systems  or  geographic  environments
evolve in a self-organized manner, which is recog-
nized  as  the  underlying  reason  for  the  equilibrium
state  of  a  complex  system.  Statistically,  the  self-
organized behavior of cities demonstrates the scal-
ing property. According to the mathematical defini-
tions of scaling, as one looks deeper or “zooms in”
on the complex system, a mini-structure similar to
the  large  structure  will  emerge,  which  is  termed
self-similarity. Here, as we “zoom in” on the city

system using the head/tail division rule, a series of
two-tier  head/tail  hierarchical  structures  can  be
obtained in the three levels (Table 3). Consequently,
the self-similarity and stability of obtained hierarchies
can  be  evaluated  by  whether  they  exhibit  scaling
property  and  how  they  are  in  agreement  with  the
80/20 rule. For example, if the percentages are far
away  from  80/20,  such  as  50/50  percent,  we  can
judge that the hierarchical structure is not well held.
Thus, the more often the percentages agree with the
80/20 rule, the more intact the hierarchical structure
remains through the three levels. 

Based on the above analysis, we can assess the
degree of self-similarity and stability of each coun-
try by checking the scaling property and proximity

countries in three levels. (Note: the heads and tails are the percentages of whole levels, whereas the ratios are percentages 
of heads divided by tails).

to the 80/20 rule of their hierarchies. As mentioned
in Section 3, each hierarchy in Table 3 demonstrates
a  power  law  distribution  (the  scaling  property).
Therefore, the assessment standard is how far each
hierarchy  deviates  away  from  the  80/20  rule.  The
farther the hierarchy deviates, the worse the struc-
ture  is.  Some  of  the  worst  cases  can  easily  read
according to the normalized ratios in Table 3. Malta
bears the worst hierarchical structures, because the
ratio deviates too much in the first level. Similarly,
the  ratios  of  Cyprus,  Lithuania,  Norway  and
Slovenia deviate much in the second level; the ratios
of  Bulgaria,  Estonia,  Finland,  Hungary,  Ireland,
Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia deviate much
in the third level. The distributions of city sizes for

Malta, Latvia and the UK do not follow power law
distributions. The cause for this finding is a matter of
continuing research. For instance, we conjecture that
one of the reasons may be because the UK and Malta
are island countries.

As stated above, blocks and cities are generated
from road networks and are the functional units of a
country.  We  conjecture  that  there  exist  types  of
relationships  between  the  spatial  patterns  or  geo-
graphic configurations of blocks and the economic
or  social  structures  of  the  country.  To  investigate
this idea, we conducted a correlation analysis of the
total  physical  area,  number  of  blocks  and  natural
cities  between  GDP  and  population  for  the  coun-
tries.  We  found  that  the  correlation  coefficients

between the number of blocks and cities and GDP
and population are up to 0.87 (Figure 6). Germany
has  too  many  blocks  compared  with  other  coun-
tries,  and  thus  Germany  is  eliminated  when
calculating the correlation coefficient. The statisti-
cal data for the year 2007 were chosen because this
year contained the most up-to-date information for
all of the countries.

Although  the  cities  have  strong  relationships
with economic factors (i.e., GDP and population) and
play  an  important  role  in  a  country’s  economy  and
other  aspects,  the  extension  of  hierarchical  spatial
structure to economic or social systems requires the
verification of real economic indices. However, such
economic  data  sets  are  very  difficult  to  obtain.
Nevertheless,  the  recent  economic  crisis  in  Greece
could be a proof of its unstable structure in the third
level as shown in Table 3. At the same time, Germany
and France maintained a stable hierarchical structure.
In addition, Switzerland has only 276 natural cities,
but its hierarchical structure is very stable.

5. Conclusions

geographic 

information 

This study develops an across-country comparison
of  hierarchical  spatial  structures  using  blocks  and
cities as the basic geographic representations at the
country  level.  Blocks  and  cities  are  extracted  from
volunteered 
data
(OpenStreetMap) for 29 European countries via data
intensive  geo-computation.  This  study  presents  a
complete  model  for  the  detection  of  heavy-tailed
distributions. The sizes of blocks and cities of the 29
European  countries  are  all  tested  to  follow  heavy-
tailed distributions. Based on the power law distri-
bution of natural cities at the country level and the
head/tail division rule, we obtain the two-tier hier-
archical structure of cities at three different levels.
We contend that the heads and tails at three levels
correspond  to  small,  medium,  large  and  mega
cities. Furthermore, proximity to the 80/20 rule at
each level of hierarchy is chosen as the standard to
assess the degree of its self-similarity and stability
in terms of a self-organized complex system. This
method is a bottom-up approach to categorize and
assess  city  systems.  Moreover,  cities  correlate
strongly  with  two  economic  factors:  population
and GDP at the country level. We conjecture that
the  hierarchical  structure  and  spatial  arrangement
of cities can be indicators of the human and social
systems and structures in a country. 

To  maintain  the  spirit  of  open  source  and
volunteered geographic information, the main data
sets  (the  road  networks  and  blocks)  and  the  core

algorithm source codes we develop in this paper are
shared directly online via the Internet: http://from-
to.hig.se/block. For future work, different types of
geographic representations are to be extracted from
volunteered  geographic  information  to  find  more
spatial  patterns  upon  which  additional  social  and
economic patterns can be explored.

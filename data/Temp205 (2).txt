(Received 4 April 2006; in final form 11 January 2007 )

Using Landsat TM data from 1995 and 2000, changes in the landscape erosion
pattern of the Yellow River Basin, China were analysed. The aim was to improve
our understanding of soil-erosion change so that sustainable land use could be
established. First, a soil-erosion intensity index model was developed to study
soil-erosion intensity change in the study area. Over the 5 years, the areas of weak
erosion, moderate erosion, severe erosion, and very severe erosion all increased.
The area of weak erosion increased dramatically by 7.946105 ha, and areas of
slight erosion and acute erosion decreased by 1.936106 ha and 4.506104 ha,
respectively. The results show that while the intensity of soil erosion has
gradually been decreasing as a whole,
in some regions the soil erosion is
becoming more severe. Based on landscape indices, the pattern of changes in soil
erosion over the past 5 years was analysed. The changes in landscape pattern of
soil erosion resulted from human activities. Analysis showed that human impact
increases fragmentation, having three major effects on landscape pattern,
reduction in patch area, variations in patch shape, and changes in spatial
pattern. In the study area, population growth, farming, governmental policy and
forest degradation are the major factors causing soil erosion change over a 5-year
period.

Introduction

Soil erosion is a serious issue in China, with an estimated 15–20% of the total soil
erosion of the world (Wen 1993). The most seriously eroded area is the Yellow
River Basin. The Yellow River, China’s second largest river, originates in the
northern part of the Bayankala mountains, is 5464 km long, and drains a total area
of 752 443 km2 (figure 1) (Yang et al. 1999). The Yellow River is one of the main
rivers in the world where the impact of human activities has been intensive since
ancient times. Most of the forest was destroyed several hundred years ago, and the
hillslopes were cultivated to provide food for the increasingly expanded population
(Yu 2002, Xu and Cheng 2002). In recent decades, the ecological environment of
the Yellow River Basin has degraded due to both global temperature warming and

a sharper conflict between humans and nature. Environment problems, such as
grassland degeneration, sandy desertification, and water erosion have seriously
affected the regional sustainable development (Ding 2003). We set out to examine
the landscape erosion pattern in the Yellow River Basin today and how it has
changed in recent years. We also wanted to determine the main factors driving soil-
erosion change in recent years. Answers to all these questions will provide some
information about the ecological and environmental background to the erosion
issue. Soil erosion, which may sometimes be triggered and aggravated anthro-
pogenically, is mainly a function of physical and geodynamical conditions. There
is a long history of research on soil erosion within the Yellow River Basin (Jing
et al. 1993, Yang et al. 1999, Xu and Cheng 2002, Lu et al. 2003, Zhu et al. 2004,
Chu et al 2005). But there is still little research on soil erosion over the whole of the
basin. It is essential to understand the patterns of soil erosion to formulate
measures to control it at a scale of breach or drainage basin level.

Satellite images are especially valuable for the study and frequent updating of
maps in inaccessible areas or areas that contain rapidly changing landforms
(Blodget et al. 1991). Satellite remote-sensing techniques were used to acquire geo-
information of a spatio-temporal series and characteristics of the Earth’s surface.
Furthermore, the evolvement process can be analysed by developing quantitative
and parameterized methods (Liu 2000, King et al. 2005). Recently, satellite remote
sensing has been integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) (Lee et al
1999). GIS integrated with satellite remote sensing has provided an excellent
framework for data capture, storage, synthesis, measurement, and analysis, all of
which are essential for eco-environmental analysis (Arthur and Nalle 1997, Ulbricht
and Heckendorff 1998, Mucher et al. 2000, Joerin and Theriault 2001). In order to
study the changes of soil erosion in the Yellow River Basin, the technologies of
remote sensing and GIS were both used. A mathematical methodology for soil-
erosion change was developed, which includes both models for soil-erosion
intensity, and landscape pattern changes of soil erosion. Using these models, the
graphic information characteristics of the soil-erosion spatial pattern and its changes
were analysed. The objectives of the present study are to:

N quantify the characteristics of erosion over the entire Yellow River Basin
mainly based on a systematic analysis of Landsat TM data from 1995 to 2000;
N detect and evaluate the spatial pattern change in soil erosion due to human

2. Materials and methods

2.1 Data acquisition

Data on spatial pattern change in soil erosion, cadastral surveys, and remotely
sensed images data are available from Chinese Resources and Environment
Database (www.cred.org.cn). Data on changes of soil erosion included a soil-
erosion database that represents the soil erosion in 1995 and a database that
represents the soil erosion in 2000 in the Yellow River Basin. All data of soil erosion
were acquired from Landsat TM image by experts’
interpretation. Prior to
interpretation, digital images were processed using standard procedures including
georeferencing, radiometric correction and image enhancement. Georeferencing is
necessary for subsequent GIS data integration. Each scene was georeferenced by
using 20 ground control points (GCPs) identified and selected from a topographic
map at a scale of 1:50 000, followed by using the corrected image as a reference for
image-to-image registration of all other band-images. The resulting root mean-
square errors generated were generally less than one-half of the pixel size. Image
enhancement was performed for better visual discrimination of soil-erosion features.
Some routing processing techniques were interactively tested, including contrast
stretching, histogram equalization, spatial filtering, and additive colour composition
of stretched bands. Interpretation was done using MGE software to identify the soil-
erosion types on the computer screen, based on the understanding of the object’s
spectral reflectance, structure, and other information. Boundaries of the objects
were drawn, and attributes (labels) were added for the polygons to produce the
digital map. Finally, the vector digital maps were compiled and edited to produce
the soil-erosion database.

According to standard regulations of soil-erosion investigation technologies,
along with consideration of
soil-erosion environment, climate environment,
vegetation, and its physiognomy, the soil-erosion types were divided into five
different classes and 12 sub-classes, which included water erosion, wind erosion,
frozen erosion, gravity erosion, and engineer erosion. Concurrently, according to
grade-rules of water erosion and wind erosion (tables 1 and 2), water erosion and
wind erosion were divided into six grades, which included weak erosion, slight
erosion, moderate erosion, severe erosion, very severe erosion, and acute erosion;
and the frozen erosion into four grades, weak erosion, slight erosion, moderate
erosion, and severe erosion. In order to support image interpretation and validation
of soil-erosion classification, a variety of data were used, which included soil type,
DEM, land cover, rivers, and climate, and reconnaissance on the field. Over this
period of field observation, more than a month of fieldwork was invested, guided by
a Global Positioning System (GPS). The research efforts were carried out to

supplement computer-based mapping that assisted in interpretation of the results in
relation to relevant natural and cultural processes.

In order to ensure verification of the accuracy of image interpretation, it was
observed that the smallest plot of the interpreted map corresponded to a scale of
1:100 000 field checking of up to 90%. All data were projected into the Albers
projection system, with parameters including: first standard parallel of 25.0000,
second standard parallel of 47.0000, and the central meridian of 105.0000, and the
ellipsoid was the KRASOVSKY ellipsoid. Using ArcGIS software, all data were
transferred into 100 m6100 m raster data.

2.2 Soil Erosion Intensity Index Model (SEIIM)

Soil-erosion intensity is an integrated representation of the degree of erosion
affected by different erosion types. Various erosion types were graded to enable
comparison among the different erosion types and to what degree the soil-erosion
impacts have on the eco-environment. For example, the weak erosion intensity
could be graded as 0, light erosion, middle erosion, intensity erosion, and more
intensity erosion, and acute erosion could be graded as 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10,
respectively. Furthermore, the gravity erosion and engineer erosion could be graded
as 4. In other words, the more severe the soil erosion is, the higher the grade value
assigned. In order to study the regional differences in soil erosion, a soil-erosion
intensity index model (SEIIM) was defined to quantify the eroded degree for
different regions. The equation form of SEIIM is:

n

Ij~100: X
i~1

Ci:Ai

(cid:1)Sj

where Ij represents the soil-erosion intensity comprehensive index in the jth region,
Ci is the grade of ith soil-erosion type, Ai is the ith type soil-erosion area in the jth
region, Sj is the total area of the jth region, and n is the number of the soil-erosion
type. The soil-erosion intensity change parameter (DI b2a) that expressed the change
in the intensity index of soil erosion was given by:

DIb{a~Ib{Ia

where Ib and Ia both represent soil-erosion intensity comprehensive indexes at time

points b and a, respectively. These relationships were comprehensive representations
of soil-erosion intensity. If the parameter DI b2a.0, the soil erosion is continuing to
develop in the region; on the contrary, the soil erosion is regressing.

In order to understand the regional soil-erosion changes and their characteristic
differences, the soil-erosion intensity comprehensive index (SEICI) was calculated
for the administrative districts in Yellow River Basin, and a regional distribution
map for the soil-erosion intensity was made using ArcGIS software.

2.3 Landscape metrics of soil erosion

Soil erosion is made up of patches, and the spatial distribution of these patches is
called a spatial pattern. A patch is a term fundamental to landscape ecology and is
defined as a relatively homogeneous area that differs from its surroundings. Patches
have a definite shape and spatial configuration, and can be described composition-
ally by internal variables such as number of trees, number of tree species, height of
trees, or other similar measurements (Forman 1995). By analysing the spatial
landscape patterns of soil erosion, we can better understand the laws of soil-erosion
changes. The landscape pattern is an integrative measure of an ecosystem’s ability to
protect habitat, prevent environmental degradation, and support other natural
processes (Chuvieco 1999, Gulinck et al. 2000, Haaren 2002, Leitao and Ahern 2002,
Papadimitriou 2002). Furthermore, the concept of landscape ecology provides an
integrated opportunity to understand the relationship between landscape pattern
and changes in environmental conditions due to human activities. Quantification of
landscape patterns through various landscape metrics could be used to describe how
a landscape changes over time (Yue et al. 2003). This information could then be used
to evaluate alternative soil-erosion management and environmental-conservation
for planning efficient approaches to spatial
strategies. This was very useful
development of landscapes, which can minimize adverse effects on the environment.
Choices for appropriate landscape metrics are dependent upon the scale of analysis
and objectives of the study (Turner and Gardner 1991, Turner et al. 2001, Keane et
al. 2002). In this study, eight metrics were chosen for the soil-erosion pattern
analysis, which include number of patches (NP), perimeter of patches (POP), area of
landscape diversity index (H),
patches (AP);
landscape dominant
and
index
landscape broken index (C). The definition and calculation of each landscape
metric are given in table 3. These landscape pattern metrics involve the qualitative
(e.g. soil-erosion type) and quantitative (e.g. number and size of patches)
measurements which express the characteristics of the landscape as a whole
(Turner et al. 2001).

Using the ArcGIS software and statistic software SPSS, the ArcGIS AML macro-
program was designed to calculate the spatial landscape indices. The AML macro-
program in this study was used to ensure that a vast number of metrics could be
calculated. The indices were divided into two groups of metrics. The first is class
level, which is defined as each patch type in the respective landscape mosaic. Many
landscape metrics could be highly correlated, so it was important
to select
uncorrelated metrics. In the analysis of the landscape structure of the Yellow River
Basin at the class level, six indices were selected, which include the number of
patches (NP), perimeter of patches (POP), mean perimeter of patches (MPOP), area

3. Results and discussion

3.1 Soil-erosion data and changes from 1995 to 2000

The spatial distribution of soil erosion of the Yellow River Basin in 1995 and 2000 is
shown in figure 2. Remote sensing analysis indicates that the main types of soil
erosion are water erosion, wind erosion, and frozen erosion. In 1995, the largest
eroded area is water erosion, which amounts to 74.13% of the total area, which is
distributed widely in the Yellow River Basin. Wind erosion, located mainly in the
north-east Yellow River basin, the second largest erosion type, accounted for about
16.37% of the total area of basin and was especially concentrated in the Municipality
of Inner-Mongolia and Ningxia. Frozen erosion was the third largest erosion type,
accounting for about 9.46% of the total area, and mainly distributed in the west of
the Yellow River Basin. Soil-erosion types and its intension changes in recent 5 years
are shown in table 4 and figure 3. Statistical analysis indicated that when comparing
the soil erosion in 1995 versus erosion in 2000 areas of weak erosion, moderate
erosion, severe erosion, and very severe erosion have all increased. Weak erosion
increased by 7.946105 ha, which was the fastest, moderate erosion increased by

5.996105 ha, and severe erosion increased by 4.966105 ha. On the other hand,
slight erosion and acute erosion decreased by 1.936106 ha and 4.506104 ha,
respectively. Based on the process study results,
it should be emphasized that
moderate erosion, severe erosion, and very severe erosion may proceed very rapidly
from incipient stages of either shallow slope failures or rill erosion. Hence,
prevention of environmental deterioration is still important for the future.

3.2 Spatial pattern change in soil-erosion intensity

Using the SEIIM model, the SEICI was calculated for each county after the soil-
erosion map was overlaid with the administrate boundary map of Yellow River
Basin. Figure 4 shows the spatial pattern changes of soil-erosion intensity for each
county in Yellow River Basin. The SEICI is highest between 660 and 791 in the
mid-eastern part of the Basin, especially in the Fugu, Hequ, Jia, Ling, and Daning
counties. This reflects the fact that the degree of erosion in these regions was
categorized as severe, and the soil and water loss even more severe. The regions
where the value of SEICI is between 0 and 131 lie to the west and south of the
Yellow River Basin, including Qinghai province and part of Shanxi and Henan
province. These regions have a good vegetation cover, and their erosion degree was
categorized as weak and slight. Concurrently, it can be seen that the value change
areas of SEICI lie mainly to the west and north of Yellow River Basin. In the west,
the SEICI is elevated (red area in figure 4(b)), including parts of Qinghai province
and Inner-Mongolia: this reflects the fact that in these regions human activity is
aggrandized, forestland and grassland are decreased, and soil and water loss was
more severe, all of which resulted in the SEICI being elevated—yet there are still
some regions where SEICI was reduced because of the cover ratio elevation of
forestland and grassland (see green area in figure 4(b)). Therefore, the intensity of
soil erosion has been gradually decreased as a whole, but in some regions the soil
erosion became more severe from 1995 to 2000.

3.3 Landscape metrics by soil-erosion type

Numerous landscape metrics were computed for each soil-erosion class through the
use of the AML- macro-program. Area, perimeter, and patch shapes of soil-erosion
types and their respective changes in landscape metrics at class level can be seen in
table 5. At the end of the 1990s, there were 25 278 slight erosion patches and 24 342

moderate erosion patches observed in the study area, which made up 47.59% of total
patches in the study area. The mean patch area of weak erosion was the largest at
16.32 km2 in the study area, followed by acute erosion at 7.23 km2. Concurrently,
the mean patch area of severe erosion is smallest at 4.52 km2 in the study area,
followed by the very severe erosion at 4.84 km2. Yet fractal dimensions of severe
erosion and very severe erosion are 1.8794 and 1.8737, respectively, which reflects
the patch shapes of severe erosion and very severe erosion, which are the most
complex. Analysis of the data indicates that the weak erosion was a basic type for all
landscape types, whose area is the largest and whose distribution is slice and
continuous. In the comparison of landscape indices at the end of the 1990s with
those in the mid-1990s, while the number of weak erosion patches, slight erosion
patches, moderate erosion patches, and acute erosion patches have all decreased, the
numbers of severe erosion patches and very severe erosion patches have increased.
Concurrently, the mean patch area of weak erosion increased from 15.16 km2 to
16.32 km2 , while the fractal dimension decreased from 1.7640 to 1.7571. Such
growth and decline changes in landscape pattern of soil erosion resulted from
human activities,
increases fragmentation,
resulting in three major effects on landscape pattern, which include a reduction in
patch area, variations in patch shape, and changes in spatial pattern. In recent years,
large efforts have been made in soil and water conservation, which have resulted in

thus showing that human impact

weak erosion, increasing by 7.946105 ha but also resulting in newly produced weak
erosion that tended to connect with the old weak erosion that finally merged.
Consequently, the patch size increased, and the degree of fragmentation evidently
declined. Meanwhile, another highly variable patch type was acute erosion, the
mean patch area of the acute erosion increased from 7.09 km2 to 7.23 km2, and the
fractal dimension decreased from 1.8378 to 1.8358, which displayed a concentrated
process in the study area. As a result, the treatment of soil and water loss and
desertification are still important questions for us to continue to investigate.

Figure 5 shows the landscape metrics at landscape level. According to these
landscape indices of spatial patterns, the spatial distribution maps of these landscape
indices, and changes, a clear picture of the interference degree caused by human
activities can be assessed. Over the past 5 years, the number of patches in the study-
area prefecture declined, while the mean patch area increased, showing a trend
towards a decreasingly fine-grained landscape. From these landscape indices and
their change maps, we also can see that overall the landscape diversity and
homogeneity increased, while the landscape dominant and broken index declined,
thus revealing that the spatial distribution of patches became more continuous. In
addition, the broken index became smaller and the homogeneity index became
larger, illustrating that the spatial distribution of various patches in the landscape
became clumped, and one or several patch types had an even greater connectivity.
The results also indicate that with increasing intensity of human influence, the
diversity index, homogeneity index and broken index all tend to increase, while the
dominant index tends to decrease. However, when the natural landscape had been
the diversity index,
changed completely by an increase in human activities,
homogeneity index, and broken index all tend to decrease, while the dominant
index tends to increase. For instance, in some regions severely subjected to human
activities, such as Linyi, Pinglu, and Fengqiu county, the degree of erosion is weak,
and the land-use type is farmland, with very clear trends.

3.4 Driving factors of soil-erosion change

By studying the soil-erosion dynamics and spatial pattern changes, the results have
shown that the intensity of soil erosion had gradually decreased as a whole, but in
some regions the soil erosion has become more severe in the last 5 years. Many
factors have been affecting the patterns of erosion in the study area, such as
structural geology, meteorological conditions, Yellow River sediment discharge,
human activity, and forest degradation, among others. Yet, over a period of 5 years,
we attribute the driving forces of the soil-erosion change to the rapid population
growth, farming, governmental policy, and vegetation degradation.

3.4.1 Human-induced erosion. There are natural processes of erosion levelling and
movement of substances controlled by physical factors. Soil and water losses
occurred as a result of natural processes but also human activities. When natural
erosion is intensified by human activities, it is called accelerated erosion. Soil erosion
in the Yellow River Basin is a combination of natural erosion and accelerated
erosion (Shi and Shao 2000). Accelerated erosion arises
from cultivation,
uncontrolled development, overgrazing, mining, road construction, and other
human activities. In the mid-1990s, the total population of the Yellow River Basin
was 97.8 million, but at the end of the 1990s, the total population was 107 million,
and the peasant population as a percentage of the total population was 76.58%. The

average annual growth rate was 1.88% over 5 years. In order to meet the demands of
food supplies, an increasing amount of forestland or grassland has been reclaimed as
farmland. Thus, the rate of vegetation coverage has decreased from 61.77% to

60.93%. Zheng et al. (1993) studied the characteristics of natural erosion in
woodlands and accelerated erosion after development of the Ziwuling forest area.
They found that in woodlands, soil erosion was 1.0–14.4 t km22 year21, yet after
development associated with human activities, it increased to 9700–21 700 t km22
year21. This could explain why, in some regions, the soil erosion has became more
severe in the last 5 years.

Impacts of governmental

land-use policies. In recent years,

increasing
3.4.2
attention has been focused on soil-erosion control and sustainable agricultural
development in the Yellow River Basin by the Chinese central government. To
reduce soil erosion, improve the ecological and environmental status, and promote
the development of rural areas in western China, several sloping croplands have
been converted to woodlands and grasslands as a part of the governmental effort.
The central government initiated a nationwide cropland set-aside programme
known as the Grain-for-Green Programme in 1999. The programme required that
those sloping arable lands with a slope steeper than 25u be converted to woodland
and pasture. This programme is believed to be one of
the world’s largest
conservation projects. The project not only plays a vital role in maintaining the
ecological security, but also promotes regional sustainable development. The
cultivation of slope land is a major factor associated with serious soil and water
erosion. In the Loess Plateau in the Yellow River Basin, 50% of the total arable land
is on slopes, and up to 70% of arable land is on slopes in the loess hilly and gully
areas. Research indicates that erosion increases substantially when the slope is
steeper than 25u (Tang et al. 1998). Therefore, at the end of the 1990s, some slopes
steeper than 25u had been returned to forest and grassland. This resulted overall in a
gradual decrease in intensity of soil-erosion in the Yellow River Basin over 5 years.

3.4.3 Vegetation factors. Vegetation is an important factor affecting soil erosion.
Areas with serious soil and water loss are often areas also where natural vegetation
had been destroyed and the environment had been degraded. On the other hand, in
areas with copious natural vegetation, normally little or no erosion occurs, even if
the geomorphology is hilly with precipitous slopes and gullies. Over several decades,
most of the natural vegetation in the Yellow River Basin had been severely
destroyed, especially on the Loess Plateau. Presently, remote-sensing monitoring
showed that forest cover was only 13.03% and was even as low as 3% in some areas.
Grass cover was only 47.9%, and grass cover decreased by 0.59% over 5 years. The
destruction of forest and grass made the soil more susceptible to erosion. It has been
calculated (Yang et al. 1999) that 8–12% of soil erosion has been caused by
deforestation. Thus, in some areas, the destruction of vegetation resources has
caused serious soil and water loss.

4. Conclusions

Data for soil erosion were acquired from Landsat TM from 1995 to 2000 and were
mainly used to analyse the changing pattern of soil erosion in the Yellow River
Basin with GIS tools. Several main conclusions can be drawn:

1. During the period 1995–2000, weak erosion increased by 7.946105 ha (which
was the fastest), moderate erosion increased by 5.996105 ha, and severe
erosion increased by 4.966105 ha. However, slight erosion and acute erosion
decreased by 1.936106 ha and 4.506104 ha, respectively. Meanwhile, the

intensity of soil erosion gradually decreased as a whole, but in some regions
the soil erosion became more severe over the past 5 years. In areas such as
Fugu, Hequ, Jia, Ling, and Daning counties, the soil and water loss was more
severe over 5 years.

2. Growth and decline changes in landscape pattern of soil erosion have resulted
from human activities. Analyses have shown that human impact has increased
fragmentation, resulting in three major effects in landscape patterns: a
reduction in patch area, variations in patch shape, and changes in spatial
pattern. As human activities in the study areas, diversity index, homogeneity
index, and broken index have all increased, the dominant index has decreased.
However, when the natural landscape has been changed completely by human
activities, as the disturbances from humans increased, the diversity index,
homogeneity index, and broken index have all decreased, as the disturbances
from human activities increased.

3. There are many factors that affect the spatial pattern change in soil erosion,
but over a period of 5 years, we attribute the driving forces of spatial change
in soil erosion to rapid population growth, farming, governmental policy, and
vegetation degradation.

4. Using RS and GIS technologies, this study has also indicated landscape
pattern changes in the Yellow River Basin, which were investigated at a high
geospatial resolution. In contrast to normative approaches, the outcomes as
presented here are more likely to reflect the local situation, and thus more
likely to be accepted by local governments and local communities who would
implement recommended policies in this manuscript.

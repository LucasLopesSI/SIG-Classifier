Here  we  describe  and  apply  a  semi-automated,  object-based  method  for  extracting  vector-building
footprint polygons from aerial photographs (orthophotos) within urban settings. The approach integrates
the  use  of  high  resolution  orthophotos  and  image  segmentation  software  and  is  compared  with  methods
using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) as the source data input. LiDAR data gives the best results with
less processing, but is not widely used by municipalities due to the expense. Results from semi-automated
image  segmentation  of  the  orthophotos  showed  a  high  accuracy  between  extracted  building  segments 
and  reference  building  footprints  for  two  study  sites,  comparable  to  those  achieved  using  LiDAR  data. 
We  recommend  image  acquisition  during  summer  months  with  a  resolution  of  10  cm  by  10  cm.  When 
data  acquisition  budgets  are  limited,  combining  ancillary  GIS  on  roads  with  a  semi-automated  and 
object-based  segmentation  approach  is  a  best  practice  strategy  for  land  cover  feature  extraction  and 
change quantification.

Ici, nous décrivons et mettons en application une méthode semi-automatisée basée sur les objets pour
l’extraction  des  polygones  d’empreintes  d’édifices  vectorielles  à  partir  de  photographies  aériennes
(orthophotos)  en  milieu  urbain.  L’approche  combine  l’utilisation  d’orthophotos  à  haute  résolution  et 
d’un  logiciel  de  segmentation  des  images.  On  la  compare  à  des  méthodes  qui  utilisent  la  technologie 
LiDAR comme source d’entrée de données. Les données LiDAR offrent les meilleurs résultats avec moins
de  traitement,  mais  ne  sont  pas  grandement  utilisées  par  les  municipalités  en  raison  du  coût  qu’elles 
engendrent.  Les résultats de la segmentation semi-automatisée des orthophotos ont démontré une grande
exactitude  entre  les  segments  d’édifices  extraits  et  les  empreintes  d’édifices,  exactitude  comparable  aux
résultats  atteints  en  utilisant  les  données  de  la  technologie  LiDAR.  Nous  recommandons  les  images 
recueillies pendant les mois d’été avec une résolution de 10 X 10 cm. Lorsque les budgets d’acquisition sont
limités,  la  meilleure  stratégie  est  d’avoir  recours  à  une  combinaison  de  données  SIG  auxiliaires  sur 
les  routes  et  de  l’approche  de  segmentation  semi-automatisée  basée  sur  les  objets  pour  l’extraction  des 
éléments de la couverture terrestre et la quantification des changements.

Accurate and up-to-date building footprints are

purposes  in  urban  planning,  utility  management
and  general  land  development  monitoring  needs

The  current  state-of-the-art  method  for  build-

building  footprints  to  be  mapped  with  semi-auto-
mated  approaches.  Although  the  results  of  these
approaches  are  encouraging,  the  use  of  remotely
sensed imagery for tasks such as automated feature
extraction  in  urban  settings  remains  challenging,
due  to  the  diverse  range  of  materials,  including
concrete,  asphalt,  metal,  plastic,  glass,  shingles,
water, grass, shrubs, trees, and soil, that are found
in urban landscapes [

Though  likely  to  change  as  LiDAR  data
become  more  routinely  collected  and  made  avail-
able  through  open  data  portals,  to  date,  the  most
commonly  used  approach  to  mapping  features  in
urban  environments  has  been  to  use  spatially
detailed  satellite  imagery,  such  as  QuickBird 
Mayunga  et  al.
(e.g., 
[2007]).  A  recent  review  of  techniques  indicated
that  it  is  possible  to  identify  larger  buildings 
(>50 m2) and that results from 3D building recon-
struction are promising [

In general, pixel-based approaches to classify-
ing  building  footprints  from  imagery  have  proven
to  be  challenging  and  have  lacked  a  robustness, 
due  to  the  complexity  of  structure  and  design  in
Kim
urban  environments  [
and  Muller

Lin  and  Nevatia

1999].  Studies  such  as  Myint  et  al.
[2011],  report  that  object-based  classification 
performs  better  than  pixel-based  classification
when  identifying  urban  land  cover  classes  from
multi-spectral imagery. In fact, most current multi-
spectral  imagery,  building  detection  algorithms
now  rely  on  object-based  segmentation,  with 
ongoing research emphasizing how to use spectral

from other objects. 

Methods for extracting building footprints tend
to  use  object-based  approaches,  while  results  are
often  evaluated  at  the  pixel  level.  Building  foot-
print  objects  can  be  evaluated  at  the  object  level,
but  there  is  no  unique  way  of  determining  if  a
detected and referenced building object overlaps or

isons between multiple polygon data sets tend to be

Over  the  last  decade,  technical  developments
in mapping have been paralleled by an intensified
Wridt
general  community  interest  in  maps  (e.g., 
[2010]; 
[2012]).  Popularization
of GIS technologies through modern culture (e.g.,
Google  Maps)  and  widespread  use  of  commercial
2012], has made
GIS (e.g., Esri software) [
online,  up-to-date  urban  mapping  a  requirement 
for  many  communities.  While  three-dimensional
data  are  ideal  for  object-based  mapping  of  urban
land  cover  features,  operational  constraints  often
limit  communities  to  working  with  available 
data  sources.  In  some  cases,  the  only  available
imagery is cost-effective orthophotography, which
may  have  sub-one-metre  spatial  resolution,  but 
less  spectral  information  than  satellite  imagery.
Specifically,  orthophotos  lack  information  from 
the near-infrared range that is essential in separat-
ing  vegetation  from  non-vegetation.  Nevertheless,
it  is  important  that  all  communities,  and  not  just
those with the ability to fund acquisition of 3D or
satellite  data,  including  that  of  LiDAR,  be  able 
to  accurately  map  their  urban  landscape  with  the
data available to them [

Krauß et al.

2008]. 

In many instances, communities cannot afford
to collect high-resolution multi-spectral and LiDAR
data for the mapping of urban landscapes and as a
result, orthophotos are used as a substitute. Given
better data options, recent research has not empha-
sized  the  use  of  orthophotos  for  semi-automated
building  footprint  extraction,  however,  there  are
practical  benefits  in  the  detailed  spatial  resolution
(i.e.,  0.1  m)  and  limited  spectral  resolution  of
orthophotos  for  operational  mapping  projects.
Nevertheless, there is still the need for an accurate
and timely, as well as low-cost, approach to achieve
adequate  mapping  of  building  footprints  in  urban
areas. Hence, the goal of the research presented in
this  paper  was  to  develop  the  foundations  for  a 
best  practice  object-based  and  semi-automated
method,  for  extracting  urban  building  footprints
from  digital  orthophotos.  Our  objective  was  to
develop  functional  workflows  that  can  be  applied
when communities are required to map urban fea-
tures,  such  as  building  footprints,  using  available

and  mixed  data  resources.  To  accomplish  this,  an
object-based  approach  was  developed  using  open
data and freely available image segmentation soft-
ware  and  commercial  ArcGIS  desktop  GIS 
software. For comparison purposes, building foot-
prints  were  also  extracted  using  a  pixel-based
analysis  of  LiDAR  data,  available  through  the 
open  data  policy  of  the  city  of  Nanaimo,  British
Columbia,  Canada.  Results  focusing  on  building
footprint  extraction  from  the  two  approaches 
and  associated  workflows,  were  compared  and
evaluated. 

2. Data and Study Area

Two study areas were selected from Nanaimo,
a  city  on  the  west  coast  of  British  Columbia,
Canada.  Study  Site  1  is  located  at  49o9’39”N 
longitude  123o57’40”W  (Figure  1)  and  is  0.09
km2,  while  Study  Site  2  is  located  at  49o9’32”N
longitude  123o57’19”W  (Figure  2)  and  is  0.10
km2.  Both  sites  were  chosen  purposively,  as  they
contain  mixed  urban  features,  including  houses,
roads,  and  trees,  as  well  as  variable  shadows  cast
by  houses  and  trees  based  upon  the  time  of  data

ing bare soil and vegetation. 

Data  used  for  this  study  include  orthophotos,
LiDAR,  reference  buildings  footprints,  and  road
data  (see  Table  1  for  technical  details).  The  first
three  data  sets  were  acquired  from  the  City  of
Nanaimo website, licensed under the Open Govern-
ment  License  —  Nanaimo,  and  were  accessible
data.
through  the  Nanaimo  Data  Catalogue  (
nanaimo.ca

). To address the impact seasonality had
on segmentation results, orthophotos were acquired
for two different temporal time frames; one in June
2012,  and  one  in  March  2009.  Both  orthophotos
captured  visible  wavelengths  from  the  red,  green,
and blue portions of the spectrum and were stored
using a pixel resolution of 0.10 m by 0.10 m. 

The  LiDAR  data  were  acquired  in  2009.
Overall point density in the study area was approx-
imately 4 points/m2. We excluded points marked as
“overlap”  from  the  edge  of  the  overlap  between
swaths,  to  the  edge  of  a  swath  and  included  only
last return points. This resulted in a nominal point
density of 2.4 points/m2, while local point densities
varied  from  0.25  to  6.75  points/m2. With  the  aim 
of assessing comparable methodological approach-
es  on  both  the  orthophoto  and  LiDAR  data,  we 
converted  the  point  cloud  to  a  raster.  A  0.75  m 
resolution was selected, as this was determined to
be  the  highest  resolution  at  which  derived  rasters
would have the fewest number of empty cells.

Three  raster  products  were  derived  from  the
LiDAR and used in this study to delineate building
footprints,  namely  a  DSM,  a  digital  elevation
model  (DEM),  and  a  height  above  ground  model
(HAG).  The  DSM  was  created  from  first  return
points,  with  each  cell  being  assigned  the  average
elevation  of  the  points  falling  within  that  cell.  A
simple  fill  method  was  applied  to  eliminate  small

voids in the DSM. The DEM was created from last
return  points,  excluding  overlap,  using  triangula-
tion and a natural neighbour interpolation. The HAG
is the difference between the DSM and the DEM.

The  circa  2012  road  network,  for  both  study
Road

sites,  was  acquired  from  Statistics  Canada  [
Network  File

2012],  and  it  depicted  the  extensive
national  road  network,  ranging  from  highways 
and expressways to local and arterial roads. Due to
the  temporal  difference  between  the  orthophotos
and the reference building dataset, manual editing
was  undertaken  to  create  comparable  2009  and
2012  reference  datasets.  Additionally,  physically
small  and  temporary  structures,  such  as  sheds, 
were excluded from the analysis.

3. Methodology

3.1 Building Footprint Extraction
from Orthophotos

www.imageseg.com

Using  an  object-based  image  segmentation
approach, we first developed a workflow for extract-
ing  building  footprints  from  the  orthophotos.
Image  segmentation  was  performed  using  the
freely  available  software  tool,  Berkley  Image
Segmentation (BIS; 
). Initially,
every  pixel  in  the  image  was  considered  to  be  an
object or segment, and these segments were merged
together  in  an  iterative  process  based  on  a  user-
defined  scale  threshold,  shape,  and  compactness,
until  the  desired  level  of  heterogeneity  within 
each  segment  was  reached.  The  scale  parameter
determined the maximum allowable heterogeneity
of each segment; therefore, as the scale parameter
increased,  so  did  the  average  object  size.  The 
shape parameter determined the influence of colour
or  spectral  homogeneity  on  the  shape  of  each 

235

segment,  thus  as  the  shape  parameter  increased, 
the  influence  of  spectral  homogeneity  on  object
shape decreased. The compactness parameter deter-
mined whether the segment became more compact
or  smooth  [
2001].  These  values  varied
image  to  image  and  were  dependent  on  the  char-
acteristics  of  the  objects  being  extracted.  For  a
detailed  review  of  the  segmentation  process  see

The BIS was run in batch mode, using a range
of parameter values as exploratory analysis aids in
selecting  appropriate  parameters  for  a  specific
2001]. Starting with a thresh-
study area [
old value of 10, shape value of 0.5, and compact-
ness  value  of  0.5,  the  threshold  parameter  was
incremented by 5 until an optimal threshold value
was determined by visual inspection as the closest
mapping  of  the  boundary  of  buildings  in  each  of 

236

the  study  areas  (irregular  and  commercial  versus
regular  and  residential).  The  shape  and  compact-
ness  values  were  then  adjusted  (starting  at  0  and
incrementing  by  0.1  every  iteration)  until  optimal
values  that  best  captured  building  rooftops  were
established.  The  optimal  parameter  set  for  each
image  was  determined,  again,  through  visual
inspection,  to  determine  which  one  best  captured
building rooftop shape and size. This approach was
based on 
[2000], who argued that
no  image  segmentation  can  be  deemed  successful 
if it does not satisfy the human eye in the detection
of  objects  of  interest.  A  threshold  value  of  60,  a
shape  value  of  0.5,  and  a  compactness  value  of 
0.9,  were  applied  to  both  study  sites.  The  para-
meters  selected  created  segments  with  relatively
straight  edges,  which  were  useful  for  delineating
buildings.  Outputs  from  BIS  included  polygons
representing  image  segments  and  statistics  for 
each image segment. 

Once the image was segmented, the individual
segments  were  analyzed  in  ArcGIS  for  spectral
properties, using segment statistics output by BIS,
and a model was built to remove road, shadow, and
vegetation segments. To remove road segments, the
model  was  extended  to  buffer  the  road  network
polyline, and all segments or segment portions that
intersected with that buffer were removed. The size
of the buffer was determined by the analyst based
on the average or typical (mode) road width in the
image.  Shadows  were  removed  based  on  image
spectral  properties,  where  all  segments  with  a 
mean  green  band  value  of  less  than  a  shadow
threshold  were  removed.  The  shadow  threshold 
can be set as the mean or mode value selected for a
representative  sample  of  shadow  pixels.  Lastly,
vegetation  segments  were  identified  and  removed
based on a green ratio (Gr; Equation (1)), calculat-
ed using the mean value of the green (G), red (R),
and blue (B) bands of each segment, where
=        G
                       R + G + B

Segments with a green ratio less than a vegeta-
tion  threshold,  were  classified  as  non-vegetation
and  removed.  The  remaining  segments  were  then
edited  manually,  removing  any  remaining  non-
building  segments,  and  the  final  segments  were
aggregated  into  building  polygons  and  the  edges
straightened to create final building footprints. 

Building footprint segmentation was done for
Study Sites 1 and 2 using both the 2012 and 2009
orthophotos. The 2012 photos were most consistent
for  use  with  ancillary  data  sets  and  were  the  pri-

mary data used for comparison with LiDAR data.
The 2012 orthophotos were collected in June, when
green  vegetation  was  clearly  visible.  In  contrast,
the 2009 orthophotos were captured in March and
had  limited  greenness.  To  compare  the  impact  of
seasonality on image capture, both 2009 and 2012
images  were  segmented.  Based  on  typical  road
widths, the road buffer distance at Site 1 was 10 m
and 8 m at Site 2. Through an exploratory visuali-
zation, the shadow threshold was 60 and 50 at Site
1  and  Site  2,  respectively,  while  the  vegetation
threshold was 0.38 for both sites.

3.2 Building Footprint Extraction
from LiDAR

For  comparison,  a  second  pixel-based  or
threshold-based  approach,  which  utilized  the 
HAG  raster  derived  from  the  three-dimensional
LiDAR  data,  was  applied  to  the  two  study  sites.
The  workflow  was  implemented  entirely  within 
the  ArcGIS  environment  using  ModelBuilder
(Figure  4).  A  user-defined  height  threshold  was
applied to the HAG. Pixels with heights above the
threshold  represented  buildings  and  vegetation.
The  vegetation  was  removed  using  a  user-defined
Gr threshold, where Gr is calculated on a pixel-by-
pixel basis rather than by segments, as described in
Section  3.1.  The  remaining  segments  were  then 
edited manually  to  remove  any  remaining  non-
building  segments.  The  final  segments  were 
aggregated  into  building  polygons  and  the  edges
straightened to create rectilinear building footprints
using the same approach employed in Section 3.1. 

3.3 Accuracy and Time Efficiency
Evaluation

Both  building  footprint  extraction  methods
were  evaluated  at  the  pixel  level,  using  a  series 
Shufelt  and
of  statistical  parameters  defined  by 
McKeown

[1993], which evaluate the degree of over-
lap  between  the  detected  and  referenced  building
footprints. For comparison, detected and referenced
building footprints were converted to raster images,
respectively, using the same resolution as the input
orthophotos  (0.10  m/pixel),  where  each  pixel  was
classified  as  either  building  or  non-building.  The
two rasters were then combined to produce a count,
where each pixel was classified as either true posi-
tive  (TP  —  both  detected  and  referenced  rasters
identify  a  building),  true  negative  (TN  —  both
detected  and  referenced  rasters  identify  a  non-
building),  false  positive  (FP  —  detected  raster

identifies a building, referenced raster does not), or
false negative (FN — referenced raster identifies a
building, detected raster does not).

From these counts, four metrics were defined

as follows: 

•

namely branch factor (Equation (2)), which
measures the degree to which a system over-
detects buildings; 

•

• miss  factor  (Equation  (3)),  which  measures
the degree to which the system under-detects
buildings; 
completeness  (Equation  (4)),  which  gives 
the percent of reference buildings that over-
lap the detected buildings (i.e., the percent of
correctly detected building pixels); 

•

To achieve 100 % quality, every pixel had to be

correctly classified.

To assess the accuracy of orthophoto segmen-
tation  and  the  impact  of  image  seasonality  on 
methods,  we  compared  both  the  2009  and  2012
data sets to a reference building footprint data set
that was manually edited to represent the buildings
present  in  both  time  periods.  To  compare  the
orthophoto  semi-automated  object-based  segmen-
tation  approach  to  the  optimal  scenario  of  using
LiDAR data, the building footprints extracted from
LiDAR  were  also  compared  to  the  pre-existing
building footprint maps. 

Operationally,  a  semi-automated  digitization
method is only beneficial if it saves time or is more
accurate  than  manual  approaches.  Preliminary 
time  trials  were  conducted  on  Study  Site  1  using
the  2012  orthophoto.  Two  users  familiar  with  the
ArcGIS  environment,  but  not  to  the  proposed 
methods, were timed when: 

1) manually  digitizing  all  the  buildings  from 

the orthophoto; 

2) running the orthophoto method; and 
3) running the LiDAR method. 

4. Results

The  evaluation  metrics  results  for  both  study
sites,  using  orthophotos  from  2009,  2012  and

LiDAR  data,  are  presented  in  Table  2.  Similar 
levels  of  accuracy  were  achieved  for  both  Study
Sites  1  and  2.  The  2012  orthophotos  and  LiDAR
data  had  similar  values  for  accuracy  metrics,
whereas  the  2009  orthophoto  yielded  somewhat
lower completeness and overall quality. 

Results  of  building  footprint  delineation  are
mapped for the 2012 orthophoto and LiDAR data
sets in Figure 5. At Site 1, the orthophoto method,
when  applied  to  imagery  from  2012,  achieved  a
branch  factor  and  miss  factor  of  0.08,  while  the
LiDAR  method  achieved  branch  and  miss  factor
values of 0.09. At Site 2, results were less uniform.
The orthophoto method, when applied to the 2012
imagery,  had  a  lower  branch  factor  of  0.07,  but  a
higher  miss  factor  of  0.09,  while  the  LiDAR
method  had  a  higher  branch  factor  of  0.10  and  a
lower  miss  factor  of  0.08.  Both  the  2012  ortho-
photo  and  LiDAR  data  sets  at  both  study  sites
achieved  the  same  completeness  value  of  92%,
while  the  orthophoto  method,  applied  to  the  2012
time  period,  achieved  an  overall  quality  metric  of
86% and 87% for Study Site 1 and 2, respectively,
which  was  slightly  higher  than  the  85%  achieved
by the LiDAR method at both study sites. 

At  both  sites,  the  LiDAR  method  (Figure 
5b,  d)  produced  more  false  positives  than  the
orthophoto  method.  At  Site  2,  the  orthophoto
method (Figure 5c) produced more false negatives,
meaning it failed to delineate buildings that existed

in the reference dataset. For example, the orthopho-
to method failed to delineate an entire building in
the bottom right corner of the image (Figure 5c), as
well  as  portions  of  several  other  buildings.  The
LiDAR method at Site 2 (Figure 5d) also failed to
detect several sections of buildings at the top of the
image.

The influence of seasonality on the orthophoto
method can be observed by comparing orthophoto
results for the two dates (Table 2). The orthophoto
collected  in  March  of  2009  contains  substantially
less green vegetation than the June 2012 image and
resulted in higher branching and miss factor values
for both Study Site 1 (0.12 and 0.17) and Study Site

2  (0.14  and  0.12),  as  well  as  lower  completeness
and quality metrics for Study Site 1 (86% and 78%)
and Study Site 2 (89% and 79%).

When  the  total  implementation  time  for  each
of these methods was evaluated, it was found that
both the manual digitizing (average of 44 minutes)
and  orthophoto  methods  (average  53  minutes)
required a similar amount of time to complete, while
the LiDAR method required substantially less time
(average  11  minutes).  When  the  manual  editing
time within the ArcGIS environment only was con-
sidered,  however,  the  orthophoto  method  required
less dedicated user time (estimated 35 minutes).

5. Discussion

LiDAR  data  will  provide  the  best  results  for
mapping building footprints, with the least amount
of editing and post-processing required. However,
many  municipalities  do  not  have  access  to  high 
resolution  multi-spectral  or  LiDAR  data  and 
continue  to  use  orthophotos  for  building  footprint
extraction. Our results suggest that both the ortho-
photo  method,  when  applied  to  the  2012  summer
image,  and  the  LiDAR  method  performed  well,
when  compared  to  the  reference  building  dataset
and  that  additionally,  both  methods  yielded  com-
parable results. Low values for both the branching
and  miss  factors  indicate  that  buildings  were 
delineated accurately, while the high completeness
value  indicates  that  a  high  percentage  of  build-
ing  footprints  were  automatically  detected. As  an 
indication of the absolute quality of the extraction
metrics,  the  quality  metric  was  also  very  high  for
both methods. 

The  major  drawback  of  using  orthophotos
compared  to  LiDAR  data  is  the  extra  processing
time required. A major portion of the time it took
to  implement  semi-automated  building  footprint
extraction from the orthophoto, involved running a
series of models developed within ArcGIS, which
do  not  require  manual  input  from  the  user. 
Hence, if only the amount of manual input from the
user  is  considered,  the  orthophoto  method,  when
compared  to  manual  digitizing,  saves  time. When
resources  are  scarce  and  when  large  areas  need 
be  mapped  by  a  single  or  few  individuals,  as  is 
the  case  for  many  communities,  minimizing 
user-dependent  processing  time  is  important.
Further analysis efficiencies may be achieved when 
additional data are available. Our approach imple-
mented  a  building  extraction  workflow  based  on
minimal  input  data,  namely  orothophotos  and
roads,  in  order  to  develop  a  flexible  approach.
However, many additional data sets could be advan-
tageous  to  include.  For  example,  land  parcel  data
could be used to ensure that buildings are separated
by  property  lines  (e.g., 
[2009]).
Furthermore, methods can be further refined if data
on approximate building centroids are available as
points [
2001]. Any additional details on
spectral  properties  also  aid  attribution  of  objects.
Specifically,  using  a  red-to-near-infrared  ratio  is
commonly helpful for improving differentiation of
vegetation  [
2011].  Regardless 
of  data  availability,  we  have  demonstrated  that
there  are  time  savings  associated  with  the  semi-
automated process of building footprint extraction,
even  on  relatively  small  images.  As  the  spatial

Fan et al.

extent  of  the  study  area  increases,  so  will  the 
time savings associated with the method. 

The  seasonality  of  vegetation  at  the  time  of
orthophoto  acquisition,  had  a  large  impact  on  the
overall effectiveness of the semi-automated meth-
ods.  When  the  green  ratio  was  unable  to  remove
vegetation  segments  automatically,  the  accuracy
was lower and more manual editing was required.
Hence, ideally, summer orthophotos should be used
for  semi-automated  building  footprint  extraction.
Many  other  studies  and  applications  have  found
vegetation  phenology  an  important  consideration 
in the information content that can be extracted by
an image, as greenness is required to differentiate
Myint  et  al.
vegetation  from  built  environments  [
2011]. 

The  building  type  within  the  orthophoto  also
had a strong influence on the success of the semi-
automated  approach  to  footprint  extraction.  The
initial  segmentation  step  required  user-specified
segmentation  parameters,  and  these  parameters 
will vary with building roof size, shape, and colour.
In  an  image  with  mixed  building  types,  such  as
seen in Site 1, the image segmentation will not be
able  to  capture  both  large  and  small  buildings
equally  accurately,  resulting  in  lower  accuracy
when  compared  to  Site  2,  which  contained  only
residential  buildings  of  similar  size.  Similar 
results have been observed in other applications of
feature  extraction  from  imagery,  as  it  is  difficult 
to  optimize  parameters  for  multiple  sized  objects
Nelson et al.
[

2002]. 

When the accuracy assessment statistics were
mapped,  the  result  was  a  better  visual  representa-
tion  of  the  results,  leading  to  easier  interpretation 
of the extraction methods. The false positives seen
with the LiDAR method could be due to the extrac-
tion of above-ground elements such as decks, which
are not considered part of the building footprint in
the  reference  dataset.  Further  analysis  could  be
conducted  to  remove  low  lying  decks  with  semi-
automated tools. The false negatives seen with the
orthophoto  method  are  most  likely  due  to  heavy
shadows cast onto these buildings by trees, thereby
causing these segments to be removed with the sha-
dows during processing. False negatives seen with
the  LiDAR  method  could  be  due  to  the  temporal
difference between the LiDAR data and the refer-
ence building dataset: if these building sections did
not exist when the LiDAR data were collected, they
would not be present in the point cloud. Alternatively,
these  could  be  above-ground  elements  such  as
decks that were not extracted by the LiDAR method
but are present in the reference dataset.

6. Recommendations

The methods and results in this paper provide
insights  that  allow  us  to  make  several  recom
mendations  to  communities  interested  in  mapping
building footprints. Specifically:

• LiDAR  data  will  provide  the  best  results  for
mapping  building  footprints,  with  the  least
amount of editing and post-processing required.
The  data  should  conform  to  the  Standard 
Pulse  Spacing  specification  defined  in  the 
draft  Canadian  Airborne  LiDAR  Acquisition
Guideline [
2013], which corresponds to
a  point  density  of  1  point/m2  in  open  areas 
and 3 points/m2 in vertically structured areas.
Data  collection  should  be  performed  during
off-leaf conditions to minimize obstruction of
the roofline by overhanging trees.

NRCan

• When  LiDAR  are  not  available,  high  resolu-
tion  multi-spectral  imagery  is  a  standard
choice, for example, IKONOS or QuickBird.
• When  orthophotography  is  the  only  available
imagery,  our  approach  demonstrates  building
footprint extraction is still possible, though more
pre- and post-processing may be required.
• When  working  with  orthophotos,  we  recom-
mend summer images, colour photography, and
10 cm imagery.

• Ancillary  GIS  data  are  beneficial  when
extracting  building  footprints  from  orthopho-
tos.  In  this  study  we  used  roads.  If  available,
land parcel data may also be helpful.

• It  is  recommended  that  study  areas  with 
multiple building types be split by type and run
through the model separately for best accuracy
and reduced manual editing. 

• Future  research  that  enables  the  parameters
used  for  image  segmentation  to  vary  locally,
may  be  beneficial  in  areas  where  building
structure is more heterogeneous, such as mixed
residential-commercial  areas  or  areas  with
housing of variable age [

1999].

7. Conclusion

This  paper  has  described  a  best-practices
object-based approach to building footprint extrac-
tion that was developed using only orthophotos and
a road network as inputs. Results were compared to
a  pixel-based  approach  using  LiDAR  and  it  was
found  that,  although  it  is  not  a  replacement  for  a
more  detailed  LiDAR  approach,  the  object-based
orthophoto method is capable of extracting existing

building footprints with 92% completeness for both
study  sites.  Moreover,  the  approach  achieved  an
overall  quality  of  86%  and  87%  for  Study  Site  1
and 2, respectively.

The proposed orthophoto method can be run on
multiple image types (e.g., MrSID and TIFF), as well
as  run  in  batch  mode,  allowing  for  multiple  para-
meters  to  be  easily  tested. The  semi-automated  and
object-based  methods  described  in  the  paper  were
found to be useful and efficient for detecting general
building locations in urban areas. They may also be
useful for exploring percentages of developed area or
evaluating  change  in  urban  environments  and  may
provide  a  worthwhile  step  toward  defining  a  best
practice-based  approach  when  municipalities  are 
limited to using only orthophotos as inputs.

Her  experience  working  with  both  Environment
Canada  and  the  University  of  Victoria  staff  has
given  her  a  solid  understanding  of  academic  and
government  needs,  and  how  to  meet  these  needs.
Rheannon  is  currently  working  for  the  District  of
Kitimat  as  a  GIS/CAD  technician,  building  their
spatial  database  from  the  ground  up,  to  develop  a
top-of-the-line web-based GIS mapping system. 

Dr. Trisalyn Nelson

is  an  associate  professor  in
the Department of Geography at the University of
Victoria,  where  she  founded  the  Spatial  Pattern
Analysis  and  Research  (SPAR)  Lab.  In  2010  she
was  awarded  the  Lansdowne  Research  Chair  in
Spatial Sciences and in 2013 she became Director
of Geomatics. Dr. Nelson and SPAR Lab’s research
develops  and  applies  spatial  and  spatial-temporal
analysis methods to a wide variety of problems in
the natural and human environments. Publications
have  included  research  on  grizzly  bear  habitat,
mountain pine beetle epidemic, biodiversity, crime,
food security, and forestry. A recent research focus
BikeMaps.org
for Dr. Nelson has been the creation of 
to employ volunteered geo-graphic information to
better understand cycling safety and risk.

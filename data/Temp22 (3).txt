SINGLE FREQUENCY GPS/GALILEO PRECISE
POINT POSITIONING USING UN-DIFFERENCED 
AND BETWEEN-SATELLITE SINGLE 
DIFFERENCE MEASUREMENTS

Akram Afifi and Ahmed El-Rabbany
Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario

We develop a new precise point positioning (PPP) model for combined GPS/Galileo single-frequency
observations.  Both  un-differenced  and  between-satellite  single-difference  (BSSD)  modes  are  considered.
Although  it  improves  the  solution  availability  and  accuracy,  combining  GPS  and  Galileo  observables
introduces additional biases that must be modelled. These include the GPS-to-Galileo time offset and the
inter-system bias. Additionally, to take full advantage of the Galileo E1 signal, it is essential that its
stochastic  characteristics  are  rigorously  modelled.  In  this  paper,  various  sets  of  GPS  and  Galileo
measurements  collected  at  two  stations  with  short  separation  were  used  to  investigate  the  stochastic
characteristics of Galileo E1 signal. As a by-product, the stochastic characteristics of the legacy GPS P1
code were obtained and then used to verify the developed stochastic model of the Galileo signal. It is shown
that  sub-decimeter  level  accuracy  is  possible  through  our  single-frequency  GPS/Galileo  PPP  model.  As
well, the addition of Galileo improves the PPP solution convergence by about 30% in comparison with the
GPS-only solution. Furthermore, the performance of BSSD GPS/Galileo PPP model was found comparable
to that of the un-differenced counterpart.

Nous développons un nouveau modèle de positionnement ponctuel précis (PPP) pour les observations
combinées  GPS/Galileo  à  fréquence  unique.  Les  deux  modes,  non  différencié  et  différence  unique
entre satellites (BSSD), sont pris en considération. Même si cela améliore la précision et la disponibilité de
la solution, la combinaison des variables observées du GPS et de Galileo introduit des biais additionnels
qui  doivent  être  modélisés.  Ceci  comprend  le  décalage  temporel  entre  le  GPS  et  Galileo  et  le  biais
entre les systèmes. De plus, pour tirer pleinement profit du signal E1de Galileo, il est essentiel que ses
caractéristiques stochastiques soient rigoureusement modélisées. Dans le présent article, diverses séries de
mesures  GPS  et  Galileo  collectées  à  deux  stations  peu  distantes  l’une  de  l’autre  ont  été  utilisées  pour
examiner les caractéristiques stochastiques du signal E1 de Galileo. Les caractéristiques stochastiques de
l’ancien  code  P1  du  GPS  ont  également  été  obtenues,  en  tant  que  sous-produit,  puis  utilisées  pour
vérifier le modèle stochastique développé du signal Galileo. L'étude montre que la précision au niveau
sub-décimétrique  est  possible  au  moyen  de  notre  modèle  de  PPP  GPS/Galileo  à  fréquence  unique.  De
même, l’ajout de Galileo améliore la convergence de la solution du PPP d’environ 30 %, comparativement
à  la  solution  du  GPS  uniquement.  En  outre,  la  performance  du  modèle  de  PPP  en  mode  BSSD  du
GPS/Galileo s’est avérée comparable à la contrepartie non différenciée. 

1. Introduction 

Traditionally, 

ionosphere-free 

linear
combinations  of  GPS  carrier-phase  and  pseudo-
range  measurements  were  used  for  precise  point
positioning  (PPP).  Both  un-differenced  and
between-satellite  single  difference  (BSSD)  meas-
urements  have been used (see for example, Kouba
and Héroux [2001],  Colombo  et  al. [2004],  Ge  et
al. [2008],  Collins  et  al. [2010],  Zumberge  et  al.
[1997]).  PPP  has  been  proven  to  be  capable  of

providing positioning solutions at the sub-decime-
ter level in static mode. More recently, Elsobeiey and
El-Rabbany [2013]  showed  that  about  50%
improvement  in  the  PPP  solution  convergence
time  can  be  achieved  with  GPS  dual  frequency
ionosphere-free BSSD. 

A  drawback  of  a  single-satellite  constellation
such  as  GPS  is  the  availability  of  sufficient  num-
bers  of  visible  satellites  in  urban  areas.  Galileo

satellite system offers additional visible satellites to
the user, which is expected to enhance the satellite
geometry  and  the  overall  PPP  solution  when
combined  with  GPS  [Hofmann-Wellenhof  et  al.
2008]. As shown in Afifi and El-Rabbany [2013],
combining  GPS  and  Galileo  observations  in  a
PPP  solution  enhances  the  positioning  solution
convergence  and  precision  in  comparison  with
GPS-only  PPP  solution.  This,  however,  requires
rigorous modelling of all errors and biases.

Generally, the mathematical model for GNSS
PPP consists of two parts, namely functional and
stochastic  models.  The  functional  part  describes
the  physical  or  geometrical  characteristics  of
the  parameters  of  the  PPP  model,  while  the  sto-
chastic part describes the statistical (or stochastic)
properties of the un-modelled residual components
in the functional part. Often, a simplified empirical
stochastic  model  is  used  in  GNSS  positioning,
which assumes that all GNSS observables are sta-
tistically  independent  and  of  the  same  quality.
This,  in  turn,  leads  to  an  overestimation  of  the
estimated  parameters  [El-Rabbany  1994].  As
shown in Afifi and El-Rabbany [2013], using the
proper stochastic modelling of the GNSS signals
leads to improving the PPP solution precision and
convergence time.

This  paper  develops  a  PPP  model  which
combines  GPS  and  Galileo  single-frequency
observables using both un-differenced and BSSD
modes.  All  errors  and  biases  are  rigorously
accounted for. Un-modelled residual components
are accounted for using stochastic models. A new
stochastic  model  for  the  Galileo  signal  is  also
developed,  which  does  not  exist  at  present.  It  is
shown that sub-decimeter level accuracy is possi-
ble  through  our  single-frequency  GPS/Galileo
PPP  model.  As  well,  the  addition  of  Galileo
improves the PPP solution convergence by about
30%  in  comparison  with  the  GPS-only  solution.
Furthermore,  both  the  un-differenced  and  BSSD
GPS/Galileo PPP solutions are comparable.

2. Un-Differenced
GPS/Galileo Model 

GNSS  observations  are  affected  by  errors
and biases, which can be categorized as satellite-
related  errors,  signal  propagation-related  errors
and  receiver/antenna-related  errors  [El-Rabbany
2006;  Hofmann-Wellenhof  et  al.  2008;  Leick
1995].  GNSS  errors  attributed  to  the  satellites

include  satellite  clock  errors,  orbital  errors,
satellite  hardware  delay,  satellite  antenna  phase
centre  variation  and  satellite  initial  phase  bias.
Errors attributed to signal propagation include the
delays of the GNSS signal as it passes through the
ionospheric and tropospheric layers. Errors attrib-
uted  to  receiver/antenna  configuration  include,
among others, the receiver clock errors, multipath
error,  receiver  noise,  receiver  hardware  delay,
receiver  initial  phase  bias  and  receiver  antenna
phase center variations.  In addition to the above
errors  and  biases,  combining  GPS  and  Galileo
observation in a PPP model introduces additional
errors  such  as  GPS  to  Galileo  time  offset
(GGTO), due to the fact that each system uses a
different  time  frame.  GPS  system  uses  the  GPS
time  system,  which  is  referenced  to  coordinated
universal  time  (UTC)  as  maintained  by  the  US
Naval  Observatory  (USNO).  On  the  other  hand,
Galileo  satellite  system  uses  the  Galileo  system
time  (GST),  which  is  a  continuous  atomic  time
scale with a nominal constant offset with respect
to the international atomic time (TAI) [Hofmann-
Wellenhof et al. 2008]. As well, GPS and Galileo
use  different  reference  frames,  which  should  be
considered  in  the  combined  PPP  solution.  The
mathematical models of GPS and Galileo observ-
ables,  code  and  carrier  phase,  can  be  written
respectively as:

Several organizations, such as the International
GNSS Service (IGS) and the Cooperative Network
for  GIOVE  Observations  (CONGO)  network,
provide the user with precise products, including
precise  satellite  orbit  and  clock  corrections.  IGS
precise  satellite  orbit  and  clock  corrections  con-
tain  the  satellite  hardware  delay  of  the  iono-
sphere-free linear combination of GPS L1 and L2
signals  [Kouba  2009].  On  the  other  hand,
CONGO  satellite  precise  orbital  and  clock  cor-
rections include the satellite hardware delay of the
ionosphere-free  linear  combination  of  Galileo  E1
and E5a signals [Montenbruck et al. 2009]. In this
research,  the  precise  orbit  and  satellite  clock  cor-
rections  from  the  CONGO  network  are  used  for
both  GPS  and  Galileo  satellites.  In  addition,  the
GPS  receiver  hardware  delay  is  lumped  with  the
receiver clock error. This, in turn, introduces a new
term  in  the  Galileo  observation  equations,  which

represents  the  difference  between  the  satellite
hardware delays of GPS and Galileo signals. A new
unknown  (ISB)  is  considered  in  our  model  to
account  for  the  system  time  offset  as  well  as  the
new satellite hardware difference term as shown in
Equations 7 and 8. The receiver and satellite hard-
ware delays can be lumped with the receiver clock
error  and  to  the  GGTO,  as  all  of  these  errors  are
timing errors. Equations 5 to 8 show the final com-
bined GPS and Galileo PPP model.

3. BSSD GPS/Galileo Model 

Differencing  the  observations  between  satel-
lites  cancels  out  most  receiver-related  errors,
including  receiver  clock  error,  receiver  hardware
delays and non-zero initial phase bias [El-Rabbany
2006; Hofmann-Wellenhof et al. 2008; Leick 1995].
In this research, a GPS satellite is used to be a ref-
erence satellite for both GPS and Galileo satellites.
As  a  result,  all  differenced  observations  will  be
mathematically  correlated.  A  simple  way  of
accounting  for  the  mathematical  correlation  could
be  done  through  the  covariance  matrix,  which  in
our  case  will  be  a  fully  populated  matrix.  The
weight matrix, which is needed in the least-squares
estimation, can be obtained by scaling the inverse
of the covariance matrix. Assuming a unit scale fac-
tor  and  ns visible  satellites,  the  weight  matrix  for
one epoch P(t) can be written as:

The additional system bias term appears in the
Galileo observation equations only. Obviously, the
related  receiver  errors  are  canceled  out  from  the
unknown  vector.  Consequently,  the  unknowns  are
the three coordinates of the receiver, 
the  additional  system  bias  term,  and  differenced
ambiguities parameters Nin.

the  least-squares  sense.  Equations  5  to  8  can  be

To combine the GPS and Galileo observations
in a PPP solution, it is essential that the statistical
characteristics  of  the  noise  terms  in  the  above
equations are described using the proper stochastic
model.

5. Stochastic Model
Development 

The  receiver  measurement  noise  results  from
the limitations of the receiver’s electronics and can
be determined through receiver calibration or test.
Two tests are usually carried out to determine  the
system noise level, namely the zero and short base-
lines  tests.  The  zero  baseline  test  employs  one
antenna followed by a signal splitter that feeds two
or  more  GPS  receivers.  Using  the  zero  baseline

test, several receiver problems can be investigated,
such  as  inter-channel  biases  and  cycle  slips.  The
single antenna cancels out the real world systematic
problems, such as multipath, in addition to the pre-
amplifier’s  noise.  The  short  baseline  test,  on  the
other  hand,  uses  two  receivers  a  few  metres  apart
and  is  usually  carried  out  over  two  consecutive
days. In this case, the double difference residuals of
one  day  would  contain  the  system  noise  and  the
multipath  effect.  As  the  multipath  effect  repeats
every sidereal day for the GPS system, differencing
the double difference residuals of the two consecu-
tive  days  cancels  out  the  multipath  effect  and
leaves the scaled system noise [El-Rabbany 2006].
However,  multipath  effect  is  not  repeatable  every
sidereal day for the Galileo satellite system, as the
satellites  take  about  14  h  4  min  41  s  to  orbit  the
Earth [Hofmann-Wellenhof et al. 2008].

In this research, a short baseline test is used to
determine  the  stochastic  characteristics  of  the  E1
signal,  assuming  that  multipath  does  not  exist.
Usually, this test is performed using the same type
of  receivers.  Unfortunately,  in  this  research,  two
different  receivers  which  can  observe  the  Galileo
measurements  (Septentrio  POLARX4TR  and
Trimple NETR9) were available for the test. This,
however, was considered when processing the data,
as shown in the sequel. The pseudo-range and car-
rier phase equations can be re-written as, assuming
no multipath and dropping the time argument:

Differencing  the  pseudo-range  and  carrier
phase  equations  of  each  receiver  cancels  out  the
geometric  term,  satellite  and  receiver  clock  error,
and tropospheric delays, as shown in Equations 21
and  22.  The  remaining  terms  include  the  satellite
and receiver hardware delays, ionosphere delay, the
ambiguity parameter and the system noise.

It should be pointed out that the noise parameters
in  Equations  21  and  22  are  essentially  those  of  the
pseudo-range  measurements.  The  phase  measure-
ment noise has been neglected due to its small size
compared to that of the pseudo-range measurements
[Elsobeiey  and  El-Rabbany 2010].  The  receiver
hardware  delay  is  assumed  to  be  stable  over  the
observation period (4 h in this research). Data series
representing  the  values  of  ΔR1 and  ΔR2  over  the
entire  observation  session  are  generated.  As  the

ambiguity parameter and initial phase bias remain
constant as long as no signal loss occurred, they can
be  removed  from  the  model  through  differencing
with respect to the first value of the series. Using
this  approach,  only  the  differenced  system  noise
remains in the model.

In PPP, most of the existing observation stochastic
models are empirical functions, such as sine, cosine,
exponential  and  polynomial  functions.  Most  of
these stochastic models are functions of the satellite
elevation  angles  [Leandro  and  Santos  2007].
Unfortunately,  existing  stochastic  models  may  not
be valid for all receiver types and GNSS signal fre-
quencies. As such, it is essential that new stochastic
models  are  developed  for  the  Galileo  signal.  The
data  series  developed  are  divided  into  nine  bins

depending  on  the  satellite  elevation  angle,  starting
from 0° to 90° with increments of 10°. The standard
deviation  of  the  differenced  system  noise  for  each
bin is estimated [Elsobeiey and El-Rabbany 2010].
A least squares regression analysis is performed to
obtain the best-fit model of the estimated standard
deviations.  Three  empirical  functions  were  tested
for this purpose, namely an exponential, a polyno-
mial and a rational model as shown in Table 1. The
best-fit model is selected based on the goodness of
fit test, i.e., the one with the largest R2 (R-squared)
statistic [Draper 2002].

Table 1 summarizes the results of all three tested
functions.  As  shown,  the  exponential  function  was
found to be the best-fitting model in the least-squares
sense, which was selected in this research.  

6. Results and Discussion

To  test  our  PPP  model  and  to  verify  the
determined  stochastic  models  of  the  Galileo  E1
signal,  Natural  Resources  Canada  (NRCan)
GPSPace PPP software was modified to handle the
Galileo observations in addition to the newly devel-
oped  stochastic  models.  The  GPS/Galileo  PPP
solution was also obtained using an existing empir-
ical function, namely the sine function, which was
compared with the PPP solution obtained with the
newly  developed  stochastic  model.  Four  stations
were used to verify our PPP model, two stations in
North America (UNB and USN) and two in Europe
(Delft and GOP) as shown in Figure 1.

The IGS global ionospheric maps (GIM) product
is used to correct for the ionospheric delay [Schaer
et  al. 1998].  In  addition,  the  NOAA  tropospheric
correction  model  is  used  along  with  the  Vienna
mapping  function  to  account  for  the  tropospheric
delay [Boehm and Schuh 2004]. CONGO network
precise satellite orbit and clock corrections are used
for both GPS and Galileo satellites. Only the results
of  stations  DLFT  (Europe)  and  UNB  (North
America)  are  presented  in  this  paper.  Similar
results were obtained for other stations.  

6.1 Un-Differenced Positioning
Results 

The  results  of  the  un-differenced  single  fre-
quency GPS PPP solution and the single-frequency
GPS/Galileo  PPP  solution  are  obtained  using  two
stochastic models, namely the sine function and the
newly-developed  exponential  function.  Figure  2
shows the positioning results of the GPS-only PPP
solution using the sine function as a representation
of the observations stochastic model.  

As shown in Figure 2, the accuracy of the PPP
solution  with  the  GPS  L1  signal  is  at  the  meter
level. In contrast, when the newly developed expo-
nential function is used, the single-frequency GPS
PPP  accuracy  is  improved  to  decimetre  level
(Figure 3). 

Figures  4  and  5  show  the  PPP  results  of  the
combined  GPS/Galileo  observations  with  the  sine
and exponential functions, respectively. 

As  can  be  seen  in  Figure  4,  the  results  of  the
GPS/Galileo  PPP  with  the  sine  function  show
decimetre-level accuracy; however the solution con-
verges to this accuracy level after about 3 h. Figure 5
shows  that,  when  the  exponential  function  is  used,
the  solution  converges  to  decimetre-level  after  30
min or less. This is considered significant improve-
ment, especially with single-frequency observations.

6.2 BSSD Positioning Results 

Similar  to  the  un-differenced  case,  BSSD  is
considered  for  both  GPS-only  and  GPS/Galileo
with  both  the  sine  function  and  newly-developed
stochastic exponential function. A GPS satellite is
considered as a reference when forming BSSD, as
Afifi  and  El-Rabbany [2013]  showed  that  better
accuracy is obtained through this scenario. Figures
6 and 7 show the results of BSSD GPS PPP using
both  the  sine  and  the  exponential  functions,
respectively. 

As  shown  in  Figure  6,  single-frequency  GPS
BSSD  results  with  the  sine  function  converge  to
decimetre-level after about 30 min. The convergence
time is reduced to 25 min or less when the exponential
function is used (Figure 7). 

Figures  8  and  9  show  the  PPP  results  of  the
combined BSSD GPS/Galileo observations with the
sine and exponential functions, respectively. As can
be seen, only slight improvement in the positioning
accuracy and convergence time is obtained in com-
parison with the un-difference GPS/Galileo scenario.
This suggests that both the un-differenced and BSSD
GPS/Galileo PPP solutions are comparable.

7. Conclusions

A  new  PPP  model  has  been  introduced  in  this
paper,  which  combines  GPS  and  Galileo  system
observations.  The  model  considers  both  the  un-dif-
ferenced and BSSD modes. As well, a new stochastic
model for Galileo E1 signal has been developed  in
this research. Three empirical functions have been
considered, namely, exponential, polynomial and
rational  functions.  It  has  been  found  that  the
exponential  function  gives  the  best  fit,  based  on
regression analysis. It has been shown that a sub-
decimetre positioning accuracy is attainable with
single-frequency  GPS/Galileo  PPP  when  the
newly  developed  exponential  model  is  used. As
well, the solution convergence time is reduced to
less  than  30  min,  which  represents  a  significant
improvement  for  single-frequency  observables.
Moreover,  both  the  un-differenced  and  BSSD
GPS/Galileo PPP solutions are comparable.

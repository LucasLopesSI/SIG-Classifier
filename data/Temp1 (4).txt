Abstract
This article presents a positional quality acceptance control method for 2D and 3D line strings based on a
statistical hypothesis test. Two statistical models are applied together: a Binomial Model is applied over a
Base Model. By means of the Base Model the method can be applied to any parametric or non-parametric
error model. The Base Model represents the hypothesis about the error behavior. The Binomial Model is
ﬁxed and consists of counting the number F of fail events in a sample of a determined size. The π param-
eter of the Binomial Model is derived from the Base Model by means of a desired tolerance. By comparing
the probabilities associated to F and π a statistical acceptance/rejection decision is achieved. This method
allows us to know and control the user’s and producer’s risk of acceptance/rejection. An example using a
2D line string data set from a commercial product is presented. The extension of the method to the 3D
line string case is also presented. In order to facilitate the application of the method, some tables linking π
with F and the control sample sizes are presented.

1 Introduction

Positional quality is one of the most desirable characteristics of spatial data and is determined
by positional accuracy. Positional quality is assessed by positional accuracy, which is a matter
of renewed interest because of the capabilities offered by the Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) and the need for greater spatial interoperability to support Spatial Data Infra-
structures.

In a Spatial Data Set (SDS) the position of a real world entity (feature) is described/
recorded with position values of geometric objects (e.g. points, line-strings, shapes) in an
appropriate coordinate system. Positional accuracy represents the nearness of those values to
the entity’s “true” position in that system. Positional accuracy has traditionally been evaluated
using control points. Following this idea there are very many statistical Positional Accuracy
Assessment Methodologies like: NMAS (USBB 1947), NSSDA (FGDC 1998), STANAG 2215
(STANAG 2002). Many researchers such as Chrisman (1982), Joao (1998) or Keefer et al.
(1988) have criticized these standards for being limited to well-deﬁned points, and also for
failing to address more complex elements like linear and areal ones.

The 3D aspect is a very important issue in Geomatics, so there is a great interest in con-
trolling the 3D positional accuracy of points (Li et al. 2009), lines (Cai and Rasdorf 2009),
and volumes (Elberink and Vosselman 2011). This interest is not theoretical but is related to
new uses of spatial data, as in intelligent transport systems, smart cities, 3D cities, virtual and
augmented reality, etc.

The most widely applied methods for the positional accuracy assessment of 2D lines are:
the Hausdorff Distance (HDM) (Abbas et al. 1995), the Mean Distance (MDM) (Skidmore
and Turner 1992), the Single Buffer Overlay (SBOM) (Goodchild and Hunter 1997) and the
Double Buffer Overlay (DBOM) (Tveite and Langaas 1999). All these methods focus on the
estimation of a parameter; however, the purpose of this article is not the estimation of a
parameter of a population (e.g. the mean error equals 5.55 ± 0.25 m), but the process of
acceptance or rejection of a SDS once a positional tolerance is established (e.g. we accepted the
SDS considering that the mean error is less than 5.55 m, assuming a given risk). Speaking in
statistical terms, this article is about statistical contrast. Our objective is to propose an
acceptance/rejection test for a SDS composed of line-strings (2D/3D). In comparison with esti-
mation, statistical contrasts need a reduced sample size (Rosenkrantz 2008).

After this introduction the article is organized in six sections. The following section pre-
sents the main ideas about statistical testing in acceptance. The next section is centered on
our method, explaining the statistical basics and the general procedure for executing a
control. The fourth section presents an actual example showing the use of the control for a
non-parametric 2D case. The ﬁfth section presents a 3D example in order to demonstrate
the easy generalization of the proposed method. This section includes some tables for spe-
ciﬁc values in order to facilitate the application of the method by readers. Finally, general
conclusions are presented.

2 Statistical Testing in Acceptance of Products

The purpose of quality control is to establish and maintain conformity of products with
design requirements, mainly expressed as standards or speciﬁcations. One of the most impor-
tant aspects of statistical quality control is the acceptance control of products. Positional
controls can be understood as industrial acceptance processes based on sampling in order to
control SDS coming from suppliers. When acceptance sampling is performed in industry a
sampling plan is required in order to establish and make explicit to both producer and
acquirer (user) the conditions of the process: deﬁnition of lot, lot size, sampling method,
sample size, and producer’s and user’s risk, etc. (AEC 1990). The decision from an investi-
gated sample on whether or not a lot satisﬁes the stated requirements can be carried out
through hypothesis testing (achieving a pass/fail decision). A statistical hypothesis is a state-
ment about a probability distribution function or about the values of the parameters of a
probability distribution function (parametric case). In statistical testing two alternatives are
always considered: (1) H0: The so-called Null Hypothesis; and (2) H1: The so-called Alterna-
tive Hypothesis.

Since sampling is a random procedure, two kinds of errors may be committed. If the H0 is
rejected when it is true, then a type I error (α) has occurred. If the H0 is not rejected when it is
false, then a type II error (β) has occurred. Type I error is called producer’s risk because it
denotes the probability that a good lot/product will be rejected, or the probability that a
process producing acceptable values of a particular quality characteristic will be rejected as
producing unsatisfactory ones. Type II error is called user’s risk because it denotes the prob-
ability of accepting a lot/product of poor quality. Sometimes it is more convenient to work
with the power of the test (Montgomery 2001), which is the probability of correctly rejecting
H0 (Power = 1 − β = P{reject H0}).

In relation to the size n of the sample when testing statistical hypotheses the general pro-
cedure is to specify a value for α and then to design a test procedure so that a small value of β

is obtained. Thus the producer’s risk is directly controlled or chosen byα, and the user’s risk is
generally a function of n and is controlled indirectly. The larger the size of the sample, the
smaller the user’s risk (Montgomery 2001).

3 Proposal of a Statistical Model

In this section we are going to propose and develop a statistical hypothesis testing model,
which we call a Coupled Model (CM), as is justiﬁed later. Our intention only achieves the
speciﬁcation of a statistical model that allows us to consider parametric and non-parametric
statistical models for errors, the producer and user risk and its application to 2D/3D line
strings.

Our method is inspired by the main idea of the NMAS (USBB 1947): the count of failures.
From a statistical point of view the basic idea is to perform a set of n independent experi-
ments, (the number of control elements analyzed), and determine in how many of them
(denoted by F) the measured error exceeds the tolerance (tol). The pass/fail clause of the stand-
ard establishes a maximum count (mc) of elements with error exceeding the tolerance. Think-
ing about statistical models this is a binomial scenario, and we call it a Binomial Model (BiM).
So if we deﬁne the fact that the measured error Ei in an element i veriﬁes Ei > tol as a fail
event, the idea consists of counting the number #Ei of fail events in a sample of size n. Because
the sample is random, the probability of fail events remains constant. In consequence we may
conclude that a pass/fail clause, as a control test, follows a Binomial distribution with param-
eters n (the sample size) and π (the probability of obtaining a fail event), which is denoted F →
B(n,π). So the probability of obtaining F fail events could be calculated as:

where π = P[Ei > tol]

In this formula (Equation 1) the following terms may vary and can be adjusted: (1) the
value of the tolerance tol; (2) the number of control elements (n) in the sample; and (3) the
count of failing cases (mc). All we need in order to apply this formula is to determine
the value of the parameter π of the Binomial model; if we know the value of π we will
know the exact probability of obtaining a speciﬁc number of fail events. This parameter π is
related to the behavior of the positional errors, and we need to establish some additional
hypothesis about the underlying error model.

So far we have not discussed whether measured errors E were following a Normal distri-
bution or another parametric (e.g. log-normal, Gamma, Raleigh) or non-parametric model
(distribution free), but we need to know, or to suppose, how errors are distributed in the popu-
lation. This is what we call the statistical Base Model (BaM), and is a basic hypothesis. In this
way our method involves working with two coupled statistical models. The ﬁrst is the BaM,
which can be any parametric or non-parametric model but adequate to apply to positional
errors of line strings. This model represents our hypothesis about the behavior of the error
measures E in control elements. The second model is ﬁxed; it is the BiM and is applied over
the former. The model is represented and summarized as follows: CM = BIM(n, π|π ∼ BaM).
That it is to say, the Coupled Model (CM) is obtained through a Binomial Distribution where
the parameter π is obtained according to the Base Model. This scheme is adequate for any
BaM, and with this structure we are proposing a statistical test where the null hypothesis is:

• H0: The product is adequate. This is equivalent to saying that errors are distributed accord-
ing to the supposed BaM and that in this population the percentage of cases greater than
the desired tolerance is π.

Versus

• H1: The product is not adequate.

In computational terms the steps are:

1. Obtain π as a function of the BaM and the imposed tolerance (tol): π = P[Ei > tol]
2. Calculate the probability p of obtaining a given number F of

fail events in the

sample:

>
p P F mc F

3. Take a pass/fail decision: reject the null hypothesis if p < α, where α is the type I error. An
alternative is not to reject but rather inform about the speciﬁc producer’s risk (p value)
and/or user’s risk.

We wish to remark that, as in any other hypothesis test, the BaM has to be completely
speciﬁed in order to calculate probabilities. For this reason the BaM is a main hypothesis.
So, if H0 is true, the probability that a speciﬁc element in the product has an error Ei > tol is
given by π through the BaM. The BaM gives us the capability of calculating the probability
that in a random sample of size n (that implies independent and identically distributed
observations) we obtain F elements where Ei > tol. If H0 is true this probability, p, follows a
Binomial distribution with parameters n (the sample size) and π (the probability of exceed-
ing the tolerance in the BaM). For a given signiﬁcance level α (type I error), if p > α we
cannot reject H0 (and the product may be adequate), and if p < α we reject H0 (and the
product is not adequate).

In consequence we do not have to demand beforehand a ﬁxed form for the BaM distribu-
tion. We only need this BaM distribution to be completely speciﬁed under the null hypothesis
as is usual in any hypothesis test procedure. So the strength of this method is that the BaM
could be any one, for instance in the case of GNSS-error distribution the Raleigh distribution
(Wilson 2006) and for the case of geocoding errors a log-normal distribution (Cayo and
Talbot 2003). For the case of vertical errors in digital elevation models there are many refer-
ences (Bonin and Rousseaux 2005; Oksanen and Sarjakoski 2006) indicating that error distri-
bution is not Normal, and for this reason it is proposed to express the results of quality
control checks by means of percentiles (Maune 2007). The proposed CM also admits empiri-
cal distributions as BaM. These empirical distribution functions can be obtained by sampling
procedures (e.g. obtained after multiple observations, like in the example presented in a fol-
lowing section). This is possible because the proposed test is performed on the distribution and
not on the parameters of the distribution. This method can easily be applied to 2D and 3D line
string cases.

Before the presentation of the examples it is convenient to summarize in a practical guide-

line the essential steps of the application of the method:

1. A BaM is needed. It must be determined beforehand by whichever method is suitable (e.g.
estimation, simulation, mathematical/statistical analysis, etc.), or may be suggested as a
hypothesis, for instance in a parametric case determined by the parameter’s values. This is
not a restriction; all hypothesis tests need to have a completely ﬁxed null hypothesis.

2. Selection of a tolerance tol. Tolerance in our case can be any value in order to satisfy
current positional quality requirements. For instance, an RMSE, a standard deviation or
whatever other measure of error. This tolerance may be established both by theoretical or
external requirements or may have been estimated by the very nature of the process
(design, techniques, methods, equipments, etc., that determine what the process can
output, i.e. the voice of the process).

3. Selection and taking a random sample of control elements of size n. As stated before,
the size of the sample in hypothesis testing depends on the assumed errors (type I, α,
and type II, β). We do not propose a speciﬁc sample size. As an example, in the results
section we will present probabilistic results for some sample sizes and tolerances
in order to show and understand the behavior of the pass/fail decision. But the idea is
that users and producers can select speciﬁc risk levels (α, β) in accordance to their
requirements.

4. Calculation of errors. Once the sample is available, discrepancies are calculated
(Q) and controlled (X) elements using the appropriate formula

between control
(e.g. Equation 1).

5. Rejection/information. Compute the p value (Equation 1) and take one of the two
options: (a) determine if p ≥ α or p < α in order to take the pass/fail decision; or (b)
inform of the p value as producer’s risk.

3.1 The measure for positional error in 2D and 3D line strings

In order to apply the proposed method we need a measure for the positional errors between
line strings. The ﬁrst idea is to use the common Euclidean Distance Method (EDM), but EDM
is a point-to-point relation that presents problems when applied to linear elements in order to
determine relative positional accuracy, for instance in the case of crossing between elements
this distance is reduced to zero. If the elements have no crossing this distance gives a minimum
value, and only when the elements are parallel does this measure achieve a complete meaning.
EDM is based on a one-point measure given a unique value per pair of elements assessed.
Therefore we can conclude that the distance between non-point features is a difﬁcult concept,
and for this reason there are many proposals of measures for positional accuracy assessment
using linear elements. Going back to the above-mentioned four line-based methods (HDM,
MDM, SBOM, DBOM) each one is a proposal of a measure. Of course these methods have
been proposed for 2D data, but the concept of the implemented measures can be directly
extended to 3D.

In this article we are going to use the Hausdorff distance (HD) but, as we have already
indicated, the proposed control method is independent of the selected measure. The HD is
widely used in information retrieval, shape and image similarity analysis, and other similar
applications. Hangouët (1995) presents the properties of this distance: asymmetry, orthogonal-
ity, sensitivity, tricks and tangency. In the context of positional accuracy, Abbas et al. (1995)
developed a complete vision of an assessment procedure, applying this distance to line
elements as a way of overcoming the limitations of other methods based on well-deﬁned
points. This proposal also takes into account such important effects as cartographic generaliza-
tion and the shape of elements. This measure is widely used for the automatic matching of
road networks (Mustière and Devogele 2008).

The HD can be deﬁned as (Deza and Deza, 2006):

where d(x,B) is the Euclidean distance for all x∈A to the B set, and d(y,A) is the Euclidean dis-
tance for all y∈B to the A set.

4 Example of Application

This section shows an example of the application of the proposed method to the 2D case. As
stated before, the BaM must be completely speciﬁed in order to calculate probabilities. This
BaM is a main hypothesis. In this case the BaM comes from an actual case where a published
product was assessed by means of a ﬁeld survey. We use a product called MTA10v which is the
ofﬁcial cartography of the Autonomous Region of Andalusia (Spain). It is a topographic-vector
database on a semi-detailed scale (1:10,000). This product includes the centerline of all the
paved roads of the region. A ﬁeld survey was performed in order to characterize the product
(BaM and the mean and standard deviation values). The principal characteristics of both the
product and the ﬁeld survey are explained in Ariza-López et al. (2011) and summarized in
Table 1.

Using the HD as deﬁned above the BaM for the 2D case (BaM2DHD) is shown in Figure 1a,
where the horizontal axis corresponds to absolute error values (m) and the vertical axis to
accumulated frequencies. Figure 1b presents the histogram in order to show the asymmetry of
the shape and the large right hand side tail. As expected, the shapes of the curves clearly indi-
cate that 2D error data are not following a parametric statistical distribution (e.g. Normal,
log-normal, Gamma, Rayleigh, etc.). Therefore, this is a clear example of a non-parametric
BaM; it is an observed or empirical BaM. Because of the samples taken for the characteriza-
tion process of the BaM2DHD we are going to consider that the curve in Figure 1 is representa-
tive of the 2D errors between the MTA10v and the ﬁeld survey as deﬁned by the HD.

tances) between the MTA10v product and the control survey

Taking into account a speciﬁc use for the product (e.g inroad car navigation), the shape of
the BaM2DHD allows us to decide whether the product ﬁts a speciﬁc use or not. In a positive
case we can decide an adequate tolerance, for instance:

• Let us now consider that tol2D = 7.5 m (measured by HD) for the 2D case.

Once the tolerance is established we can obtain π2D as a function of the BaM2DHD. In this
case, we derive from the BaM2DHD the probability that a controlled element has an error
greater than tol2D:

π =

This value can be obtained graphically from Figure 1a or analytically from the data. So
11% of the population elements exceed tol2D in the distribution given by the BaM2DHD. Finally,
as is usual in the majority of hypothesis tests, let us consider that the type I error α = 5%. In
this case the meaning of the test is:

• H0: The distribution function of 2D positional errors of line strings to be controlled and
measured by HD is given by Figure 1a (BaM2DHD), and in this population the tolerance
(tol2d = 7.5 m) is exceeded in 11% of the observed cases (π2D = 11%). In consequence, the
distribution of the number of fails in a sample of size n is B(n, 0.11). And because α = 5%
we accept being wrong 5% of times and we select a sample of size n, rejecting this hypoth-
esis when it is true.

• H1: The distribution of observed errors is not given by Figure 1a (the BaM2DHD), and the
error is worse (more than 11% of cases of the data supplied are in error greater than the
tolerance).

Until now we have taken the general and common decisions for the acceptance process
(framework): (1) the assumption of the BaM (the BaM2DHD in this case is Figure 1a) as the base
hypothesis; (2) the determination of a speciﬁc threshold (tol2D = 7.5 m); and (3) the determina-
tion of a probability level for the type I error (α = 0.05).

Let us now suppose that we are receiving a data set supply, we are interested in 2D positional
control of the supplied line strings and the framework is the one established beforehand. The appli-
cation of the control method to a speciﬁc data supply requires only three additional steps:

• Selection of a random sample. GIS packages offer us capabilities for selection of random
samples. These automatic processes are preferred to human driven processes in order to
eliminate bias in sample selection. Let us consider a sample of size n.

• Calculation of HD. The calculation of HD between line strings is not trivial. However, GIS
tools based on the Java Topology Suit (Davis 2007) and PostGIS (Refraction Research
2013) offer this calculation for 2D geometries. Let us consider the set SHD of calculated dis-
tances: SHD = {dHD1, dHD2 . . . dHDn}.

• Rejection/information. After calculating the distances between each line string of the
sample and its homologous control line string; we count the cases F that exceed the toler-
ance. With this F we calculate the probability p = P[F > i|i ∈ (0, n)] (p-value of the statisti-
cal test) of obtaining this number F of fail events in a sample of size n by means of the
BiM: F → B(n, π2D). Remember that we reject the null hypothesis of a statistical test if p <
α, where α is the type I error.

As an example of this p-values calculation, Table 2 shows calculated p values for sizes n =
{10, 20, 30, 40, 50} and F values in the interval [1, 8] when tolerance is exceeded by π2D =
11% of cases in the non-parametric distribution shown in Figure 1a.

Let us now give some numerical examples. For instance, if we select a quality-control
sample of n = 20 control elements and we ﬁnd that F ≤ 5 (elements whose HD error is greater
than tol2D = 7.5 m) we do not reject H0 because the p value of Table 2 presented for this case
(n = 20, F ≤ 5) is greater than α. On the contrary, if F ≥ 6 we can reject H0. Now consider
another sample size, for instance n = 30. Now the product passes if F ≤ 6 and fails if F ≥ 7.
Another possibility is to inform about the producer’s risk of the situation and not take a pass/
fail decision. Table 2 presents type I errors of each combination (F, n), which can be inter-
preted as producer’s risk. In this way if we perform a control by means of a sample of 20
control elements (n = 20) and we ﬁnd two errors (F = 2) exceeding the tol2D, Table 2 informs
us that there is 66.24% of producer’s risk, which means that if we reject the product under
this situation we will be wrong 66.24% of the time.

A Method of Positional Quality Control Testing for 2D and 3D Line Strings

We may take into account that the Binomial distribution is a discrete distribution, so an
exact value of α may be difﬁcult to obtain – unless we randomize the test - but if the sample
size n is high we can use the normal approximation to the Binomial distribution.

5 Generalization

In the previous section we developed the example using 2D data, but the application of the method
is the same for 3D line string data. Obviously, a previous BaM is needed for the 3D case. Consider
now a 3D line-string control for data for a different product with a very different BaM, as shown
in Figure 2. Consider that tol3D = 10.5 m (measured by HD) for the 3D case. In this population, the
tolerance (tol3d = 10.5 m) is exceeded by eleven percent of the observed cases (π3D = 11%).

Here the steps and calculations are the same as for the previous 2D case. Since π3D is the
same as in the previous case, Table 2 is also applicable to this case. As can be observed, BaM2D ≠
BaM3D are very different, but as π2D = π3D, the proposed test behavior (α and β) is the same
regardless of the BaM. In other words, Table 2 is valid for any base model under consideration,
parametric or non-parametric, and the results of the control test only depend on π which is the
parameter of the BiM.

The conclusion achieved in the example for the 3D case on the generality of the solution
as shown in Table 2 for any BaM allows us to calculate similar tables for any value of π. It is
very important to note that this is independent of:

• The BaM (parametric or non-parametric).
• The geometry of data (point, line, etc.).
• The spatial dimensions of the control (1D, 2D or 3D).
• The measure used to assess the positional accuracy (Euclidean, Hausdorff, etc.).

In order to facilitate the application of the proposed method, Tables 3, 4 and 5 show the
producer’s risks (α) or p-values for different values of π = {0.025, 0.05, 0.1}, control sample
sizes n = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} and number of erroneous controlled elements F = {1,2, . . . , 10}.
As expected, the tables show that as π increases, greater F values must be admitted for the
same sample size. These tables have been derived for speciﬁc cases of π but can be calculated

cases. This method is based on what we call a Coupled Model. Two statistical models are

applied together: a Binomial Model is applied over another model that we call here the Base
Model. The Base Model can be any parametric or non-parametric model applicable to posi-
tional errors of line strings. This model represents our hypothesis about the behavior of the
error measures in control elements. The second model is ﬁxed, and the idea of this Binomial
Model consists of counting the number of fail events in a sample of a determined size. The
model is represented and summarized as follows: CM = BiM(BaM). This scheme is adequate
for any BaM and with this structure we propose a very simple statistical control test based on
Binomial distribution where the π parameter is derived from the Base Model.

We have shown an actual example of a 2D line string data set controlled by means of a
ﬁeld survey. For these controls we propose the use of the Hausdorff distance because it is
widely used in other applications and avoids the problems of the Euclidean distance in the case
of intersecting lines.

In order to facilitate the application of the proposed method we have supplied tables with
calculated p-values for different values of the BiM (π = {0.025, 0.05, 0.1}), control sample sizes
(n = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}) and number of erroneous controlled elements (F = {1 . . . 10}). These
tables can be calculated for any value by means of statistics programs or spreadsheets.

This control method has several features:

• The Base Model can be parametric or non-parametric. This is of great interest because

positional errors do not always follow a parametric distribution (e.g. LiDAR).

• The statistical contrast is non-parametric. The test is not parametric, in the sense that there
is no need to summarize the sample information into a small set of parameters (e.g. mean,
standard deviation, etc.) and then make a decision about them.

• The statistical contrast is robust. In this procedure the population is the element subjected
to the statistical contrast: (1) the probability π is obtained from the whole population, irre-
spective of their distribution; (2) the contrast is performed on the entire population and not
on a few elements (parameters); and (3) the counting of fail events in a sample has to be
consistent with the population and to a single parameter.

• No alien hypothesis is needed. The assumption of any prior hypothesis is not necessary

outside the contrast of the population distribution.

• Easier statistical compliance. The ﬁnal decision of acceptance/rejection is not reached by
means of numerous chained hypotheses (e.g. independence, normality, etc.); it only needs a
well deﬁned Base Model.

• Ease of calculation. The binomial distribution calculations are available in all spreadsheets

and statistical packages. The binomial distribution is conceptually simple.

• The method is extensible to any kind of spatial data. Here we have argued and presented
the use centered on line string control, but the method can be applied to any geometry of
spatial data (e.g. points, surfaces, volumes) and to any dimension (e.g. 1D, 2D, 3D . . .).

This article proposes a methodology for the construction and the calibration of a
micro-economic urban land-use model within an extended Cellular Automata
(CA) framework. The methodology is applied to processes of residential spread
in a part of the commuting periphery of Brussels. The model hypothesizes that
households effect on urban development, through their valuation of neighbour-
hood externalities. A coarse sensitivity analysis is undertaken in order to explore
the relationship between household neighbourhood preferences and emerging
spatial morphologies. These macro-structures are measured with different indices
in order to parameterize the model.

Introduction

Many techniques have been developed to model land-use dynamics and to apply
these to a broad range of research questions (Parker et al. 2003). The analysis of
urban land-use change has benefited from new types of models that have made the
consideration of space and/or time more explicit than in traditional spatial economic
and spatial
interaction models. The study of urban and regional geographical
processes, in particular, has increasingly looked to the theory of dynamic systems
and self-organization (Pumain et al. 1989, Krugman 1996, Allen 1997). For more
than a decade, urban simulations based on cellular space have been flourishing,
using statistical techniques, Markovian transitions, cellular automata, multi-agent
systems or some combination of these (Parker et al. 2003).

Cellular automata (CA) applications emphasize the role of local processes that
create spatial structures and dynamics. This underlying principle of CA, as well as
its affinity with raster data models, explains the development of numerous CA
models for hypothetical and real case-study applications (Batty et al. 1999). There is
a large variety of CA models exploring urban patterns and many empirical
applications that simulate the growth of urban settlement or land-use transitions in
a regional context (e.g. White and Engelen 1993, 1997, Batty and Xie 1994,
Portugali and Benenson 1995, Cechini 1996, Sembolini 1997, White et al. 1997,

Advances in modelling have, however, often been accompanied by an increase in
the complexity of the models applied to real case studies. This is sometimes
inevitable given that many human systems are themselves complex, but as Couclelis
(1997, p. 167) stated: ‘once complexity degenerates into complication, the game is
lost’. This has important implications for the value of models in understanding
geographic processes, and simplifying model construction may be a way of avoiding
these problems. For example, reducing the number of parameters makes sensitivity
analyses more tractable as well as allowing the identification of (non-)linearities and
thresholds (bifurcations) in the model response to parameters changes. Taking such
a reductionist approach might appear contradictory when considering cities as
complex systems (Torrens 2000), but this is not a problem provided that the model is
still able to generate emergent properties from the selected processes. Simplification,
therefore, requires a good selection of the processes to be represented.

Many CA applications also suffer from a lack of a theoretical foundation,
especially in relation to economics (Irwin and Geoghegan 2001). This statement is
supported by: (1) the emergence of agent-based models that seek to model land-use
change through the decision-making and interactions of individuals (Parker et al.
2003); (2) the criticism of CAs for being tools that focus on the modelling exercise
rather then enlightening urban theory (Torrens and O’Sullivan 2001); (3) the lack of
non-economic dynamic models to express preferences and behaviour, as well as in
modelling price systems (Anas et al., 1998).

is that

The principal advantage of including economic theory within a spatio-dynamic
model
the simulations have a greater explanatory power. Since the
parameters in a model are more strongly based on reality, the simulations not
only attempt to reproduce spatial patterns, but also provide a real opportunity to
relate these patterns to individual behaviour. This clearly is an important goal of CA
models. Such models can further contribute to the understanding of land-use
tools for spatial policy making. If robust
change, as well as being useful
relationships could be established between form and process, it would be possible
to devise policy instruments to direct urban growth and form (Batty et al. 1989).
With behavioural economic models, spatial metrics reflect the ecological, but also
the socio-economic functioning of the landscape (e.g. see Parker and Meretsky
2004). Furthermore, Wu and Webster (1998) were able to evaluate the relative
performance of CA simulations using a range of socio-economic indicators as their
model was grounded in economics. Certainly, this type of model can be useful in
addressing the sustainability of urban environments and contribute to the debate on
efficient city size (Capello and Camagni 2000) and urban form (Anderson et al.
1996).

Because the parameters within a behavioural model are so important, calibration
is critical. Moreover, calibration is increasingly important when one considers the
problem of ‘equi-finality’ (see a discussion in Richardson 2002, or Batty and Torrens
2001). Various techniques have been explored to determine parameter values when
applying CA models, but there is no standard procedure, probably because the
objectives and constructs of the models are different. Clarke and Gaydos (1998) and
Silva and Clarke (2002) explored a very large set of possible parameter values and
measured the statistical fit to different spatial metrics. The Markov CA model
applied by Jenerette and Wu (2001) was parameterized by a linear interpolation of
empirical data and by using a genetic algorithm, the performance being assessed
through a set of landscape indices. Yeh and Li (2003) estimated development

probabilities by means of neural networks trained on an observed sequence of land
use. Wu (2002) used logistic regression and Monte-Carlo simulations to assess the
performance of a model on a cell-by-cell basis, as well as comparing both
autocorrelation, and development density within distance (time) rings around the
city. Verburg et al. (2003) also used logistic regression to reduce the solution space of
a CA and assist in calibration. For the types of CA models proposed by White and
Engelen, Straatman et al. (2003) implemented an algorithmic procedure based on
neighbourhood comparisons in order to automate calibration, while the random
parameter of the model is fine-tuned on radial fractal dimensions (White et al. 1997).
Since behavioural models relate individual decision-making to emergent spatial
morphologies, macro-pattern characterization can be used to parameterize micro-
behaviour. CA models should, therefore, aim to generate spatial morphologies that
are similar to reality and not to reproduce the exact pixel-based location of agents.
The focus of this article is on the spatial morphologies of periurban development.
Several methods have been adopted in the literature to define and measure sprawl,
or to describe urban land-use structure and change. Of interest for the purpose of
calibration are those methods which provide a global characterization of space by
means of indices or functions.

The measurement of urban density gradients and its change has seen many
applications and functional adaptations since the determination of Clark’s law
(Clark 1958; see discussion in Anas et al. 1998). More recently, however, Galster
et al. (2001) have indicated the fuzziness of the sprawl concept and the need for
operational quantifications other than density gradients. The diverse range of
spatial indicators proposed by different researchers (Galster et al. 2001, Torrens and
Alberti 2001, Hasse and Lathrop 2003) generally include density measures, measures
related to scattered development, isolation, leapfrogging, functional segregation, or
discontinuities, landscape composition metrics, ribbon or stripped development,
proximity of each land use, and accessibility to services. Herold et al. (2002) used
landscape metrics derived from information theory and fractals to describe changes
in urban land use from a high-resolution dataset. These indices were also used to
calibrate CA models (e.g. Jenerette and Wu 2001, Herold et al. 2003).

Fractal analysis has also proven to be useful at measuring space-filling patterns as
well as urban evolution trends. Such analysis is able to reflect the chaotic nature of
cities and provide evidence for similarity between cities (Batty and Longley 1994,
Frankhauser 1994). Global properties of monocentric urban morphologies,
evaluated in terms of scaling behaviour, have also been obtained from diffusion-
limited aggregation (Batty et al. 1989) or correlated percolation models (Makse et al.
1998). These studies are insightful for the assessment of urban densities and the
compactness of global urban forms and clusters. The use of a fractal measure
should, therefore, also be a commonly accepted methodology to test or to
parameterize urban growth models.

When considering the creation of periurban morphologies, the economics of
residential choice can be expressed by two types of agglomeration-dispersion forces.
First, at the regional scale, these forces correspond to the monocentric residential
model (Alonso 1964) where households trade-off additional transport cost for space
and amenity (see Fujita 1989, Anas et al. 1998). The second set of forces is local: new
migrants within periurban areas search for lower-density environments and
amenities that are provided by the neighbourhood of a given location. New
residents are assumed to value local proximity to schools, shops, network

however, value the openness of the landscape, low-density environments, greenness,

the proximity to rural

in simple words,

Neighbourhoods are the central element of a CA model, as they support the
interactions between land use and the dynamics of the system. The relevance of
neighbourhood processes and distance decay effects (i.e. spatial autocorrelation,)
has long been recognized as an important law in geography (Tobler 1979), and an
early application of the neighbourhood-based concept of space in simulation can be
found in the mean information field of Ha¨ gerstrand (1967). In most CA models, the
existence of interaction between two locations is implied by their membership to an
a priori defined neighbourhood extent, or the level of interaction is derived from the
Euclidian distance between cells. In practice, any other length metric relationship
could be used to represent the relative separation of a set of locations (see the
axiomatic approach proposed by Beguin and Thisse (1979) and a recent discussion
in Miller and Wentz (2003)). The concept of proximal space (Couclelis 1997)
emphasizes the relative representation of space that is characteristic of CA, and a
notion of a neighbourhood that goes beyond its geographic representation.
Basically, any framework that seeks to implement a behavioural model of land-
use change within a CA dynamic has to consider the formalization of proximal
interactions. Here, these are created through the coexistence of two land uses and
represent externalities that are valued by one of the land users.

Thus, two hypotheses underpin the approach presented here: (1) the integration of
a raster GIS, a cellular dynamic mechanism, and an economic framework can
provide useful information on the decision making of individuals in space, and
contribute to the understanding of land use change; (2) to achieve this goal, a
calibration procedure is required that is based on a sensitivity analysis of the
exogenous inputs and endogenous behavioural interactions for which the results are
measured by global geographic indices. The spatial morphology of urban
development is taken as an example. A model of residential spread is proposed
where a part of the southern periurban area of Brussels is represented as a cellular-
dynamic system including two types of located agents: households and farmers. The
model focuses on household behaviour and aims to understand residential location
choice. A simple sensitivity analysis is used to calibrate the model against
observations of residential locations.

2. Methods

2.1 Theory

2.1.1 A general CA framework for simulating land-use competition. The framework
proposed here is inspired and very similar to the generalized and constrained CA
model approach of White and Engelen (1993, 1997) and White et al. (1997). The
main differences are: first, no macro model is used to determine the number of cells
in each land-use class at each time step; second: the model is deterministic so that no
(stochastic) heterogeneity is added to the variations which already exist within the
raster inputs. Therefore, the differences observed between each run of the model
represent the result of varying parameter values only.

The framework was created to implement models which incorporate neighbour-
hood dynamic elements as well as other location-specific attributes. The objective
was to show how, by extending a conventional CA framework, it becomes possible
to simulate processes based on urban economics. Takeyama and Couclelis (1997)
introduced the ‘Geo-Algebra paradigm’ for integrating GIS and CA within a
general mathematical framework when modelling dynamic spatial processes. Within
this framework: (1) there is no a priori structure given for the locations in space (i.e.
not only regular cells), (2) values attributed to locations can be continuous, (3) any
type of neighbourhood definition is possible (by using relational maps), (4)
interactions and transition rules are not necessarily homogeneous in space and time,
(5) any interaction can be formalized from a multiplicity of GIS layers, and finally
(6) CA are no longer closed systems as they can take any GIS layer as an additional
input.

The framework proposed here also includes some of

these extensions to
conventional CA, namely: the possibility of dealing with continuous values, the
definition of a neighbourhood that is based on a proximal distance and decay
functions, an open system that can account for additional raster datasets at any time
step and differentiated according to the land use under consideration.

Let the land use be denoted by Ct

ij, where ij determines a unique location on a
lattice, and t refers to a given point in time. A limited number (c) of land use classes
is possible Ct
g. A sequence of land-use maps can be computed from, at
ij
least, a given initial state C0
ij and a set of formalized interactions. A potential
function is calculated for all concurrent uses of land in order to drive the landscape
dynamic. The comparison of these potentials leads to land-use conversions.

~ 1, . . . c

f

Let Pt

c,ij be the potential value of the cell ij to be in state c at time t. Firstly, Pt

c,ij is
a function of some location-specific variables that are given exogenously as raster
type inputs, Xij. These ‘grid’ inputs can vary with time; X t
ij is then a multi-temporal
raster dataset; or varying with c, Xc,ij is then a multi-state raster dataset. X t
c,ij can, for
example, represent the suitability of a cell ij when considering the possibility of ij
being in land-use state c. There is potentially a large number of raster data types that
can ‘constrain’ locally the potential of being in use c (topography, soil types and
yields, accessibility by road or train, zoning permissions, etc). Therefore, let q be the
number of raster (or multi-raster) inputs to be considered and define the vector of
variables Xqt

k,ij with q ranging from 1 to q.

A second type of variable influencing Pt

is neighbourhood-based, and this
represents the core of the CA dynamics. A neighbourhood variable, Nij, is calculated
on the basis of the land use in the neighbouring cells of ij at time t-1 (the framework
is constrained to a first-order Markov process). Any Nc,ij can then be defined
similarly to Xc,ij, as a neighbourhood function can also vary according to the land
use under consideration. Again, a set of neighbourhood variables can be considered,
and so let n be the number of neighbourhood variables used in the model and define
the vector of variables Nnt
c,ij with n ranging from 1 to n.
So, a general formulation for any land-use potential is

c,ij itself is a somewhat more general formulation of the White and Engelen
approach (1997). While their neighbourhood function was based on the state (land
use) of surrounding cells, any quantitative measures can be used here (provided that

an initial raster input
is given). A neighbourhood function is a spatially
homogeneous influence function (in the sense of Takeyama and Couclelis 1997) as
it is applied in the same way at every location. It is a part of the transition
determination in the CA. An example of such a function would be to calculate the
average of the land prices observed at t-1 in a neighbourhood when considering
location at time t in a certain cell.

A neighbourhood function is then generally defined as a weighted sum of the
values of the cells kl belonging to the neighbourhood of ij, X being whatever variable
for which a value is available for every cell at t-1, I being a binary variable equalling
1 if cell kl is in state c9 at time t-1, and 0 otherwise.

neighbourhood of ij to impact differently on Nc,ij and therefore on the potential
of being c. This impact is defined for each pair (c,c9) of land uses and is constantly
defined across space and time. In addition, wc,c9,kl allows the more remote cells kl
belonging to the neighbourhood of ij to impact differently on Nc,ij than the
contiguous cells. It is defined once and as a distance decay function within the range

with xkl being the distance from cell ij to kl, and ^xx being the maximum distance
considered in the neighbourhood, that is the neighbourhood extent.

Finally, the set of cells ij that can be converted into use c at time t is defined by
comparisons of Pt
c,ij values. If no further constraints are added, the transition is
made for every cell ij towards the state c having the highest potential value in ij. A
global constraint can also be defined for each land use c in the form of a percentage
of the total number of cells in the area. A limited percentage of the total area can for
example be converted into an urban use. This percentage can be defined as a
function of time and therefore reflects a known growth rate. In the following
example, the global constraint is used to determine exogenously the residential
growth rate (e.g. a single resident at each time step). It is then necessary to make a
choice between the set of cells where c has the highest P value, in order to select only
some of them for conversion into class c. The choice is made by ordering Pt
c,ij values
and selecting the highest.

2.1.2
Implementing economic theory within a CA framework. The economic model
hypothesizes that dynamic spatial configurations in periurban areas are related to
economic factors and behavioural aspects of residential choice, including the level of
income, transport costs, and preferences for local amenities. A variety of theoretical
equilibrium and transitory configurations have already been obtained from this
model and as discussed in Caruso (2003), where the economic theory, parameters
conditions and equilibria are presented in more details.

A bidding system is implemented within the transition rules of the CA which
determines the conversion from agricultural to residential use. In this example, the
time-lagged cellular neighbourhood is used to calculate periurban location
externalities, as well as their change through time and space.

In urban economic theory, residential behaviour is usually formalized by the
maximization of a utility function under a budget constraint. From this

Downloaded by [University of Illinois Chicago] at 10:30 11 November 2014 Spatio-dynamic model of residential behaviour

109

maximization, the bid rent of a resident for each location at any time can be derived.
In this case, the bid rent represents the amount a resident is willing to pay to acquire
a particular cell, given the distance to the city and the observation of the
neighbouring environment. Residents are assumed to value the neighbourhood
environment of a cell in two ways. First, they are interested in having a certain
density of residences around them, i.e. the social externalities (S) at a single location.
Second, they value the environmental quality of the landscape around them, i.e. the
environmental externalities (E). Both of these neighbourhood preferences, E and S,
are expressed as a function of the density of households in the neighbourhood, r. E
decreases and S increases with r, both at a decreasing rate. The neighbourhood
density is assumed to be evaluated by newcomers just before making their location
decision—the time lag—giving more importance to proximal cells within a
neighbourhood. The preferences have been formalized in a Cobb–Douglas function
to be maximized (where Z represents the set of all other consumptions): Max
U;ZEbSc.

The location choice of a household is then constrained by its income (Y) and a
location specific commuting cost (T(dij)). Each household is assumed to earn the
same income, and T(dij) comes from a cost distance GIS calculation along the main
road network. Given a utility level (u) to be achieved at any location, the
maximization produces an expression of the bid rent for each location and time,
where Y and u are given constants. Similarly to equation (1), this residential bid rent
is interpreted as the potential for a cell ij to be in residential use at time t, Pt
resident,ij:

The two contrasting preferences, E and S, can be summed into a single ‘local
externality variable’ (L) which is a function of the (distance decay weighted)
in t-1. The detailed functional form comes from a
neighbourhood density, r,
simplification of the parameter values in Caruso (2003), and equals

The level of local externalities is represented as a function of the neighbourhood
density in figure 1a. The function displays a maximum at r* (according to the same
simplification, r*5(c/2b)2), which represents the optimal preference of households
in terms of neighbourhood density. Each level of density corresponds to a bid-rent
curve (figure 1b) which decreases linearly with the distance to the city because of the
commuting cost T(dij) (in equation (4)).

social amenities, when making their location decision choice. Higher values of b/c
indicate a preference for greener neighbourhoods. This ratio will be tested
in subsequent analyses because it affects the value of the optimal density, r*
(figure 2), and, therefore, the global residential morphology of the area. Clustering
is stronger with low b/c (high r*), whereas more dispersion occurs with high b/c
(low r*).

Once Pt

resident,ij is defined, it is compared with the potential of being in agricultural
use, Pt
farmer,ij. The higher the bid of the farmer, the stronger the competition.
However, for the sake of simplicity and because of a lack of spatially detailed data
on agricultural yields and profits, the bid-rent (potential) of the farmer is considered
as a constant through space and time. Farmers are then assumed to be unable to
prevent residential growth. The potential refers to the opportunity cost of land and
is assumed to be far below the residential potential.

In theory, the bid-rent of the farmer is necessary to limit urban spread, as it
constrains the equilibrium city size (Caruso 2003). The present application, however,
considers a fixed city size (the number of residential cells to be simulated is taken
from the application dataset) and focuses therefore on the way residents spread into
the rural area. At each time step, a single cell is converted into residential use, with
the selected cell providing the highest potential, Pt
resident,ij. The number of runs for a
simulation corresponds, therefore, to the total number of residential cells in the
actual map.

This is a simple model given that only one land-use class c, the residents, is
explicitly modelled. The farmer is considered to be the default land user whose
behaviour when faced with urbanization is not represented here. Moreover, the
model uses only one neighbourhood variable (Nc,ij; see equation (2)), namely the
density of residences, and two simple raster inputs (Xc,ij), the commuting cost and
the planning restrictions on building. This economic model does not therefore
represent the whole set of processes underlying urban spread in rural areas. It is
limited to the spread from a single dominant centre, whereas in reality, it is known
that part of
the development can also derive from local peripheral centres
(Champion 1989).

2.1.3 Calibration based on the measurement of macro-structures. The methodology
proposed here assumes that micro-behaviour can be calibrated on the basis of
macro-geographical indices. The ratio b/c characterizing residential choices can be
found by selecting the value from a simulation with the best fit to the observed
pattern. The correspondence between model and observation is evaluated using four
macro-indices: (1) an index of fragmentation; (2) the radial fractal dimension, (3) a
measure of the quality of the adjustment to the whole radial fractal curve, and (4) to
the density–distance plot within the planning zones.

1. Fragmentation: The fragmentation index, HF-edge-share, represents the
edges of the residential cells that are in contact with farmers as a proportion
of the total sum of edges for residential cells. A value of 1 indicates full
fragmentation when each residential cell is completely isolated. A value of 0
is not possible if the two land uses are present, but a low value indicates
compaction. The index is similar to the edge density metric used for example
by Jenerette and Wu (2001), Herold et al. (2003), or Parker and Meretsky
(forthcoming).

2. and 3. Fractal curve and dimension: Although different measurements of a
fractal signature have been used in the literature, the radial fractal dimension
was applied here. This dimension has the advantage of reflecting the dilution
of the build-up area within space, from the centre to the periphery (Ba¨ ck
et al. 1996). It is, therefore, well suited to a monocentric approach to urban
spread. Furthermore, because the number of cells is rather limited,
insufficient variation in the size of residential clusters makes the calculation
of a cluster-size index meaningless. The radial fractal dimension, Radial-
slope, is obtained from the slope of a linear regression that is fitted onto a
double-logarithmic diagram of the number of residential cells within a set of
distance radii. This measure is used by White et al. (1997) in order to fine
tune the level of stochastic perturbation in a CA simulation. A disadvantage
of the radial dimension, however, is the difficulty of applying a single linear
regression to a signature that is not a regular fractal. As this is often the case,
the observed residential pattern is multi-fractal. From a comprehensive
analysis using different fractal metrics, De Keersmaecker et al. (2003)
concluded that the urban structure of Brussels corresponds to multi-fractal
logic. In order to take this structure into account, and following Ba¨ ck et al.
(1996), the whole length of the log–log curve is considered. Thus, the
capacity of any single simulation to reproduce the observed fractal signature
will be assessed by measuring a quadratic distance between the observed and
the modelled curves (R2-radial).

3. Density vs. distance: An index based on the relationship between residential
density and distance (time) was calculated. The number of modelled and
observed residents in each minute commuting ring was divided by the
number of cells available for building in the same ring. A determination
coefficient was calculated by comparing these values, R2-density-plan. As the
density/distance function is an output of the urban economic model, it is
used in the calibration. Wu (2002) also assessed the performance of a CA
model based on such a relationship.

2.2 Application

2.2.1 Study area,
target maps and inputs. The study area was based on a
25625 km square located in the southern commuting area of Brussels (following
definitions in Van der Haegen et al. 1996). The area has a good road network
orientated towards the Brussels Capital Region (in the North West corner of the
map, figure 3) where most employment is located. The region is characterized by
rapid residential development and strong dispersion (a characteristic of Belgian
periurbanisation compared to neighbouring countries (Caruso 2002)). Urban
development increases in this region mostly at the expense of agricultural land
(Jehin and Me´renne 1998). The observed residential development is presented on
two maps at different spatial resolutions (250 and 500 m). These target maps
(figure 3) have a rather coarse resolution because of the computing time constraints
of running the CA at finer resolutions. The original dataset is a fine-grained (20 m)
raster land-use map that has been aggregated through an averaging procedure. The
urban cells comprise two classes: residential and a mix of residential and services.
The impact of the aggregation method was assumed not to be important, although
in practice this depends on the level of spatial autocorrelation (Bian and Butler
1999). At a spatial resolution of 250 m, the model must locate a total of 826
residential cells, step by step. This decreases to 202 cells at a resolution of 500 m.

The theoretical processes described above are not a priori related to a specific
case. The application is, therefore, undertaken for two spatial resolutions. How
sensitive the model is to the definition of the spatial agents is also a question. In such
a CA/agent-based approach, agents correspond to a cell. Given the chosen
resolutions, this corresponds more to a group of residents rather than to individuals.
Moreover, the model considers two distance attributes, which are influenced by
varying the size of the spatial units (Tagashira and Okabe 2002): the commuting
distance and the neighbourhood size. The latter is measured as a number of cells,
and so varying the spatial resolution also changes the extent to which neighbour-
hood externalities are perceived. The dependency of neighbourhood characteristics

on the spatial
Furthermore, the results of the optimization of the parameters of a CA model

2001).

resolution has been emphasized by Verburg et al.

Running the model requires at least two raster GIS input layers: an initial land-
use map and the commuting cost. The initial map is occupied only by farmers. The
commuting cost is calculated in travel time units from a GIS cost distance algorithm
based on the main road network. The largest portion of the transport cost is in fact
the time (Anas et al. 1998). Local roads are not considered, as this detail is not
necessary, given the spatial resolution of the simulations. Isochrones are reported on

the maps (figure 3). Planning zones for residential development are represented by a
binary raster dataset. These zones were created during the 1970s and are currently
being revised. Given the size of the surface reserved for urbanization in these plans,
the restrictions have not had much impact on residential dispersion and have led to a
non-parsimonious use of land. This ‘lack of planning’, however, makes the study
area quite suited to an exploration of residential preferences. A primary interest in
using the planning constraint is to analyse whether urbanization fills in the available
space step-by-step, starting with the shorter distances, or by ‘leapfrogging’. In effect,
the degree of residential space filling does not decrease continuously within the
planning zones, whereas it does when the whole surface is considered. A second
reason for using planning zones in the model is to consider these zones as a good
proxy for other important landscape features, including topographical constraints,
existing settlements or villages, etc. and therefore making the simulation closer to
reality.

2.2.2 Simulations. A set of simulations were run to analyse the sensitivity of the
macro-patterns to changes in the parameters including the preference of individuals
for neighbourhood density. A further simulation, independent of the model, was
used as a benchmark to interpret the value of the macro-structural indices.

When a single cell represents the location of a decisional entity, it is necessary to
define the geographical meaning of a cell and the spatial resolution of the
simulations. The choice of the size of the neighbourhood and its shape is then not
independent and becomes meaningful. Spatial resolution is no longer just an issue of
data availability, quality or computation capacity, but enters the modelling process
itself. The spatial resolution issue was tackled explicitly in this analysis: simulations
were run on two different spatial resolutions, and a sensitivity analysis was
undertaken on the size of the neighbourhood where externalities are perceived.
Three increments were defined for the two spatial resolutions. The maximum
distances considered, i.e. the radius of the neighbourhood, were 1.5 (the Moore
neighbourhood), 3 and 5 cells. These radii correspond, respectively, to a total of 8,
28, and 80 cells. Because of the use of different resolutions, the neighbourhoods
considered ranged from 250 to 2500 m. This range is simply assumed to cover the
possible perception of migrants who want to choose a location in the area.

The sensitivity analysis on the economic parameters was then limited to the
parameter to ‘optimize’: the value of the ratio b/c was varied from 1 to 3 by
increments. A value of 1 indicates an equal preference for social and for
environmental externalities. In this case, the optimal density (r*) corresponds to
the occupation of a quarter of the neighbourhood by residents.

Running simulations on a real case study in an exploratory or prospective way
can benefit from the addition of inputs such as planning zones which constrain the
simulated patterns further toward the observation. However, when incorporating
these types of data, it is necessary to carefully interpret the fit of the simulation to
the observed dataset. Specifically, there is a risk of measuring the role of the inputs
which constrain the simulation rather than the adequacy of
the processes
implemented within the model. For example, by randomly choosing the location
of the 826 (or 202) residents within the cells available within the planning zones, the
measures of global structure might already be similar to the measures made for the
target maps (the observation). Thus, the contribution of the model must be
measured independently from the contribution of the constraining inputs.

115

In order to solve this problem (at least partly), a random simulation was
undertaken for the same land-use constraints, and the macro-patterns measured.
Rather than undertaking a simple random simulation, a distribution of probabilities
was used that follows the observed gradient of residential density against distance to
the city centre. The probability distribution was constructed from the fit of an
exponential curve to the observed data according to the classic law of Clark (1958).
This law can be derived from the monocentric model of the urban economy on
which the simulation is based. The resulting patterns were then used as a benchmark
for the fragmentation and fractal measurements. In this way, the differences
between the modelled simulations and the random simulations represent the
additional effect of the neighbourhood externalities.

3. Results

Figures 5 and 6 show that where b5c, the resulting patterns appear to be more
compact and most different from the observed patterns. Visually, the model
becomes closer to the observed patterns when the preference for rural amenities is
increased, and this observation is supported by the values of fragmentation and
fractality (see table 1). This still occurs in spite of the simple economic assumptions
within the model.

For fragmentation 1, the observed map has 74% of the edges of residential cells in
contact with farmers at 500 m resolution. This increases to 78% at 250 m resolution,
as in general there is more variation at a lower resolution. The simulations with a
value of b/c of about 2 or 3 (depending on the spatial resolution) have an HF-edge-
share index that is closest to the observation. The resolution seems to have a strong
influence on the results. Whilst, visually, the size of the neighbourhood (as observed
in figures 5 and 6) seems to affect the size of the clusters, when looking at the three
values of the fragmentation index, reported for each b/c value, no such trend is
apparent.

For the fractality (2 and 3) the radial-slope value measured for the target map at
250 m resolution equals 1.65, and 1.79 at 500 m resolution. The radial dimension and
the fit of the curve seem to be less affected by the spatial resolution. The evolution of

aThe first line corresponds to the observed values. The second presents results from the
random simulations based on the probability decreasing with distance. Subsequent lines
display the results for simulations with preference for rural amenities increasing from 1 to 3.
Within these lines, the three values correspond to three neighbourhood sizes (8, 28, and
80 cells, respectively, from top to bottom). For indicative purposes, a value is shown in bold
for each criterion which corresponds to the best fit.

the fragmentation level and the radial fractal dimension at 250 m resolution are
presented in figure 4. Although a more precise analysis could be undertaken, the
figures already display some interesting trends as well as representing the difficulty
of calibrating such a model. This is especially true for the fragmentation level.
Varying the size of the neighbourhood from 28 to 80 cells increases the range of
possible parameter values of b/c that fit the observed fragmentation. Whereas the
best fit points to a value of 3.0 with a neighbourhood composed of 80 cells, a very
similar fragmentation can be obtained with b/c52.0 with an eight-cell neighbour-
hood. Further analysis could be used to identify precisely the equi-final set of
parameters. The fractal dimension points towards values of b/c ranging from 2.0 to
2.5. Fitting the whole fractal curve points to a similar, although higher, value for the
landscape preferences.

The level of fragmentation generated by the random simulation is too high, but
surprisingly quite close to the observation. The radial dimension is, however, quite
weak. In general, the performance of the random simulation is not as good as
the micro-economic model. Since the probabilistic distribution accounts only for the
decreasing density of settlements with commuting distance, this result indicates the
important contribution of the neighbourhood interactions, i.e. the externalities, in
simulating good spatial patterns.

The distribution of density against distance within the planning zones (4) is far
from a continuously decreasing function when measured on the target map.

Hypothetically, this might represent leapfrogging processes or the role of local
subcentres. In contrast to the results presented above, this index suggests much
lower values for b/c. However, compared with the fractal curve, the fit is not good
whatever the parameter values. The simulated distributions of density within the
zones barely correspond to the observation.

This result demonstrates how strongly the simulation patterns are influenced by
the planning constraint. This constraint is very important, therefore, when building
predictive models. While the fractality or the fragmentation is quite well replicated

by the model, the structure within the planning zone is not. It is still possible,
however, to obtain better results than with a random simulation. The neighbour-
hood effect seems to be important, therefore, in grouping migrants into clusters. It is
the location of these clusters which is not well simulated: with a low b/c value, the
compaction is too strong, and the urban expansion too small, whereas with a high b/
c value,

It is possible that this reflects the absence of an initial configuration of small
urban nodes that are encroached upon by the urbanization dynamic of Brussels.

119

However, the addition of small initial residential settlements does not substantially
change the results, since the dynamic which is represented within the model is
the problems encountered with this
essentially monocentric. More precisely,
criterion reflect the absence in the model of a way to account for local dynamics
created by subcentres. The distance to Brussels is ‘tyrannic’, and even if leapfrogging
patterns are possible, no process of counterurbanization is simulated. From this
perspective, the model appears to be incomplete.

4. Discussion and conclusion

The analysis presented here was exploratory and the model simple in its formulation
of some processes. It has, however, developed an economic interpretation of land
conversion, provided a methodology for estimating agent behaviour based only on
macro-geographical outputs, and demonstrated the usefulness of undertaking
sensitivity analysis of
the spatial resolution and neighbourhood size when
establishing values of behavioural parameters.

The sensitivity analysis may be insufficient for a complete calibration of the model
but has demonstrated the necessity when modelling processes within a CA type
framework of varying parameters in order to understand their impacts on the
resulting global spatial structures. A limitation of the approach is the lack of
automatic methods that would allow for an exploration of a larger set of possible
solutions and their ability to reproduce geographical patterns.

From the sensitivity analysis, new residents around Brussels seem to prefer
landscape amenities 2.5 times as much as social amenities. Nevertheless, this result is
quite sensitive to the ways in which the macro-structure,
is
measured. Different values might be found for this model on the basis of different
objective functions. This also underlines the implications of choosing an objective
instead of trying to fit multiple criteria.
function based on a single criterion,
Technical and methodological
improvements to tackle this problem should be
investigated.

i.e. the ‘finality’,

While empirically based models may be able to reproduce the observed patterns in
a more efficient way, fine tuning a deductive model to a geographic output is also
possible and useful, as potentially it provides information about processes. The
hypotheses stating the role of neighbourhood interactions and commuting costs in
explaining residential spread are corroborated by this application. These processes
have not been proven to be incorrect as the model reproduced patterns that were
similar to the observation.

Empirically based models of urban growth are probably easier to calibrate
because the values of the parameters are important for the fit of the model to the
observation, rather than as a way of interpreting processes. These models are
certainly useful to explore trajectories of change, but it is challenging to calibrate
deductive behavioural models because of the potential to interpret the model
parameters. This interpretation, in turn, offers an opportunity to test the model with
the spatial
independent sources of
distribution of modelled residential potential values (which represent residential
bid rents) could be compared to observed distributions of land values. Preferences
could also be found from household surveys or hedonic estimations of land values.
Analysing urban growth patterns by means of an economically based
cellular dynamic model can contribute to further understanding of residential

information and methods. For example,

choice. The use of a CA-type framework can overcome two limitations in
the application of urban economic models:
the difficulty in accounting
location dynamics and in dealing with geographically detailed
for sequential
information. The dynamic nature and the role of neighbourhood externalities
are important aspects of the urban diffusion process. Both are emphasized in
the model presented here. Once properly calibrated,
the model
could provide applications that contribute to thinking about spatial management
and urban sustainability. There is, however, a need to better understand
the implications for the model results of assuming rationality and similarity of
agents.

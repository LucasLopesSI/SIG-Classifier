Generalization of the Lambert–Lagrange projection

The Lagrange projection represents conformally the terrestrial globe within a circle. This is achieved by compressing the latitude and
longitude and by applying the new coordinates into the equatorial stereographic projection. The same concept can be generalized to
any conformal projection, although the application of this technique to other analytical functions is less known. In this work, the
general Lambert–Lagrange projection formula is proposed and the application of the modified coordinates
is discussed on
projections: stereographic, conformal conic and Gauss–Schreiber. In general, the results are merely a curiosity, except for the case of
Gauss–Schreiber, where the use of coordinates with altered scale can be applied in the optimization of conformal projections.

Keywords: Lambert–Lagrange; conformal projection; compressed coordinates

INTRODUCTION

In his classic work on map projections, Lambert (1772) pre-
sented a conformal projection that represents the entire globe
in a circle. The technique used is shrinking, in the same pro-
portion, the longitude and isometric latitude in the equatorial
stereographic projection. The representation of the entire
world in a circle is often used as the basis for the development
of other conformal projections through polar coordinates. The
Schwarz–Christoffel mapping allows the transformation of cir-
cular contours on polygonal contours, creating new families of
conformal projections delimited by straight sides. The most
comprehensive work on this subject is the monograph by
Lee (1976), where an extensive use of the elliptic functions
for transforming the polar coordinates is laid out.

Altering the latitude and longitude while preserving the
conformal property is the most important innovation of this
projection. It is very simple to alter the longitude scale, but
not the latitude. The Lambert formula (1772, p. 40) that con-
verts the colatitude according to a scale factor is expressed as:

f being the geodetic latitude. An explanation on the develop-
ment of the Lambert formula can be found in Fenna (2006,
pp. 250–257).

Taking m/2 as a constant value, we note that a similar
relationship appears in the writings of Thomas Harriot of

Apparently, this formula arises from a study of the stereo-
graphic projection and its relation to meridional parts. There
is no connection with the construction of a chart with com-
pressed longitudes, but it is interesting to note the pre-exist-
ence of this relationship in the spherical surface.

Lagrange (1779) generalized this concept for the ellipsoid
of revolution, then, this projection is known as Lambert–
Lagrange or just Lagrange. Fenna (2006, pp. 347–351) dis-
cusses the generalization of the Lagrange projection to its
normal appearance, arbitrarily changing the straight parallel
and the shrinking of longitude. The formula developed by
Snyder (1993, pp. 80–82) is a compact
the
Lambert projection on the spherical surface. This formula,
by varying certain constants, represents the parallels and mer-
idians in a family of conic curves, from which the Littrow
projection can also be derived. Some unconventional uses
of the Lambert formula can be seen in Savard (2001),
where the compressed coordinates were applied to projec-
tions of Gouyu and conformal conic.

Generalization of the Lambert–Lagrange projection

where f′
is the latitude with altered scale, k the shrinking
factor and e the first eccentricity of the ellipsoid. Considering
directly the pair of isometric coordinates, the relationship is
much simpler:

c+ iy = k(q + il),

being k · l the modified geodetic longitude and k · q the
modified isometric latitude defined in the right part of (1).
Being c+ iy isometric coordinates too, they can be intro-
duced as variables in any conformal projection. In this
paper, the application of this latter formula in analytic func-
tions as a generalization of the Lagrange–Lambert projection
is discussed, developing the expressions of the conical and
cylindrical representations in their transverse aspect.

PRELIMINARY FORMULAS

In general, with x and y related to grid east and grid north
respectively, we call Lambert–Lagrange to the conformal pro-
jection given by the following expression:

y + ix = a · f (c+ iy),

x + iy = a · f (y+ ic),

or

where

c+ iy = (a+ ib)(q + il),
c = aq − bl,
y = al+ bq,

equations. Usually, b = 0

and f (·) is an analytic function that satisfies the d’Alembert
(Cauchy–Riemann)
and
0 , a ≤ 1 being a the factor that modifies the scale of the
isometric latitude and the longitude. This scalar value is
also called factor of conformality (Grafarend and Krumm,
2006, p. 193).

In a more general way, adding the translation to the origin,

z = q − q0

+ i(l− l0),

a = a+ ib,
c+ iy = az.

The result is the Helmert transformation of isometric coor-
dinates (q, l) into coordinates (c, y) on the complex plane,
where conformality is preserved. The angle v results in a
skew of the meridians and parallels lines after applying the
transformation f (·).

The meridian convergence is the azimuth of its represen-
tation on the chart relative to the north of the grid. Being g
the convergence angle, its value on a point is calculated coun-
terclockwise as

The scale factor is the relationship ds′/ds, being s the linear
element on the ellipsoid of revolution and s′
its image on
the projection. Since in conformal projections the scale on a
point is equal in all directions, this factor can be calculated
on a parallel arc:

functions of complex variables was derived with the CAS
Maxima (2013). In order not to overload formulas, inter-
mediate steps were omitted; Maxima documents, where for-
mulas were developed, are available at request to the author.

The whole world in a semicircle, in WE direction, is shown
in Figure 2(a) and NS direction in Figure 2(b). In the first case
the formula (13) was used with ℓ = 0.5, a = 0 and b = 0.5;
the second case corresponds to the formula (16) with
a = 0, a = 0 and b = 0.5. For certain combinations of ℓ, a
and b, the representation contour remains a circumference
arc. In addition to the cases cited, e.g. with ℓ =
/2,

ance is also maintained. The appearance in the form of delta
wing, Figure 3(b), obtained with values ℓ = sin (p/12),

Taking a sector of the American continent, the changes in

suggests that it could be used to compensate for distortion

in conformal representations by modifying the factor of con-
formality values. Also, the rectangular coordinates of modified
Gauss–Schreiber can be used as variables into harmonic poly-
nomials (see Driencourt and Laborde, 1932, p. 202) with the
advantage that the lines of equal distortion already envelop the
contour of a particular region.

OBLIQUE GAUSS–SCHREIBER PROJECTION

The oblique projection formulas are given in Lee (1956,
it oblique Gauss–Schreiber projection
p. 329). We call
since, formally, the oblique Mercator projection on the ellip-
soid of revolution requires that isocols must be parallel to
meta-equator, being this a straight line where the scale is con-
stant. Just as in the Gauss–Schreiber normal aspect, in the
oblique case, the scale factor is not constant in meta-
equator, or main circle on the Riemann sphere.

The oblique Gauss–Schreiber projection is an alternative way

of scale variation to the normal case, as seen in Figure 6
(a = 0, b = 0.4 and v = p/6).

CONCLUSIONS

The application of modified isometric coordinates, or
Lambert–Lagrange, on analytical functions generates a
new family of conformal projections. The main effect of
the contraction of scale in the coordinates is the modifi-
cation of the boundary of the domain represented and the
pattern of isocols. In general, the centre of the projection
scale factor when
is enclosed by a contour
am(a, b) , 1, with the exception of cases where there are
outages, e.g. conical projection. This property can be
used to compensate scale variation in the representation
of a given region, by approximating the isocol to his
boundary.

line of

Using a complex number as a factor of conformality allows
to change the orientation of the projection by modifying the
values of real and imaginary parts. When one of these values
is not zero, the warping of meridians and parallels is gener-
ated, but it does not offer significant advantages in offsetting
the scale variation.

The cases analysed provide rather a novel aspect of the
mapping, except the Gauss–Schreiber projection that allows
to represent regions, oriented NS or EW, with low distortion.
This can be achieved both by adapting the value of the factor
of conformality as well as by using the rectangular coordi-
nates in harmonic polynomials.

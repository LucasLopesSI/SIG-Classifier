Abstract
Geostatistical characterization of local DEM error is usually based on the assump-
tion of a stationary variogram model which requires the mean and variance to be
ﬁnite and constant in the area under investigation. However,
in practice this
assumption is appropriate only in a restricted spatial location, where the local
experimental variograms vary slowly. Therefore, an adaptive method is developed
in this article to model non-stationary variograms, for which the estimator and the
indicator for characterization of spatial variation are a Voronoi map and the stan-
dard deviation of mean values displayed in the Voronoi map, respectively. For the
adaptive method, the global domain is divided into different meshes with various
sizes according to the variability of local variograms. The adaptive method of
non-stationary variogram modeling is applied to simulating error surfaces of a
LiDAR derived DEM located in Sichuan province, China. Results indicate that the
locally adaptive variogram model is more accurate than the global one for capturing
the characterization of spatial variation in DEM errors. The adaptive model can be
considered as an alternative approach to modeling non-stationary variograms for
DEM error surface simulation.

1 Introduction

In recent decades, digital elevation models (DEMs), as one of the ﬁrst widely available
digital forms of geographical information, have been widely used for hydrological and
landslide susceptibility mapping
geomorphological modeling (Moore et al. 1991),
(Kawabata and Bandibas 2009), habitat prediction (Van Niel and Austin 2007) and

image rectiﬁcation (Van Niel et al. 2008). DEMs can be obtained in different ways
such as remote sensing, topographic maps and ground survey techniques (Chen and Yue
2010, Fisher and Tate 2006). However, no matter what method is adopted, errors are
inherent in DEMs and can propagate to DEM derivatives (Chen et al. 2011, Erdogan
2010).

The accuracy of DEMs is traditionally reported by summary statistics, such as root
mean square error (RMSE) and mean error (ME), which quantify the average difference
between higher accuracy elevation measurements and corresponding elevations extracted
from the DEM at a set of locations (Chen et al. 2012b, Oksanen and Sarjakoski 2006).
It should be noticed that the summary statistics are global measures and are not speciﬁc
to any particular location or area (Kyriakidis et al. 1999). Both theoretical and empirical
evidence indicates that DEM error is spatially variable and correlated (Carlisle 2005).
Thus, many researchers (Ehlschlaeger 2002, Fisher 1991, Lee et al. 1992, Lindsay 2006,
Openshaw 1979, Veregin 1997) have attempted to describe the pattern of DEM errors
spatially in terms of unconditioned and conditioned error simulation models.

Conditional simulation can generate multiple realizations of the error surface that
honor the error measurements at their original locations and sample statistics including
the histogram and variogram model (Holmes et al. 2000). The differences between these
alternative error surfaces generate a model of uncertainty for the unknown DEM error
spatial distribution (Darnell et al. 2008). The conditional model makes full use of
information about the statistical and spatial distribution of the local errors, and so must
be better than unconditioned ones relying only on global estimates of aspatial parameters
(Fisher 1998).

For conditional modeling, geostatistical characterization of DEM error has been
based on the assumption of a stationary variogram model which requires the mean and
variance to be ﬁnite and constant in the area under investigation (Fisher 1998). However,
in practice this assumption is appropriate in only a restricted spatial location, where the
locally experimental variograms vary slowly (Atkinson and Lloyd 2007, Lloyd and
Atkinson 2002). Therefore, the opportunities for appropriate modeling of DEM errors
using non-stationary geostatistics should be investigated.

Generally, a non-stationary geostatistical model can be implemented based on some
possible approaches. Two common alternative methods are: (1) using detrending and
transformation techniques to make the model close to stationary; and (2) obtaining
stationary variogram in terms of division (Lloyd 2010). The ﬁrst method detrends the
local mean to reduce the variability of the mean value, and transform the residual to
make the variance constant, whereas division divides the study region into smaller
meshes within which the variogram is assumed to be stationary. Considering that trend
removal methods may introduce biases into the input data and are not actual methods to
speciﬁcally model non-stationarity, the method of division might be adopted (Darbe-
heshti and Featherstone 2010).

The traditional division approach has been to divide the entire domain uniformly
and as ﬁnely as possible to ensure the stationarity of the variogram model in each mesh
(Atkinson and Lloyd 2007). In general, the smaller the mesh, the more stationary the
model may be. Unfortunately, due to the limited number and random distribution of
sampling points, it is usually impossible to divide the domain into uniform meshes. On
the other hand, it is often the case that ﬁner meshes are only required in regions where
the local variogram varies markedly with spatial location. In recognition of this, an
adaptive method is developed in this article to model the non-stationary variogram,

which places ﬁne meshes in regions where local variograms show rapid changes, and uses
coarse meshes in regions where local variograms vary slowly (Chang et al. 2000).

2 Materials and Methods

In our study, a LiDAR-derived data set was employed to investigate the effect of the
locally adaptive non-stationary variogram on the accuracy of the simulated DEM error
surface.

2.1 Study Site and Data Acquisition

The study site (Figure 1) is situated in Sichuan province, China and covers an area of
25.4 km2. The elevations range from 756 m to 1,408 m with mean and standard devia-
tion values of 1,066 m and 128 m, respectively.

The raw data with an average sampling interval of 2 m were collected by a Leica
ALS60 Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS). During the data capture, the ﬂying height was
about 2,700 m and the ﬁeld of view (FOVs) was 50°. The scanning and impulse
frequencies were 23 Hz and 60 kHz, respectively. The coordinate system employed was
WGS 1984 UTM Zone 48N. The detailed procedure of DEM construction can be found
in Chen et al. (2012a).

In order to assess the accuracy of the DEM, 7,093 checkpoints were randomly
collected using a Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS with vertical and horizontal accuracies
of (cid:2)2 cm and (cid:2)1 cm, respectively. Hence, DEM error was computed as GPS derived
elevation minus 2 m DEM derived elevation at each checkpoint. Global statistics indicate
that standard deviation and ME of the DEM are 0.997 and 0.155 m, respectively.

2.2 Estimator and Indicator for Characterization of Spatial Variation

The characterization of spatial variation in DEM errors is not available directly from
DEM errors, so we should use some estimators, which provide the tools for assessing the
stationarity of variogram models. Generally, a dataset with a stationary variogram must
satisfy the fact that the mean and covariance are constant between samples and inde-
pendent of location.

One efﬁcient estimator is the Voronoi map. Voronoi maps are constructed from a
series of polygons formed around the location of a sample point (Aurenhammer 1991).
Voronoi polygons are created so that every location within a polygon is closer to the
sample point in that polygon than any other sample point. After the polygons are created,
neighbors of a sample point are deﬁned as any other sample point whose polygon shares
a border with the chosen sample point. Using this deﬁnition of neighbors, a variety of
local statistics such as mean, standard deviation, entropy and interquartile range can be
computed from local neighbor sampling points. For instance, a local mean is computed
by taking the average of the sampling points and its neighbors, with the computed value
assigned to the polygon. This is then repeated for all sampling points and their neighbors,
and a map is formed to show the values and spatial distribution of the local mean. Thus,
to satisfy the assumption of the stationarity of a variogram, the computed values should
be constant or vary slowly throughout the mapped polygons.

2.3 Adaptive Method of Non-stationary Variogram Modeling

The procedure for the adaptive method is as follows,

(1) DEM error is computed as GPS derived elevation minus the DEM derived elevation

at each checkpoint.

(2) The characterization of spatial variation in DEM errors is assessed in terms

tolerance,

(3) For

the non-stationary variogram,

the corresponding region is uniformly
divided into four sub-regions by lines connecting the midpoints of two opposite
sides.

(4) The process from steps (2) to (3) is repeated until the variogram achieves station-

arity in each sub-region.

(5) Error surfaces are simulated using conditional simulation with the stationary vari-
ogram as the input parameter in the sub-regions. In order to avoid the abrupt
changes in the simulated error surfaces near the borders of these subregions, the
simulation is performed for each segment using not only this segment’s points, but
also the points from its neighborhood. To efﬁciently obtain additional points, a
growing overlapping region technique is used. The growing overlapping region
starts from the current region and increases by one-quarter of the side length on
each side until the region has sufﬁcient points.

Geostatistical characterization of DEM errors located in the global region and
sub-divisions was executed with classical binned directional and omni-directional
variograms, in order to deﬁne in different ways the extent of the areas in which the
stationarity assumption of the variogram is valid. The variogram ﬁtting was performed
in four cardinal directions (angular tolerance of 45°) using GS+ software (Gamma Design
Software, Michigan, USA) which provides all geostatistics components, from variogram
analysis through kriging and mapping, in a single integrated program widely praised for
its ﬂexibility and friendly interface. Results indicate that only small differences between
the four directional variograms were observed, and omni-directional semivariograms
were ﬁnally adopted (Goovaerts 1997).

In the global region, the Voronoi map displaying local mean values (Figure 2)
indicates that the mean ranges from -3.213 to 2.339 m with a standard deviation of
0.938 m. Therefore, the mean values vary markedly with the standard deviation values
greater than the tolerance. Thus, it can be concluded that the global variogram is
non-stationary. The global variogram for all the DEM errors is shown in Figure 3. A

be attributed to the variation at micro-scales smaller than the sampling interval (Goo-
vaerts 1997).

The global region is divided up (Figure 4) and then Voronoi maps of the four
sub-regions are constructed. The variograms in each region were ﬁtted with different
models (Table 1 and Figure 5). Results indicate that the variograms vary signiﬁcantly
across the global region. These differences show that the global variogram is inadequate
to represent the local spatial variation. Table 2 indicates that the ranges of the mean
values in the left-bottom (LB), left-upper (LU), right-upper (RU) and right-bottom (RB)
regions are [-0.653 m, 2.104 m], [-2.142 m, 1.704 m], [-3.213 m, 1.408 m] and
[-2.053 m, 2.339 m], respectively. The corresponding standard deviation values are
0.574, 0.724, 0.834 and 0.831 m, respectively. Therefore, the variogram models of LU,
RU and RB are considered non-stationary, and the second division is needed.

The three sub-regions are further divided into four sections and then Voronoi maps
are formed. Statistical results (Table 3) show that except for the variogram of RU-3,
those of other sub-regions with the standard deviation values smaller than 0.7 m are
stationary. It is noted that the variogram of RB-2 with the standard deviation of 0.377 m
is more stationary than those of others. The variogram in each sub-region was ﬁtted with
a variety of different models. Results (Figures 6–8) show that the ﬁtted models are quite
different from their corresponding global ones.

After the third division, the statistical results of the four sub-regions from RU-3
are obtained. Results (Table 4) indicate that the variograms of all sub-regions show
stationarity with the standard deviation values of 0.644, 0.697, 0.447 and 0.525 m,

respectively. Meanwhile, their corresponding nuggets (Figure 9 and Table 1) are close to
zero, indicating that the DEM errors in each sub-region show homogeneity.

2.4 DEM Error Surface Simulation

Three regions including LB, RB-1 and RU-3-2 were employed to show the effect of the
variogram as a parameter of geostatistics on the accuracy of error surface simulation. In
our article, 100 realizations were generated by global and local variograms in each
region. Figure 10 shows one randomly selected realization for the global and local
variograms in each region. Results indicate that the error surfaces generated by the global
model are much coarser than those by the local models, indicating that much information
is lost by the global model. This is due to the fact that the local variogram is composed
of larger semivariances than the global one.

Global statistics for the error points obtained by RTK and error surfaces simulated by
the global and local models in the three test regions are shown in Table 5. The results show
that almost all of the statistics for the local models are closer to the values of RTK than
those of the global ones, except for the mean value in the LB region, indicating that the
locally adaptive variogram is more efﬁcient than the global variogram in capturing the
characterization of spatial variation in DEM errors. In conclusion, DEM accuracy
evaluation based on the error surface simulated by the global variogram would be
completely misleading, and the locally adaptive variogram should be employed in its place.

3 Discussion and Conclusions

This article has described an adaptive method employed to model the non-stationarity of
variogram in geostatistics. In order to ensure the stationarity, ﬁner meshes are placed in

the areas where the variability of local variograms is marked instead of using uniform
meshes of the same size across the research domain. DEM error surface simulation
indicates that the adaptive method of non-stationarity modeling is more accurate than
the global variogram to capture information in the micro-scale. The adaptive method can
be selected as an effective tool to region division for avoiding non-stationarity at the
global level.

Generally, the adaptive method consists of predeﬁned reﬁnement and self-adaptive
reﬁnement (Yue et al. 2010). With predeﬁned reﬁnement, the areas which need reﬁne-
ment are determined before computation is started; with self-adaptive reﬁnement, the
meshes are dynamically reﬁned based on the computation results. For the non-
stationarity variogram modeling of DEM errors, we adopted the self-adaptive method
which automatically determines the regions for further reﬁnement.

For modeling the non-stationary variogram in terms of an adaptive method,
a proper indicator for the characterization of spatial variation, which provides an
indication of further reﬁnement, is very demanding. The adaptive method is effective
only when the reﬁnement area is accurately determined by the indicator. In our simu-
lation, we found the standard deviation of means in the Voronoi map to be very
effective.

It is important that sufﬁcient checkpoints are available for DEM error surface
simulation because we might ﬁnd that although the variogram shows non-stationarity,
the number of checkpoints is so small that the variogram model cannot be accurately
ﬁtted. Therefore, additional checkpoints should be sampled to guarantee the accuracy of
simulation results.

The non-stationarity of the variogram is a great challenge for geostatistics, since
many simulations are based on geostatistical methods with the assumption of a station-
ary variogram. Thus, the adaptive method of non-stationary variogram modeling is very
promising, and our future work aims to validate the efﬁciency of this method in other
applications such as kriging interpolation and optimal sampling design for minimizing
kriging error.

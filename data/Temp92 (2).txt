Abstract The response of environment to ashfall was evaluated aiming at defining the
vulnerability in the areas surrounding Mt. Etna volcano, Sicily. The two utilized scenarios
assume different thickness of ashfall, over distances comparable with those covered by
deposits from realistic eruptions that occurred recently on the volcano. The fall episodes are
considered instantaneous or with a duration of 90 days. These models are in agreement with
the actual and recent activity of the volcano. The evaluation of vulnerability was performed
by a GIS-based method, accordingly with the different themes that constitute the Corine
Land Cover inventory of the study area and discovering the potentially damaged elements
following the two hypothesized scenarios.

1 Introduction

The evaluation of volcanic risk is one of the main objectives of volcanological scientific
research that requires the evaluation of the vulnerability degree associated to the different
typology of hazard. The importance of this research is often underestimated, so that
scientists commonly tend to concentrate the efforts only on a detailed estimation of the
hazard. On the contrary, it must be stressed that the evaluation of risk is an extremely
important task, especially as regards volcanoes, like Etna, where human activities are
frequently hindered or limited by volcanic activity.

Research on risk evaluation concerning Mt. Etna volcano has so far being aimed at a
mere speculative calculation of hazard factor and of the vulnerability of human settlements
to lava flows, and this has resulted in the production of probability maps of lava flow

invasions and numerical simulations of lava flow paths. Furthermore, land exploitation in
areas around the volcano and the expansion of urban settlements have generally not taken
into consideration the risk problem thus creating a situation of potentially high volcanic
risk. Only since the events of 1999/2000, the need of a more accurate estimate of volcanic
risk has been fully recognized, also giving due consideration to the problem of land
vulnerability to the effects of pyroclastic fallouts.

The study on environmental vulnerability is, however, a new subject for the overall
research work on the possible circumstances (scenarios) arising from the eruptions of the
Sicilian volcano and its outcomes provide valuable information and suggestions for the
Civil Protection Service in the planning of their work programs both in a pre-emergency
phase and during an eruptive event.

In this study the results of a preliminary estimation of vulnerability, attained by the

integration of realistic eruptive scenarios with a GIS-based method are presented.

Nowadays GIS is emerging as a powerful tool for the assessment of risk, vulnerability
and management of Natural Hazards. GIS-based maps of vulnerability may better help the
civil authorities for quick assessment of potential impact of volcanic ashfall hazard and
initiation of appropriate measures for reducing the impact.

2 Brief review of Mt. Etna recent volcanic activity

More than one million people live on Mt. Etna volcano flanks in numerous villages, separated
by extensively cultivated areas. The volcanic activity consists mainly of frequent lava flow
emissions poured out from lateral vents, whereas the summit craters are characterized by a
more or less steady explosive activity [1, 6, 8]. The South East Crater is most active of the
four summit craters of this volcano. Its activity started in 1971 [4], and varied from the
production of quiet, non-explosive lava emissions to brief, violent lava-fountaining episodes.
Since 1989, this crater has increased its explosive character, with frequent tephra fallouts
over the whole eastern coast of Sicily, causing great damage to human settlements and crops.
From 26 January 2000 this crater was characterized by a complex and varied explosive
activity that occurred in several cyclic phases [3, 4] until 17 July 2001. In July–August 2001
and in October 2002–January 2003 two flank eruptions characterized by the production of
ash columns and lava flows occurred. These eruptions caused great damage to local economy
for the whole duration of the event and forced the repeated closure of airport of Catania and
even that one located in Reggio Calabria (more than 120 km northwards). After a brief period
of repose, a new flank eruption occurred on the upper eastern flank of the South East Crater
from September 2004–March 2005, but this time it had a totally effusive character [14, 15].
From mid-July 2006 the South East Crater produced a new series of explosive events
whose intensity became increasingly more violent and reached its climax with the
generation of eruptive columns of pyroclastic tephra, sustained for a few hours, which
covered with ash especially the eastern and north-eastern flanks of the volcano. Since
December to the present time (July 2007) these episodes have become less frequent and ash
emissions less consistent.

3 Description of methodology utilized

As regards the evaluation of the vulnerability of the territory to pyroclastic fallouts no
overall accepted methodology has so far being developed, comparable e.g. to the SINTACS

Geoinformatica (2009) 13:267–276

269

or POCK methods applied to the calculation of land vulnerability to pollutants in
groundwater reservoirs, consequently, no research has being made on the response of
environment around Mt. Etna to tephra fallouts.

In view of this, a new method has being conceived, according to the objectives of the
study, available data and techniques, aiming at formulating an indicative evaluation of the
vulnerability degree of territory to pyroclastic fallouts, providing at the same time easily
applicable suggestions to public institutions.

With this in mind, it has being chosen to utilize a “direct” method that envisages the
continues and punctual supervision of technicians, who can monitor, check and control the
method during its application [11], and allowing at
the same time its critical
interdisciplinary elaboration.

The research work on this methodology has included in three tasks:

(a) Application of a simplified eruptive model that may figure out reliable scenarios, and

delimitation of the case study areas.

(b) Land cover/land use analysis and implementation of the “vulnerability data base”.
(c) Vulnerability visualization.

The flow chart shows the methodology adopted during this study (Fig. 1).

(a) Application of a simplified eruptive model that may figure out reliable scenarios, and

delimitation of the case study areas.

As the parameters and the variables involved in the simulations are numerous it was
decided to apply a simplified approach through the adoption of a reduced number of

270

possible scenarios and through some approximations related to the eruptive models
considered: the composition of pyroclastic deposits is assumed to be made up only of
volcanic particles whose size is less than 2 mm; the bulk grain size is considered to be
composed of equal fractions of each granulometric class. These limitations assume constant
eruptive conditions (output rate, degree of fragmentation of the products, height of eruptive
column, magma gas content, no vent and conduit erosion), and exclude the sieving effect of
the gravity of tephra from the eruptive column.

In particular it is assumed that:

& The chemical and mineralogical compositions of the erupted material and of the
expelled gas do not change during the eruption,
remaining within the normal
composition range that characterizes the activity of this volcano [7, 17]. In this way,
any possible variation in the density and viscosity values of the erupted magma is
excluded, as well as the presence of carcinogenic minerals (such as cristobalite and
fluoroedenite) and/or a concentration of toxic gases (Cl, F, CO2).

& The effect of rain water, both under sin-depositional and post-depositional conditions is
not taken into consideration. In this way the consequent increased load of deposit
accumulated over the roofs is not taken into account nor are the remobilization/re-
deposition of tephra with the consequent formation of small hyperconcentrated
grainflows and also the rapid removal of volcanic dust from the atmosphere.

In the simulation the effect of wind is not considered, which results in a circular
homogeneous distribution of deposits all around the vent, thus deposits are not zoned
vertically and do not changes with their distance form the source.

On the bases of typology, duration and intensity of Etna’s explosive activity during the

last 8 years, two possible scenarios were simulated:

&

&

Scenario 1: simulating the effects of the instantaneous deposition of 0.5 cm of pyroclastic
tephra over a circular area within a radius of 35 km from the South East Crater. This
scenario simulates the effects of fine tephra deposition (0.125 < ∅ < 1 mm) erupted
during one of the numerous explosive events that occurred from 1999 to 2007, whose
climax phase had an average duration of 30 min. Such events normally generated up to
0.5 cm-thick deposits over areas that are up to 25–35 km far from the crater.
Scenario 2: simulating the effects of the continuous fall of 0.5 cm of pyroclastic tephra
per day, during 90 days over a circular area within a radius of 50 km from the South
East Crater. This scenario is justified by the average daily depositional ratio of fine
tephra (from ash to sand), observed during the eruptions of 2001 and 2002–2003. In
2001 there was the constant emission of about 5–10×106 m3 of tephra [5], whereas,
during the 90 days of the 2002–2003 eruption, about 40×106 m3 of fragmented magma
were emitted [19], generating deposits that, at a distance of 5 km from the source,
measured up to 10 cm in thickness.

The extension of damages is directly related to the thickness of deposits and to the
duration of the phenomena. Lastly, deposits can be reworked and disaggregated by the
activities of man.

(b) Land cover/land use analysis and implementation of the “vulnerability data base”

The analysis of the territory based on a 1:100,000 fixed scale that in the field of
ecological evaluation represents the spatial resolution of a study or a number of data. This
scale may be fixed or adjustable in accordance with any possible scenario.

As regards both scale and dimension, it must be underlined, however, that no fixed scale
may be clearly identify the processes [16]. In the light of these considerations, it must be
trusted that future simulations will be based on variable scales (e.g. 1:1,000; 1:200) and
fixed dimensions (e.g. 10,000 m2) and that they will mainly concern specific areas, like for

272

Geoinformatica (2009) 13:267–276

instance, inhabitant centers, in order to calculate their vulnerability with more certainty [13,
18]. In particular, the scale chosen for the project is 1:100,000 due to several reasons:

* the distribution of the deposits, especially those composed of finer grain size, is

wide, according to the intensity of high winds.

* smaller scales (1:250,000, 1:500,000) are not detailed enough to be useful such as

preliminary investigations for civil or environmental protection projects.

* it is also compatible with projects which use a smaller scale (e.g. 1:1,000,000), since
spaceborne remote sensing allows generalization at that basic cartographic scale.
* the common mapping scale utilized allow future possible applications of the method

in other countries.

The inventory utilized in this research is an updated version (2000/2001) of the Corine
Land Cover 2000 (CLC), realized by the European Community,
to provide them a
homogenous and synoptic land cover/land use data set [5, 9]. It is composed of 44 classes
(Table 1) covering the agricultural as well as the urban and natural sector and it is based on
satellite images (Spot, Landsat MSS and TM—[10, 12]) as the primary information source.
The vulnerability data base has been implemented, according to the all scientific
discipline involved in the field of natural sciences and economic sciences, for all voices in
legend and existing in the case study area. Vulnerability has defined as “the concept of
vulnerability expresses the multidimensionality of disasters by focusing attention on the
totality of relationships in a given social situation which constitute a condition that, in

combination with environmental forces, produces a disaster” [2]. In the environmental
vulnerability assessment related to volcanic ashfall it is fundamental the study of the
characteristics of the eruptive process and of the relative emitted material.

The vulnerability database is composed by multiple tables setting up in a database as an easy
way to keep related data together. The attributes of the tables are ordinal variables (five ranks:
very low, low, medium, high, very high) concerning the vulnerability to volcanic ashfall of each
single voice of the CLC inventory. The intervals between scale points may be uneven, in fact it
was no possible to find an equal distance of “vulnerability class”, so in the “vulnerability
database” the arithmetic operations are not possible, but logical operations can be performed.
After the acquisition of the CLC inventory, we have implemented the GIS of hazard

vulnerability assessments related to the volcanic ashfall.

The study areas interested by ashfall risk, as described in task A, are delineated using
Intergraph GeoMedia®Professional software GIS. For each scenario it was realized joins
among the polygons of the CLC inventory and the “vulnerability data base” realized in task B.

(c) Vulnerability visualization

The purpose of this task is to visualize biophysical and social vulnerability information
to enable vulnerability assessment. At the end of this task it was produced a spatial
representation of vulnerable areas. In the report phase, the project layout was opportunely
visualized in order
to simplify the reading and the comprehension also to not
volcanologists.

4 Results and discussion

The main results of this study, related to the two different scenarios are presented in Figs. 2
and 3 as vectorial format map output. It is shown that the highly vulnerability in scenario 1
is related to the presence of continuous and discontinuous urban fabric and in particular of
the Catania airport. In scenario 2 a high vulnerability value characterizes also urban areas
located on the Tyrrhenian coastline and all the areas characterized by delicate seasonal
croplands. Forests and natural areas, on the contrary, in all scenarios present low and very
low vulnerability.

With analysis of spatial modeling, in conclusion, it is possible to assess the land

vulnerability with higher accuracy.

5 Conclusions

available information and, the high accuracy of GIS-based vulnerability maps especially
when compared to the traditional procedures.

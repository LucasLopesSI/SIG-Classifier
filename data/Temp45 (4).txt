Abstract

Place is a concept that is fundamental to how we orientate 

and communicate space in our everyday lives. Crowdsourced 

social media data present a valuable opportunity to develop 

bottom-up inferences of places that are integral to social ac-

tivities and settings. Conventional location-led approaches 

use  a  predefined  spatial  unit  to  associate  data  and  space 

with  places,  which  cannot  capture  the  richness  of  urban 

places (i.e., spatial extents and their dynamic functions). This 

article develops a name-led framework to overcome these 

limitations in using social media data to study urban places. 

The  framework  first  derives  place  names  from  georefer-

enced Twitter data combining text mining and spatial point 

pattern analysis, then estimates the spatial extents by spa-

tial clustering, and further extracts their dynamic functions 

with  time,  which  makes  up  a  complete  place  profile.  The 

framework  is  tested  on  a  case  study  in  Camden  Borough, 

London and the results are evaluated through comparisons 

to the Foursquare point of interest data. This name-led ap-

proach enables the shift from space-based analysis to place-

based analysis of urban space.

Place  is  a  concept  that  is  fundamental  to  how  people  make  sense  of  geography  (Tuan,  1977).  Conceptually,  a 

place  can  be  described  as  a  specific  named  location  where  specific  activities  take  place  at  specific  times  

(Roche, 2015; Tuan, 1977). Urban places are particularly complex and dynamic due to the high concentration of 

activities and people, which may change throughout the day (Batty et al., 2012; Chan, Vasardani, & Winter, 2014).

A good understanding and representation of urban places would be beneficial for many applications, particularly 

within industries that rely on information about people and their activities, such as urban planning, retail, market-

ing, and transportation (Arribas-Bel, 2014; Batty et al., 2012; Cronin, 2008; Davoudi, 2003).

Unfortunately, it is inherently difficult to efficiently harvest place-related datasets, as places are dynamic so-

cial  constructs  and  different  members  of  the  public  may  identify  them  differently  (Jenkins,  Croitoru,  Crooks,  & 

Stefanidis, 2016). Thus, a place dataset should attempt to reach a consensus through the consideration of numerous 

human actors' perceptions. In recent years, new technologies, including Web 2.0, have greatly increased the supply, 

velocity, and availability of volunteered geographic information (VGI; Elwood, Goodchild, & Sui, 2012). Among the 

sources of VGI, georeferenced social media data have both semantic information (text) and high-resolution spatial 

and temporal information, making them a promising resource for place-related studies (Elwood et al., 2012). Given 

that a large share of georeferenced social media data tends to describe places and activities in near real time, they 

offer valuable opportunities to gain more insights into complex urban environments (Jenkins et al., 2016).

This article presents a methodological framework for identifying and profiling urban local places from large 

sets of georeferenced social media data, with an innovative name-led approach of associating social media data 

with places. The framework first identifies place names from a large sample of georeferenced social media posts 

using a combination of text mining and spatial point pattern analysis (SPPA). Second, it identifies probable spatial 

extents  of  the  identified  place  names  using  spatial  clustering.  Third,  semantic  and  temporal  characteristics  of 

places are described by analyzing the associated data. The framework is demonstrated using a set of geotagged 

tweets collected in Camden, Greater London.

The remainder of the article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the background to this study 

and related research. The methodological framework is described in Section 3 and the case study and results are 

presented in Section 4. Section 5 presents conclusions and directions for further research.

2.1 | Space and place

A place is more than just a simple physical space that is solely represented by its spatial location and geometric 

form; it is also an experiential construction of people (Relph, 1976; Tuan, 1977). Historically, in geographic infor-

mation science (GIScience), most place-related research has been simplified to spatial analysis for ease of compu-

tation, with places represented spatially as points or polygons (Goodchild, 2010; Longley, Goodchild, Maguire, & 

Rhind, 2005). In contrast to space-based analysis (spatial analysis), the concept of place-based analysis (otherwise 

known  as  platial  analysis),  which  treats  place  as  a  notion  that  has  vague  and  dynamic  spatial  and  semantic  at-

tributes,  has  attracted  increasing  attention  over  the  last  decade  (Agnew,  2011;  Goodchild,  2015;  Goodchild  & 

Li,  2011;  Purves  &  Derungs,  2015;  Roche,  2015).  Platial  analysis  offers  new  insights  beyond  traditional  spatial 

approaches when determining the interaction between people and their environment, because human cognition 

and activity are more aligned with places rather than geometric space (Goodchild, 2015). However, to apply platial 

analysis, place information needs to be better extracted, organized, and formalized, which remains a challenge.

2.2 | Social media and place

Many efforts have been made by geographers and urban planners to construct the profiles of places. Previously, 

they were mostly created with data sources produced by urban institutions, such as remote sensing (RS) satellite 

images, census data, and gazetteers (Goodchild & Hill, 2008; Liu et al., 2015; Sloan, Morgan, Burnap, & Williams, 

2015). Unlike official data sources, crowdsourced data represent a bottom-up means of generating information 

LAI et AL.    |  3

about the world and may provide additional insights that could have been neglected by practitioners (Goodchild, 

2007). As a well-known product of VGI, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a platform where volunteers can create and 

edit geographic features and related descriptions of maps, and its overall objective is to create a set of open, free, 

digital maps through crowd contribution (Haklay & Weber, 2008). Although it is a crowdsourced means of describ-

ing places, when contributing one's local knowledge in OSM, there are still many restrictions and rules, and it is 

mostly based on a static perspective.

Social media platforms enable users to upload information about real-world phenomena in real time, which 

can be assigned to predefined check-in points or geolocated precisely using a mobile phone’s positioning tech-

nology. These data can take different forms such as text, photos, videos, and GPS tracks. For example, a Twitter 

user might describe an activity occurring at the place they are visiting, and such information can be used to reflect 

aspects of the place, such as its function, popularity, and the meaning that users attach to it. Given that places are 

social constructs, and many are informal and invisible to officially produced datasets, social media data present an 

invaluable opportunity to acquire relatable information about places. Despite their ambiguities, the integration of 

places into everyday life has meant that there is still well-founded interest in place data to understand people and 

their activities (Goodchild & Hill, 2008).

Many discussions on social media platforms tend to be place focused. Lansley and Longley (2016) segmented 

a large sample of geotagged Twitter posts using topic modeling techniques. They found 10% of posts to be solely 

attributed  to  locations,  usually  through  check-ins  or  photography.  In  addition,  a  larger  share  of  messages  de-

scribed activities and events and many of those also referenced place names. The study revealed that there is a 

correspondence between what people describe on Twitter and the places that they inhabit or visit. For instance, 

retail centers all experienced high concentrations of messages about fashion and shopping.

There have also been efforts to harness social media data to generate crowdsourced information on the geog-

raphy of places. Keßler, Janowicz, and Bishr (2009), for example, experimented with generating bottom-up gazet-

teers using geotags from photo-sharing web services, whilst both Hollenstein and Purves (2010) and Goodchild 

and Li (2011) explored the spatial extent of place names identified from georeferenced Flickr posts using kernel 

spatial smoothing techniques. For each of these studies a prior understanding of place names or local naming 

heuristics was required. Such approaches cannot detect informally named places that may have important func-

tions in everyday life. One possible alternative is to use a crowdsourced dictionary of places. For instance, Adams 

and  Janowicz  (2015)  used  Wikipedia  data  to  identify  and  understand  places.  However,  no  such  alternative  is 

available for spatial data and we must also be cognisant that some places might have multiple names.

2.3 | Associating spatial data with place: A location-led approach

There are fundamental barriers to accurately detecting and representing places from georeferenced social media 

data. Primarily, it is difficult to link all posts to the places they describe where predetermined points of interest 

(POI) services are not used. Data typically need to be aggregated and bound to established frameworks in order 

to generate generalizations on places. Usually, urban place studies that harness georeferenced social media fol-

low  a  location-led  approach  which  associates  point-like  data  with  the  spatial  units  that  represent  places  using 

spatial joins. In such an approach, the study area needs to be partitioned into smaller units initially, or a layer of 

spatial units needs to be defined. Predefined spatial units can be grids, administrative units, roads, or user-defined 

catchment  areas  (Cranshaw,  Hong,  &  Sadeh,  2012;  Jenkins  et  al.,  2016;  Lai,  Cheng,  &  Lansley,  2017;  Quercia, 

Schifanella, Aiello, & McLean, 2015). This approach is suitable for statistical analysis from a general perspective 

because the boundaries can be clearly defined and can be linked to alternative datasets.

However, analyzing urban places with a location-led approach has many limitations. The spatial units are often 

designed for specific purposes, such as census surveys, but urban places in our everyday communications may 

LAI et AL.4  |    

not match these predefined units. The boundaries of urban places are vague and not fixed, and are likely to vary 

between people and communities, possibly also changing throughout time (Gao et al., 2017; Goodchild & Li, 2011). 

In addition, many places may overlap, especially in city centers, so it may not be appropriate to associate all data 

falling within the same spatial unit with a single location. For example, there may be shops, offices, and restau-

rants in one area (unit) and people may have different reasons for their visit. Therefore, the generated knowledge 

for a single unit may be a mixture of the results of all the places within it. This diversity of information is lost by 

considering each unit as a single place. For all these reasons, the location-based approach has many drawbacks for 

studying places using social media data.

3.1 | The concept of place profile

A place can be conceptually described as a named location with a certain spatial extent, where specific activi-

ties occur at particular times (Roche, 2015; Tuan, 1977). However, a formalized definition of place, which allows 

these important features of a place to be digitally described and integrated, has not yet been given in the existing 

literature. The commonly used place information formalization schemes, such as gazetteers, present a place as a 

static object with attributes of place name, footprint, and category (Hill, 2000). Similarly, Roche (2015) attempted 

to formalize the place information with three elements: name, event, and location. However, places in the urban 

context are more complex and dynamic than such formalizations can describe. Based on previous place studies, 

some essential elements of a good profile of a place can be derived.

First, the name of a place is an essential element that allows it to be identified and referred to. The shared 

knowledge of place names allows geographic locations and other features of the place to be communicated in 

everyday interactions and activities, and recorded in text documents with the geographical context (Vasardani, 

Winter, & Richter, 2013). Normally, an official set naming system (toponym) exists in every country, regulated by 

governing authorities for standardization purposes. However, only certain place names are officially authorized, 

and many more are unofficially recognized and adopted locally, termed “vernacular names” (Purves & Derungs, 

2015; Vasardani et al., 2013). Furthermore, in our daily communications, the name of a place can be temporally 

substituted by the name of the event or activities occurring there (Chan et al., 2014).

Second, location, as one fundamental element of a place, defines its physical position in space in contrast 

to everywhere else (Agnew, 1987, 2011). The description regarding the location of a place is not just about its 

position, but also its geometric form and spatial extent. The spatial extent of an area-type place may be vague 

unless it is officially defined, hence most places in daily communication do not have a crisp boundary in the 

minds of the people who refer to them. Moreover, the boundary of a place is likely to vary between people 

and communities, and may also change through time (Goodchild & Li, 2011; Montello, Goodchild, Gottsegen, 

& Fohl, 2003).

Third, the locations of the lived world that we perceive as meaningful places are differentiated because they in-

volve a concentration of our intentions, attitudes, purposes, and experience (Agnew, 2011; Lynch, 1960). Although 

one place may have different meanings for various individuals and groups, there is nevertheless some common 

ground of agreement about the meaning of that place for all the citizens interacting with the place (Relph, 1976). 

The meaning of place is essential to understanding place, but is difficult in terms of representation in a concise and 

formalized description. Activities, in contrast, can be recorded, measured, and formalized. Therefore, it has been 

suggested by many researchers that the meaning of place can be inferred from activities (e.g., Cheshmehzangi & 

Heath, 2012; Zakariya & Harun, 2013).

LAI et AL.    |  5

Last,  as  Wagner  (1972)  indicates,  “place,  person,  act  and  time  form  an  indivisible  unity.  To  be  oneself,  one 

has to be somewhere definite, do certain things at appropriate times.” From the perspective of describing place, 

a place should be described as the context where certain people do certain things at certain times. The name, 

location, activities, and meanings of a place can change over time, which makes the static description of place 

incomplete and inaccurate in many cases where up-to-date information is required (An et al., 2015; Batty et al., 

2012; Goodchild, 2013). Time, therefore, provides a continuity to the experience of place, and place should be 

described in a dynamic manner.

Therefore, we put forth a new concept of describing place, namely the place profile, formalized according to 

Equation (1), where P is place, N is name, L is location, A is activity, and T is time:

P = f

N,L,A,T

(

)

(1)

The place profile is a collection of information surrounding “what is the place called,” “where is it,” “what activities 

are occurring there,” and “how do these change over time.” Although the information related to a place is far more 

than what these four elements can describe, the basic information and characteristics of a place can be described 

if these four elements are addressed. Describing places according to such a structural definition integrates the 

spatial, temporal, and semantic information, which can provide relatively comprehensive insight into each place 

and form a standardized basis of analyzing, comparing, and relating places.

3.2 | A name-led approach to profile places

A place is a “named domain that can occur in human discourse (by contrast, references to latitude and longitude 

in human discourse are of course extremely rare)” (Goodchild & Li, 2011). Individuals normally use a name to refer 

to a place, given that people are more familiar with communicating places through names rather than coordinates 

(Goodchild, 2015), so a name-led approach would be better at relating social media data to urban places than a 

location-led  approach  as  discussed  in  Section  2.3.  Some  researchers  may  use  a  pre-existing  database  of  place 

names (e.g., gazetteers) as a means to find place names in social media data (Hollenstein & Purves, 2010; Vasardani 

et al., 2013). However, many place names used in social media data are vernacular names and abbreviations, which 

are very different compared to those official recognized names listed in gazetteers.

A name-led framework is developed here to profile urban places, consisting of four major steps, taking the 

geotagged Twitter data as initial input. It first identifies probable terms as place names from the Twitter text, then 

estimates the spatial extents of each term, representing the geographic boundary of each place; next, it extracts 

dynamic functions and generates a profile of each place; finally, it evaluates the outcome with a pre-existing POI 

database. The overall framework is presented in Figure 1 and the methods used in each step are introduced in the 

following subsections.

3.3 | Identifying place names

Place names should be derived from social media data itself in order to capture the full array of places discussed 

on social media that may or may not be captured by official datasets. Within the social media data, if a term has 

an unusually high concentration within a small geographic area then it might be a place name, or place related. To 

extract the names of places, we combined natural language processing (NLP) and SPPA to identify candidate place 

names from Twitter text. An advantage of this method is that it can be repeated at any location worldwide without 

a prior list of place names. This includes the following three procedures: NLP, SPPA, and duplicate removal.

3.3.1 | Natural language processing

A series of NLP techniques was applied to clean and format the Twitter text and reduce the size of the term vo-

cabulary. First, numbers, punctuation, and URLs were removed from the text, and then stop words (i.e., the com-

mon words that do not have specific meaning, such as “I,” “and,” “the”) were removed according to the English stop 

word list from the SMART information retrieval system (Lewis, Yang, Rose, & Li, 2004).

After text cleaning, text strings were split into terms through tokenization. Tokenization is a method that splits 

a  string  into  separate  terms  based  on  the  space  between  them.  We  consider  that  place  names  are  not  always 

unigrams. For example, “British Museum” is the name of a place but dividing the term into “British” and “Museum” 

removes the reference that is unique to that particular place. Therefore, an n-gram-based tokenizer was adopted 

to allow individual tokens to represent a term of n words.

3.3.2 | SPPA with platial score

After tokenization, the terms that are rarely used are further removed. Each remaining term in the list can be spa-

tially represented by the distribution of georeferenced tweets that contain it. We have assumed that place-related 

terms will be concentrated in and around said places, therefore, we use SPPA to identify spatial concentration 

of terms. In this study, we use Ripley's K function to identify place-related terms. Ripley's K function is typically 

used  to  compare  distribution  patterns  of  a  given  point  set  with  a  random  distribution  (Kiskowski,  Hancock,  & 

Kenworthy, 2009; Ripley, 1977). The point distribution is tested against the null hypothesis that the points are 
independent and identically distributed in space. For a given radius r, Ripley's K can be defined according to:

K (r) =

A
n − 1
)

(

n

I

dij ≤ r
(

)

kij

∑i ∑j

where  A is the total area of a spatial point set  X, n is the total number of points. I(dij ≤ r) is an indicator variable 
that equals 1 if the distance dij of a pair of points  i  and  j is no larger than distance r, and 0 otherwise. If an edge 
correction method is defined, kij is the edge correction weight. In this research, border correction is selected. The 
expected value K (r) for a random Poisson distribution is 𝜋r2. The results of Ripley's K function can be difficult to 
interpret, and a number of variations have been proposed, such as the K function normalized by area (L function), 
or by area and radius (H function). The L function L (r) (Besag, 1977) is a transformed K (r), so that its expected value 
is a linear value r, instead of 𝜋r2:

L (r) can be normalized further to give the H function H (r) (Kiskowski et al., 2009), which has an expected value of 0:

L (r) = √K (r) ∕𝜋

(2)

(3)

LAI et AL.H (r) = L (r) − r

    |  7

(4)

Interpreting  the  results  of H (r)  is  much  more  straightforward;  a  positive H (r)  indicates  clustering  over  that 

spatial scale, whereas a negative value indicates dispersion. Figure 2 shows the K function, L function, and H func-

tion for a sample of 1,000 geolocated tweets, drawn randomly from the dataset described in Section 4.1. On the 

figure, black lines represent the observed values and red dashed lines represent the expected value of a random 

distribution. The plots demonstrate the differences of these three functions and demonstrate that randomly se-

lected tweets display a clustering pattern that reflects the spatial distribution of population in the city.

Although tweets in general are spatially clustered because of the underlying spatial distribution of the users, 

the level of clustering still varies for different terms. To demonstrate this, tweets of three terms are selected and 

examined in Figure 3: 3,016 tweets containing “nice” [a term with a low H(r) chosen at random]; 3,520 tweets con-

taining “Euston”; and 1,707 tweets containing “Euston railway station.” The map on the left shows the spatial dis-

tributions of the three terms and the plot on the right displays the H-function values of the three groups of tweets. 

It can be observed from Figure 3 that tweets of the term “nice” have a relatively dispersed pattern, spreading over

the study area, while tweets of the term “Euston” are more clustered. Many tweets of “Euston railway station” are 

concentrated in a few specific points, because many of them were generated by check-in behaviors in Twitter and 

are geolocated to specific locations. It is worth noting that even though the number of tweets containing these 
three terms is different, the results of H (r) are comparable because the measure is based on point density rather 

than counts. The H-function values of a sample of 1,000 randomly selected tweets are also displayed as a gray line 
in the plot for comparison. As the plot shows, a point set which is spatially clustered has a higher H (r) value. The 
maximum score of H (r) can be extracted as a simple index of the level of clustering of a spatial point pattern. It can 
also be observed that the value of r that maximizes H (r) indicates the radius of maximal aggregation: the radius of 

an area in which a centered test point on average contains the most points per area. In other words, the smaller 
the value of r when H (r) reaches its maximum, the smaller the spatial extent of the cluster.

Although some places are meaningful to individuals (e.g., someone's home), from a general perspective, they 

are not as important to identify as places that are visited and used by larger groups of people. Therefore, we only 

investigate places from a collective perspective. Therefore, in addition to spatial clustering patterns, it is also im-

portant to take the number of unique users that mention each term into account to prevent extremely active users 

from skewing the results. We introduce an index score to rank terms according to their spatial point distribution 
and popularity among users, which is termed the platial score P (t) and is as:

P (t) = Hmax (t) ∗ log

Nu (t)

(

)

(5)

where, for each term t in the generated term list, P (t) is calculated by multiplying the maximum H-function value 
Hmax(t) and the log of the number of users Nu (t). The platial scores of all terms are then normalized using range 
standardization to facilitate comparison.

Terms  with  a  high  platial  score  are  more  likely  to  be  place  names.  In  order  to  separate  platial  terms  from 
non-platial terms, a threshold is defined on P (t). The threshold is defined quantitatively using a test statistic as 

follows. First, a random sample of terms (e.g., 10%) is selected and manually annotated by three volunteers. Terms 

that are related to place are marked as “true,” while the others are marked as “false.” After each volunteer has 

marked the sample terms independently, terms are annotated with the mark agreed to by the majority. For a given 
threshold of P (t), the terms that are above the threshold are tagged as “positive,” while the remainder are tagged 

as “negative.” Terms that are marked both “true” and “positive” are the “correct” terms. The performance of this 

threshold can be evaluated with three indices: precision, recall, and F score. Precision measures the percentage 

of “correct” terms in all “positive” terms. Recall measures the percentage of “correct” terms in all “true” terms. F 

score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall; a high F score indicates both high precision and recall. The 

performance of different thresholds can be evaluated, and the one achieving the highest F score is set as the final 

threshold.

3.3.3 | Duplicate place terms detection

It is common for places to be distinguished by multiple different place names, which might be especially common 

in social media. For example, “eus” is the abbreviation of “Euston” and both terms are commonly used. This situa-

tion is difficult to deal with automatically because there is a risk of grouping similarly distributed place names that 

actually represent unique places. In addition, different tokens could be generated from one string during n-gram 

tokenization, for example, “euston railway,” “railway station eus,” and “station eus” are tokens split from the string 

“euston railway station eus.”

Practically, each place term has a list of Twitter IDs associated with it. The Jaccard index J

(

based on their co-occurrences in tweets are clustered. Each cluster can be labeled by the term with the highest 

platial score to generate a cleaned list of place names.

3.4 | Estimating spatial extents of the identified places

Once a list of place names has been derived, the tweets in which the name within the list is mentioned can be 

extracted by matching the place names with Twitter text. This association process is purely based on string match-

ing. To supply a more complete dataset, the alternate names of the place (terms in the same cluster in the previous 

step) are also used in matching. For example, “euston railway station,” “railway station eus,” and “station eus” are 

alternate names for “London Euston railway station,” and tweets that include any of these terms will be extracted 

and associated with the place. In addition, one tweet may be associated with multiple places if it has multiple place 

terms simultaneously.

Tweets associated with a place are used to refer to the spatial locations of the place, and the highly concen-

trated area could be considered as the core spatial extent of the place. This is necessary given that people not 

only communicate place name, but also like to know where the place is spatially, which is normally not a single 

geometric location but an area with a boundary. In conventional gazetteer and POI data, the location of a place is 

normally represented by a point with a pair of coordinates. The point-based representation is convenient in spatial 

analysis, such as calculating distances and spatial joins. However, places in real life are not points but areas, and 

different  places  may  have  different  levels  of  spatial  influence  on  their  neighborhood  areas,  leading  to  varying 

spatial extents. The area-based representation may be more appropriate to represent the spatial extent of places.

One issue with social media data is that users might mention the names of places that they are not proximal to. 

For instance, Keßler et al. (2009) identified that many geotags were located miles away from the places they were 

describing. While there is interest in harvesting these messages to estimate the social influence of places, they will 

confuse models that are trying to identify the geographic extent of places.

Kriegel, Sander, & Xu, 1996), is used here to estimate the spatial extent of the place due to the following reasons: 

(a) clusters of arbitrary shape are detectable, such as linear, concave, oval, and so on (Gomide et al., 2011; Zhou, 

Frankowski, Ludford, Shekhar, & Terveen, 2007); (b) in contrast to some clustering algorithms, such as K-means, 

the number of clusters sought does not need to be specified; and (c) the algorithm naturally handles noise by al-

lowing isolated points to be unassigned (Sacco, Motta, You, Bertolazzo, & Chen, 2013).

DBSCAN organizes data points to obtain dense groups (clusters) that are separate from sparse data points 

(Zhou et al., 2007). The algorithm requires two parameters as input: (a) the radius of the search circle around a 
data point, usually termed 𝜀; and (b) the minimum number of points that must be in the circle of radius 𝜀 to be con-
sidered as a group of related points, usually termed minPts. The number of tweets associated with a place ranges 
from dozens to thousands, meaning that a fixed value of minPts is not suitable. Therefore, minPts is expressed as 

LAI et AL.10  |    

a percentage of the total points that a cluster should contain. To avoid places being defined by the activity of an 

individual user, a filter of minimum number of users can be applied to qualify a cluster.

After clustering, a convex hull is generated around each cluster to represent the spatial boundary of the place 

(Zhang, Noulas, Scellato, & Mascolo, 2013). A convex hull approach is a computationally efficient method used to 

represent the minimum bounding shape for a set of points.

3.5 | Generating place profiles

After identifying places and associating data with them, the four elements of each place (i.e., name, location, ac-

tivities, and time) can be revealed and its profile can be generated.

A list of term clusters was generated after duplicate detection in Section 3.1; each cluster can be labeled with the 

term having the highest platial score. The label term is suggested as the name of the place, while other terms in 

the same cluster can be presented as alternative names.

Given a set of spatial points that are identified as related to a place, the location and core area of that place can 

be approximated according to spatial analysis techniques, such as kernel density estimation (Cheng & Shen, 2018) 

and  spatial  clustering.  To  simplify  the  visualization,  in  this  article  the  spatial  extent  of  each  place  is  estimated 

through DBSCAN clustering as explained in Section 3.2, and spatially represented by the convex hull of the clus-

tered points. It is noted that the spatial influence of a place is not fixed and may vary through time and, although 

not shown here for brevity, the boundary of a place can be displayed differently according to the clustering results

of data in different time periods.

3.5.3 | Activities element

To infer the relevant activities and semantic information of a place, a topic modeling approach, latent Dirichlet 

allocation (LDA; Blei, Andrew, & Jordan, 2003), is applied to analyze the topics discussed in tweets that are as-

sociated with the place. As an unsupervised generative model, LDA classifies words into topics and represents 

documents (e.g., tweets) as mixtures of topics with various probabilities. A detailed explanation of LDA is beyond 

the scope of this article and can be found in the following references: Blei et al. (2003), Griffiths and Steyvers 

(2004), and Lai et al. (2017). After topic modeling, each tweet has a probability distribution indicative of belonging 

to multiple topics. However, as most tweets are very short, it is assumed that each tweet has a single topic and 

they are labeled accordingly. The activity element of a place, or its function and meaning, can be derived through 

analyzing the distributions of the topics in tweets associated with the place.

As per the nature of user-generated social media data, there is much noise in Twitter data, where some users 

produce a plethora of tweets featuring similar content. This might include, as an example, the tweets of weather 

forecasting and news produced by public service accounts. Since the noise is not always identical (e.g., weather 

forecasting posts), to reduce the influence of such noise, instead of removing all the identical tweets produced by 

each user, we limit the contribution of each individual user to the influence of each activity at a particular place 

LAI et AL.    |  11

(8)

to one. If this user visits another place, posts about another activity, or does so at another time, their data will be 

considered as new contributions. With this concept in mind, the bias from such noise is prevented while, at the 

same time, other useful information is not lost because there is no need to remove tweets in advance. For each 
place (p), the number of unique users for each activity (a) can be counted, represented as Np,a. The importance sp,a 
of the activity to the place can be calculated as:

sp,a =

Np,a
a Np,a

∑

Regarding temporal information, the relative distribution of tweets over time is analyzed to reveal the dynamic 

popularity  of  the  place.  In  this  framework  we  present  the  average  number  of  messages  by  hour  of  the  week, 

although the data can be aggregated according to other time schemes as Twitter has detailed timestamp informa-

tion. It should be noted that the spatial extent and activity distribution of one place may change in different time 

At this stage, the spatial, temporal, and semantic information of a place can be extracted and organized as its 

profile, which describes its basic information and reveals its characteristics.

periods.

3.6 | Evaluation

There are two steps in the evaluation. We first compare the identified place names with one of the most popular 

and widely used social media place databases, Foursquare POIs. Information from the Foursquare POIs is verified 

by the company as well as their user communities and thus may be treated as a reliable reference for a ground 

truth exercise (Hu, Mao, & McKenzie, 2019). If a place name can be matched with a Foursquare POI, it is marked 

as a correctly identified result. The remainder of the terms in the place names list are then manually inspected 

according to local knowledge and online searching; the terms will be annotated and grouped depending on their 

types and actual meanings, for example, whether they are real places.

4.1 | Data and case study area

To demonstrate the methodological framework, 361,388 tweets with geotags in the London Borough of Camden 

covering the entire year of 2013 are used. While tweet data are used for the case study, the framework proposed 

can  be  applied  to  any  spatially  referenced,  timestamped  data  with  text  descriptions,  such  as  travel  blogs  and 

geotagged photos (with text). The research pipeline can also be applied to data in other language contexts, since 

the terms were treated as tokens in data analysis; only the text mining and topic modeling steps will need to be 

changed before the spatial and statistical analysis.

Camden is located in the center of London (see map on the left in Figure 4). Figure 4 also displays the spatial 

distribution of tweets within the borough. The tweets are spatially concentrated in the southern part of Camden, 

which is a major commercial sector, while the northern part is primarily residential and has a far lower density of 

tweets.

4.2 | Data preprocessing

The  raw  Twitter  posts  were  cleaned  and  formatted  to  achieve  a  better  accuracy  of  topic  modeling  (Hong  & 

Davison, 2010; Lai et al., 2017; Lansley & Longley, 2016; Wang, Ye, & Tsou, 2016). The texts of the tweets were 

first imported as a “corpus,” which is a data structure to manage a collection of documents (Wallach, Mimno, & 

McCallum, 2009). The texts were then passed through text-mining steps, which include removing white spaces, 

numbers,  punctuation,  and  URLs.  Stop  words  were  removed  according  to  the  English  stop  word  list  from  the 

SMART information retrieval system (Lewis et al., 2004). By doing this, common characters and stop words are 

removed and the remaining words are more likely to be meaningful, which increases the chances of generating 

good-quality and distinctive topics in the following topic modeling process. Furthermore, the process of “stem-

ming” was also applied, which seeks to diminish inflected words to their stem form by removing suffixes of the 

words (e.g., “ing,” “ed,” “er,” etc.). These two steps are conducted to ensure different forms of words that have the 

same meaning will be treated as one input.

A collapsed Gibbs sampler (Resnik & Hardisty, 2009) was used to fit the LDA model and point estimates of the 

latent parameters were returned using the state of the last iteration. As suggested by Griffiths and Steyvers (2004), 

to achieve a fine-grained decomposition of the corpus into topics that address specific activities, we chose topic 

number 30 and hyperparameters α = 0.1 and β = 0.1 following empirical results of different parameter settings of the 

LDA model and manual inspection of the results. To ensure convergence of the model, 1,000 iterations were applied. 

Among the 30 generated topics, many were not relevant to activities and places (e.g., online slang and profanity). In 

addition, several topics were very similar, and therefore should be merged to yield more distinctive topic groups. As 

we were expecting to analyze activity or place-relevant topics, we extracted topics from the 30 generated topics 

and 10 activity-relevant topic groups were the result, referring to the topic classification schemes of POI categories 

(https ://devel oper.fours quare.com/docs/resou rces/categ ories ). The 10 selected topic groups, represented by their 

top 20 words ranked by the probabilities of belonging to the topic, are found in Table 1 and a label was assigned to 

each topic for ease of interpretation in later analysis. Tweets assigned to topics of the 10 selected groups were given 

the corresponding labels, while the remainder of the tweets were labeled as belonging to other topics.

4.3 | Identified place terms

After text cleaning, over 2.7 million tokens were generated using an n-gram tokenizer for values of n = 1, 2, 3. To 

reduce the computational intensity of the subsequent steps, the vocabulary is pruned by removing the terms that

occur in less than 100 documents, resulting in 2,847 tokens. The tweets that correspond to each token were then 

extracted. The user number was summed by counting the unique user IDs within the tweet list for each token. 

Ripley's L function was then applied to the tweet coordinates to estimate the spatial point distribution pattern.

The platial score P(t) of each token in the pruned vocabulary was calculated. A histogram of the normalized pla-
tial scores of all tokens is displayed in Figure 5 (left). To identify the threshold of P(t) we conducted an evaluation. 

A random 20% sample of the tokens (568 in total) was selected and manually annotated. We iterate the threshold 

from 0 to 1 with a step of 0.01, calculating the F score at each threshold. The result is displayed in Figure 5 (right). 

The F score reaches its maximum (0.86) at threshold P(t) = 0.33. Using this threshold, which is indicated by the blue 

dashed line in the charts, we identified a total of 252 terms that are likely to be place names.

To  identify overlapping terms, the pairwise Jaccard index of  the  selected terms  was  calculated.  Next,  hier-

archical clustering was applied to the terms based on the Jaccard distance matrix. The resulting dendrogram is 

shown in Figure 6. The height of the hierarchical tree corresponds to the Jaccard distance, which ranges from 

0 to 1. Users can cut the tree to produce any number of clusters from 1 to 252. After inspecting the clustering 

tree at different heights, we specify the height at 0.5 to generate 138 clusters, which successfully merges many 

overlapping terms while avoiding the merging of different places. A Jaccard distance of 0.5 means 50% of tweets 

in the subsample contain overlapping terms, which suggests that these two terms are very likely to originate from 

longer terms that refer to the same place. The term that has the highest platial score within each cluster is chosen 

as the place name label of this cluster. The remaining terms in a cluster are labeled as its alternative place names.

After these steps, the majority of the noise terms which are not relevant to places are removed and only the 

terms that are most likely to be place names remain. The parameters in this filtering process can be tuned by the 

user according to their needs and preferences. At this stage, it is feasible to go through the filtered term list and 

identify terms that refer to the same place which cannot be detected in the previous step, based on local knowl-

edge. A summary of the steps in identifying place names is illustrated in Table 2.

4.4 | Spatial boundaries of the identified places

The distribution of the number of Twitter points associated with each of the 111 identified places follows an ap-

proximate power law, ranging from 100 to 8,274 with a mean value of 685. For each Twitter point set, we apply 

DBSCAN clustering to identify the dense clusters, which are the core locations of that place. Based on the result 

of empirical tests with different sets of parameters, to have a reasonable constraint on the size of the major cluster

without splitting the data into too many small clusters, the search radius is set to 200 m and the minimum points 

threshold is set to 10% of the investigating point set in this case. Most of the places only have one cluster, while a 

few places may have more than one cluster. The extracted clusters indicate the core locations of a place. A convex 

hull is used to approximate the spatial extent of the place. An example is shown in Figure 7b.

4.5 | Place profiles

The occurrence of place names on social media throughout the day and week may reflect their characteristics and 

related activities. An example of the generated place profile of Euston railway station is observed in Figure 7. The 

profile consists of four elements. (a) Place name: “Euston railway station.” Other terms extracted from GSM data 

that are identified as associated with the place are also listed here, as one place may have multiple terms (alter-

nate names), such as “euston station,” “station eus.” (b) Location: all the associated tweets are plotted on the map,

chart here; the x axis also indicates the number of users. (d) Time: the tweet counts of 24 h over 7 days of the week 

are visualized here, each cell representing one hourly slot. The morning peaks and evening peaks at Euston railway 

station can be observed from the temporal pattern shown in Figure 7d. From the profiles presented, we can obtain 

basic information and some insights about this place. Based on our local knowledge of the place (i.e., Euston rail-

way station), the place names, location, prominent activity, and temporal variance are correctly identified.

4.6 | Evaluation of the results

Through matching, 75 of our 111 identified places can be linked directly to the POIs recorded in the Foursquare 

database. Grouped according to the top-level category of POI, the counts and cases of the matched places are 

presented in Table 3. Most of the identified places are in the “Art & Entertainment,” “Outdoor & Recreation,” and 

“Travel  &  Transport”  categories.  In  contrast,  no  places  in  the  “Residences”  category  are  identified  in  this  case 

study. It is noted that there are 2,085 POIs in total in Camden recorded in Foursquare (as collected in 2017), and 

only a small portion of them have been identified through our approach. This is possibly because the popularity 

of these POIs varies a lot; a large proportion refer to singular outlets or small places that are rarely discussed by 

users, especially in Twitter. However, according to our local knowledge of the study area, most popular places 

were  successfully  identified.  More  places  may  be  detected  if  we  decrease  the  threshold  of  term  frequency  or 

platial score, but this may also increase the chance of noise terms.

The remainder of the places on the list that do not match the POI data were subsequently manually inves-

tigated  and  labeled.  The  results  are  shown  in  Table  4.  The  analysis  confirms  that  the  Twitter  data  successfully 

identified some places that were not in the POI data. The tweets also located events as places, since the terms 

are frequently mentioned in specific locations, which were not considered in the POI database. However, there 

were some discrepancies. For instance, the Twitter data also identified some peripheral places where the POI fell 

just outside the study area. In addition, the terms “Paris” and “Brussels” were found due to discussions of interna-

tional trips at St Pancras international railway station. The methodology also misidentified train brands as places, 

because consumers tend to complain about train delays to train companies when they are at the major stations.

4.7 | Advantages of place profile over POI

Although the number of places we identified is smaller than the existing POIs, when comparing such place profiles 

with conventional place databases such as gazetteers, or the POI data, many advantages can be observed. (a) Some 

irregular expressions of place names are identified using the name-led approach. This is helpful in detecting more 

associated data in research using online documents. If the query is made using the exact place name recorded in 

conventional databases, for example “Euston railway station,” only part of the relevant data can be retrieved and 

the data that use other alternate terms such as “station eus” will be missed. (b) The location information stored 

in either gazetteers or POI databases is mostly pairs of coordinates. As well as location, the areas influenced by 

place can be identified using place profiles. This is important because it reveals where people view themselves to 

be, which may be different from where gazetteers, POIs, or other geographies place them. (c) Normally, only one 

category tag is attached to place in conventional databases, while the activity information in the profile reflects 

the values relating to multiple activities. (d) A detailed temporal variation can be observed from the profile, which 

helps to better understand the dynamic nature of a place. It should be noted that, while the example shown in 

Figure 7 (place profile for Euston station) is intuitive due to its clearly defined function, this may not be the case 

for other places whose function may be more diverse.

Another advantage of the framework presented here over standard POI-type data is that it identifies the spa-

tial extent of larger places, instead of simply representing them as points. For example, the method successfully 

identifies polygons for neighborhoods in the study area. The neighborhoods are mapped in Figure 8 and the POIs 

are shown for comparison. Interestingly, the location of the “St Pancras” POI falls outside the extent identified by 

the Twitter data. This is largely because “St Pancras” is a neighborhood-level administrative unit, and its location 

LAI et AL.    |  19

F I G U R E   8  The identified neighborhood-level places and corresponding POIs

recorded in the POI data is the centroid of this unit. However, people mostly refer to “St Pancras international 

railway station” when such a term (i.e., “St Pancras”) is mentioned in daily communications or online posts. This 

highlights the mismatch when relating places in human cognition to officially defined place locations. Name-led 

place definition is able to identify these differences. In addition, by associating tweets with places via place names 

instead of rigid predefined spatial units, the boundary of each individual place can be better represented, and the 

overlaps between places can also be clearly shown. This suggests that the name-led approach proposed in this 

research provides a new way of associating and representing platial data, from a place-based thinking.

This  article  has  presented  a  name-led  framework  for  harnessing  information  on  places  from  geotagged  social 

media data. Demonstrating this through a sample of tweets in Camden, London, we have presented a means of 

firstly, harvesting probable place names directly from tweet text and secondly, estimating the spatial extents of 

the identified places. Then, profiles of the places are generated by analyzing semantic and temporal information 

of the associated tweets.

We should note that bias exists since only Twitter data is used to conduct this research; however, the research 

framework and methods proposed in this article can be applied to many other data sources, especially geotagged 

LAI et AL.20  |    

textural documents. Each big data source is likely to over- or under-represent certain groups, activities, and places 

when  they  are  repurposed  to  represent  real-world  phenomena  (Lansley  &  Longley,  2016).  For  instance,  social 

media may be more useful for understanding urban tourist attractions than sleepy rural villages. However, social 

media remains unique in generating large volumes of georeferenced information at high velocity and from large 

numbers of people. It is fundamentally distinctive from official datasets, which are infrequently updated and do 

not reflect the full spectrum of public perspectives.

Indeed, the quality of the list of identified place names could also be improved by exploring more advanced 

NLP techniques to filter out place names mentioned in such informal online documents. The overlap between the 

Twitter-inferred places and the pre-existing POI database from Foursquare could also suggest that there is merit 

in using both types of place data in conjunction with each other to improve our understanding of social media 

activity and the real world. We have also not explicitly taken into account varying accuracies of the geolocations 

associated with tweets. Depending on the device and location settings, the geolocations may be determined by 

GPS, mobile phone masts, or both. Therefore, the accuracy may vary from a few meters to hundreds of meters, es-

pecially in dense urban canyons where satellite visibility and multipath have an effect. The design of the DBSCAN 

algorithm accounts for this to a certain extent, but future work could examine alternatives to the convex hull for 

determining the boundaries of places that take into account uncertainty.

Despite the limitations mentioned above, the general research framework and the innovative name-led ap-

proach proposed in this research break the conventional limitations of using predefined rigid spatial units to an-

alyze places and create a more flexible and people-centered way of perceiving places. Instead of simply joining 

data to the rigid predefined spatial units, data are joined to places via place names, which corresponds to how 

people perceive and communicate about place. More importantly, this research is unique in that little or no prior 

knowledge of the bounding locations is required to harvest the place information, thus this could be repeated in 

other locations around the world to profile urban places without the need for a well-established place database. 

If dealing with data in another language, only the text mining and topic modeling steps will need to be modified 

by adopting the tokenization tool corresponding to that language. The remainder of the research pipeline, which 

is mainly spatial and statistical analysis, can easily be transferred. In addition, a concept of place profile was pro-

posed in this research, which helps to structurally organize the basic information of urban places (including place 

name, location and boundary, activities and temporal information) that can be extracted and inferred from social 

media data. Thus, it is hoped that this research can assist the general shift from space-based analysis to place-

based analysis in the context of GIScience.

After profiling urban places, their connections can be explored further in future studies, which will benefit a 

wide range of urban place-related applications. For example, with such detailed and dynamic understanding of 

urban places achieved, site selections for retail business can be more convenient. In fields such as urban planning, 

such knowledge can aid more efficient distribution of resources and planning of new infrastructure to maximize 

their usage. In marketing and tourism, more targeted planning can be made using the information gathered about 

places, specific to location, target audience, and even time of day. In general, it is hoped that this research can 

assist in advancing the development of smart cities, where information about places can be better gathered, pro-

cessed, and utilized.

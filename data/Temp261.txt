Introduction
A GIS representation of a natural resource traditionally conforms to the discrete
model of spatial variation, which is commonly modelled using object-based or
polygon-based GIS (Goodchild et al. 1993). In such a system, the natural resource
is divided into a set of discrete and mutually exclusive classes, whose spatial
distribution are traditionally presented using a set of different colours in the so
called ‘choropleth’, or more precisely ‘chorochromatic’ map (Burrough and
this is a polygon map with fully deﬁned
McDonnell 1998). In GIS terms,
adjacency, while the properties are recorded in attribute tables keyed to the polygon
identiﬁer. Since the geographical units are modelled as discrete objects, and the
taxonomic entities as discrete classes, this approach is referred to as the double
crisp approach (Burrough et al. 1997). For example, a soil surveyor uses sharp
boundaries to delineate soil bodies (polypedons) on the landscape, and crisp classes
of soil types to classify the typical soil individual found in the body. Variation of
soil types within the crisp boundary may be mentioned in the linked database, but
an impression of having crisp objects remains. Similar approaches are followed for
other natural resources, including forest vegetation types, geomorphic classes, land-
cover classes, and geological units. In all these cases, the mapped objects are, in
fact, usually not as crisp as the map indicates. On the contrary, these are often
continuous in both their properties and distribution. In particular, soil units have
always been considered to be poorly identiﬁable in both respects, being ‘arbitrarily
deﬁned classes of mostly hidden objects’ (Burrough, 1993). Similarly, classes of
geoforms or landforms are hard to separate, as the geographers often emphasize
(Fisher and Wood 1998).

The alternative, continuous model of spatial variation and related ﬁeld approach
to GIS modelling (Heuvelink 1998) were ﬁrst utilized in geostatistical interpolations
to produce maps of single continuous ratio or interval-scale variables (Burrough
and McDonnell 1998). With the emergence of the theory of fuzzy logic (Zadeh
1965),
it becomes interesting to model categorical variables, such as soil and
landform classes. Here each class ﬁrst has to be mapped separately as a single class
map, usually as the membership grade or membership value (m), ranging from 0 (no
membership in the class) to 1 (full membership). Consequently, a variable with n
classes will result in several (n) single maps, i.e. multiple memberships maps. These
are continuous categorical or fuzzy maps, with the main difference from the
conventional maps being that they can be analysed for ambiguity or indistinctness
of a speciﬁc class and the overall confusion among all classes (Hootsmans 1996).
In the past decade, a number of methods have been proposed to deal with
fuzzily deﬁned natural objects. Lagacherie et al. (1996) drew the fundamental
distinction between categorical and geographical
fuzziness, and proposed a
classiﬁcation of boundaries between soil map units on this basis. Irvin et al.
(1997) used ﬁve landform parameters to produce membership maps of landform
classes using fuzzy k-means classiﬁcation. The classiﬁcation of landforms was then
further on discussed and improved by Burrough et al. (2000), who suggested an
automated procedure to select the number of classes based on the classiﬁcation
entropy. Similar applications where continuous categorical maps are used instead of
double-crisp maps can be found for vegetation (Brown 1998), land cover (Hansen
and Reed 2000) and land-evaluation studies (Hall et al. 1992, de Gruijter and
Boogaard 2001). Woodcock and Gopal (2000) examined accuracy assessment for

fuzzy maps and concluded that they can give better estimates of areas covered by
crisply deﬁned classes than the conventional double-crisp maps.

Single membership maps are easily visualized by grey or pseudo-colour scales
that are related to strength of membership. However, each map is separate, which
means that the user cannot visualize the membership maps as a whole and
understand the properties of the whole set of classes, e.g. overall fuzziness and
relations between multiple classes. Visualization of fuzziness and uncertainty are
important as they allow users to explore these and investigate the effects of different
decisions in the classiﬁcation process (MacEachren and Kraak 1997). This is not an
easy task for maps of natural resources having tens of classes and resulting
membership maps.

The simplest cartographic procedure commonly used to display the membership
maps is defuzziﬁcation (Burrough et al. 1997). Here, a crisp colour map is produced
by assigning the class with the highest membership in an individual pixel. Since
defuzziﬁcation applies to individual pixels, it provides no means to visualize the
nature of boundaries or the uncertainty of classiﬁcation, although there have been
some investigations in this direction (Fisher 1993, Hootsmans 1996, §7). de Gruijter
et al. (1997) were among the ﬁrst to develop a cartographic technique called ‘Pixel
Mixture’ (PM) to visualize membership maps by including all membership values in
the representation. This technique randomly assigns pixels to a sub-pixel grid, with
a probability proportional to the membership grade in the class, thereby giving a
visual impression of both the possible classes and their confusion (de Gruijter et al.
1997). A similar concept of setting up a sub-pixel grid to visualize the transition
zones between land cover classes was given by Atkinson (1997). de Bruin and Stein
(1998) visualized multiple membership grades together with the uncertainty of
classiﬁcation, where the class map was displayed together with the confusion index
(in further text CI), by combining hatching to visualize the classes and grey-scale
intensity to visualize the CI. Although, in principle, the latter method would work
with any number of classes, more than about ﬁve classes leads to visual ambiguity
between the grey-scale intensity and density of the hatching pattern.

Until now, a per-pixel colour-mixing approach had not been pursued, assuming
that digital technology was limited to three colours. Colour mixing is in fact
possible, using, for example, the standard red, green, and blue bands (RGB), but
only if the number of classes is three. There is still a need for GIS methods to
visually explore the results of fuzzy classiﬁcation and at the same time quantify
transitions (Goodchild et al. 1994, Burrough and McDonnell
abruptness of
1998: 284).

In this paper, we extend the work of Burrough et al. (1997) and de Gruijter et al.
(1997) by developing a new static visualization technique based on calculations with
colours. We propose a technique to simultaneously explore both the spatial and
taxonomic confusion of our mapping system. For this purpose, we developed a so-
called ‘fuzzy-metric’ circular colour legend, suitable for quantiﬁed categorical data,
and a method to analyse the abruptness of the derived boundaries.

2. Methods
2.1. Supervised fuzzy k-means classiﬁcation

Membership maps can be derived by different algorithms. Most commonly, the
membership maps are derived using a continuous classiﬁcation algorithm such as

fuzzy k-means (de Gruijter and McBratney 1988). From the general theory of
numerical taxonomy, a membership is calculated from the standardized distance in
the attribute space (Sokal and Sneath 1976):

mc ið Þ[ 0, 1
½
where: mc(i) is a fuzzy membership value of the ith object in the cth cluster, d is the
similarity distance, k is the number of clusters, and q is the fuzzy exponent
determining the amount of fuzziness. A commonly suggested value for q, also used
in this work, is 1.5 (Burrough et al. 1997). The simplest similarity distance is the
Euclidian distance, deﬁned as the sum of squared differences from a given ith object
to the class centres in attribute space (Gordon 1981):

ð3Þ

where: xc, j’s are the class centres of the jth attribute variable, and k is the total
number of classes. The fuzzy k-means classiﬁcation was used to develop an
unsupervised classiﬁcation algorithm where the memberships are calculated based
on an objective function for the entire set of k classes (de Gruijter and McBratney
1988). In this case, the only input is the number of classes and fuzzy exponent,
while the algorithm ﬁnds the optimum class centres iteratively. The alternative to
this approach is to predeﬁne the class centres, so that the optimization function is
not necessary. This is a supervised fuzzy k-means classiﬁcation or allocation, which
is attractive for those cases where the surveyor has prior knowledge of the central
concepts of the several classes (Hartigan 1975).

In the case of supervised classiﬁcation, the cluster centres for each attribute of
each class are established prior to the classiﬁcation by sampling. The similarity
distances are ﬁrst standardized using the sampled variance for each class and then
used to derive the multiple memberships:

where: sxc, j is the sampled variance around the xc, js, and dc(i) is the diagonal distance
(Hartigan 1975).

2.2. The Colour mixture (CM)

Instead of mingling ﬁxed-colour sub-pixels, as in the case of PM, an impression
of confusion can be achieved by mixing colours in each pixel (i) as an averaged
intensity of RGB bands. The new derived Ri, Gi, Bi raster maps are ﬁrst calculated
separately for each of the three primary colours and then combined as a colour
composite in image processing software:

where: the Ri, Gi, Bi are the new derived mixed colours, Rc, Gc, and Bc are
the digital values (0–255) for selected class colours, and k is the number of classes.
We refer to this algorithm as the Colour Mixture (CM). For standardized fuzzy
sets, the sum of memberships equals unity, and the denominator in Eqs. (5), (6) and
(7) can be discarded. A simpliﬁed example of how CM works, can be seen in
ﬁgure 1.

In ﬁgure 1, a new colour (cyanish blue) is derived as a weighted average of four
colours and reﬂects the highest memberships: blue and green-cyan colour. However,
the CM technique is more complex than it appears at the ﬁrst sight: how can one
interpret the new colours and create a legend showing all possible colours for all
combinations of memberships? Moreover,
if the legend class colours for each
individual class are selected freely, a new-derived colour will not necessarily appear
in the originally selected legend (accidental colour).

A more serious problem can be illustrated by the case of three classes (say A, B,
C), where the representation of class B lies midway along the line connecting A
and C in the RGB colour cube. A pixel that appears the same as the colour of
class B in the legend could indeed indicate class B. However, it could also result
from the maximum confusion between the A and C classes (i.e. mA~mC~0.5). The

the weighted averages of class representations.

possibility of such situations increases with the addition of more class colours,
i.e. a higher density of points in the colour cube. To minimize such confusion,
classes that are close together taxonomically should also be close in the colour
cube.

To account for the above-listed problems, we decided to construct the legend

following three principles:

1. All legend colours should lie in the same plane in the RGB colour cube, to be

able to produce a two-dimensional representation.

2. It should not be possible to derive an exact colour in the legend from any

combinations of colours representing other classes.

3. A mixture in colour space should be the visual equivalent to a mixture in

taxonomic space.

Following these three principles, we designed a special legend for the purpose of

CM. We named it the ‘fuzzy-metric colour legend’.

2.3. Fuzzy-metric colour legend

To keep all colours on one plane, we selected the cross-section (plane) of the
RGB cube perpendicular to the diagonal, which connects black (0, 0, 0) and white
(255, 255, 255). This is the Hue, Saturation, Intensity (HSI) colour model (Brown
and Feringa 1999). There are an inﬁnite number of such planes along the diagonal,
each corresponding to one intensity, also called the brightness (ﬁgure 2(a)). At any
brightness, we can produce a wheel-shaped palette, called an ‘HSI colourwheel’,
which has the same brightness value and different hue and saturation values
(Niblack 1986, p. 61). Here, the hue (H) represents the visual sensation of the colour
type and is calculated as the number of degrees around the axis. The saturation (S)
represents the degree to which the colour expresses its hue and is calculated as the
radial distance from the diagonal axis (ﬁgure 2(a)). The intensity (I ) represents the
visual !sensation of brightness. The HSI colour model has already been deemed as
promising for the visualization of uncertainty by Jiang et al. (1995) and Jiang
(1996).

The formulas for RGB-to-HSI transformations often differ between software.

In ILWIS, the transformation is made using:

In this way, none of the mixed colours will appear too dominant visually. The
class colour representations were located on the perimeter of the HSI colourwheel
at a given brightness (here, arbitrarily set to 120 or half of the full brightness). In
this way, the class or taxonomic value is coded only with the hue, while the
saturation is maximized (240), and the brightness is kept constant.

We imagined that the relation between class centres in attribute space can be
used to place them closer or further apart on the circumference of the HSI wheel.
The class centres can be analysed in multivariate attribute space, also referred to as

taxonomic space. However, the centres rarely fall along a two-dimensional subspace
(plane) within this space. Yet, we only have two dimensions that can be
represented. Therefore, the dimensionality of the taxonomic space can be reduced
to factor loadings by factor analysis (Tucker and MacCallum 1997). The ﬁrst (F1)
and the second (F2) factor loading can then be used as the axes of a reduced
attribute space, the so-called biplot display (Gabriel 1971). The angular distances of
the class centres can then be used to derive representation hues for each class.
Figure 2(b) shows an example of colour derivation for four classes, in which the
angular distance between any two classes is proportional to the distance in
taxonomic space spanned by the factor scores F1 and F2. Note that we lose
information by using only ﬁrst and second factor loadings, which is unavoidable,
since we need to produce a two-dimensional legend. The Hue of each class is
derived as the angular distance around the centre of gravity, which, in the case of
factor loadings, is the centre of the coordinate system:
Þ: 240
360

Hc~ 360
2p

: arctan F1c, F2c
ð

ð12Þ

where: Hc is the new derived class Hue, and F1c and Fc2 are the factor loadings in
the cth class. To display the class colours in the GIS, the Hc, Sc, and Ic values
(where Sc~240 and Ic~120) need to be transformed to RGB. In ILWIS, this is
done by using the inverse HSI-to-RGB transformation. Towards the centre of the
circle, the colours approach grey, that is, the hues become less distinct. This
visualizes the situation where we are less sure about the components of any mixture.
However, the ﬁrst maps produced showed that the coding of uncertainty of
classiﬁcation with saturation does not offer sufﬁcient visual
impression. This
corresponds to results of perception tests conducted by cartographers, which clearly
showed that brightness is the best variable to visualize uncertainty (Jiang 1996:
118–120). Therefore, we ﬁnally decided to visualize confusion using the whiteness,
i.e. the amount of white colour, by replacing the constant brightness with the
derived saturation:

(cid:1)

ð13Þ

where: Hi and Si are the hue and saturation maps derived from the CM, colorhsi is
the ILWIS command to derive a RGB map from HSI maps, and Ri*, Gi*, and Bi*
are the corrected RGB. Now, both the saturation and brightness change radially,
i.e. the brightness changes from 120 (circumference) to the maximum brightness
(255 or the centre of the colourwheel).

From equation (12), we can back-transform the RGB map to estimate the input
memberships. We ﬁrst have to derive angular coordinates of each colour in the HSI
colourwheel:

2.4. Confusion index based on the CM saturation

The fuzziness of the derived multiple memberships is analysed by calculating the
confusion index (CI), which is commonly deﬁned as the difference, or sometimes
the ratio, between the ﬁrst and second highest membership class per pixel:

CI1~1{ mmax{m2nd max

ð

Þ

CI2~

m2nd max
mmax

where: mmax is the highest membership and the m2nd max is the second-highest
membership (Burrough et al. 1997). The CI map calculated from one of these
equations will show higher values in the areas of transition between different classes
in attribute space. The CI1,2 are the highest at the transition zones, and thus can be
used for their automatic delineatation. However, the CI1,2 do not consider how
similar the mmax and m2nd max classes are taxonomically. It can show high confusion
although the classes might be taxonomically very similar and vice versa. To assess
which classes are more similar, we can calculate the distances between the class
centres using formula in equation (4) and pooled standard deviation:

It appears that the between-class memberships should be used to adjust the CI
for similarities between the classes. However, the calculation of adjusted CI can be
complex as there are many combinations of class centres. In this case, the design of
the fuzzy-metric colourwheel can be regarded as a way of adjusting the confusion.
The classes that are closer on the colourwheel will give a lower distance when used
to derive a new colour, thus giving us a similar impression of the confusion. In
ILWIS the colour-separation operation can be used to derive the saturation Si of
each pixel from its (Ri, Gi, Bi) values. The saturation can now be expressed as the
relative saturation or radial distance on the colourwheel (CICM) by transforming S

ð22Þ

In this case, the maximum back-transformed saturation value produced by
ILWIS was 210, not 240 as would be expected from the forward transformation.
However, due to the truncation of the values used in the HSI to RGB trans-
formation, which is non-linear, we decided to use the lower value for saturation as
the more realistic.

2.5. Deriving primary boundaries

The geographic transition zones, i.e. pixels, were ﬁrst extracted by calculating a
crisp map of most possible classes (defuzziﬁcation). This map was then converted to
a vector format using raster-to-vector transformation in GIS, i.e. to a segment map
showing the transition zones. The CICM can be used to quantify different
boundaries. In this case, the boundary pixels with high CICM (w0.7) were classiﬁed
as ﬁrst-level or primary boundaries, otherwise as
secondary
boundaries or soft lines, which correspond to the boundary types typically used
in the photointerpretation (Buringh 1960). Areas of high CICM outside the
transition zones were considered to represent possible intra-/extra-grade classes, as
they show a greater distance from more than two classes at the same time.

second-level,

2.6. Case study

The methodology was tested using the Baranja Hill dataset, a 3.563.5 km
square. This is the central photo from the aerial phototriplet that had been
interpreted for landform classes using a conventional aerial photointerpretation
technique (API)—the geo-pedological approach to soil mapping (Zinck and
Valenzuela 1990). Two main landscapes were recognized: a dissected elongated hill
with numerous vales and a plain with two terrace levels. To classify the landform
classes, we used six attribute maps: relative elevation to groundwater (GWD), slope
gradient (SLOPE), wetness index (CTI), proﬁle and tangent curvature (PROFC and
TANGC), and viewshed (VSHED) at a grid resolution of 25 m. We selected about
30 pixels in each mapping unit to estimate the central values in the attribute space
(table 1). This corresponds to the selection of the training set in the supervised
classiﬁcation of remote sensing images.

The memberships of the fuzzy k-means were calculated in ILWIS from the set of
six maps. Factor analysis of the attribute space was carried out using the maximum
likelihood estimation model of S–Plus
Inc., 1999). The derived
memberships are shown in ﬁgure 3.

most correlated landform parameters were SLOPE and CTI, TANGC and
PROFC, and GWD and CTI. The closest classes on the circumference of the
colourwheel were Pl311 and Pl411, i.e. the low and high terraces of the plain. These
classes are also very close in taxonomic space, both being towards the centre of the
two-dimensional attribute space formed by the factors. By contrast, the summit and
shoulder of the hill (Hi111 and Hi112) are close on the colourwheel (similar angle)
but not in the taxonomic space, i.e. Hi111 was much further from the centre. This
problem is further discussed in the Conclusions and discussion.

The allocation of classes on the colourwheel can be compared with the similarity
distances calculated between the class centres (table 3) and their derived between-
class memberships (table 4). The most similar class pairs are: Hi112 and Hi311;
Hi112 and Hi111; and Pl311 and Pl411. The sum of distances gives an idea of the
closeness of class centres in the multivariate attribute space. In this case, the most
distant class centres are Pl311 and Hi411, while Hi112 and Hi311 are the closest
having the lowest total sum of distances. These relations correspond to that seen in
the biplot display.

colours were selected subjectively to represent a psychological impression of the
landform facets: bluer colours were used to represent wetter, lower soils such as
the terraces and vales, green to represent steeper slopes, and yellow for hilltops,
whereas, in the case of the mixed-colour map, colours reﬂect distances between
classes in the attribute space. The defuzziﬁed map in ﬁgure 5(a), does not provide
any information about confusion or original memberships. The PM allows the
viewer to infer the overall confusion of each class. For example, the vale bottom
(Hi311) seems to be the purest delineation (ﬁgure 5(b)). The mixed-colour map
(ﬁgure 5(c)) shows intermediate colours between similar classes (i.e. along the
circumference), which represent intergrades in taxonomic space and therefore are
assigned intermediate colour. However, intergrades between strongly contrasting
classes ﬁnished having colours towards the centre of the circle, i.e. being whitish.
For example, intermediate pixels between escarpment (Hi211) and the two terrace
levels (Pl311 and Pl411) show an almost white colour. This is psychologically
appealing: a pure white colour represents a mixture of strong contrasts or an
undeﬁned class, where a mixture of similar classes results in a transitional colour.
The inverse process of back-deriving the memberships from the mixed-colour
map showed that the estimation of the memberships, based on the angular
coordinates of the reduced feature space (f1, f2), can make inaccurate estimates of
the original membership in areas of high confusion. This is not the case with the
PM technique, where the original memberships can be estimated fairly well by

counting the proportion of pixels. In the case of CM, once we have projected the
class centres onto the circumference of the colourwheel, we have permanently lost a
part of the information. We compared original and back-derived memberships for
all classes and found a strong relationship with correlation coefﬁcients between the
classes ranging from R2~0.43 (Pl311) to R2~0.94 (Hi312, Pl411). However, the
back-derivation showed systematic discrepancy, as the areas of higher original
memberships will usually be overestimated, while the areas of high confusion can
give rather different estimates of the original values.

3.3. Confusion and boundary index

Differences between CICM and the commonly used confusion indices CI1,2 can
be seen in ﬁgure 6. The CI1 map shows all transition zones, while the CICM map
shows only the transition zones between classes that have sufﬁcient angular
separation on the colourwheel. In this case, some classes were basically merged, and
no confusion is shown. For example, the transition zone between the hill summit
and shoulder (Hi111 and Hi112) disappeared in the mixed-colour and CICM map.
Also, the transitions between the high and low terraces and the sloping part and

colluvium of the escarpment were ignored. However, the transitions between the
Hi111 and Hi311 and Hi312 were shown as being more abrupt.

The histogram of the CICM map showed a small grouping around the higher
CICM and a clear breakpoint at CICM~0.7. We selected this as the threshold to
separate the primary and secondary boundaries. The derived primary boundaries
(transitions between the more contrasting classes) can be seen in ﬁgure 7. The CM
technique shows the clear advantage of diminishing the boundaries of fairly similar
classes, which cannot be achieved by using the common confusion indices (CI12).
The remaining areas of high CICM (w0.7), i.e. those areas which were not areas
of transition, were considered to be inter-/extra-grades, again adjusted for the
taxonomic similarities. Comparing these patches with the input maps, we found
that they are mainly correlated with proﬁle curvature and slope (PROFC and
SLOPE). Indeed, neither proﬁle nor tangent curvature (PROFC and TANGC)
showed any correspondence with the delineated geomorphic units in a visual
overlay. These are thus areas inside some API units, which differ from the
surrounding unit in their convexity, and should perhaps be considered as different
geomorphic classes in a revised API legend.

4. Conclusions and discussion

A comparison of the CM and the alternative approaches with visualization of
multiple memberships showed that the there are two major applications that should
be emphasized in this work: (1) CM visualizes the uncertainty of our classiﬁcation
by giving an insight into both taxonomic and geographical confusion, and (2) it
serves as a method to generalize similar classes. In the case of visualization of

CICM values in the upper part of the histogram.

uncertainty, we used whiteness, which gave a better impression of uncertainty than
the saturation. This was also conﬁrmed after we printed the mixed-colour map. The
confusion index derived from the mixed-colour map allows extraction of primary
transition zones between fairly contrasting classes. Moreover, the CICM can be used
to locate areas of high taxonomic confusion (inter-/extra-grades) and therefore can
be used to redesign the map legend or make additional sampling on the ﬁeld. The
commonly used CI1,2 do not account for confusion in taxonomic space. In the case
of CM, the selection of colours to represent a class was not based on the mapper’s
connotation (e.g. yellow for sand, purple for peat), but were assigned by the
algorithm and limited to seven colour types. This is a relatively small number,
considering that there are 627 colour names in the qualitative Colour Notation
System (Berk et al. 1982), which will be discouraging for an experienced
cartographer. However, taking the rule of thumb that the optimal number of
classes that can be perceived and memorized by user is seven (Kraak and Ormeling
1996), the double continuous approach ensures a limited number of colours
regardless of the total number of classes.

Although the input number of classes is high, the system will always limit the
number of colours to seven generic hues: red, yellowish, green, cyan, blue, magenta,
and white. In that sense, the mixed-colour map can be compared with the pseudo-
colour scale used in many GIS packages for visualizing continuous variables. The
derived saturation of the mixed-colour map calculated using the CM technique
visualizes both objects and their taxonomic location as fuzzy sets, whereas the
defuzziﬁcation or PM visualizes both classes and transitions as crisp. Therefore, we
address it as a double continuous or double fuzzy approach and the resulting map
as a mixed-colour map with a fuzzy-metric legend (ﬁgure 8). In this case, the legend

indicates not only the category but also the ‘amount’ of a category, e.g. ‘terraceness’
or ‘summitness’ in different parts of the map. Although one may argue that the
concept of relatively homogeneous delineations, occupying relatively compact
geographical areas is not so far from reality, the advantage of the continuous
categorical maps is that they are universal. If there is indeed no confusion between
the class clusters, a map becomes double-crisp.

The limitations of the described CM method are as follows. First, in the case of
CM, the colours can still be derived from different combinations of memberships,
i.e. the class centres are considered to be as relative as the deﬁnition of classes. If
the classes from which a new colour is derived are fairly distant on the colourwheel,
the CM will produce an ambiguous (whitish) colour. The original memberships
cannot be accurately back-derived as we do not know from which combination of
membership it was derived. The system quantiﬁes the taxonomic space, which
means that even if a membership of some class is low, if two closely neighbouring
classes show equally high memberships, the derived colour will correspond to an
intermediate class colour.

The second limitation of CM is that we were forced to reduce the attribute space
to only the ﬁrst and second components. Thus, we have discarded information in
this reduced attribute space, as only 67% of the total variation was explained with
the ﬁrst two components. Also, note that for factor analysis, the number of classes
needs to be larger than the number of attributes. An alternative would be to
develop a method to use distances between the class centres (from table 3) to
allocate them on the circumference of the colourwheel. In both cases, we will have
to approximate or average input values, as the number of classes is much lower
than the number of possible combinations. In this case, a 969 matrix gives 36
combinations in total, or (k22k)/2. Second, in the case that the class centres are
maximally spread over the feature space, the biplot display method is fast and gives
a good picture about the relation between them (ﬁgure 9(a)). A problem will appear

if a class is very close to the centre of gravity (ﬁgure 9(b)). Two classes could have
similar angles, but one could be much closer to the centre than the other (class C in
this case). In fact, this class can casily ﬁnish being any colour, which is an unwanted
effect. It will appear closer to some class, although it is almost equally distant from
all classes. We can also imagine a case where a single class, fairly distant from other
classes, will distract the centre of gravity (ﬁgure 9(c)). In this case, it is clear that
there are more taxonomic clusters, but the map produced will show only a few
colours.

Finally, a limitation of the proposed CM algorithm is that the deﬁnition of the
HSI colourwheel is not completely perceptually scaled. (Equal distances measured
throughout colour spaces represent equally perceived colour differences.) In this
case, we were forced to use a geometric colour space to enable linear calculations
with colours. It is possible that some other colour models could provide better
solutions for colour mixing and design of the legend.

‘There is no longer any need to cling to the double-crisp model† we can do much
better now’, stated Burrough et al. (1997: 133) half a decade ago. At that time, the
algorithms for fuzzy classiﬁcations were applied in experimental studies only,
whereas today, they can be can found in many statistical and GIS packages, some
of which are free, e.g. FuzME (Minasny and McBratney 1999). In this paper, we
presented a method to visualize and analyse the multiple memberships by doing
GIS calculations on colours. Its development has forced us to think about
taxonomic space and how to construct a metric legend for categorical variables. We
ﬁnally selected the circular form of the legend—categorical classes are not sorted
one above another as they are in the traditional concepts. A circle has no beginning
and therefore indicates that the classes are not ordinal. However, some classes can
be located closer and some farther apart.

Operational tools for production and use of continuous categorical maps in
large projects are yet to be developed. The example shown here is based on nine
classes in a small area. Real county-level soil surveys typically have 20–40 map
units, which requires a greater computational effort. The next step will be to test
this methodology on datasets developed as a part of large inventory projects. Some
parts of the CM principles could also be used in a more interactive way to offer
better insight into the classiﬁcation uncertainty of discrete data. For example, by
linking the resulting mixed-colour map to the sample points, so that a mapper
could inspect class deﬁnition interactively. This could, for example, help optimize
the deﬁnition and number of class centres.

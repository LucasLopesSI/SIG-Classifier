In economy, society and personal life map-based interactive geospatial visualization becomes a natural element of a growing
number of applications and systems. The visualization of 3D geospatial information, however, raises the question how to
represent the information in an effective way. Considerable research has been done in technology-driven directions in the
ﬁelds of cartography and computer graphics (e.g., design principles, visualization techniques). Here, non-photorealistic
rendering (NPR) represents a promising visualization category – situated between both ﬁelds – that offers a large
number of degrees for the cartography-oriented visual design of complex 2D and 3D geospatial information for a given
application context. Still today, however, speciﬁcations and techniques for mapping cartographic design principles to the
state-of-the-art rendering pipeline of 3D computer graphics remain to be explored. This paper revisits cartographic design
principles for 3D geospatial visualization and introduces an extended 3D semiotic model that complies with the general,
interactive visualization pipeline. Based on this model, we propose NPR techniques to interactively synthesize cartographic
renditions of basic feature types, such as terrain, water, and buildings. In particular, it includes a novel iconiﬁcation concept
to seamlessly interpolate between photorealistic and cartographic representations of 3D landmarks. Our work concludes
with a discussion of open challenges in this ﬁeld of research, including topics, such as user interaction and evaluation.

Keywords: 3D information visualization, 3D semiotic model, cartographic design, user interaction, real-time rendering

INTRODUCTION

Owing to the progress in computer graphics technology,
speciﬁcally in interactive 3D rendering (Akenine-Mo¨ller
et al., 2008) and computer graphics hardware, the ﬁeld
of cartography is confronted by new potentials and
applications (Kraak, 1989; Buchroithner et al., 2000).
The ongoing shift from static media to diverse interactive
display technologies has a tremendous impact on the design,
production, and use of digital maps and map-related
visualization. Today, they are faced with new possibilities
to effectively and efﬁciently present complex, massive 2D
and 3D geospatial data. Accordingly, the transfer of existing,
proven cartographic principles to modern media and
imaging technologies, and the development of new
cartographic methods are key challenges for current and
future research.

Approaches of interactive non-photorealistic rendering
(NPR) (Gooch and Gooch, 2001) applied to 3D geospatial
visualization facilitate an effective information transfer
(Do¨llner and Buchholz, 2005). Generally, these techniques
comprise various parameterizations to enable a view, data,
and user dependent image synthesis. In current literature,

a systematic review of recent interactive 3D rendering and
visualization techniques, which drive modern display
technology, is missing with respect to aspects of carto-
graphic design and map production. Such systematization,
however,
facilitates the exploration of 3D cartographic
design spaces, provides an overview of parameterizations
for
and applications, and enables reference pipelines
visualization to be combined with existing semiotic models.
This paper comprises the following contributions. First,
design principles and core variables considered important
for an effective design of 3D geospatial visualization are
revisited and enhanced in accordance with previous research
in semiotics. Second, concepts are provided to map-related
cartographic design elements to graphical primitives, based
on an analysis of the state-of-the-art in NPR. Third,
exemplary illustrative visualization techniques are proposed
in correspondence with cartographic design principles of
traditional hand-drawn maps (Figure 1) to demonstrate the
potentials of computer graphics hardware for real-time
rendering and user-deﬁned parameterization. This includes
a novel
iconiﬁcation technique for a view-dependent
visualization of 3D landmarks.

Figure 1. Examples of cartography-oriented design for 3D geospatial visualization

The remainder of this work is structured as follows. The
following section revisits the cartographic design process for
3D geospatial visualization and provides an extended 3D
semiotic model that complies with the general visualization
pipeline. Afterwards, we survey illustrative visualization
techniques and propose new techniques for an interactive
design of basic feature types (e.g., water, buildings). We
then state future challenges for interactive 3D geospatial
visualization with cartography-oriented design. The ﬁnal
section concludes this paper. In the following, we refer to all
forms of map-related representations of mixed 2D and 3D
geospatial information by ‘3D maps’ as a pragmatic notion.

CARTOGRAPHIC DESIGN PROCESS FOR INTERACTIVE
3D GEOSPATIAL VISUALIZATION: AN EXTENDED 3D
SEMIOTIC MODEL

An effective communication involves people as recipients
and makes the contents relevant within the knowledge
transfer (Brodersen, 2008). Geospatial involvement signiﬁ-
cantly depends on how relevant information is designed and
cognitively processed (MacEachren, 1995). Key factors for a
successful information transfer involve design aspects that
provide a perceivable and comprehensible visualization, and
that reduce the memory load of a user by addressing
rational, emotional, and cognitive aspects (Kolacny, 1969;
Montello, 2002; Fabrikant et al., 2010). Cartographers
evolve the collection of visual variables (Bertin, 1983; Tufte,
1983; Brewer, 1994; Garlandini and Fabrikant, 2009) to
provide graphic semiology principles and optimize the
geospatial information transfer mainly of 2D cartography.
Because 3D geospatial visualization, however, adheres to
speciﬁc challenges, such as occlusion, visual clutter, and the
absence of map scales (Jobst and Do¨llner, 2008b), the need
for a 3D semiotic model that includes design aspects for 3D
geospatial visualization has received considerable attention
in the past years (Ha¨berling et al., 2008; Jobst et al., 2008c;
Pegg, 2012). Primary concerns of these works are the
independent graphic variables and their
mechanisms of
mutual impact (Jobst, 2008a). These variables follow the
basic stages of 3D map production, such as modeling,
symbolization, and visualization (Ha¨berling, 1999; Ha¨ber-
ling et al., 2008), including psychological and physiological
design aspects (Albertz, 1997; Buchroithner et al., 2000).
Researchers agree that the cartographic design process
should account for application space, level of interactivity, and
the audience of purpose (Hake et al., 2002), including the
user’s context and environment, skills, and competence, and
the purpose of visualization (e.g., user’s task) (Nivala and
Sarjakoski, 2003). User interaction plays an important role in

3D geospatial visualization to consider these contextual
constraints, as it provides the means to adapt the spatial and
thematic granularity at which 3D model contents should be
represented (i.e., the level of abstraction, LoA) (Semmo et al.,
2012b). In practice, this results in user-deﬁned parameteriza-
tions of 3D semiotic variables, ranging from high-detail
deﬁnitions (e.g., using unﬁltered data) over symbolized
(Ha¨berling, 1999) to completely abstract deﬁnitions (Kraak,
1989; Dykes et al., 1999). Because the presentation of 3D
contents in perspective views can be manifold and complex;
however, 3D objects need to be generalized to display relevant
information in a clear and efﬁcient manner (Petrovic, 2003;
Ha¨berling et al., 2008). In cartographic theory, a coupling of
the 3D semiotic model to a well-established framework that
supports user interaction and generalization has not been
formulated. From a computer graphics perspective, however,
this is mandatory to provide the conceptual means for a
hardware-accelerated visualization process.

We extended the 3D semiotic model to comply with the
visualization pipeline of 3D computer graphics (Ware,
2004), which is a generally accepted model by visualization
researchers and practitioners. Figure 2 categorizes variables
of the models by Jobst et al. (2008c) and Ha¨berling et al.
(2008) in ﬁve processing stages, with additional interaction
aspects for user involvement and generalization operators
for an automated design. The model also considers
temporal and spatial coherence of graphical elements as
important design aspects, along with preserving (monocu-
lar) cues for humans to infer depth (Surdick et al., 1994;
Pfautz, 2000; Buchroithner et al., 2000). In particular, the
shower-door effect should be avoided at the rendering
stage, i.e., the impression that a 3D scene is observed
through a semi-transparent
layer of (texture) marks
(Be´nard et al., 2011).

Our model embeds cartographic generalization operators
that are used to transform geodata into human-readable
maps (Sester, 2007; McMaster and Shea, 1992; MacEach-
ren, 1995). The transformation and presentation techniques
are based on combinations of generalization operators, such
as class selection, simpliﬁcation, enhancement, displace-
ment, or typiﬁcation (Foerster et al., 2007). Generalization
operators can be applied (1) to the original geodata of a 3D
virtual model in the ﬁltering stage, leading to a generalized
primary landscape model, (2) to the mapped data in the
mapping stage (symbolization) to yield a generalized
cartographic model, and (3) in the rendering stage for a
generalized graphics representation. In practice, concrete
these
visualization techniques use a combination of
operators. In particular, generalization operators for all
three stages are required if they have to provide adaptive,

visualization pipeline (Ware, 2004), coupled with concepts for cartographic generalization (Foerster et al., 2007). The visualization process comprises
ﬁve processing stages: (1) modeling of real-world phenomena (features), (2) ﬁltering and pre-processing, (3) mapping of the primary model to a
cartographic model via symbolization, (4) rendering, and (5) the perceptional interface

User involvement is a critical design aspect to maintain an
iterative feedback loop between the visualization system

and the user’s

A good interactive design presents as much information as
required for context (Reichenbacher and Swienty, 2007). In
particular, the ﬁltering stage provides an effective user
interface to select only that information required for further
processing. Figure 3 provides examples of focus and context
deﬁnitions for the visualization of virtual 3D city models.

ILLUSTRATIVE VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES

This section surveys illustrative visualization techniques
according to the extended 3D semiotic model, and proposes
new techniques based on building blocks of the real-time
rendering pipeline.

Taxonomy and overview
Non-photorealistic rendering is a particular domain of
computer graphics that has been adopted and used in
illustrative visualization to provide the hardware-accelerated
means for reducing visual complexity and directing a
viewer’s focus of attention to features of interest (Gooch and
Gooch 2001; Santella and DeCarlo, 2004; Cole et al.,
2006). Table 1 presents a non-exhaustive overview of
visualization techniques that consider cartographic design
aspects in 3D spaces. This overview is drawn with respect to
the extended 3D semiotic model (Figure 2), and is
categorized by feature type semantics using the taxonomy
research,
of CityGML (Kolbe, 2009). From our
we conclude
. Terrain: we distinguish between techniques for contour
highlighting, simulation of traditional
illustrations by
means of slope lines and hachures, hill shading and relief
shading, and isolines. Perceptional design aspects have
also been explored using progressive or degressive
projections via multi-perspective views (MPVs) to handle
occlusions.

. Water: a ﬁrst extensive framework for 3D geospatial
visualization has been presented by Semmo et al. (2013)
to simulate waterlining, contour hatching, water
stippling, and labeling at different LoAs.

. Green spaces: vegetation objects can be distinguished
without and with individual characteristics (Do¨llner and
Buchholz, 2005),
the ﬁrst being based on 2D
distribution functions via synthesis of point patterns

(e.g., Jenny et al., 2010a) and element arrangements
(e.g., Hurtut et al., 2009) for symbolization, and the
latter being based on individually stylized 3D objects
(e.g., trees, Deussen and Strothotte, 2000).

. Buildings: techniques for 3D building design are often
based on reduced colour palettes with typiﬁed or stylized
fac(cid:1)ade elements, and symbolized LoA representations
(e.g., for tourist maps, Grabler et al., 2008).

. Transportation networks: their projection on digital terrain
models (draping) and disocclusion can be identiﬁed as a key
challenge (e.g., Takahashi et al., 2006), together with
colorization and view-dependent contour-lining in 3D
perspective views (e.g., Vaaraniemi et al., 2011).

Many visualization frameworks are also coupled with generic
NPR techniques (Kennelly and Kimerling, 2006), e.g., the
depiction of suggestive contours to convey shape (DeCarlo
et al., 2003), edge-preserving image ﬁltering for LoA
visualization (Semmo and Do¨llner, 2014), and labeling.

Most of these techniques can be applied in real-time using
image-based rendering concepts (e.g., G-buffers) (Saito and
Takahashi, 1990). Focus þ context visualization is a
relatively new ﬁeld of research; previous work use location-
based or view-dependent metrics (Semmo et al., 2012b) to
select and to combine different LoAs according to user
interaction and semantics.

Visualization techniques for basic feature types
We empirically analyzed illustration techniques by famous
cartographers printed in map collections (e.g., Merian,
2005), and textbooks on map design (Imhof, 1975;
MacEachren, 1995; Kraak and Ormeling, 2003; Tyner,
this section presents
2010). Based on this research,
visualization techniques for buildings, water surfaces,
green spaces, transportation networks, and digital terrain
models. The main focus lies on how design principles used
for traditional hand-drawn maps can be implemented with
buildings blocks of the real-time rendering pipeline, such as
texturing and deformation, to demonstrate the capabilities
of modern computer graphics hardware.

Building and site models
Four graphical core variables for buildings and sites can be
extracted (Figure 4). (1) Reduced colour palettes are often
used for visualization, e.g., using distinct colours for roofs
and fac(cid:1)ades to distinguish between sacred and secular
buildings. (2) Contour lines are often depicted to better
distinguish building instances. (3) Building features are
depicted using strokes, for instance, to indicate windows.
(4) Important buildings may be shown from a “best view”,
i.e., a landmark is rotated to face its most characteristic fac(cid:1)ade;
this concept is often practiced in the design of tourist maps.

We implemented an algorithm that automatically extracts
dominant colours (colour palette) and structural elements
(variations in colour value/intensity, such as window
contours) from photorealistic textures, such as aerial
images. Previous work showed that these contour edges
may improve depth perception signiﬁcantly, e.g., in the
visualization of
thematic data (Engel et al., 2013).
To summarize, two major steps are performed:

Colorization: Dominant colours are derived from textures in
regions with constant colour tone, which are weighted via
entropy-based metrics. Afterwards, the algorithm by Levin
et al. (2004) is used to obtain (re-)colourized fac(cid:1)ades, e.g.,
in the style of natural colour maps (Patterson and Kelso, 2004).

3. Landmarks are ﬂattened in depth; i.e., their geometry is
projected to the plane facing the horizontal view
direction (billboard synthesis).

4. The billboard representation is yawed by the camera

elevation to vertically face the view direction.

The linear combination of all steps yield transformed
positions of a 3D landmark. In addition, a smooth
interpolation between the original 3D representation and
iconiﬁed version can be performed as an animated transition.
Here, view metrics may be used to parameterize this
interpolation (e.g., view distance) for focus þ context
visualization (Semmo et al., 2012b).

for water

Water surfaces
Illustration techniques
surfaces are diverse
(Figure 7). A popular technique in the ﬁrst half of the
twentieth century for lithographed maps was waterlining,
i.e., the placement of ﬁne solid lines parallel to shorelines,
where the spacing between succeeding lines gradually
increase. Another conventional technique for hand-drawn
maps is water stippling, where distance information is
propagated by small dots, aligned with non-linear distances
to shorelines. Contour hatching has been widely used to
establish motion, i.e., placing excessively wavy strokes with
high-density near shorelines, complemented by loose lines
with increasing irregularity towards the middle stream.
Other illustrations use non-feature-aligned cross-hatches for
land-water distinction, but have been replaced in the
second half of the twentieth century by colour tones and
drop shadows. The techniques may be complemented by an
irregular placement of signatures with area-wide coverage.
Waterlines correspond to shaded areas of a water surface
with equal shoreline distance. To comply with non-equidistant
interspaces, a non-normalized distance map is computed and
used to independently apply waterlining from a water surface’s
scale (e.g., oceans vs lakes). This automatically derived map is
used to query the distance to the nearest shoreline for each
point on a water surface, and thus, is able to effectively convey
shape. The correspondent distance values are then thresholded
using a non-linear step function, and padded by small intervals
to render antialiased waterlines with smooth transitions. For
a continuous level of abstraction, the thresholding is
parameterized by the view distance. At high-view distances,
this approach signiﬁcantly reduces the number of rendered
waterlines and provides a smooth transition while zooming

Contour Lines: Difference-of-Gaussians ﬁltering is
performed on each scene texture (Semmo and Do¨llner,
2014), coupled with an image-based approach (Nienhaus
and Do¨llner, 2003) for enhancing contour lines.

Figure 5 exempliﬁes a result of our algorithm applied to a
virtual 3D city model. Compared to typical photorealistic
depictions, our method is able to improve feature contrasts
and express uncertainty.

We also implemented a visualization technique that uses
deformations to automatically transform 3D buildings and
sites to iconiﬁed variants according to their best views. For
buildings, best views often face the main entrance and can be
approximated via viewpoint entropy (Va´zquez et al., 2004),
or explicitly deﬁned via model semantics. To obtain a
transformed landmark in world space coordinates,
the following four steps are performed on a per-vertex
basis at the rendering stage in real-time (Figure 6):

1. Landmarks are non-linearly scaled to improve their
visibility in far view distances (Glander et al., 2007).
A weighted smoothstep function is used to compute the
scale factor.

2. Landmarks are pitched so that their best-view direction
horizontally coincides with the user’s view direction.

in a 3D scene. Figure 8 shows a rendering result that
uses our waterlining technique to illustrate the land–water
interface in a dynamic ﬂooding scenario.

We employ an enhanced variant of Glanville’s (2004) texture
bombing to place water stipples with feature-aligned distri-
bution and irregular density, i.e., to convey shape and motion.
The basic idea is to randomly place glyphs in regularly
distributed grid cells. We extend this algorithm by three phases;
a selection, displacement, and ﬁltering of stipples (Figure 9).
Instead of using a random placement of these stipples,
offsets are computed that align them with the waterlines.

Finally, we developed a novel contour-hatching technique
to symbolize water movements. Once a feature-aligned
distance map is computed, digitized stroke maps are
irregularly placed with non-linear distance to shorelines.
Parameters for stroke length, thickness, and spacing are
deﬁned and applied during rendering to provide artistic
control over this placement. Here, the main idea is to derive

Figure 11. Examples for the cartographic design of green spaces

Figure 12. Examples for the cartographic design of street networks:
a) non-explicit vs b) explicit graphical representation

and threshold 2D texture coordinates for each rendering
fragment by bilinearly sampling distance maps (Figure 10).
Because this placement works in object space, it provides
frame-to-frame coherence, and avoids the shower-door
effect known from image-space techniques. In addition,
water movements can be animated quite easily, contrary to
static media, e.g., by shifting individual strokes along the
major directions of the computed distance maps.

Green spaces
Green spaces are often depicted in perspective views on
entity level using detailed graphics, or via symbolization
(Figure 11). The ﬁrst approach can be modeled via
example-based methods and instancing, while for the latter
we again use texture bombing (Glanville, 2004). The
approach aligns and scales the signatures with the view
direction and distance during shading to reduce visual
clutter (Figure 13a). The symbols can be parameterized to
reﬂect land-use information (e.g., arable land, grassland)
and tree species.

Transportation networks
Two general approaches for the depiction of transportation
networks exist: (1) non-explicitly by the principle of
surroundedness (MacEachren, 1995) (Figure 12a) and
(2) the explicit graphical depiction via connected route
segments (Figure 12b). In modern maps, contour lines often
surround ﬁne-textured ﬁlls or solid colours to add visual
contrast and improve the ﬁgure-ground perception. We
implemented a shading-based technique that models this
behavior using distance maps to generate and stylize route
geometry on-the-ﬂy during rendering (Figure 13b). The
technique enables interactive modiﬁcations of the depicted
content (e.g.,
localized colour schemes, view-dependent
stylization for focus þ context visualization). Further, it uses
qualitative colour schemes to portray different grades of roads
and enables cognitive grouping of each network type
(Kraak and Ormeling, 2003), where primary streets often
overlap secondary or tertiary streets. This approach provides a
highly ﬂexible stylization, since no pre-computations are
required, which is vital
for highlighting important or
prioritized route segments in dynamic visualization scenarios.

glyph size) is parameterized during rendering to enable a user-deﬁned or view-dependent design process

Digital terrain models
At this point, we do not add on the substantive literature on
terrain design and visualization. A reasonable shading-based
approach for hatching is to extract morphometric variables
from height ﬁelds (e.g., slope steepness), and then trace
and stylize slope lines at the rendering stage via an example-
based shading approach (e.g., placing digitized strokes).
Figure 13c depicts two results following the methods of
Buchin et al. (2004).

DISCUSSION

The presented systematization of rendering and visuali-
zation techniques via the extended 3D semiotic model form
a basis for the development of more advanced visualization
concepts, tools, systems, and applications, i.e., to embed
cartographic design into 3D geospatial visualization. The
presented illustrative visualization techniques demonstrate
the parameterization capabilities of modern computer
graphics hardware to simulate selected design principles
found in hand-drawn maps. An elaborate study of their
practical use in real-world scenarios, however, remains
subject to future work.

There are numerous technical and conceptual aspects for
further improvements of the presented results. Despite
algorithmic optimizations and feature enhancements to
ongoing developments in computer graphics hardware, the
parameterization and conﬁguration of the visualization
techniques to non-expert users comprises a number of
potentials for future research. In particular, this includes the
question on how the parameterization of visualization
techniques can be adapted to the virtual camera to ensure
optimal results for different viewing situations.

Further,

the development of dedicated interaction
techniques based on direct user input (e.g., via touch
technology on mobile devices) and according to feature
semantics is required to effectively control the visualization
parameters, and thus, foster further applications in map
production pipelines. Focus þ context and zooming
interfaces are promising concepts
to provide these
in 3D geospatial visualization, especially
constraints
considering an interactive ﬁltering process. Although
some of the presented techniques are already included
in software systems used by non-experts, the conduction
of qualitative and quantitative user studies remains an
important topic for future works to further improve the
visualizations techniques.

Furthermore, most of the techniques considered in this
paper are designed to handle outdoor visualization
scenarios. With respect to this, the presented system-
atization can be extended to cover indoor mapping scenarios
as well. Based on CityGML LoD-4 models (Kolbe, 2009) or
building information model standards, this can include
combinations of ghosting, cut-away, and explosion viewing
techniques to support and to complement computer-
generated camera paths, and guarantee that a user is able
to preserve the spatial context during navigation.

Finally, a major research direction represents the transfer
and integration of visualization techniques into service-
oriented architectures to facilitate their application for cloud

computing and mobile devices. Integration into these
infrastructures enables a broad and scalable access of
geospatial data, e.g., using new specialized mapping services
or a combination of existing ones (Beaujardiere de la, 2006)
to foster the availability and accessibility of geospatial
products and applications.

CONCLUSIONS

We present an overview of new approaches
to the
cartography-oriented design of map-related representations
as well as a correlated extended 3D semiotic model that
integrates cartographic design aspects and concepts of
generalization into a reference visualization pipeline,
including new aspects, such as ﬁltering and coherency, to
help systemizing the exploration of 3D cartographic design
spaces. Using this model, we give an overview on the state-
of-the-art in the visualization of 3D geospatial information
based on 3D semiotics and NPR. On top of this, we present
exemplary visualization techniques for basic geographic
feature types and how core mechanisms of the modern
real-time rendering pipeline can be leveraged, such as
texturing and shading. Most notably, these techniques
demonstrate the capability to shift the design process from
pre-processing to all interactive stages of the visualization
pipeline, which is promising for digital web based and
mobile mapping services to provide an accomplished
context-aware visualization – e.g., sensitive to the environ-
ment and purpose of visualization (user’s task). Future work
will have to show how convenient the proposed visualization
techniques are in real-world scenarios, such as routing or
geospatial exploration.

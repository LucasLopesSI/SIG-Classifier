There exist many facets of error and uncertainty in digital spatial information. As error
or uncertainty will not likely ever be completely eliminated, a better understanding
of its impacts is necessary. Spatial analytical approaches, in particular, must some-
how address data-quality issues. This can range from evaluating impacts of potential
data uncertainty in planning processes that make use of methods to devising methods
that explicitly account for error/uncertainty. To date, little has been done to structure
methods accounting for error. This article develops an integrated approach to address
data uncertainty in spatial optimization. We demonstrate that it is possible to charac-
terize uncertainty impacts by constructing and solving a new multi-objective model
that explicitly incorporates facets of data uncertainty. Empirical ﬁndings indicate that
the proposed approaches can be applied to evaluate the impacts of data uncertainty
with statistical conﬁdence, which moves beyond popular practices of simulating errors
in data.

dispersion

Introduction

1.
The growth and popularity of geographic information systems and associated digital spatial
information is remarkable, fundamentally changing planning and management processes
as well as spawning the development of advanced spatial analytical methods. While there
has been much done to identify and ameliorate data error and uncertainty issues, and
more generally improve overall data quality, imperfections in spatial information remain.
This ultimately may be attributed to the fact that the three-dimensional real world is
abstracted as a simpliﬁed digital representation in modeling and analyses (Longley et al.
2011). When spatial data are relied upon in applications, error or uncertainty in data will
not disappear but rather will be propagated through subsequent manipulation, process-
ing, and analysis (Longley et al. 2011). There are many examples in the literature that
demonstrate this, including Arbia et al. (1998) and Abbaspour et al. (2003), where error
propagation is tracked in simple map algebra operations like overlay. More sophisticated
analytical approaches have been subjected to data uncertainty impacts as well, including
Fisher (1991), Heuvelink (1998), Bruin et al. (2001), Aerts et al. (2003), and Heuvelink

et al. (2007), to name but a few. In particular, Aerts et al. (2003) found a signiﬁcant dif-
ference in construction costs for a ski run when accounting for potential errors in derived
slopes using in a land-use optimization model. What the above work highlights is that all
spatial analysis is likely impacted by data error/uncertainty in some way. Better under-
standing impacts and implications of data uncertainty in spatial analysis using various
methods therefore requires techniques to explicitly account for uncertainty, lest the analysis
be biased and unreliable.

While uncertainty impacts associated with any and all spatial analytical methods are a
concern, this article focuses on spatial optimization, an analytical method that contributes
to transportation, retail, natural resource management, location modeling, medical geogra-
phy, land-use planning, and districting, among others. The importance of optimization in
geographic information science is well recognized, spanning database structure and access,
algorithm design, cartographic display, and spatial analysis (see Church 1999, Murray
2007). Overviews of spatial optimization may be found in Church (2001), Xiao (2008),
and Tong and Murray (2011). A spatial optimization problem is one where there are deci-
sions to be made regarding the placement and/or allocation of a good or service, and the
best decisions are sought subject to maintaining any constraints or conditions. A problem
or issue is therefore represented (implicitly or explicitly) as a mathematical model, with
decision variables, an objective(s), and constraints (Tong and Murray 2011). Spatial opti-
mization research has in fact long recognized data uncertainty issues. For example, Cooper
(1974) observed that demand locations may not be known with certainty in location mod-
els and Goodchild (1984) discussed that potential demand locations in a location-allocation
model for retail site selection may be somewhat inaccurate. Reviews of work on one class
of spatial optimization problem, location models, associated with data uncertainty can be
found in Murray (2003) and Snyder (2006).

Even though data uncertainty in spatial optimization models has been widely acknowl-
edged, a generally applicable method to account for uncertainty and evaluate its impacts
on modeling results remains elusive (Church 1999, Murray 2003). One commonly used
method is simulating error in spatial data. This has involved intentional perturbation of
input or output data to mimic error, then comparing analyses obtained with and without
simulated error (see Goodchild 1984, Hodgson 1991, Aerts et al. 2003, Murray 2003,
Beech et al. 2008). This makes intuitive sense, and provides some capacity for evalua-
tion and sensitivity assessment. However, simulation along these lines is computationally
intensive, effectively necessitating an inﬁnite number of combinatorial possibilities to be
considered in practice. It is impossible to consider all combinations of variability, which is
why samples have been relied upon. Unfortunately, uncertainty necessarily remains, often
absent any type of certainty bounds on derived ﬁndings or results (Salema et al. 2007,
Ascough et al. 2008).

In this article, we propose an explicit approach for considering error/uncertainty in spa-
tial optimization. To illustrate this, a particular type of spatial optimization problem known
as a dispersion model is considered. Uncertainty in geographic proximity is expressly
represented and incorporated into the model, enabling evaluation and assessment with a
degree of statistical certainty. The next section reviews existing literature on data uncer-
tainty in spatial optimization. This is followed by the introduction of the optimization
model being considered here. A discussion highlighting spatial uncertainty associated with
the use and application of this dispersion model is then presented. A new model is then
introduced that enables data uncertainty to be explicitly considered. Application results
are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the new model. Finally, a discussion and
concluding comments are given.

2. Background

Spatial optimization models are implicit or explicit mathematical representations of plan-
ning problems, necessarily abstractions of reality, and could be affected by uncertainties
or errors in various ways. Such uncertainty may arise in model speciﬁcation, solution sub-
optimality, attribute variation (estimates/classiﬁcation/precision), spatial representation,
locational accuracy, and proximity interpretation, among others. Many studies have sought
to better understand elements of uncertainty along these lines. Table 1 lists representative
work associated with uncertainty in spatial optimization grouped in six categories. The last
three, spatial representation, locational accuracy, and proximity interpretation, are partic-
ularly relevant to issues of spatial uncertainty. As a result, the review that follows focuses
on these three categories. While uncertainty in model speciﬁcation, sub-optimality, and
attributes are no doubt important, they are generally not associated directly with error in
spatial position.

There has been much work on spatial representation associated with uncertainty and
error in spatial optimization modeling, as suggested by the representative work noted in
Table 1. There are two basic streams associated with spatial representation that relate to
uncertainty. One is aggregation and another is simpliﬁcation. Aggregation has involved
the intentional merging of spatial units, either to reduce computational effort or to accom-
modate the modeling approach. Work by Goodchild (1979), Daskin et al. (1989), Current
and Schilling (1990), Fotheringham et al. (1995), Murray and Gottsegen (1997), Francis
et al. (1999), and Francis et al. (2009) has sought to examine some aspect of unit aggrega-
tion in spatial optimization. In many cases, it has been demonstrated that errors associated
with such aggregation can be minimal in certain circumstances. Another way that aggre-
gation has been used is to re-structure spatial units in a particular planning problem so that
they conform to more easily implementable mathematical characterizations. For example,
Murray (1999) demonstrates how aggregation of smaller management units into larger
blocks then allows binary restrictions between blocks to be imposed in a constraint, avoid-
ing the combinatorial complexity of enumerating possible blocks. Murray and Weintraub
(2002) provide empirical evidence of error introduced as a result. The second aspect of spa-
tial representation uncertainty is due to simpliﬁcation. Miller (1996), Drezner and Drezner
(1997), and Church (1999) detail that spatial simpliﬁcation of demand/facility objects is
fairly common, typically involving the conversion of an area to a single representative
point. Evidence of error in such simpliﬁcation along these lines is detailed in Murray and
O’Kelly (2002).

Locational uncertainty noted in Table 1 is another important area of work in spatial
optimization modeling, encompassing inaccuracy in given demand locations and sited
facility locations. Demand location inaccuracy could be caused by systematic or random
errors in data. Hodgson (1991) and Aerts et al. (2003) simulate demands with such kind
of errors to examine its impacts on solutions. While Hodgson (1991) ﬁnds little sensi-
tivity in model results given input data errors, Aerts et al. (2003) demonstrate substantial
impacts of locational errors in practice. Demand locations could also be stochastic for some
planning situations, either uncertain in location or changing over time (see Cooper 1974,
Mirchandani and Odoni 1979, Weaver and Church 1983, AltInel et al. 2009, Bonneu and
Thomas-Agnan 2009). Another form of locational uncertainty, solution variation, is that
identiﬁed sites are not available due to land-use and accessibility issues. Goodchild (1984)
and Murray (2003) evaluate optimality loss by simulating possible locational offsets for
sited facilities.

A ﬁnal aspect of spatial uncertainty identiﬁed in Table 1 is associated with prox-
imity interpretation. Distances between facilities/demands are commonly employed to

measure proximity in spatial optimization. Many distance measures are possible, such as
Euclidean, rectilinear, and network. Uncertainty associated with possible distance mea-
sures could have signiﬁcant impacts on modeling results. For example, Bach (1981) and
AltInel et al. (2009) imply that model solutions and computational effort can be quite dis-
similar when using different distance measures. Other related studies include Andersson
et al. (1998) and Plastria (2001). The impacts of distance measurement errors are dis-
cussed in Hodgson (1991) and Brimberg and Love (1995). Mirchandani and Oudjit (1980)
and Berman and Odoni (1982) consider stochastic distances, simulating several scenarios
to represent expected distances.

Since data uncertainty could have a substantial impact on spatial optimization model
results, as suggested above, there is always a need to evaluate potential impacts. Previous
work in this area has approached the assessment of uncertainty through simulation-based
approaches, requiring repeated solution of many modiﬁed problems where data inputs have
been systematically altered in some manner. What is lacking is the capacity to qualify or
statistically infer something about the impacts of data uncertainty in deﬁnitive terms.

3. Uncertainty implications

The intent of this article is to demonstrate how spatial uncertainty can be addressed in an
integrated and explicit fashion. A particular kind of spatial optimization model, a disper-
sion model called the anti-covering location problem, is used here given its widespread
application. It has been applied to a broad range of urban and environmental contexts,
including forest planning (Barahona et al. 1992, Hochbaum and Pathria 1997, Murray
1999, Goycoolea et al. 2005), market saturation (Zeller et al. 1980), examination of habi-
tat carrying capacity (Downs et al. 2008), and undesirable service provision (Grubesic and
Murray 2008). However, the implications of spatial uncertainty for this dispersion model
are not understood.

The anti-covering location problem (ACLP), also referred to as node packing, ver-
tex packing, maximal independent set, and stable set problems, aims to determine the
maximum number of service locations that can be sited while maintaining a minimum
separation between locations. It has been formulated as integer program (see Padberg
1973, Nemhauser and Trotter 1975, Moon and Chaudhry 1984, Nemhauser and Sigismondi
1992, Murray and Church 1997, Murray and Kim 2008), with much attention on efﬁcient
solution. Consider the following notation:

i = index of areas

(cid:2) = separation distance

(cid:3)i = set of areas whose distances to area i are within (cid:2)

(cid:2)

xi =

1,
0,

if area i is selected,
otherwise.

The variables, xi, therefore represent the decisions associated with whether a service
facility is sited at location i. All areas that are within the speciﬁed distance (cid:2) from i,
denoted by the set (cid:3)i, cannot simultaneously site a service facility if area i is already
selected. With this notation, the formulation follows:

The objective of ACLP, Equation (1), is to maximize the number of selected areas to locate
facilities/services. That is, the goal is to site as many as possible in order to provide the
greatest level of service possible (or the most accessible). Constraints (2) are spatial prox-
imity constraints ensuring that no two pairs of conﬂicting areas could both site facilities.
Constraints (3) impose binary integer restrictions on decision variables.

The ACLP, or equivalently the node packing problem, is a deterministic optimization
model that assumes the input data to be precise and accurate. In this case, the locations i
and the distance between them are assumed to be known precisely. However, there actually
exist various sources of uncertainty associated with any spatial data relied upon, and most
certainly this should be understood and likely accounted for when used to support any
substantive planning and analysis. For example, potential facility locations are typically
inaccurate in some way. The reason is that data/map layers are usually produced from ﬁeld
survey, remote sensing imagery, or paper-map reproduction, each of which involves sys-
tematic and random errors. Imprecision also occurs in any transformation process where
raw data are somehow converted to a desirable data format, like digitization and geo-
referencing. The metadata information for potential sites, such as commonly used parcels,
has a speciﬁc spatial accuracy associated with it. For example, parcel data in Ramsey, MN,
have a horizontal accuracy of 7–30 feet (RCSO 2005), while the accuracy of parcel data in
Santa Barbara, CA, is 3.28–328 feet (SBSD 2011). Parcel level data are generally one of
the most spatially accurate data sources, but even so a boundary of a parcel might be a few
hundred feet or more off.

If such data are utilized in an optimization model, such as the ACLP, there is potential
for error or bias in any analysis. In this case, a boundary being within 300 feet of the
reported location would likely alter what is potentially conﬂicting. Murray and Grubesic
(2011) discuss other sources of error and uncertainty, but sufﬁce it to say that there is some
error, either due to the data or other spatial considerations. Such error may be deﬁned as a
composite level of spatial uncertainty, ε, as follows:

ε = f (εb, εd, εp)

(4)

where,

εb = uncertainty associated with boundry delineation
εd = uncertainty associated with distance measurement
εp = uncertainty associated with proximity interpretation

Murray and Grubesic (2011) conclude that spatial location, distance measurement, and
proximity evaluation are most critical for the ACLP, but certainly other forms of error
could be considered as well in Equation (4). The challenge therefore is generating a valid

inference based on the co-mingling of uncertainty. An approach for doing this is now
detailed.

4. Accounting for error/uncertainty
A spatial optimization model is now derived to explicitly address locational error/
uncertainty characterized by ε. This is in contrast to the generation of multiple input/output
scenarios using simulated errors, an approach commonly relied upon in the literature. The
developed model enables the possible impacts of uncertainty to be thoroughly evaluated,
including worst-case to best-case scenarios. Given composite error in Equation (4), the
strict proximity restrictions in the ACLP become somewhat ambiguous. Speciﬁcally, some
adjacency constraints may or may not become necessary, depending on the actual spatial
proximity between two units i and j. For instance, if the pre-speciﬁed separation distance is
1320 feet and the estimated error resulting from spatial uncertainty is 50 feet under some
conﬁdence level, the dispersion conditions, constraints (2), might need to impose a restric-
tion when they are measured to be as close as 1270 feet (1320 – 50 = 1270) or as far
away as 1370 feet (1320 + 50 = 1370). Alternatively, if the units are actually outside of
the separation standard, then they should not be enforced as there is no problem if both are
selected. Unfortunately, all proximity constraints in the ACLP are required to be imposed.
In order to address spatial error/uncertainty, consider the following additional notation:

pij = penalty cost of relaxing the proximity restriction between i and j

(cid:2)

yij =

1,
0,

if the proximity restriction between i and j is relaxed,
otherwise.

(cid:6)i = set of areas whose distances to i are within ((cid:2) − ε)

ψi = set of areas whose distances to i are between ((cid:2) − ε) and ((cid:2) + ε)

The idea here is to track proximity restrictions based on what is certain and what is uncer-
tain. Those restrictions that are uncertain will be accounted for in the model using decision
variables yij. In this sense, the intent is to possibly relax uncertain restrictions, possibly
impose uncertain restrictions, or possibly impose some but relax others. To accomplish
this, a penalty cost, pij, is introduced, reﬂecting a risk of potential violation of a dispersion
requirement. This allows for differentiation between different types of restrictions based on
ancillary criteria. As an example, when two units are considered further away, the penalty
might be less than if they were closer to each other. Given the potential errors involved in
ACLP, (cid:6)i represents a conservative conﬂict set that is certain based on the characterization
of error. Restrictions between unit i and members of this set should always be imposed.
Alternatively, the uncertain conﬂicts are represented by the set (cid:7)i. It may or may not be
necessary to impose restrictions between unit i and members of this set, depending on
actual proximity. These two sets, therefore, account for the error scope ((cid:2) ± ε). Figure 1
depicts the two sets surrounding a residential parcel i.

Structuring a new model that incorporates certainty and uncertainty will make use of

the two sets, (cid:6)i and (cid:7)i.

This new model is structured with multiple objectives. The ﬁrst objective, (5), is to maxi-
mize the number of selected areas, exactly as structured in the ACLP. The second objective,
(6), is to minimize the total penalty costs of relaxing separation constraints that are spatially

uncertain. Constraints (7) ensure that no two selected sites conﬂict among the certain
restrictions. Constraints (8) track separation of those that might be in conﬂict. These are
the constraints that could be okay to relax or ignore, depending on error. When yij equals
1, both xi and xj could be 1 in constraint (8), indicating both areas could be selected;
otherwise, the proximity constraint is imposed, and at most one of them can be selected.
Constraints (9) impose binary integer restrictions on decision variables.

The error-ACLP (E-ACLP) is a multi-objective extension of the ACLP. Further, it is
related to the work of Hochbaum and Pathria (1997) who proposed the generalized inde-
pendent set problem, where all proximity constraints can be violated with some penalty
cost. Thus, if the set (cid:6)i is empty and (cid:7)i is not empty, then the E-ACLP would be equiva-
lent to the generalized independent set problem. Thus, the E-ACLP can be considered as an
extension or generalization of the generalized independent set problem in that it imposes
restrictions between conﬂicts that are certain, but allows those that are uncertain to possibly
be relaxed, similar to the spirit of the generalized independent set problem.

Solution of the E-ACLP is challenging given the multiple objectives and binary integer
variables. Depending on the signiﬁcance of uncertainty and the penalty costs, there will no
doubt be trade-offs between the two objectives. The model can be solved to identify trade-
off solutions using multi-objective techniques, such as the weighting or constraint methods
(see Cohen 1978).

5. Application
The ACLP and the E-ACLP detailed above are applied in the context of evaluating the
implications of offender residency restriction laws. In order to mitigate risk exposure to
communities by convicted sex offenders that reintegrate into society, local governments
have considered/proposed regulations that limit where convicted sex offenders can live
relative to other offenders. Grubesic and Murray (2008) detailed how the ACLP could be
used to assess this issue, providing insights regarding the maximum number of offenders
that could reside in a region under such conditions as well as the geographic implications
of this residence restriction law. The study area is a community in the Phoenix metropolitan
area containing 1583 parcels of which 1295 are residential parcels. The separation distance
(cid:2) has been established as 1320 feet, identical to proposed legislation detailed in Grubesic
and Murray (2008). Based on parcel data accuracy and other sources of spatial uncertainty,
as well as imputed quality, ε is estimated to be ±100 feet.

The spatial optimization models are structured using Python, an open source object-
oriented programming language, and subsequently solved using a commercial optimization
package, Gurobi. Computational processing was carried out on a MS Windows-based, Intel
Xeon (2.53 GHz) computer with 6 GB of RAM.

Application of the ACLP indicates that the maximum number of offenders that could
reside in this community would be 16 in order to ensure a dispersion distance 1320 feet
between each pair of offenders. This possible spatial conﬁguration is shown in Figure 2.
The analysis using the ACLP, as noted previously, assumes that the data are free of error
or uncertainty. The issue then is what are the implications of data error/uncertainty in this
case, both at a regional level in terms of total number of offenders as well as more locally
in terms of spatial patterns of residency.

To assess the impacts of data error/uncertainty, the E-ACLP is applied. For the sake of
simplicity, the penalty costs are assumed to all equal 1. Alternative approaches for estab-
lishing penalty costs are discussed later in the article. The constraint method is used here
to identify all trade-off solutions associated with these two objectives.

column in Table 2 effectively corresponds to the number of restriction constraints relaxed
since all the penalty costs are equal. This is objective (6) in the E-ACLP. Table 2 high-
lights that accounting for error in the model means that as few as 15 residences could be
established, but up to 19 are possible. This is in contrast to the 16 identiﬁed using the
ACLP, assuming certainty in spatial location. Table 2 shows that increasing the number
of residences means that the penalty cost would increase, or rather separation constraints
would need to be relaxed. This trade-off is depicted in Figure 3, showing the Pareto optimal
curve and the associated non-dominated solutions attained by changing the relative impor-
tance of objective (5) with respect to objective (6). For the 15 residences in Figure 3, all
uncertain restrictions are actually imposed, explaining the zero penalty cost in Table 2
for this solution. On the other extreme, it is possible that 19 residences could be estab-
lished, and doing so would mean that 22 uncertain restrictions would not be imposed. The
other solutions in Figure 3 (and Table 2) therefore reﬂect a trade-off ranging between these
extremes of 15–19 for number of residences and 0–22 for penalty cost.

Beyond the implications for total number of residences possible, each possible solution
reﬂects a different spatial pattern that could result. In the case of 15, this corresponds to the
situation that the most expansive separation distance (cid:2) + ε (1320 + 100 feet) is effectively
imposed. The resulting spatial conﬁguration is shown in Figure 4. All of the other solutions
reﬂect a relaxation of this strict interpretation of error. Thus, Figure 5 corresponding to 16,
Figure 6 corresponding to 17, Figure 7 corresponding to 18, and Figure 8 corresponding to
19, each move more towards the other end of separation, (cid:2) – ε(1320 – 100 feet).

It is most evident that the E-ACLP provides the capacity to identify a range of implica-
tions for spatial uncertainty in the geographic position of land units. However, the speciﬁc
comparative nuances are particularly interesting. The contrast between the ACLP and

E-ACLP is very evident when examining Figure 2 (ACLP) and Figure 5 (E-ACLP), where
16 residences are identiﬁed by each approach. What can be observed is a change in the
spatial distributions of identiﬁed residences. The reason for this is that the separations
between selected residences in Figure 2 are mostly less than 1420 feet. When error is taken
into account, this changes things, which means that proximity restrictions must be relaxed
in the E-ACLP if 16 residences are to be selected.

6. Discussion

Addressing uncertainty in spatial data no doubt complicates any analysis endeavor. Further
discussion on a number of points is provided here associated with analysis complexity,
model solution, and alternative approaches.

The application results presented in the previous section illustrate that the ACLP is
in fact sensitive to spatial data uncertainty. If the potential errors in spatial data are
ignored, the analysis and any conclusions are incomplete. The E-ACLP was introduced
to illuminate how spatial uncertainty would affect analysis ﬁndings. In this case, it is
possible that 15–19 offenders could reside in the region, and in each case there would
be a different associated level of neighborhood danger or risk as a result. Thus, there is
considerable complexity in the analysis of associated impacts of uncertainty. Addressing
spatial error/uncertainty using the E-ACLP has necessitated the use of multiple objectives.
Multi-objective models mean that there are trade-offs reﬂecting the complexities of plan-
ning situation and requiring subjective interpretation of the results. The application results
suggest a range of possible impacts associated with data error/uncertainty on the modeling

results; moreover, the trade-off curve provides a statistical conﬁdence that can be related to
data uncertainty. This rationale may also be applied to other spatial optimization models.

A ﬁnal point in need of discussion is model solution. Because the uncertainty asso-
ciated with spatial data impacts dispersion requirements, the E-ACLP allows for the
relaxation of uncertain proximity constraints with some penalty cost. At a basic level, this
means that a difﬁcult problem, the ACLP or node packing problem, has been extended
through the use of an additional objective and new binary integer variables. This point is
particularly important when one considers that the ACLP/node packing problem is itself
a challenging optimization problem to solve, and subject to considerable research on bet-
ter solution approaches. In particular, Murray and Church (1997), Goycoolea et al. (2005),
and Murray and Kim (2008), among others, have focused on methods for identifying better
facets or alternative formulations of the problem. Given that the application reported in this

article considered 1295 potential residential locations and required less than 2 seconds to
solve the ACLP, it is not terribly surprising to see in Table 2 that the E-ACLP was con-
siderably more difﬁcult to solve, requiring 19,287 seconds in the worst case. As problem
size grows, it is unlikely that the E-ACLP would be optimally solved using commercial
software. Therefore, it is clear that future research is needed for developing alternative
approaches, both heuristic and exact, to solve the E-ACLP.

7. Conclusions
In this article, we have highlighted the error and uncertainty common in virtually all
spatial information. The implications of error/uncertainty in spatial data are that any

methods making use of the data must understand their effects. Spatial optimization work
has approached geographic uncertainty through the use of simulated error propagation, but
such an approach is computationally intensive and fails to provide capabilities for establish-
ing statistical signiﬁcance in derived ﬁndings. To address this deﬁciency, we have proposed
a new integrated approach to explicitly account for data uncertainty in a spatial optimiza-
tion model. This entailed the formulation and solution of a new multi-objective model. The
application results illustrated the effectiveness of this approach, providing the capacity to
establish bounds on spatial uncertainty. It is hoped that more research will follow along
these lines as addressing uncertainly will no doubt mean that more complex and difﬁcult
models will arise.

The conventional integration mechanism in GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) aided inertial
integrated positioning and navigation system is mainly based on the continuous outputs of the navigation
mechanization, the associated error models for navigation parameters, the biases of the inertial measurement
units  (IMU),  and  the  error  measurements.  Its  strong  dependence  on  the 
error  characteristics  of 
inertial  sensors  may  suffer  with  the  low-cost  IMUs,  e.g.  the  MEMS  IMUs  due  to  their  low  and  unstable 
performance.  This  paper  strives  for  a  significant  breakthrough  in  a  compact  and  general  integration 
strategy which restructures the Kalman filter by deploying a system model on the basis of 3D kinematics 
of a rigid body and performing measurement update via all sensor data inclusive of the IMU measurements.
This  novel  IMU/GNSS  Kalman  filter  directly  estimates  navigational  parameters  instead  of  the  error 
states.  It  enables  the  direct  use  of  the  IMU’s  raw  outputs  as  measurements  in  measurement  updates  of
Kalman  filter  instead  of  involving  the  free  inertial  navigation  calculation  through  the  conventional 
integration mechanism. This realization makes all of the sensors in a system no longer to be differentiated
between core and aiding sensors. The proposed integration strategy can greatly enhance the sustainability
of  low-cost  navigation  systems  in  poor  GNSS  and/or  GNSS  denied  environment  compared  to  the 
conventional  aided  error-state-based  inertial  navigation  integration  mechanism.  The  post-processed 
solutions are presented to show the success of the proposed multisensor integrated navigation strategy.

Le  mécanisme  d’intégration  conventionnel  du  système  de  positionnement  et  de  navigation  inertiel 
intégré assisté par GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) se base principalement sur la transmission
continue des extrants de la mécanisation de navigation, des modèles d’erreurs associés pour les paramètres
de  navigation,  des  biais  des  unités  de  mesure  inertielle  (UMI)  et  des  mesures  d’erreurs.  Son  importante
dépendance  aux  caractéristiques  d’erreur 
des  capteurs  inertiels  est  affectée  par  les  UMI 
peu coûteuses, p. ex., les UMI MEMS, en raison de leur performance faible et instable. Cet article est sur
la  piste  d’une  avancée  majeure  dans  le  cadre  d’une  stratégie  d’intégration  compacte  et  générale  qui
restructure le filtre Kalman en déployant un modèle systémique basé sur la cinématique tridimensionnelle
d’un corps rigide et en effectuant des mises à jour des mesures à l’aide de toutes les données comprises 
dans  les  mesures  de  l’UMI.  Ce  nouveau  filtre  Kalman  UMI/GNSS  estime  directement  les  paramètres 
de navigation plutôt que les états des erreurs. Il permet d’utiliser directement les données brutes fournies
par l’UMI en tant que mesures pour mettre à jour le filtre Kalman au lieu d’utiliser le calcul de navigation
inertiel  libre  dans  le  mécanisme  d’intégration  conventionnel.  Cette  manière  de  faire  assure  que  tous 
les  capteurs  d’un  système  ne  peuvent  plus  être  distingués  en  tant  que  capteurs  principal  ou  secondaire. 
La stratégie d’intégration proposée peut grandement augmenter la durabilité des systèmes de navigation
peu  coûteux  dans  les  environnements  GNSS  où  il  y  a  peu  de  satellites  ou  ceux  dépourvus  de  GNSS, 
comparativement  au  mécanisme  conventionnel  d’intégration  de  navigation  inertielle  basé  sur  les  états 
d’erreurs.  Les  solutions  post-traitées  sont  présentées  pour  démontrer  le  succès  de  la  stratégie  proposée 
de navigation intégrée à multiples capteurs.

1. Introduction

One of the core parts of an inertial navigation
system (INS) is the fusion of the data from Inertial
Measurement  Unit  (IMU)  and  the  heterogeneous
aiding  sensors  such  as  GPS  receivers  etc.  The 

conventional  integration  mechanism  consists  of

However,  in  all  above  mentioned  work,  the
core error-state-based system equations still remain
the  same  as  in  the  conventional  strategy  built 
Titter-
upon the inertial navigation mechanization [
ton

2001]. From the authors’ point of
view,  the  conventional  integration  strategy  driven
by  the  a 
error  model  of  inertial  sensor 
could become problematic in the case of low-cost
MEMS  IMUs  as  their  time-variant  noise  model
could  be  highly  sensitive  to  the  temperature 
El-Diasty
2009]  and  the  dynamic  excitations 
[
De  Pasquale
[
2010].  The  free  inertial  navigation
solution  from  low-cost  IMUs  between  two  aiding
measurement  updates  can  easily  suffers  from  the
intolerable drift of IMU systematic errors occurring
during  outages  of  aiding  measurements,  such  as
GNSS  outages  in  poor  GNSS  and/or  GNSS 
denied  environment.  In  view  of  the  increasing 
popularity  of  the  low-cost  MEMS  IMU  sensors 
and 
the  exponentially  growing  computation 
power,  a  significant  changeover  in  the  integration
strategy  for  low-cost  IMU-based  multisensor 
integrated  navigation  systems  is  undoubtedly
demanded considering one may not be able to reach
an  innovative  and  cost-effective  breakthrough  if
Wagner  and
one  remains  in  the  traditional  rut  [
Wieneke

2003].

Since the 1990s, unremitting efforts have also 
been made  for  innovative  multisensor  integration 
strategy. A pioneering compact integration mecha-
nism  was  proposed  and  showed  pleasing  solution

quality  by  directly  estimating  the  optimal  naviga-
tion parameters instead of the error states, in which
the  inertial  navigation  mechanization  was  assimi-
lated  into  the  equivalent  system  equations  in  the 
extended  Kalman  filter  [
1997;
Wagner and Wieneke
[1997] employed
2003]. 
a  2D  kinematic  model  as  the  system  model  for
kinematic  positioning  and  integrated  navigation 
in  the  Kalman  filter.  A  preliminary  version  of  a 
3D  kinematic  model  was  further  developed  for 
the same purpose of integrating of GPS, IMU and
odometer  sensors  towards  a  different  integration
strategy other than the conventional one discussed
in 
[2000], whose most striking
features were the use of the navigation parameters
and  measurements  in  Kalman  filter  instead  of 
error states and error measurements. More relevant
studies  about  applications  of  kinematic  model  as
system model in Kalman filter can be found in the
Sternberg
following  resources:  [

. 2014 etc.].

Along  the  same  path,  the  research  presented 
in  this  paper  intends  to  comprehensively  propose 
a novel IMU/GNSS integrated navigation Kalman
filter  (IMU/GNSS  KF)  which  applies  the  kine-
matics  of  a  rigid  body  as  the  system  model,  in 
order  that  the  rigorous  trajectories  and  smooth 
rotation  dynamics  can  naturally  be  regulated  over
the  IMU  data  interval  or  a  specific  limited  time
interval. In addition, this novel integration strategy
utilizes  IMU  measurements  together  with  the 
other aiding measurements as direct measurements.
In  this  way,  the  strong  dependence  of  the  inertial
navigation  mechanization  on  the  IMU  outputs  in
the  conventional  integration  strategy  is  released.
Additionally,  it  allows  the  estimation  of  naviga-
tion states via sensor measurements instead of the 
error  states  via  error  measurements.  Essentially, 
the  influences  of  the  time-variant  errors  of  an 
inertial sensor on navigation solution are mitigated
through  the  utilization  of  the  realistic  trajectory
model. 

In  the  following,  Section  2  will  discuss  the
introduction  will  be  followed  by  the  derivation 
of  the  3D  trajectory  model  for  a  rigid  body  in 
section  2.  And  then,  the  construction  of  the 
novel  IMU / GNSS  Kalman  filter  is  described  in 
Section  3.  In  order  to  validate  the  proposed 
integration strategy, Section 4 shows the solutions
of  the  IMU/  GNSS  Kalman  filter  with  one  road 
test.  Conclusions  and  remarks  in  Section  5  end 
the manuscript.

2.3 Angular Rate Model

b
and wnby

Under  the  normal  driving  condition  with  a
smooth  steering  within  a  short  time  interval,  the
b
three components of the angular rate vector wnb
for
a land vehicle can be treated as three independent
b
random processes, of which wnbx
are two
b
zero-mean  processes  and  wnbz
is  a  non-zero  mean
random process with random disturbance. In gener-
al, the first order Markov model is used to model
the  zero-mean  random  variable  through  exploring
the  time  correlation  between  consecutive  random
variables  in  a  time  series.  Thus,  the  zero-mean
Singer
Singer motion model [
1970] is used to express
the  dynamic  variation  of  two  quasi-zero  angular
b
rate  components,  wnbx
,  in  the  system
model of the proposed IMU/GNSS KF. Meanwhile,
the “current” model as the modified Singer model
Li  and  Jilkov
Zhou  et  al.
[
2000]  is  adapted

Without loss of the generality, three orthogonal
gyroscopes  in  an  IMU  unit  measure  the  angular 
b
rate vector wib
while three accelerometers measure 
the  specific  force 
.  An  important  assumption
about inertial sensors is that their measurements are
mainly  disturbed  by  the  following  error  sources:
constant start-off bias, drifting bias residuals, linear
scale  factors,  misalignment  of  sensor  axes  and
Gaussian white noises. The IMU measurements in
the being constructed IMU/GNSS KF are modeled

The post-processed GNSS solutions (position,
velocity  and  DGPS  heading  solution)  have  been
taken as the aiding measurements and integrated in
the loosely-coupled manner because our focus here

3.5 The Extended Kalman Filter

Based  on  the  mathematical  description  from
Section  3.1  to  Section  3.4,  the  novel  IMU/GNSS
KF is realized by applying the extended KF (EKF)
algorithm. First, the equations (3.1) ~ (3.9) and the
measurement equations (3.10) ~ (3.16) are respec-
tively  generalized  by  the  nonlinear  system  and
measurement model

vector,

the measurement vector including all of the

section (3.4),

the measurement noise vector, and

As  widely  known,  the  EKF  performs  the 
prediction  of  the  state  and  measurement  vectors
directly  through  (3.17)  and  (3.18)  whilst  their 
variance  propagation  are  proceeded  by  using  the
associated  coefficient  matrices  after  the  lineariza-
tion. Specifically, the time update predicts the state

3.6 Further Insights of the System
Model

Figure 1 shows three fundamental distinctions
between  the  proposed  integration  scheme  (right
side) and the conventional counterpart (left side): 

i)

ii)

the  embedment  of  the  prediction  of  the 
kinematic  states,  i.e.,  the  velocity,  accel-
eration,  attitude  and  angular  rate  vector 
into Kalman filter as the system model, 
the introduction of the IMU measurements 
in measurement update process and 
iii) the navigation parameters directly used in 
the state vector. Particularly, this integra-
tion strategy allows for equal treatment of 
all  the  sensors  no  matter  which  sensor  is 
used as an aiding sensor.

In  principle,  Kalman  filter  is  equivalent  to  a
sequential  least  square  with  a  time-variant  state

vector  and  the  process  noises  [
1979, 
2006]. In other words, the system
model consists of a group of virtual measurements
for  the  state  vector  and  reveals  the  connections
between  the  state  vectors  from  epoch  to  epoch. 
Due  to  these  extra  virtual  measurements  that  the
measurement  redundancies  in  the  proposed  IMU/

GNSS  KF  for  wnb
are  obviously  better 
than that in the traditional error state-based Kalman 
filter,  wherein  in  which  the  acceleration  and 
angular  rate  vectors  are  only  treated  as  input 
(driving  force)  of  the  mechanization.  Therefore, 
the accuracy of the body frame angular rate vector

in the IMU/GNSS
KF  will  be  surely  improved  because  they  are  not
only predicted but also measured.

It  can  also  be  seen  that  the  dynamics  con-

[2001]  are 
equivalent to the equation (2.4) with the zero noise

the  system  equations  (3.1)–(3.9)  actually  play  the
role  of  the  dynamic  constraints  for  the  navigation
parameters.

Furthermore, the a 

error model defined
for  a  static  low-cost  MEMS  inertial  sensor  needs 
to be checked and/or compensated in the dynamic
working  environment  as  the  vibration  on  a  low 
cost MEMS IMU might cause significant changes
in  its  scale  factors  and  noise  level  compared  to
those in the static case [
2010]. In the 
IMU/GNSS KF, the system model (prediction) for  
b
wnb
does  provide  a  rigorous  reference for
checking on the IMU performance without compli-
cating the filtering structure.

In summary, the most significant feature of the
proposed  multisensory  integration  strategy  lies  in
the  improvement  of  the  overall  measurement
redundancy of a system through the system model
based  on  the  kinematic  model  of  a  rigid  body. 
In  addition,  the  influences  of  the  IMU  measure-
ment  noises  on  the  final  navigation  solutions  are 
effectively  mitigated  as  the  result  of  the  partici-
pation  of  the  IMU  outputs  in  Kalman  Filter’s 
measurement update. 

3.7 Remarks for the Implemented
IMU/GNSS KF

(

At  the  beginning  of  the  IMU/GNSS  KF,  the
pitch  and  roll  angles  are  initialized  through  one
static alignment for 
>5) minute, during which
the  velocity,  acceleration  and  angular  rate  vectors
are all true zeroes. For each pair of IMU measure-
ments (angular rates and specific forces), the pitch
and  roll  angles  are  solved  by  using  the  following
DCM matrix [

2001].

The  mean  values  of  the  pitch  and  roll  angles
from the static alignment will be used as the initial
estimation for pitch and roll angles. In addition, the
position and heading states could be initialized via
the GPS position and heading solution based on the
double differenced carrier phase measurements. 

In consideration of the measurement noise on
the  IMU  raw  outputs,  the  random  constant  model
for  IMU  bias  components  in  gyroscopes  and
accelerometers was taken. At last, the computation
cost  for  the  IMU/GNSS  KF  is  noticeably  higher
than  the  conventional  integration  strategy  due  to
the high rate measurement updates caused by IMU
observables. However, the prolonged computation
time  can  be  greatly  shortened  by  more  powerful
CPU  unit.  On  the  other  hand,  the  usage  of  the 
pre-filter [
1975] on any sensor with
high  data  rate,  e.g.  the  IMU’s  raw  measurements,
shall be able to effectively reduce the computation
cost without significant loss of performance. They
will  not  be  involved  here  due  to  the  scope  of  this
paper.

4. Examples

4.1 Overview of the Land-based
Road Tests

The  proposed  IMU/GNSS  KF  was  applied  to 
process  the  data  collected  by  the  land  vehicle 
navigation  system  developed  at  the  Earth  Obser-
Qian  et  al.
vation  Laboratory  of York  University  [
2012], which consists of one Crossbow IMU440CA
(MEMS) IMU unit and two NovAtel OEM3/4 GPS
receivers rigidly mounted on the vehicle roof. One
of  the  road  tests  is  presented  here.  The  lever  arm
parameters of the GPS receivers with respect to the
IMU unit were measured beforehand at the accuracy
of  0.5  cm.  The  raw  IMU  data  were  collected  at 
100 Hz and the measurements from two GPS rovers
were acquired at 4 Hz. One GPS base station near
the  start  point  was  set  up  with  the  1 Hz  data  rate
throughout  the  whole  road  test.  Given  that  the 
number  of  GPS  satellites  in  the  view  was  greater
than or equal to 6, the high accuracy relative GPS
positioning  solution  and  DGPS  heading  solution
between two GPS rovers based on the fixed ambi-
guities  on  L1  phase  observables  were  achieved.
The  overall  1s accuracies  of  the  position  solution
and DGPS heading were approximately ±2 ~ 4 cm
and  ± 0.5
respectively.  In  the  loosely-coupled

manner, the post-processed GPS solutions (position,

tion  was  not  available,  the  single  point  GPS 
position was then used as the replacements.

4.2 The Navigation Solution

This  subsection  presents  the  integrated  navi-
gation  solution  from  the  proposed  IMU/GNSS 
navigation  KF.  At  the  beginning  of  the  data 
processing,  the  static  alignment  module  using 
the  equation  (3.24)  described  in  Section  3.7  was
executed  until  the  GPS  position  and  the  DGPS
heading solution became ready for the initialization
of  the  state  vector  and  its  covariance  matrix  in
Kalman filter. The IMU/GNSS KF was carried on
afterwards with the update rate of 100 Hz for IMU
measurements and 4 Hz for GPS measurements. 

As shown in Figure 3, the overall 1s positional
accuracies  in  east,  north  and  up  directions  were
approximately  ± 0.04  m,  ± 0.04  m  and  ± 0.05  m, 
correspondingly.  Two  significant  spikes  were  due
to  the  low  quality  of  the  GPS  position  measure-
ments (single point positioning solutions for those
specific  time  periods). The  cm-level  system  inno-
vations  and  measurement  residuals  presented  in
Figure 4 for the GPS position measurements verify
the correctness of our computed position accuracy. 
Similarly,  the  velocity  solution  accuracy  and
associated GPS velocity innovations and residuals
are presented in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The overall
1s accuracies for velocity state vector in east, north
and  up  directions  were  approximately  ± 0.04  m,
± 0.05 m and ± 0.07 m, correspondingly.

Furthermore,  the  estimated  bias  state  vector
and  its  ± 3s bound  in  IMU/GNSS  KF  are  shown 
in  Figure  9  and  Figure  10.  The  accuracies  of
accelerometer bias drifts in both right and forward
directions  are  noticeably  improved  while  the 
vehicle is turning, since the observabilities of bias
drifts during the turning period are enhanced.

4.3 Comparisons Between the IMU
Raw Outputs and Their Filtered
Counterparts

As  discussed  in  Section  3,  it  is  expected  that
the use of rigorous trajectory model as the system
model of the novel IMU/GNSS KF shall improve
the  accuracy  of  the  navigation  solutions.  As  the
components in the state vector, the angular rate and
acceleration vectors in body frame will also profit
from  the  novel  KF  time  updates  for  the  same 
reason.  For  better  visual  effects,  the  comparisons
between the raw IMU outputs and filtered signals
are presented in Figure 11 and 12. 

It can be observed in Figure 11 that the overall
variation of the filtered angular rates were slightly
lower than that of the IMU raw outputs. However,
the  overall  fluctuation  of  the  raw  IMU  accelero-
meter  outputs  (specific  forces)  was  significantly
larger than that of the filtered acceleration in Figure
12.  This  improvement  lies  on  the  introduction  of
the  new  system  model  as  part  of  the  proposed
IMU/GNSS KF.

4.4 Free Inertial Solutions During
GNSS Outage

the  proposed 

In  order  to  assess  the  performance  of  the 
free-inertial  positioning  and  navigation  solutions
after 
IMU/GNSS  KF,  eight 
20-second  GNSS  outages  were  simulated  based 
on  segments  of  the  reference  dataset  shown  in 
Figure  2. At  the  commencement  of  the  simulated
GNSS  outage,  the  navigation  parameters  for 
both  free-inertial  solutions  were  initialized  to  the
same  reference  inertial  integrated  navigation 
solutions.  During  the  simulated  outage  periods,
only the IMU raw outputs were used as the avail-
able measurements.

For  the  purpose  of  comparison,  the  free 
inertial  position  solutions  from  the  novel  KF  and
the  conventional  inertial  mechanization  were 
presented  together  in  Figure  13.  In  addition,  the
largest  position  drifts  for  both  methods  during 
all  eight  outages  in  east,  north  and  up  directions, 
are  listed  in  Table  2.  The  bottom  line  in  Table  2
shows  that  the  root  mean  square  (RMS)  of  the 
8  position  drifts  for  conventional  dead  reckoning
(DR)  and  IMU/GNSS  KF  are  [18.32  m  17.76  m
2.61 m] and [2.15 m  3.12 m  0.52 m] respectively.
Undoubtedly,  the  position  drifts  from  the  IMU/
GNSS  KF  were  much  slower  than  the  ones  from
the  free  inertial  navigation  solution  based  on  the
conventional mechanization.

References

This paper proposed a novel integration strategy
for  multisensor  integrated  kinematic  positioning
and navigation systems, in which the 3D kinematic
trajectory model has been deployed as the system
model  in  the  restructured  Kalman  filter.  This 
novel  Kalman  filter,  identified  as  the  IMU/GNSS
integrated  navigation  Kalman  Filter  (IMU/GNSS
KF), enables equal utilization of the measurements
from all of the sensors, inclusive of the IMU data,
through  Kalman  Filter  measurement  update.  One 
of the test datasets collected by our in-house land
vehicle system was presented to show the success
of  the  novel  multisensor  integration  strategy.  The
results  showed  that  the  proposed  IMU/GNSS  KF
can improve the accuracy and the robustness of the
navigation  solutions,  especially  with  the  low-cost
IMU  sensors  in  poor  GNSS  and/or  GNSS  denied
environment.  Furthermore,  the  influence  of  the
noise of the IMU raw data on the final navigation
solution  could  be  significantly  reduced  because
IMU raw outputs participate in measurement update
in  the  IMU/GNSS  KF.  Our  next  focus  will  be 
on the tightly-coupled integration of GNSS meas-
urements  so  that  the  advantages  of  the  novel 
integration strategy can further be revealed.

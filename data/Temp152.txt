The paper describes mental maps and their use in teaching process. The survey conducted among students of geodesy and
cartography resulted in 124 sketches. They were analysed from the point of view of cartographic methodology and used methods
of presentation. The different elements and methods were counted and helped in evaluation of teaching process effectiveness,
showing changes in students’ knowledge of certain rules of cartographic language and design and their applications. As the
survey was conducted in relation to courses taught, the results are of great value in increasing the quality of cartographic
content of these courses and teaching methods.

INTRODUCTION

Maps as a medium of communication are almost as early as
human interaction with the environment. Through the ages
they have evolved into a professional representation of space,
with rules, mathematical base, design and graphic code..
Today people still interact with the environment, although
often in different ways. We still build the image of known
space in our minds. Part of this image is now based on pro-
fessional paper maps we use, digital materials in our GPS-
equipped smartphones and so on, but part is purely the
result of experiencing the space by ourselves while walking or
driving. The representation of this space in our imagination
is often called mental or cognitive map. These terms can be
treated as synonyms, but some authors note differences here
(Bláha et al., 2011). They are sometimes supplemented by a
sketch map term, which can be explained as a graphic represen-
tation of a mental map (Huynh and Doherty, 2007, p. 286). In
this paper, the term mental map is used in a general meaning
and the term sketch map is used to describe the illustration
of space stored in the human brain only.

Despite some terminological

inconsistency, mental and
sketch maps are in the research scope of a few professional
groups, with geographers and psychologists being the most
involved. The research is well established with comprehen-
sive works dating back to the sixth decade of the twentieth
century. The classic works of Lynch (1960) and Gould
(1966) defined two main approaches to the examination of
mental maps. The first concentrates on the structure of the
space with its characteristic features (path, edges, districts,
nodes and landmarks) as marked on sketch maps by their

authors. The latter adds an evaluation to the space depicted,
supplementing sketches with qualitative information (good –
bad, safe – unsafe, etc.).

Since then mental maps have become a popular subject and
tool in investigative science. A significant number of tests
utilize them to analyse socio-geographic aspects of the
space, discovering the human interaction with the environ-
ment and the process of learning it through spatial cognition,
organization of information and communicating this knowl-
edge through sketch maps (Gendźwiłł, 2006; Ismael and de
Menezes, 2005; Kulczyńska and Matykowski, 2011; Nishi-
moto, 2012). Such studies focus on modern and geographi-
cally educated societies, but also on indigenous people, often
interacting with the environment to a far more extent than
Western societies and with a better practical understanding
of it, but lacking in a formal contemporary education (Fein-
berg et al., 2003; Mitchell, 2014). Cartographers are often
interested in not only how people see space and how they
visualize their mental maps, but also what the relationship
is of these sketches to the real world in terms of geometric
accuracy. Hence some works use methods similar to those
of the history of cartography to examine the cartometric
qualities of sketch maps (Lloyd and Heivly, 1987; Waterman
and Gordon, 1984). In recent decades, with the development
of Geographic Information Systems and IT, new tools have
been incorporated broadly into the research field of mental
and sketch maps, both in terms of faster, more precise distor-
tion analyses (Peake and Moore, 2004), quantitative and
graphic representation of survey data gathered (Nieścioruk,
2013) and collecting the data, using digital drawing almost

directly into GIS instead of on paper (Huynh and Doherty,
2007). Another interesting aspect of mental maps for pro-
fessional map-makers is how to present the results of a
survey in cartographic form – how to transfer a quantitative,
but an often seriously distorted series of data on a map well
read and correct in terms of geometry (Gendźwiłł, 2009;
Nieścioruk, 2013).

The sketches are a representation of spatial cognition, but
cognition can be achieved in different ways – not always directly,
sometimes indirectly, through maps (that is how most of us
‘visit’ distant places). Analysing sketches based on knowledge
gained from professional maps can be a way to evaluate these
maps in terms of effectiveness, design and communication
quality, although quite rare such works are also conducted
(Bláha and Hudeček, 2010). It is unusual as well to use the
mental map approach in evaluating not spatial cognition and
its representation directly, but the sketch map and its design to
assess the effectiveness of the teaching process. There are
examples of research of this kind at the elementary and second-
ary school level and knowledge of the maps of the selected
countries (Bláha and Pastuhová Nováková, 2013). This work
presents such an approach and tests if sketches drawn by univer-
sity students at different stages of their education can be of any
help in evaluating and improving the teaching programme of
cartography and GIS courses.

The effectiveness of the teaching process by examples of car-
tography skills and principles can be evaluated in different ways.
The described case of using sketches is a unique approach, while
others are more or less widely used. Some works concentrate on
special needs users and the level of professional knowledge of
teachers, which is especially important in the case of schools
and general classes (e.g. geography) instead of narrow scope
professional courses (Almeida, 2009). The pre-test and post-
test (performed before the teaching process and after it) is a
typical approach, but it differs depending on the subject being
tested. The most common school or university method is an
exam, written or oral, testing knowledge with little or few prac-
tical elements. While theoretical background is important, it is
also very important to know how to apply this knowledge
during real-life tasking in a working environment and map-
making is no exception here. The effectiveness of gaining prac-
tical cartographic knowledge is seen as especially vital for those
groups that need fast, precise spatial data presentation, e.g. a
GIS analyst. As they often come from a range of non-carto-
graphic fields (e.g. IT, emergency management, spatial plan-
ning), the fast increase in map-related knowledge can be
observed even during short practical courses just by performing
the same task twice, at the beginning and at the end of course. A
very effective method is evaluating your own or a teacher-pre-
pared map in this way. This map critique method is very effec-
tive as a progress evaluation tool and gives the student a true
impression of their advance of knowledge (Murad-al-shaikh,
2009). The teaching method that concentrates on practice and
evaluation of one’s own work may be opposed to the gaining
of theoretical knowledge before a practical task, mainly due to
the use of well-designed maps and map reading. Research
shows that both approaches are effective and influence each
other, however for groups gaining initial cartographic knowl-
edge, map-drawing pupils made more significant progress
than the map-reading group when comparing pre- and post-
it must be stressed that both
teaching results. Although,

activities involve different skills (Umek, 2003). Map drawing
seems to be especially demanding here in the field of cartogra-
phy as it needs, at least partly, artistic skills, which may have
some influence on this factor (Bell and Iong, 2009). The effec-
tiveness of the course in terms of acquiring knowledge and prac-
tical skills may be evaluated by means of questionnaires used as a
framework to collect impressions, suggestions and problems
encountered by students and teachers during the course (Aki-
nyemi, 2002). This is of course a method used widely in
including university
many fields (not only cartography),
quality teaching control systems.

DESCRIPTION OF THE CASE STUDY
The survey took place during the 2012–2014 period. Partici-
pants were students of geodesy and cartography at the Uni-
versity of Life Sciences in Lublin, Poland. This is a typical
engineering programme and students mainly gather knowl-
edge on different aspects of geodesy. However, the pro-
gramme consists of cartography (‘Kartografia’) and GIS
(‘Systemy Informacji Przestrzennej’) courses, taught by the
author, which contains, among others, the design, visualiza-
tion and composition aspects of maps. Students perform ana-
lyses, prepare visualization of data from databases and create
maps from the ground up, including full 1:50 000 A4 tourist
map of a selected small area. This half-semester task is a good
opportunity to practice not just technical, but also design
skills, resulting in some pretty elegant and efficient maps
(Figure 1), as well as some not so great works. Cartography
is a third-semester course (in fact it was during taking the
survey, now it is a semester longer – spanning the second
and third semesters), while GIS spans the fifth and sixth
semesters. The survey took place at the very beginning of
the third semester, at its end (so before and just after the car-
tography course) and at the end of the sixth semester. The
participants were students of one class; hence, sketch maps
were done in October 2012, February 2013 (start and end
of the third semester) and June 2014 (end of the sixth seme-
ster). According to this, the survey was a pre-test and post-
test as described above. And the author was able to
monitor the general progress during more than half of the
studies (4 of 7 semesters) which accounts for about 70% of
knowledge gained as measured with ECTS points (154
points of 216 in total). The process of learning as well as
(re)creating with the use of knowledge learned involves the
short- and long-term memory. It may be used when, e.g. a
map symbol
is designed. When it resembles a natural
object (man on a bike), the image of this object is retrieved
using other maps seen before and/or real-life experiences
and transformed into a pictorial symbol (schematic man on
a bike for bike hiring point) and when the map author tries
to use a typical, conventional symbol, its image may be
retrieved from memory based on many maps that have
already been seen (a non-pictorial rectangular sign with a
flag for a youth hostel). Both approaches use mental
imagery – an image seen with ‘mind’s eye’ by activating the
long-term memory (Kosslyn, 1995). However, this process
is seen not only as a simple store and reproduce system, but
as a more complex one, involving, e.g. generalization of the
image and its details, which makes it similar to cartography

(Peterson, 1987). The long- and short-term memory are also
involved in the thought process of transforming spatial infor-
mation, that can be seen as an internal human Geographic
Information System with the long-term memory being a per-
manent data warehouse and the short-term memory seen as a
working repository (Peterson, 1987). While this store model
(separate warehouses for long- and short-term memory) is a
classic psychological theory, it is now treated, with (partly)

Getting back to the test group, the other class was
(additionally) surveyed also, but only once – at the end of
their fifth semester (this class was the first ever to study
geodesy and cartography at the University of Life Sciences
as it is quite a new programme). Unfortunately,
it was
impossible to survey them on earlier stages of their education
and their results can be used as additional comparison
material. They were included mainly to confront the most
post-teaching results of two different cartography courses
as the one they attended was very different
from the
present, a strongly modified one that the main group of stu-
dents (included in all the survey waves) attended.

Students were asked to monochromatically draw an area of
the university campus (it consists of objects of three univer-
sities of Lublin: the University of Maria Skłodowska-Curie
(UMCS), the Catholic University of Lublin (KUL) and the
mentioned University of Life Sciences (UP)), and its vicinity
in a totally free manner (they decided what to show and how
to show it) – they were asked to put two reference buildings
only (one was where the cartography course took place),
located on an edge of the area. The exact wording of a task
was short: to draw the area of campus with the extent
defined by the rector’s office and the 7 Leszczyńskiego st.
building with a free selection of methods and content. A
total of 124 sketches were analysed and used in this study
(part of them were as well used in the study of spatial cogni-
tion, see Nieścioruk, 2013). The number of sketches drawn
was over 130, but a few had to be rejected due to formal
reasons (no reference points, no gender given). Unfortu-
nately, the number of maps done in each single survey was
not equal (see Table 1), but the core of the group remained
the same. This was caused by the changing number of stu-
dents from class to class and by the fact that the survey was
voluntary and announced among students attending lectures,
which are not obligatory.

with 41% in the first survey and up to 69% in the small

ANALYSED ELEMENTS

Most of the works and maps done during the programme of
geodesy and cartography are strictly geodetic. The large-scale
maps of 1:1000, 1:2000 and 1:5000 are prepared under
Polish law and in accordance with the regulations of the Min-
istry of Interior, which define, among others, content and
graphical convention of the large-scale geodetic maps. The
only courses where students can design symbols, colour con-
vention, data classification, etc. by themselves is cartography
and GIS and, to a small extent, introductory Earth science
basis (‘Podstawy nauk o Ziemi’). To test their knowledge
of how to use and the ability to use cartographic principles,
groups of features were analysed on sketches. They are
described below. Due to the nature of sketches, not all
elements of cartographic design can be tested with them.
Simple linear features often form a frame of an image, but
a person has little choice here, unless he or she is asked to
draw an area with many different types of lines, e.g. streets
of different classes, paths, pedestrian walkways, streams,
etc. In such a case a clear differentiation is needed, which
can be done with colours or patterns, so it is worth supplying
surveyees with colour pencils if we plan to concentrate on line
features. With the most typical cases of depicted city space,
one type of line is often used (streets only). Areal and point
features offer much more as design indicators. Point features
depicted as map symbols especially fall into this category, as
they can show both the graphical talent of a tested person
and her or his attitude towards the language of a map and
the possibilities offered by more complex, eye-catching and
pictorial symbols. One of the basic rules of a good carto-
graphic design is also the composition of a map and a pres-
ence of exact elements. While graticule and scale is rather
obsolete on sketch maps (due to their non-cartometric
nature), the legend is important evidence of the knowledge
of design rules and is vital when a surveyee uses graphical,
that need explanation. As
well-invented map symbols
sketch maps are often used to test spatial cognition, it is
obvious that they are distorted by its author’s space percep-
tion. While the aspect of cartometry and distortion of these
sketches is interesting, it also shows that sketches cannot be
used to test the design when considering the mathematical
base of maps.

The tested elements are as described below.
1. Streets. These are vital elements of mental maps, the
most typical of line features, as defined by Lynch (1960).

linear objects, hence there is not much to design on a
sketch map here, as previously mentioned. Two sub-classes
were distinguished, however, as single line and double, paral-
lel lines (which in some cases and scales can be treated as
areal, not linear symbols). Both are equal from a good
design point of view.

2. Street names
Labelling features is a sign of knowing the space, so the
number of labels was not taken into account in the study, as
it could differ depending on whether the respondent lives
in Lublin or not. As little as one label was enough to
analyse this feature, as the placement is what counts. The
name could be placed inside a street (even for a single-line
symbol it is possible– the label is written on the line and
looks like it is crossed out) or above it. The first type is
much better for double line (name ‘inside’ a street), the
second one for single-line symbol (name ‘over’ a street, not
crossed by it).

3. Point features
This is a very broad class and the name is not very precise
here, being even a little incorrect in terms of methodology.
All small (in the scale of the map) elements depicted by
respondents were treated as single point features, e.g. bus
stops, photocopying points, and pubs. This group consists
of bigger objects as well, which, in terms of classification
are areal (could be shown in natural dimensions in a scale
of the map), but are treated as points because they are
small and have strictly defined borders on sketch maps.
These objects are single buildings, mainly of universities.
This class contains a few types of graphical representation
of objects. First is a symbol showing the object, including a
more complicated pictorial symbols. The second is as
above, but accompanied by the label describing and explain-
ing the object. The next two are similar but referred mainly to
buildings and are buildings’ outlines with names inside and
building outlines only. The last type is very untypical, but
was present on some sketches – point features marked only
by the name (label) itself. In terms of design, a well-invented
symbol is the best solution for ‘real’ point features, while for
buildings it can be better to show them using an outline. A
name only is the worst solution, as it is less precise and less
cartographic using text where symbols could be used.

4. Areal features
This class consists of large-area objects which could have
appeared on sketches with undefined, imprecise or blurred
boundaries. Hence building were not counted here (they
were treated as point features), while parks, campus area,
cemetery and similar landmarks were. A few types were dis-
tinguished here – areas marked with symbols (and pattern of
symbols) only, by symbols and names, by symbols, names
and outline, by name and outline and by name only. All
types are correct in terms of design, but – again – using a
name only is the least informative and less precise and
symbols are the most attractive graphically, but they need
proper explanation in the legend. Adding a borderline

precisely shows the spatial extent of the area, which is absent
in the case of text only and is not exactly defined in the case of
pattern of symbols.

hand – on sketches drawn with no graticule goes to prove
that a sketch’s author knows the orientation of the area.

5. Legend
It is a vital element of any map, explaining used symbols. It is,
however, quite rare on representations of mental maps, as
sketches are often treated as self-explanatory or explained in
a fairy ordinary way with labels. On the other hand,
courses of cartography and GIS lay stress on the function
of a legend on a map, both on qualitative (symbols
showing different types of information) and on quantitative
(classes in choropleth maps or sizes of diagrams) infor-
mation. The presence of a legend on a sketch map can be
seen as adopting and understanding one of the basic rules
of communicating through maps.

6. North arrow
This element is often discussed as obsolete on maps, as they
contain graticule showing north or use projections where
north cannot be shown with one, unified arrow. However,
it is very easy to add this element to a map in GIS software
and it is quite popular on pictorial maps (often in an
elegant form of a compass rose). In general,
it can be
treated as obsolete, as mentioned above, but on the other

7. Geodetic map symbols
This class contains elements which were depicted in a manner
defined by geodetic technical instruction. Their presence on a
map shows that the author knows this convention and uses it,
instead of self-designed symbols. It cannot be evaluated
however. It is just a sign of the fact that respondents, students
of geodesy and cartography, are more educated in geodetic
convention rather than in free design, they work with
large-scale maps and are used to their graphical solutions
and adopt them to their own maps.

Besides the elements mentioned above, a few other inter-
esting but untypical features were analysed which will be dis-
cussed more broadly in a further part of the paper.

Figure 2 shows the selection of all the described elements

from sketches.

THE RESULTS

All of the features and conventions used that appeared on
sketches were counted and analysed in four time-moments,
the same as in Table 1. The ‘other class’ was a comparison
series only. The numbers in total may exceed the number of

respondents, as a few types of a single feature could have been
concurrent on one sketch, e.g. one could use both pictorial
map symbols and labelled outlines of buildings.

Table 2 presents the numbers for streets and street names
and Figure 3 presents changes in the percentage of these
values on a chart.

What can be clearly seen here is the domination of double-line
streets. A single-line solution is also good, it is even easier to
draw, but was far less popular. The first reason could be the
scale of sketches – as they show relatively small area of the
campus, double lines ‘fill’ more space and resemble an areal
way of showing streets, typical for large-scale maps. The other
reason could be labels placement. Double-line streets allow the
putting of names inside streets, which binds a name to a street
in a more definite way, leaves more space outside the street
and generally looks better, especially – as it was mentioned –
with double-line solution, which is dominant here. Figure 3
shows a constant increase of a pair ‘double-line + labels
inside’, from over 90% to 100%. Domination of it can even
be seen in the comparative other class (see Table 2). Both men
and women followed the same tendency. Although the single-
line presentation cannot be called a bad design, it is less appropri-
ate in this case and most of the respondents were aware of it.

Table 3 presents the numbers for symbols and point-alike
objects (as defined above). Figures 4 and 5 present changes
in percentage for map symbols and objects, respectively, on
the charts.

The most important and positive observation in this case is
a general increase in map symbol use. As it has already been
said, symbols are a very good solution, an effective way of
transmitting information on a map (when properly

explained) and an example of a good understanding of the
map’s language. The significant growth of its frequency can
be seen comparing the first and the second surveys, when it
rose from 31% to 60% in general and from almost 20% to
40% in the case of pictorial, well-thought out map symbols
(see no. 2 – ‘fruits’ – in Figure 2). A smaller increase can be
seen for symbols accompanied by text explanation on a
sketch – from 11.5% to 16% and from 8.2% to 16% for pic-
torial. The important factor in the case of the first group
(symbols only with no text) is the simultaneous growth of
the presence of a legend on sketches, especially from the
first to the second survey (see the following section).

Changes occurring from the second to the third survey are
interesting. The previous survey showed an overall increase
in map symbol use, as described. The reason for it is rather
obvious, as the first survey was conducted before the carto-
graphy course and the second one at the very end of it. Stu-
dents (respondents) were about to finish their semester
works (small tourist maps) and were preparing for an
exam, so their knowledge of cartography basis was strong
in both practical and theoretical ways, maintained by con-
stant rehearsal and not faded by time and other, in some
aspects contradicting, courses. It, to some extent, was
notable in the second period. The third survey was con-
ducted at the end of the sixth semester, a year after the pre-
vious one. For students it was a time of intense use of
geodetic maps and geodetic symbols, defined by regu-
lations. Even the GIS course, where resulting maps were
partly freely designed by students, did not change the
overall attitude, as the GIS software provokes the use of
pre-defined symbols as well, especially for quite temporary

(e.g. not printed) maps. A positive aspect is the fact that the
total use of map symbols stayed at the same level: 60% for
symbols and 16% for symbols with labels. A decrease was
observed in such symbols, which could be seen as well
designed and pictorial: from 40% to 20% for solo symbols
and from 16 to 8 for labelled map symbols. While the
overall result is quite satisfactory (of course it could be
higher), the ‘design’ part is lacking somehow. This obser-
vation resulted in a direct suggestion to modify the cartogra-
phy and GIS courses slightly and put more stress on the own
design of symbols. The programme of geodesy and cartogra-
phy studies at the University of Life Sciences in Lublin are
relatively new and are still in development and subject to

minor changes. This relates to the cartography course also
including both lectures and laboratories (workshops). The
design part was modified according to the workshop projects
results, students’ surveys and the results of experiments like
the one described here. An example of a project done
during workshops can be seen in Figure 1. Each semester is
summarized by a teaching quality control body and teachers
themselves which gives a possibility to observe if knowledge
gained during one course is properly used during another (in
this case – map reading and designing skills) and, if needed,
the teaching programme,
strengthen the exact part of
especially when two courses are closely related and taught
by the same teacher. Students can also fill in the survey at

the end of the cartography course and this is where they may
influence the content of the course. In the field of design,
they asked for more examples of good map design during lec-
tures and more hours for the introductory technical aspect of
symbol design. Both suggestions were accepted, especially
that they were backed up, as mentioned above, by the
result of the described experiment with a significant decrease
in good map symbol design in semesters that took place after
the cartography course.

Comparing the results with the test group of the other class
(the last column of Table 3), it can be seen that a change in the
course content may be seen as a positive decision – general
map symbol use rose by almost 15%.

The absolute numbers for symbols, especially from the first
to the second survey decreased, but one has to keep in mind
that the number of survey participants differed – for the first
one it was 61 and for the second one – 25, so a decrease from
19 (of 61) to 15 (of 25) can be – as a percentage – treated
positive.

The other type of presentation of point-alike objects was
using contours. It was typical for buildings, especially these
of universities. The most common way to use this method
was joining outlines with labels (see no. 3 in Figure 2) –
for all three surveys and for the additional class it stood at
over the 90% level, with 100% during the second survey,
just at the end of a semester with the cartography course.
Other ways of presenting data, e.g. contours only and
labels only, should be treated as less effective and less informa-
tive (especially labels only). The contours-only method was
used by over 30% of respondents (with a maximum of

36% in the second survey) and labels only by just less than
10% (with a maximum of 9.8% during the first survey),
which can be seen as a good result, bearing in mind that
this method is the least effective.

The last big group of features was areal objects, here rep-
resented mainly by parks and cemeteries. The values for
them are shown in Table 4 and changes in percentage are
illustrated in Figure 6.

This part shows rather surprising results. The most infor-
mative versions of representation with borders of areas and
the most attractive (in terms of graphics) version with map
symbols followed the same trend as described above for
point features (symbols and contours). An increase from
the first to the second survey was observed due to intense
and fresh cartographic knowledge resulting from the carto-
graphy course and a decrease two semesters later can be
seen. In most cases (except for the ‘labels and outlines’
version), an increase was larger than the following decrease.
The only one version of depicting areas that did not match
this trend was marking areas with labels only. It is the least
informative and eye-catching way to present areas, as there
is no graphic design and no precise borders defined, so a con-
stant decrease should be observed or only a little increase in
the second period, as students learn these rules. However, it
can be seen that in the third period there is a significant
increase of this (the worst) version and, moreover, it has
the biggest share with 36%. The issue in the high use of
this method in the last period is observed for both men and
women. Even for the class used as a comparison, this share
is quite big (23.1%), but not the biggest one. The reasoning

conducted at the end of the cartography course. It can be
clearly seen that the rule of explaining symbols used on a
map with a legend has been adopted by students – respon-
dents (see no. 5 in Figure 2). The result could be higher as
it is just a little more than a quarter of the group, although
students work with geodetic maps in everyday practice and
other courses, where a legend is often absent on the sheet.
That is probably the main reason of a small decrease in per-
centage for the legend during the third survey, even if the
fifth and sixth semesters GIS course also emphasizes the
role of a legend (which is put with less effort there, as it is
set and placed automatically by the software). A very
encouraging element seen on the chart is the fact that after
some major changes in the cartography course content an
increase in this legend-related knowledge can be seen – the
other class put no legend on their sketches (compared to
24% for the survey class, attending the modified cartography
course).

The opposite tendency can be seen for geodetic symbols.
Use of them on sketches decreased from the first to the
second survey (from 3.3% to 0%) and then increased to as
much as 20%, showing the increasing knowledge and fre-
quency of use of geodetic maps and professional, technical
regulations among students. In comparison, the other class
scored a much higher share of
this element, reaching
almost 40%. What is worth mentioning is all geodetic
symbols were (if used) used correctly, depicting elements as
defined in the regulations.

The last of the additional features described in this section
is the north arrow. It has been described above as an element
dependent on a projection and obsolete on maps with grati-
cule. On sketches it allows the general orientation to be
shown and proves the knowledge of an area by the respon-
dent, however. In fact, this element cannot be treated as
bad or good, as there are contradicting rules for ‘normal’
maps (students were often told that the north arrow added
to a map in a GIS software pointing upward while the paral-
lels are not vertical is an error) and sketches (orientation
element). The general presence of this element was not
higher than 10% for all the survey groups.

Unfortunately, it was not possible to measure the individ-
ual progress of each student and observe if and to what extent
changes in methods used were significant. The reason for that
was the fact that the survey was anonymous, with no code or
symbol used to denote the persons’ identity, which gave stu-
dents a free hand in map designing. It is worth mentioning
that a few respondents went far beyond the task, adding
information and elements adopted from the cartography
course and popular culture not exactly relevant for these

Figure 7. Portion of a sketch showing area labelled only (‘Park Saski’)
and territorially marked by other features (streets encircling it)

for this situation can be different. Most probably, it is the lack
of way of showing precise information of the spatial extent of
the area on a sketch map. On the other hand, it does not
prevent respondents from using outlines for buildings in a
very general way or avoiding this method in the second
period when none such cases were noted. Another probable
reason can be seen in Figure 7. With areas being surrounded
by buildings and/or streets, there is no need to depict bound-
aries, as they are present in a natural way, with the use of other
features’ elements. However, it is worth mentioning that
some methods of presenting such uncertain information are
known to respondents, but they lack the technical possibili-
ties to use them on a pencil-drawn sketch. The most
common way is to use blurred outskirts for uncertain
extent. Depicting these boundaries with other features, as
mentioned, may be a serious deterrent
in using such
design, even if they could find a solution (e.g. by marking
outlines with a dashed instead of a solid line to show
uncertainty).

Besides these three general types of features (lines, point-
alike and areas), some interesting elements of sketches were
analysed, as described in the earlier section. The quantities
are given in Table 5 and changes in percentage are shown
in Figure 8.

The presence of a legend on mental sketches is, as pre-
viously mentioned, quite rare due to the nature of these
maps and the symbols used which are often limited and
self-explanatory. However, the knowledge of cartographic
rules and communication principles causes that a legend
should be put even on those sketches where cartographers-
to-be are surveyed. Figure 8 shows the significant growth
in percentage of sketches with a legend – from less than 2%
during the first survey to 28% during the second one,

The Use of Mental and Sketch Maps

Figure 8. Chart showing changes in the percentage for presence of other features (lines)

sketches. They were neither errors nor mistakes, they were
just some extras, but often humorous, as those seen in
Figure 9. Monsters seen on empty spaces of maps is a way
to fill or decorate the maps or mark a danger in a way it
used to be done on some early maps (Blake n.d.). Decorative
elements were also used for objects, turning symbols into
unique pictorial elements, often with some humour or even
irony, when depicting the TV tower with the image of the
Sauron’s Barad-dȗr from J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth.
More advanced cartographic methods of presentation were
also used, although again with a little humorous attitude
thrown in, as a slightly incorrect diagram method with the
legend explaining the groups that visit certain shops and res-
taurants (e.g. students, pensioners and hipsters). These latter
examples show that even simple sketches may provoke the
addition of a personal touch in terms of design on the map.
It is important that these respondents, even if joking, dared
to do something more than they were told and treated the
map language as a formal language, but with presence of
some beauty. It is important, as every map is a channel of

communication and this communication has to be precise
and correct, that it is easier to achieve this through with
elegant words and sentences (here: design) rather than with
careless grammar and spelling mistakes.

CONCLUSION

The use of mental maps in cartographic research is quite
wide,
from spatial cognition to maps evaluation. The
approach proposed in this paper is different, as it uses
sketches to measure the level of cartographic editing and
design skills. The application of this method brought inter-
esting results, as is described in this case.

First of all, it can be well used to observe the change (pro-
gress or regress) of students’ attitude to selected methods,
their knowledge of them, the ability to use them and their
tendency to substitute them with other solutions. All this
based on – in this case – the attended cartography and GIS
course and with relation to other, non-cartographic courses.
It is a great motivator to analyse the situation and modify
the courses content to meet the requirements of an ever-
demanding market, the methodology and the students them-
selves. Knowing what is good and where the practical knowl-
edge lacks is a starting point in preparing lectures, tasks and
exercises which aim to change the status quo.

In the analysed case study, it was good to see the increase in
symbols and legend use. However, the slight decrease in their
use with time shows that maybe more stress should be put on
it in the future. The other argument in improving the course
content in relation to the own symbols design is the fact that
60% of respondents using map symbols were good, but still
not an ultimately very good result. Some negative tendencies
which could be remedied were noted too, being the growing
tendency of marking areas with labels only.

The overall approach can definitely be summarized as
effective, but further studies are without doubt necessary.
First is to observe the tendencies in the change of used
methods and second to evaluate the method itself in a
longer framework. At least a few consecutive classes partici-
pating in all of the three waves of the survey would result

in more concise conclusions. A modification definitely worth
considering is monitoring the level of the individuals’ pro-
gress. The survey was planned as being anonymous, but
introducing special symbols or codes attached to participants
and known only to them may be an effective solution. This
would allow the observation of individual tendencies and
the ability to summarize them using other established statisti-
cal methods.

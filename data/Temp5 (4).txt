Abstract
With the increasing concerns in developing methodologies for Reducing Emissions
from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) projects, there is a need to
understand the characteristics of existing Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) modules.
This research presents a modular framework for assessing predictive accuracy of
business-as-usual deforestation in the future by comparing two existing approaches:
GEOMOD Modeling (GM) and Land Change Modeler (LCM). The comparison
uses data from a case study in Chiquitanía, Bolivia. Data from 1986 and 1994 are
used to simulate land-cover of 2000; the resulting maps are compared with an
observed land-cover map of 2000. GM and LCM simulate business-as-usual defor-
estations at the pixel level. The model structures of GM’s linear extrapolation and
LCM’s Markov Chain are compared to review quantity of LUCC; and the model
structures of GM’s empirical frequency, LCM’s logistic regression, and LCM’s
multilayer perceptron are compared to review (spatial) allocation of LUCC. Relative
operating characteristics, ﬁgure of merit, and multiple resolution analysis are
employed to assess predictive accuracy of multiple transition modeling. By design,
GM lacks the potential to model multiple transitions, and the LCM’s multilayer
perceptron may produce different results for each simulation due to its stochastic
element. Based on the model structure and predictive accuracy comparisons, the
LCM seems more suitable than the GM for a REDD application. When a project is
to employ a predictive method for its spatially explicit baseline setting, then it is
highly recommended to use the proposed framework to assess accuracy of the
baseline as part of a project design document.tgis_1227 631..654

1 Introduction

1.1 Background

Emissions of carbon dioxide in developed, developing, and least developed countries
vary substantially from their point-source of emissions. According to the World
Resources Institute, carbon dioxide emissions of developed countries are mainly due to
burning fossil fuels, whereas those of developing and least developed countries are
largely due to land-use and land-cover change, e.g., deforestation (Baumert et al.
2005). Rainforests, mostly located in developing and least developed countries, play a
key role in sequestering Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (IPCC
2007). They are also crucial in terms of preventing degradation of other tropical envi-
ronments such as soil and watersheds (Johnson and Lewis 2007). The United Nations
Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD) is designed to prevent deforestation
of rainforests in developing and least developed countries, while allowing developed
countries to sustain their economies as usual
(UN-REDD 2008). According to
UN-REDD, developed countries guarantee ﬁnancial support to developing and least
developed countries through the trades of carbon credits. The carbon credit is a new
monetary system that allows countries to sell and buy the rights to emit GHGs. The
main goal of this mechanism is to integrate the externalities of human driven climate
change into the global economy; in turn, this helps to mitigate the impact of anthro-
pogenic climate change.

In the case of forestry-based carbon offset projects, a project has to prove
its “additionality” in order to generate carbon credits. Additionality is deﬁned as “the
extent to which project interventions lead to GHG beneﬁts that are additional to
business-as-usual” (IPCC 2000). In other words, forestry-based carbon credit becomes
feasible only if there are additional planted trees (i.e. afforestation and reforestation) or
additional preventive measures of deforestation (i.e. REDD). That said, a REDD project
must include a baseline since the additionality is calculated based upon the results of the
business-as-usual report outcome. A REDD baseline is constructed by two components:
(1) the land-use and land-cover change modeling that depicts business-as-usual defores-
tation, and (2) the corresponding carbon mass measured by scientiﬁc metrics (Brown
et al. 2007). The present article exclusively deals with the former portion of the REDD
baseline setting.

1.2 Research Objectives

Land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) modeling is a partial representation of the
real LUCC due to a lack of knowledge of the coupled human and natural systems.
It is a methodology to test our understanding of LUCC processes by conducting
scientiﬁc experiments (Veldkamp and Lambin 2001). In the context of REDD, LUCC
modeling is used to simulate trends of business-as-usual deforestation in the future.
The simulation is then combined with carbon mass data to quantify the amounts of
carbon loss. The negative aspect of using carbon mass data is dealing with the incon-
sistencies of carbon stocks and GHG measurements (IPCC 2000, Ramankutty et al.
2007). The errors associated with such inconsistencies produce larger chances of
discrepancies in the resulting baseline. Understanding the characteristics of LUCC

modeling with itspredictive accuracy becomes vital in the initial stages of implementing
REDD projects.

The present article proposes a modular framework to assess accuracy of a spatially
explicit REDD baseline by demonstrating the comparison of two LUCC modeling
approaches. In this article, LUCC modeling refers to an overall predictive LUCC simu-
lation process, while a LUCC module indicates an automated tool which is imple-
mented in a computer program. In this context, the scope of this research is limited to
two LUCC modeling approaches that include two LUCC modules in IDRISI Andes
15.0™: GEOMOD and Land Change Modeler. The research compares only the LUCC
modeling part of each module, i.e. carbon components in GEOMOD or biodiversity
components in Land Change Modeler are not compared. The main purpose of this
study is to compare the performance of “GEOMOD Modeling (GM)” (Pontius and
Chen 2006) and “Land Change Modeler (LCM)” (Eastman 2007) for simulating base-
line deforestation of multiple transitions based on model structure and predictive accu-
racy. Unlike LCM, GEOMOD does not estimate quantity of LUCC; i.e. it needs an
independent quantity for its use. For a fair comparison, linear extrapolation dictates the
quantity for the GM runs. In addition, LCM has two options for producing transition
potential maps, namely logistic regression and multilayer perceptron, whereas GM
employs empirical frequency. In terms of the quantity of LUCC estimation, linear
extrapolation (Pontius and Chen 2006) and Markov Chain (Eastman 2007) are com-
pared; similarly the (spatial) allocation of LUCC estimation, empirical frequency
(Pontius and Chen 2006), logistic regression (Eastman 2007) and multilayer perceptron
(Eastman 2007) are compared to explore the feasibility of multiple transition modeling.
The produced transition potential maps are assessed by Relative (or Receiver) Operat-
ing Characteristics (ROC) (Pontius and Schneider 2001). Furthermore, “Figure of
Merit” (Pontius et al. 2008) and “Multiple Resolution Analysis” (Pontius et al. 2008)
are considered when the quantity is identically speciﬁed to assess predictive accuracy of
multiple transition modeling.

The proposed framework can be employed immediately as part of a Project Design
Document (PDD), that should include sound criteria in determining “baseline defores-
tation methodology” (CIFOR 2005). The preparation of PDD is mandatory in order to
qualify carbon credits either for a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)-approved
carbon market or a voluntary carbon market (Zerbock, pers. comm., 2007). Moreover,
Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) mandates a periodic validation for a spatially explicit
REDD baseline by physically monitoring protected forests because not all carbon credits
are immediately tradable due to their uncertainty (Emmer et al. 2007). Hence, the use of
scientiﬁc accuracy assessments will support the validity of carbon credits produced, and
in turn, may increase the magnitude of tradable carbon credits.

1.3 Literature Review

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and United Nations Environmental
Programme (UNEP) deﬁne land-use as “the arrangements, activities and inputs people
undertake in a certain land cover type to produce, change or maintain it,” while
land-cover is considered “the observed (bio)physical cover on the earth’s surface.” They
argue that there is a distinct relationship between land-cover and land-use, and these
terms should not be used interchangeably. For example, a forest is a type of land-cover

and the land-use could be hunting or rubber tapping (FAO and UNEP 1999). From this
context, LUCC embodies a snapshot of the dynamic coupled human and natural systems
of the terrestrial surface. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, LUCC has been studied
by various disciplines, such as agricultural economics and geography, with numerous
methodologies ranging from econometrics to geographic information science/systems
(GIS) (Agarwal et al. 2002, Heistermann et al. 2006). Heistermann et al. (2006, p. 142)
allocate numerous land-use models to three categories: (1) geographic models, (2) eco-
nomic models, and (3) integrated geographic and economic models, where a land-use
model deﬁned as “a tool to compute the change of area allocated to at least one speciﬁc
land-use type”. The geographic model is geared towards analyses of land suitability and
spatial interaction, while the economic model is geared towards analyses of drivers of
LUCC, such as market and population structures. The integrated model seeks to combine
the advantages of both approaches and it often aims at incorporating the interactions of
terrestrial environment and global economy (Heistermann et al. 2006). In this context,
both GEOMOD Modeling (GM) and Land Change Modeler (LCM) are classiﬁed as
geographic models because they are primarily focused on identifying different degrees of
land suitability.

GM and LCM are compared in this research with respect to REDD applications;
it seems crucial to compare those with other land-use models that are relevant to
environmental policy. Lee (1975) argues that a model must be transparent and simple,
and it should start with a particular policy problem that needs to be solved. The best
models will also retain a balance between theory, intersubjectivity, and the intuition of
users. The Global Climate Change Program of the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA)’s Forest Service compares 15 land-use models in order to understand the mecha-
nisms of LUCC modeling (Agarwal et al. 2002). The authors proposed a framework
based on the principles of Lee (1975) to identify “good” policy models. The comparison
framework has three dimensions: (1) space, (2) time, and (3) human decision-making.
Along with the three axes of space, time, and human decision-making, the land-use
models are plotted discretely based on their complexities and scales. According to the
framework, GM and LCM are characterized to have high spatial and temporal com-
plexity with low complexity of human decision-making. They both can deal with spatial
representation and spatial interactions in a sophisticated way. In addition, they not only
support ﬂexible time-steps but also support ﬂexible duration settings. In terms of human
decision-making, however, they are considered level 1 where the level indicates “no
human decision-making – only biophysical variables in the model” (Agarwal et al. 2002,
p. 6). Finally, the scale of their human decision-making, which ranges from agents to
domains, is not explicitly deﬁned.

GEOMOD was developed to estimate spatial and temporal patterns of LUCC for
use in the General Circulation Models (GCMs). GEOMOD is comprised of two parts,
GEOMOD1 and GEOMOD2, which helps the user to understand LUCC by comparing
the two opposite approaches: GEOMOD1 is based on the authors’ hypothesis on how
people use land, whereas GEOMOD2 is an empirical numeric analysis that depicts how
people actually use land. The results of the two GEOMODs do not always correspond
to each other over different study areas, and the predictive accuracy declines when the
number of land-use classes increases (Hall et al. 1995, Pontius et al. 2001). To compare
GEOMOD1 and GEOMOD2 applications, the studies employ Kappa indices that
measure the statistical difference between different categorical maps. However, Kappa
indices do not differentiate the disagreement due to pixel quantity and disagreement due

An Assessment of Deforestation Models for REDD 635

to pixel allocation; hence, it is difﬁcult to obtain precise predictive accuracy information
from the Kappa indices since the information derived from those is the mixture of two
different disagreements (Pontius 2000). This indicates that the Kappa indices employed
in Hall et al. (1995) and Pontius et al. (2001) could be misleading; i.e. they are not
sufﬁcient to measure predictive accuracy of LUCC modeling and hence, to compare
different LUCC modeling approaches.

GEOMOD2 has been frequently used by Winrock International and the US Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) for their forestry-based carbon offset projects. The
Noel Kempff Mercado Climate Action Project, which is the largest carbon offset
project at the time, demonstrates the use of GEOMOD2 (Brown 2002, 2005). The
projects employ Klocation statistics (or Kappa indices for pixel allocation) to assess the
predictive accuracy of GEOMOD2 applications. Although the Klocation statistics are
an improved version of the traditional Kappa indices, by removing the disagreement
due to pixel quantity portion, this measurement is still insufﬁcient to determine pre-
cisely the predictive accuracy of LUCC modeling. Pontius and Millones (2008) argue
that Kappa indices and the variants, such as Khisto, Kquantity and Klocation, could be
misleading. The authors mathematically prove the problematic attributes of the Kappa
family, through mapping the attributes on what they refer to as space of agreement.
In this way, it becomes clear what type of predictive accuracy can be measured (or
differentiated from different types of accuracy) and cannot be measured by the Kappa
family.

Clark Labs and Conservation International evaluate nine different peer-reviewed
LUCC modeling approaches based on model structure and predictive accuracy, mea-
sured by Peirce Skill Score (PSS) (Stephenson 2000) and ROC (Pontius and Schneider
2001). The comparison concludes that multilayer perceptron, which is the main logic
of LTM, and logistic regression, which is the main logic of CLUE-S and LUCAS, and
an option of LTM, have better predictive accuracy compared to other approaches
(Eastman et al. 2005). PSS is deﬁned by taking the difference between the proportion of
hits and the proportion of false alarms (Stephenson 2000). To rephrase PSS using the
ROC’s terminology, it is deﬁned as the difference between true positives and false
positives. The true and false positives are also used as coordinates when constructing an
ROC curve to calculate an area under the curve (Pontius, pers. comm., 2007). In
addition, PSS can be also be rephrased using the Figure of Merit’s terminology intro-
duced by Pontius et al. (2008); the major difference between the PSS and Figure of
Merit is such that the PSS tabulates the difference of hits versus errors while the Figure
of Merit tabulates the ratio of hits versus errors; the main logic that penalizes errors as
opposed to hits remains the same. Pontius et al. (2008) compare 13 applications of nine
different peer-reviewed LUCC modeling approaches based on model structure and pre-
dictive accuracy, measured by two- and three-paired map comparisons at multiple
resolutions (i.e. Multiple Resolutions Analysis) where the three-paired map comparison
includes statistics such as Figure of Merit (Pontius et al. 2008), Producer’s Accuracy
(Congalton 1991) and User’s Accuracy (Congalton 1991). The research concludes
that 12 of the 13 applications contain more erroneous pixels than correctly predicted
pixels, and the fact that one application has more correctly predicted pixels than
erroneous pixels is largely because the study area experienced the largest net land-use
and land-cover change. The authors imply that the Producer’s and User’s Accuracies
in remote sensing could be considered variants of Figure of Merit in LUCC modeling.
In short, the map comparison measurements introduced above may contain redundant

information; thus, those can be streamlined to ROC and Figure of Merit accompanied
with Multiple Resolutions Analysis.

2 Methods

2.1 Study Area and Data

Bolivia has been experiencing rapid deforestation due to several major economic and
social trends during the past two decades (Steininger et al. 2001b). In particular, the
estimated deforestation rate in Santa Cruz, Bolivia is the highest on the planet for a
limited area (Steininger et al. 2001a). Chiquitanía is located in fertile lowlands of
Santa Cruz; the ecosystem contains many commercially valuable tree species and many
of them are being exploited (Killeen et al. 1998). The most targeted are the closed canopy
deciduous forest that has a huge potential economic value in international timber
markets (Killeen et al. 2007b). Further, the region is highly suitable for agricultural
activities due to its fertile landscape (Steininger et al. 2001a), and the governmental
intervention to resolve land tenure conﬂicts created a perverse incentive for deforestation
(Killeen et al. 2007b).

The data for this research were developed by Conservation International’s Center for
Applied Biodiversity Science at the Museo Noel Kempff Mercado in Bolivia, and are used
here with permission of Clark Labs. The data are identical to the tutorial data of IDRISI
Andes 15.0™ and Land Change Modeler for ArcGIS™. The data are constituted by three
land-cover maps from 1986, 1994 and 2000 with nine land-cover categories consisting
of woodland savanna, inundated savanna, savanna, Amazonian mature forest, deciduous
mature forest, cusi palm, inundated forest, water body and anthropogenic disturbance.
For ease of comparison, these categories have been reduced to three categories of forest,
savanna and anthropogenic disturbance (Figure 1). Raw satellite images were acquired
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Geocover project; the
land-cover maps in 1986 and 1994, captured by Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and
Multispectral Scanning System (MSS), were classiﬁed by a supervised classiﬁcation
accompanied with numerous aerial and ﬁeld surveys (Steininger et al. 2001b). The
land-cover map in 2000, captured by Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM), was
classiﬁed by an unsupervised classiﬁcation using the Isodata module of ERDAS Imag-
ine™ (Killeen et al. 2007a). Included in the data are six environmental variables such as
distance from disturbance, distance from roads, distance from streams, distance from
cities, elevation and slope (Figures 2a–f). They all use World Geodetic System (WGS)
84 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 20 South coordinate system and a 150
by 150 m spatial resolution.

2.2 Multiple Transition Modeling

Transition refers to a process in which something undergoes a change from one land-type
(e.g. forest) to another (e.g. anthropogenic disturbance). There is a need for modeling
multiple transitions in REDD projects since there can be numerous transitions due to
different types of land management, e.g. forest to cropland or forest to grassland.
Consequently, different types of future land-use may lead to different carbon emissions
levels. For instance, cropland may emit GHGs by using machines that consume fossil

fuels for agricultural activities, while livestock may generate GHGs by producing wastes
(Emmer et al. 2007). In addition, it is crucial to acknowledge that the term “forest” is/can
be deﬁned in different ways (Ramankutty et al. 2007). According to the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), many deﬁnitions of forest are based on a single threshold
of minimum canopy cover, and determining an adequate threshold is not globally uniform.
If one employs a high threshold then many trees might not be considered “forest” and
hence, they can be cleared out immediately; whereas if one employs a low threshold
then it might become legal to degrade many forests till they reach the threshold (IPCC
2000). Such issues can be resolved when a REDD project considers multiple categories
of forest, which results in numerous transitions, e.g. dense forest to sparse forest. In
this context, the objective of this research in terms of LUCC modeling is to simulate
two transitions, namely “forest disturbed between 1994 and 2000” (red) and “savanna

disturbed between 1994 and 2000” (yellow) as precisely as possible using two land-cover
maps for 1986 and 1994 (Figure 1) with six environmental variables (Figures 2a–f).

One transition potential map is necessary and sufﬁcient for single transition mod-
eling. In general, n transition potential maps are necessary for modeling n transitions.
In this case study, there are two transitions of interest between 1986 and 1994: forest to
anthropogenic disturbance, and savanna to anthropogenic disturbance; so there is no

An Assessment of Deforestation Models for REDD 639

competition between the two transitions because they begin with different land-cover
types. Hence, a total of six transition potential maps are generated based on the two
transitions and three approaches, namely Empirical Frequency (EmpFreq), Logistic
Regression (LogReg) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Lastly, GM employs GEO-
MOD’s pixel allocating process to combine the speciﬁed quantity of LUCC with the
transition potential maps by EmpFreq. Likewise, LCM employs its own pixel allocating
process, which includes the Multi-Objective Land Allocation (MOLA) module of IDRISI
Andes 15.0™, to combine the speciﬁed quantity of LUCC with the transition potential
maps by LogReg and MLP (Eastman 2006).

2.3 Calibration and Validation

The validation process is essential in predictive quantitative modeling (Isaaks and Srivas-
tava 1989, Park and Kim 2002, Pontius et al. 2007). In geostatistics, Kriging, which can
be considered a type of prediction, is typically evaluated by cross-validation (Isaaks and
Srivastava 1989). In time-series analysis, it is conventional to reserve a certain number of
observations in order to conﬁrm whether or not the excluded observations actually fall
into a model’s conﬁdence interval when those are not used at the calibration stage (Park
and Kim 2002). In GIS-based LUCC modeling, a simulation can be evaluated by
comparing it with its reference map, which is considered as a “true” observation (Pontius
et al. 2007). The common element of these validation processes is separating data for
calibration and validation. From this context, the baseline deforestation modeling is
calibrated with data from 1986 and 1994, and data from 2000 are used to validate the
calibration with three measurements: ROC, Figure of Merit and Multiple Resolution
Analysis.

3 Model Structure

3.1 Quantity

A linear extrapolation estimates the quantity of forest disturbed in 2000 by interpolating
the quantity of forest disturbed in 1986 and the quantity of forest disturbed in 1994
using a straight line. Then it is linearly extrapolated to 2000 so that the extended straight
line can estimate the quantity of disturbed forest area in that year (Pontius and Chen
2006). This method makes sense when there is only one transition of land-cover change,
such as undisturbed forest to disturbed forest.

A Markov Chain is “a Markov process in which the probability of transition from
one discrete state to the next state in the change depends on the previous state” where
a Markov process is deﬁned as “a natural process which has a random element, but
also exhibits an effect, in which previous events inﬂuence, but do not rigidly control,
subsequent events” (Till 1974, p. 15). This logic produces a transition potential matrix
that shows the rates of change for all possible combinations of transitions. The tran-
sitions are empirically determined based on the given land-cover maps of 1986 and
1994 (Table 1), and the generated transition probability matrix determines the corre-
sponding quantity of LUCC for each transition (Eastman 2007). Compared with the
linear extrapolation, its main beneﬁt is that the method is applicable for multiple
transition modeling.

3.2 Transition Potential Map

in LUCC modeling such
There are many terms that refer to transition potential
lubrication (Pontius and Chen 2006), favorability
as suitability (Eastman 2006),
(Soares-Filho et al. 2003), potential land-use change (Brown et al. 2007), and vulner-
ability (Eastman 2007). The transition potential is used here since it implies the purpose
in a more direct manner, especially when taking into account multiple transition model-
ing. Transition potential is deﬁned as “a degree to which locations might potentially
change in a future period of time” (Eastman et al. 2005, p. 345).

In this research, the logic that calculates transition potential in GEOMOD2 is called
empirical frequency (EmpFreq). EmpFreq produces a transition potential map, while
GEOMOD2 is considered a LUCC module of IDRISI Andes 15.0™ that includes
EmpFreq. This simulates one transition at each time, and all environmental variables
must be binned into a categorical form in order to be used for EmpFreq. EmpFreq
computes weighted summations of all binned environmental variables with the following
equation:

( ) =

R i

A

∑

where R(i) is a transition potential value in pixel i, a indicates a particular environmental
variable, A indicates the total number of environmental variables, Wa is the weight of
environmental variable a, and Pa (i) indicates the percent of LUCC during the calibration
interval in the bin to which pixel i belongs for variable a (Pontius and Chen 2006).
EmpFreq provides the information of each environmental variable’s contribution to a
projected LUCC. However, users’ subjective inputs are used when binning continuous
environmental variables to categorical variables. Tables 2a–b show the speciﬁcations of
the EmpFreq procedure employed in this research.

Logistic regression (LogReg) detects a statistical relationship in a parametric way
between six environmental variables and a binary event such as disturbance versus
persistence, where 1 indicates disturbance and 0 indicates persistence. The basic assump-
tion is that the probability of a binary event that takes the value of 1 follows a logistic
curve. The transition potential can be estimated with the following equation:

where y is a binary event, P is the probability of the binary event given column vector X,
X is a column vector that give the values of the environmental variables, and B is a row
vector that gives the estimated coefﬁcients (Wooldridge 2006). LogReg provides the
information of each environmental variable’s contribution to a projected LUCC through
estimated coefﬁcients. Table 3 shows the speciﬁcations of the LogReg (without any
statistical sampling) employed in this research.

Multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of artiﬁcial neural network that mathemati-
cally mimics how a human brain perceives a particular pattern from complex data (Kim
2005, Mas and Flores 2008). Once a particular pattern cognition process is built up by
MLP for speciﬁc data, then such cognition can be employed with other data to detect the
similar pattern (Kim 2005). By nature, MLP is a distribution-free, non-linear and black
box-like estimator. Distribution-free and non-linear properties allow MLP to have more
ﬂexibility than LogReg in terms of ﬁtting an empirical equation to data and generalizing
it. However, the ﬁtted equation, in many cases, cannot be even numerically expressed;
this means that the relationships between the projected LUCC and six environmental
variables are difﬁcult to interpret. Hence, MLP is often referred to as a black box
(Eastman 2007). Users’ subjective inputs are unavoidable when determining parameters
for its network training. Furthermore, LCM’s MLP employs random sampling for its
network training, which cannot be controlled by users. Therefore each MLP run will
produce different results even with the same input. Table 4 shows the speciﬁcations of the
MLP employed in this research.

events. The measurement considers the accuracy for numerous quantities of LUCC.
ROC requires one or more thresholds, and a threshold refers to the percentage of
pixels in the transition potential map to be reclassiﬁed as 1 in preparation for com-
parison with the reference map. For each threshold, one data point (x, y) is generated
where x is the percent of false positives, and y is the percent of true positives. These
data points are connected to create an ROC curve, and a higher ROC curve implies
that its corresponding transition potential map has more agreement with the reference
map than other transition potential maps that have lower ROC curves. The percent of
true positives is derived from A/(A + C) while the percent false positives is derived
from B/(B + D), where A, B, C, D are pixel counts in Table 5 for each threshold
(Pontius and Schneider 2001). Furthermore, it is important to exclude pixels that are
not candidates for the transition because the pixels do not belong to the “from”
category (Pontius, pers. comm., 2007). An Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), which
coarsely summarizes the information of an ROC curve, is calculated according to the
following equation:

where xi is the false positives for the threshold i, yi is the true positives for threshold i, and
n + 1 is the number of thresholds.

Motivated by Eastman et al. (2005), three types of AUC statistics are calculated:
ordinary AUC, “AUC for all threshold values up to and including the predicted quantity
(or AUCp),” and “AUC for all threshold values up to and including the true quantity

(or AUCt).” The ordinary AUC is calculated by 100 equal-interval thresholds. The AUCp
and the AUCt are calculated based on the ordinary AUC. These are crucial since they
more precisely indicate how transition potential maps contribute to allocation of
LUCC simulation than the ordinary AUC.

4.2 Figure of Merit

“Figure of Merit” (Pontius et al. 2008) assesses the predictive accuracy of a simulated
LUCC by simply overlaying the land-cover map of 1994, the land-cover map of 2000 and
the predicted map of 2000. It has both visual and numeric expressions. In this research,
Figure of Merit maps and statistics are employed. A Figure of Merit map visually
expresses accuracy of simulated LUCC over space; a Figure of Merit statistic is derived
directly from the corresponding Figure of Merit map. It can be expressed mathematically
as follows:

Figure of Merit statistics =

B A B C

+ +

(

)

(4)

where A is a number of pixels for “error due to observed change predicted as persistence”
(or misses), B is a number of pixels for “correct due to observed change predicted as
change” (or hits), C is a number of pixels for “error due to observed persistence predicted
as change” (or false alarms). The Figure of Merit statistics range from 0 to 100 percent,
where 100 percent indicates perfect prediction (Pontius et al. 2008).

4.3 Multiple Resolution Analysis

“Multiple Resolution Analysis” (Pontius et al. 2008) assesses how closely in space the
simulated LUCC is to the reference LUCC. This compares each simulation map to its
reference map by aggregating pixels to coarser resolutions. The raw pixels are aggregated
into coarser pixels by computing the proportion of the three land-cover categories of the
raw pixels within each coarser pixel (Pontius 2002), and such partial membership of the
pixels is calculated by the Validate module in IDRISI Andes 15.0™ (Eastman 2006). Each
ﬁner resolution is completely nested within each coarser resolution where the side of each
coarser pixel is a multiple of the side of a raw pixel in a geometric sequence such as
1, 2, 4, 8 . . . 1,024. Therefore, the lines of Figures 8a–c, for example, range from 150 m

Transactions in GIS, 2010, 14(5)

An Assessment of Deforestation Models for REDD 645

(=1 ¥ 150 m) through 153, 600 m or 153.6 km (=1,024 ¥ 150 m) where the x-axis
indicates the different resolutions of pixels in a logarithmic scale. In Figures 8a–c, the
black solid line indicates how predictive accuracy of each LUCC simulation varies
throughout the different resolutions, while the black dash-dot-dot line represents how
predictive accuracy of persistence varies throughout the different resolutions. This
comparison assumes “persistence” as the prediction of future LUCC that experiences
no change, and then it is compared to determine how a result of LUCC modeling is more
accurate than the prediction of no change. The intersection point of the two black
lines of Figures 8a–c is a speciﬁc resolution called “null resolution,” and this is the critical
point where a result of LUCC modeling starts to perform better than the prediction
of no change. More precise LUCC simulations have ﬁner null resolutions (Pontius and
Malanson 2005).

5 Results

Figures 3a–c are the transition potential maps for forest to anthropogenic produced by
EmpFreq, LogReg and MLP. A higher degree (or a darker pixel) shows that the corre-
sponding location has more potential to be transformed to a different land-use and
land-cover category in the future than a lower degree (or a lighter pixel). Figure 4a shows
the ROC curves of the transition potential maps for forest to anthropogenic transition,
and Figure 4b is a zoom-in ROC curve of Figure 4a; Table 6a gives the corresponding
AUC statistics. The ordinary AUC shows that the MLP has the best overall performance,
and the AUCt also indicates that the MLP performs better than the other two at
identifying the location that actually changed (Table 6a). Meanwhile, between the origin,
and black crosses indicating the predicted quantity by the Markov Chain, the LogReg has
the highest predictive accuracy. This implies researchers may conclude the LogReg has
the most accurate performance compared with others if they do not have information of
the true quantity of LUCC (or if they overlook the validation procedure).

curve is consistently higher than the other curves (Figure 6b). This leads to the conclusion
that the LogReg is the most accurate way to estimate the allocation of LUCC for savanna
to anthropogenic transition.

According to the Figure of Merit maps, the LogReg has the largest amount of
accurately predicted pixels, which is 8.0%, while those of the EmpFreq and MLP are
6.62% and 6.57%, respectively (Table 7). Further, the LogReg’s precise predictions as
well as the MLP’s are distributed more evenly than those of EmpFreq (Figures 7a–c).
Lastly, the Multiple Resolution Analysis indicates that LogReg has the ﬁnest null reso-
lution ranging from 1.2 to 2.4 km, which indicates the LogReg’s prediction is the nearest
to the true LUCC, followed by MLP (about 2.4 km) and EmpFreq (2.4~4.8 km)
(Figures 8a–c, Table 7).

6 Discussion

Based on the model structure and predictive accuracy comparisons, the LCM seems more
suitable than the GM to construct a REDD baseline when considering multiple transi-
tions. The embedded Markov Chain can estimate the quantity of LUCC for multiple
transitions, while it is challenging for linear extrapolation to do so. Moreover, the LCM’s
LogReg has the highest predictive accuracy in most cases measured by ordinary AUC,
AUCp, Figure of Merit, and Multiple Resolution Analysis. The MLP appears to have the

frequency (EmpFreq),

highest predictive accuracy when measured by the AUCt for forest to anthropogenic
transition, but it is important to note that MLP contains a stochastic element. In this
particular case study, therefore, the results of LogReg and those of MLP could be
considered similar, and the stochasticity in the MLP results make any conclusions about
the model comparison supports the results
such differences impossible. Overall,
of Eastman et al. (2005), which also employs the same study area (but with different
categories of land-cover).

Compared to Pontius et al. (2008), it is worth pointing out that the Figure of Merit
maps and statistics are produced in a slightly different way. Those are usually calibrated
with the true quantity of LUCC in other Figure of Merit’s applications (Pontius et al.
2007, 2008), but the present research could not calibrate those with the true quantity of
LUCC due to the number of transitions not being ﬁxed over time. More speciﬁcally, there
are only two transitions between 1986 and 1994, whereas there turn out to have been
ﬁve transitions between 1994 and 2000 (Table 8). The method simply projects the two
transitions between 1986 and 1994 assuming that there will be the same number of
transitions between 1994 and 2000. That is why Figure of Merit statistics are relatively
much lower than the other Figure of Merit’s applications, given the Markov Chain

underestimates the quantity of LUCC for both transitions (Figures 4a and 6a). Pontius
et al. (2008) further investigates different study areas and the transitions by employing
three possible two-map comparisons, namely reference map of time 1 versus reference
map of time 2 (or observed change), reference map of time 1 versus prediction map of
time 2 (or predicted change), and reference map of time 2 versus prediction map of time
2 (or prediction error). This is considered a preliminary approach before applying Figure
of Merit; this becomes particularly handy when one explores multiple study areas and
when there are conﬂicts between transitions. However, those advantages have little to do
with the present research because it investigates only one study area and there are no
conﬂicts between the transitions.

From a land change scientist’s point of view, the differences, measured by ROC,
Figure of Merit, or Multiple Resolution Analysis, must be statistically tested to substan-
tiate how every map comparison measurement differs signiﬁcantly from every other. A
traditional t test or Mann-Whitney U test cannot be used to measure such differences
since they are not independent samples of observations. In the case of REDD, however,
such a “test”ing procedure might not be necessary. As mentioned earlier, a spatially
explicit REDD baseline is constituted of the LUCC modeling that depicts business-as-
usual deforestation practices, and the corresponding carbon mass of the locations mea-
sured by scientiﬁc metrics. That said, the LUCC modeling conducted in this research has
to be combined with additional information of carbon mass in order to generate a
complete baseline. One can map out carbon mass of rainforests, for example, by
individually measuring their size and shape with respect to their carbon content. Most
likely, a type of statistical approach, such as stratiﬁed sampling, is going to be an
important part of this measuring procedure, otherwise it might be unrealistic to measure
every single tree species in a detailed manner. Therefore, a carbon mass map of rainfor-
ests should contain a conﬁdence interval to indicate its measurement precision. This layer
then can be linearly multiplied with the corresponding business-as-usual deforestation
map to generate the complete spatiallyexplicit REDD baseline indicating the amount of
carbon loss under the business-as-usual scenario. If the difference (in terms of carbon
mass) between two LUCC modeling approaches falls into the conﬁdence interval of the

Transactions in GIS, 2010, 14(5)

An Assessment of Deforestation Models for REDD 651

carbon mass measured then it seems reasonable to regard the difference (in terms of
predictive accuracy) between the two LUCC modeling approaches as insubstantial. This
logic can be easily applied to the accuracy assessment framework proposed in this
research. In the case of ROC, it is clear that the LogReg performed somewhat better than
the MLP for savanna to anthropogenic transition measured by the AUCs (Figure 6b,
Table 6b). To verify whether or not such a difference is substantial, one can compare
the binary – savanna or anthropogenic – map of LogReg, which matches with the ROC
coordinates marked by the black cross on the black solid curve, with the binary map of
MLP, which matches with the ROC coordinates marked by the black cross on the black
dash-dot-dot curve (Figure 6b), by multiplying each of them to the carbon mass map of
the study area individually; then each calculation shall produce a number indicating the
amount of carbon loss estimated by each logic. If the resulting two numbers’ numerical
difference is smaller than the conﬁdence interval of the carbon mass measured, then it
seems reasonable to ignore the difference and conclude that the predicted business-as-
usual deforestations by LogReg and MLP are identical. Likewise, Figure of Merit and
Multiple Resolution Analysis can utilize the carbon mass map to measure the difference
of LUCC modeling approaches. In the case of Figure of Merit, each Figure of Merit map
can be multiplied with the carbon mass map to show how the carbon mass of “correct
due to observed change predicted as change” category differs between different LUCC
modeling approaches. In the case of Multiple Resolution Analysis, each map that
matches with its null resolution can then be multiplied with the carbon mass map to
show which LUCC modeling approach estimates the amount of carbon loss more
accurately (when it starts to perform better than the prediction of no change). If their
numerical differences fall into the same conﬁdence interval of the carbon mass measured,
then it seems reasonable to ignore the differences since they cannot tell the difference in
terms of carbon mass, i.e. they indicate the same baseline.

7 Conclusions

This research presents a modular framework for assessing predictive accuracy of defor-
estation models under the business-as-usual scenario by demonstrating the comparison
of two existing approaches: GEOMOD Modeling (GM) and Land Change Modeler
(LCM). The comparison uses data from a case study in Chiquitanía, Bolivia. Data from
1986 and 1994 are used to simulate land-cover of 2000; the resulting maps are compared
to an observed land-cover map of 2000. The model structures of GM’s linear extrapo-
lation and LCM’s Markov Chain are compared to review quantity of LUCC; and the
model structures of GM’s empirical frequency, LCM’s logistic regression, and LCM’s
multilayer perceptron are compared to review (spatial) allocation of LUCC. ROC, Figure
of Merit, and Multiple Resolution Analysis are employed to assess predictive accuracy
of multiple transition modeling. By design, GM lacks the potential to model multiple
transitions, and the LCM’s multilayer perceptron may produce different results for each
simulation due to its stochastic element. Based on the model structure and predictive
accuracy comparisons, the LCM seems more suitable than the GM for setting a REDD
baseline in this particular case study. The most important contribution of this research is
the development and evaluation of the modular framework to assess predictive accuracy
of a spatially explicit REDD baseline, which is immediately applicable as part of a Project
Design Document (PDD). The performances of GM and LCM are also informative but

not as much crucial as the framework itself. The measured differences by the ROC,
Figure of Merit, and Multiple Resolution Analysis can be later roughly veriﬁed by
utilizing the carbon mass information of the study area.

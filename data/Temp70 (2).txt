Abstract A web site was designed to disseminate new information on historical landslides
and floods in Umbria, central Italy. The historical information was compiled through a
thorough review of existing catalogues of historical
landslide and flood events,
supplemented by an extensive search of local historical archives and chronicles, for the
period before 1900. The new catalogue lists 1983 landslide events in the period from 1139
to 2001, and 1956 flood events in the period from 860 to 2001. In the considered period, in
Umbria there were at least 1,531 sites affected one or more times by landslides, and at least
1,071 sites affected one or more times by inundations. The seasonal distribution of
landslides and inundations was found different before and after 1900, most probably
because of incompleteness of the historical record prior to 1900. WebGIS technology was
used to disseminate the geographical and thematic information on historical landslides and
floods in Umbria. The GIS-based web site is aimed at a diversified audience of experts and
private citizens seeking information on geo-hydrological hazards in Umbria.

1 Introduction

WebGIS technology extends to the Internet functionalities typical of a Geographical
Information System (GIS) [8, 9, 11]. In a WebGIS environment, operations such as access
to geographical databases, map production, theme overlay, and visualization of map attributes
are possible using a standard Internet browser (e.g., Mozilla Firefox©, Microsoft Internet
Explorer©, Opera©) and without specific or proprietary software on the computer client (e.g.,

Applets Java, Active X). WebGIS technology is particularly interesting for the dissemination
of information on geo-hydrological events, such as landslides and inundations [1, 4].

For the Umbria region, central Italy, a catalogue of historical landslide and inundation
events was compiled through the systematic analysis of various archive and information
sources. Sites affected by historical landslides and inundations were identified and mapped
at 1:25,000 scale. A specific Web site was designed to disseminate the available historical
information, and WebGIS technology was adopted to show the location of the sites
historically affected by landslides and inundations in Umbria.

In this paper, we describe the available information on historical landslides and floods in
Umbria, we perform a temporal and a spatial analysis of the collected historical
information, and we present a Web site designed to disseminate the information.

2 Study area

The Umbria region extends for 8,456 km2 in central Italy, with elevations ranging from 50
to 2,436 m a.s.l. (Fig. 1). Landscape is hilly or mountainous, with open valleys and large
intra-mountain basins. The Tiber River, a tributary of the Tyrrhenian Sea, drains the area.
Climate is Mediterranean, with distinct wet and dry seasons. Rainfall occurs mainly from
October to December and from March to May, with cumulative annual values ranging
between 500 and 2,100 mm. Snowfall occurs every year in the mountains and about every
5 years at lower elevations. Due to the physiographic and climatic setting, landslides and
floods are common in Umbria, and cause severe damage [3, 5, 6, 10].

3 Historical information on landslides and floods in Umbria

The Umbria Region has a long history of landslides and floods (Fig. 2) [3, 5, 6, 10].

For the Umbria region, the AVI Project, a national inventory of historical landslides and
floods in Italy [2, 4, 5, 12] collected information on 1,482 landslide events at 1,286 sites, and
on 1,257 inundation events at 525 sites. Most of the events occurred in the 83-year period
from 1918 to 2001. Information on landslides and floods occurred before 1918 is available
for a limited number of events in the national catalogue. The historical information on
landslides and floods listed in the AVI inventory was obtained searching local and national
newspapers, interviewing local experts on mass movements and floods, and through the
systematic review of published and unpublished technical and scientific reports [2, 4, 5, 10].
Inspection of the temporal distribution of the inventoried historical landslides and floods
events in Umbria (Fig. 3) reveals that the completeness of the historical catalogue varies
with time. The increased number of events reported after about 1950 is attributed chiefly to
the augmented number and to the better quality of the historical information; the result of
better and more abundant information sources [4, 5].

More recently, the AVI inventory for Umbria was updated through a systematic revision
of the existing information on historical landslides and floods in Umbria, and a thorough
search for new information on historical landslides and floods occurred before 1900 in
Umbria [1, 14]. The new information was obtained searching: (1) old serials and
monographic publications, (2) manuscripts and printed documents, and (3) published or
unpublished reports. The searched documents were stored in two National Archives
(Perugia and Terni), two Public Libraries (the “Biblioteca Augusta” in Perugia and the Terni
Public Library), and the Historical Archive of the Todi Municipality.

A digital catalogue listing all the collected information on historical landslide and flood
events in Umbria was compiled [14]. For each event, the following information was
collected: (1) location of the event, (2) date or period of the event, (3) type of mass
movement and volume of the material
involved, (4) hydrological and meteorological
characteristics of a flooding event; (5) temporal and spatial evolution of the landslide or
inundation event, (6) triggering mechanism, (7) geological and morphological character-
istics of the affected area, and (8) type and extent of the damage. Not all the information
was available for all the events.

A unique numeric value was assigned to each site where a landslide or a flood occurred.
The unique code allowed linking an individual “site” (represented by a single set of

geographical coordinates) to one or more “events” (each represented by a date or period)
occurred at the site. For each site, geographical coordinates were obtained at 1:25,000 scale
adopting the following procedure. First, the original source of information was analysed
searching for all the elements that could help locating the landslide or the inundation
events. Where necessary, lists of local names-of-places were used to help locating the event.
Next,
the site affected by a landslide or an inundation was mapped as a point on
topographic base maps at 1:25,000 scale. Sites for which the location remained
undetermined were mapped in the municipality main centre. Lastly,
the geographic
coordinates for each site were obtained through hand digitization in a GIS. A degree of
certainty in the geographic location was attributed to each site.

Figure 4 shows a sample of the map of sites affected by historical landslides and floods
in Umbria for the Orvieto village. Inspection of Fig. 4 reveals the cartographic detail of the
mapping, and the local abundance of the historical information.

The new historical catalogue for Umbria lists information on 1,983 landslide events at
1,327 sites in the 863-year period from 1139 to 2001, and information on 1,956 flood
events at 972 sites in the 1,142-year period from 860 to 2001.

period from 1910 to 2001

4 Analysis of the new historical catalogue

The new catalogue of historical landslides and floods in Umbria can be used to investigate
the spatial and the temporal distribution of the reported events. This is important
information for landslide and flood hazard and risk assessment [3, 4, 7, 13].

4.1 Geographical distribution of historical events

Figure 5 shows the geographical distribution of sites affected by historical landslides and
floods in Umbria. The map shows the location of 1,324 sites affected by landslides, and
1,003 sites affected by inundations, in the period from 860 to 2001. Inspection of the map
reveals clustering of the reported landslide information in urban areas (e.g., the cities of
Perugia, Todi, Orvieto). This has several causes, including: (1) a higher concern of local
administrators for urban areas, (2) the larger and most frequent damage caused by historical
landslides in urban areas, compared to the damage caused in rural areas, and (3) a certain
easiness in reporting landslides in urban areas, when compared to similar events occurred in
rural areas. Further inspection of Fig. 5 reveals clustering of the reported information on
historical floods at specific sites or areas, chiefly along the Tiber River and its major
tributaries. This reflects the higher frequency of events in these areas that, for this reason,
should be considered at high risk of inundation.

Figure 6 shows the density of landslide and flood sites (i.e., the number of events per
square kilometres) in the 92 municipalities in Umbria. Inspection of the map reveals that
municipalities most affected by historical landslides were Orvieto (281 events), Todi (236),
and Perugia (149); and municipalities most affected by historical floods were Deruta (141

events), Marsciano (112), Terni (112) and Perugia (101). Of the 92 municipalities in Umbria,
90 municipalities (covering 99% of the territory) experienced at least once a landslide, and 79
municipalities (91% of the territory) experienced at least once an inundation. For two
municipalities (Montecchio and Sigillo) no information on historical landslides or floods is
listed in the historical catalogue. These two municipalities cover 0.1% of the Umbria region.
In the two municipalities landslides and floods may have occurred, but they may have not
been noticed or they may have not been reported e.g., because they did not cause damage.

4.2 Temporal pattern of historical events

In the new catalogue of historical landslide and flood events in Umbria, the date, month, or
year of occurrence is known for 1,496 landslide events (75.4%) and for 1,956 flood events
(99.8%; Fig. 7). These events can be used to investigate the temporal pattern of historical
landslide and flood events in Umbria. Inspection of Fig. 7 reveals that the distribution of the
reported events varies with time. Before about 1600, only a handful of events were

Umbria, in the period from 860 to 2001. Affected sites are shown by different symbols and colours,
depending on the type of the event and the source of the information

reported. The number of reported events increases after about 1800, is more distinct in the
second half of the nineteenth century, and is particularly evident after about 1950.

In an historical catalogue of natural events the lack of occurrences in any given period
may be due either to the catalogue’s incompleteness or to variation in the conditions that led
to the events [3, 4, 13]. Decoupling the two effects is difficult. For the new catalogue of
historical landslide and flood events in Umbria, both effects are present. In Umbria, the

year period from 860 to 2001

population went from 442,000 inhabitants in 1860 to 825,000 inhabitants in the year 2001.
The number of vulnerable elements (e.g., houses, roads, etc.) increased proportionally. The
augmented number of reported landslide and flood events—particularly after 1950—is at
least partly the result of the larger population and the increased number of vulnerable
elements. However, we maintain that the increase in the number of reported events in the
catalogue is largely the result of incompleteness of the historical record.

4.3 Monthly distribution of historical events

In the new historical catalogue, the date or the month of occurrence is known for 952
landslide events (48.0%) and for 1,760 inundation events (89.8%). These events can be used
to investigate the seasonal distribution of historical landslides and floods in Umbria (Fig. 8).
Inspection of Fig. 8 reveals that the seasonal distributions of landslide events before
1900 and after 1900 are different. Before 1900 (201 events), reported landslides were
particularly abundant in the period between October and November, and in the period from
March to May. Landslide events were also abundant in July. After 1900 (751events),
landslide events concentrate in the period form September to April, with a peak in February.
The seasonal distribution of historical inundations is also different before and after 1900.
Before 1900 (244 events), reported inundations were particularly abundant in the period
from September to December, with the largest number of reported inundations in
September, i.e., at the beginning of the rainy season. After 1900 (1,516 events), inundations
are most frequent from September to February, with the maximum number of events
reported in December and a distinct (relative) minimum value in January.

periods. a and b, before 1900. c and d, between 1900 and 2001

The observed differences in the seasonal frequency of landslides and inundations with
time may have several causes, including: (1) incompleteness of the catalogue for the earlier
part of the record, (2) changes in land-use types that have affected slope stability and
surface runoff, and (3) climatic and meteorological variations that have affected the pattern
and intensity of the triggering events.

4.4 Recurrence of historical events

Analysis of the historical catalogue reveals that some sites were affected by landslides or
inundations repeatedly. This information can be used to investigate the recurrence of
landslide and inundation events at specific sites. Figure 9 shows the number of times each
site was affected by a landslide or an inundation (y-axis) against the rank of the event (x-
axis), ordered from the largest number of events to the least number of events.

Inspection of Fig. 9 reveals that the total number of damaged sites is large for both
landslides and inundations, confirming that slope failures and flooding are frequent and
widespread in Umbria. Further inspection of the graphs reveals that the number of sites
affected repeatedly is relatively low. Of the 1,071 sites affected by inundations, 296 sites
(27.6%) were affected two or more times, 63 sites (5.8%) were affected five or more times,
and only 17 sites (1.6%) were affected ten or more times. Of the 1,531 reported landslide
sites, 203 sites (18.9%) experienced two or more events, 24 sites (2.2%) were affected five
or more times, and only nine sites (0.8%) experienced ten or more slope failure events.

These figures confirm that the areas where landslides and inundations are frequent—and for
this reason can be considered at risk—are limited, and that
landslides are a more
widespread phenomenon than inundations. This was expected, as inundations occur along
the river network, whereas landslides can occur everywhere a slope exists.

5 WebGIS for historical landslides and floods in Umbria

For the dissemination of the information on historical landslides and inundations in Umbria,
a specific Web site—available at http://eventistoriciumbria.irpi.cnr.it—was designed. Since
the collected historical information has a significant geographical component (sites affected
by landslide or flood events are located by their geographical coordinates), WebGIS
technology was adopted to show the location of sites historically affected by landslides and
inundations in Umbria.

The Web site runs on an Apache HTTP Server version 2.0.55 (http://www.apache.org).
The WebGIS engine is MapServer version 4.10.0 (http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu). The
shared geographical and thematic data are stored in the Web and WebGIS server computer:
an Intel® Pentium IV processor (3.2 GHz) running Linux OS (Fedora Core 4) with two
SATA hard disks (160 GB capacity each) and 1 GB of RAM.

the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, implements a “server-based” architec-
ture for the publication of geographical information on the Internet. Queries submitted by
a “client” using a standard Internet browser that supports the HTML language, are
received by the Web server and passed to MapServer. The WebGIS engine receives the
query and process it, generating the requested maps “on-the-fly”, and sending the result
to the “client” (via the Web server) as a single image file (e.g., a PNG raster file). With
this respect, MapServer is an “image server”, for distributing cartographic information.
The main advantage of the “server-based” architecture consists in the fact
the
“client” does not need specific or proprietary software to use (i.e., query) the WebGIS
server.

MapServer has the following additional characteristics:

1. Runs as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) program, a standard procedure for

interfacing external application software with an information/web server

2. Exploits the OGR Simple Feature Library for vector data, and the GDAL (Geospatial
Data Abstraction Library) for raster data to convert from one file format to another
3. Supports the PostgreSQL database (http://www.postgresql.org) and its PostGIS

extension for handling geographical information (http://postgis.refractions.net/)

4. Supports a number of proprietary GIS formats, including ESRI® Shapefile®
5.

Integrates the PROJ4 library, for the conversion of geographical coordinate from
different projection systems
Integrates the LibTiff, LibGeoTiff and LibJPEG libraries for Tiff, GeoTiff and Jpeg
support

7. Complies with standards proposed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC),
including the Web Map Service (WMS) and the Web Feature Service (WFS) standards

Figure 10 portrays a scheme for the Web and the WebGIS servers used to publish on the

Internet information on historical landslides and floods in Umbria.

The ability of MapServer to serve geographical information through the Web is based on
a single ASCII file: the “mapfile”. In a “mapfile” the available geographical information is
indexed, and the relationships between the geographical information and the display objects
are defined. The established relationships uniquely specify the layout, organization, style,
and scale of publication of the geographical information. In a “mapfile” geographical
information is organized in separate layers. For each layer, classes are defined and styles of

landslides and inundations in Umbria (http://eventistoriciumbria.irpi.cnr.it). Example of map showing
historical landslides and inundations near the city of Perugia, central Umbria

visualization are associated to each class. The structure is flexible, allowing for, e.g. the
publication of maps using different styles (colours, patterns, symbols) depending on the
scale of visualization of the geographical information.

Preparation of a functioning “mapfile” by hand is possible, but it is a tedious and error
prone operation. To facilitate the preparation of complex “mapfiles”, a number of software
applications have been developed, including Map-Lab (http://www.maptools.org/maplab/)
and QuantumGis (http://www.qgis.org/). Software applications are also available to help
designing Web pages to show cartographic information delivered by MapServer. These
Web-designing tools include Chameleon (http://chameleon.maptools.org/), Ka-Map (http://
ka-map.maptools.org/), and Map-Lab (http://www.maptools.org/maplab/). To prepare the
“mapfile” used for the publication of the geographical information on historical landslides
and inundations in Umbria, Map-Lab was used. Optimization and refinement of the
“mapfile” was performed by hand, using a standard text editor. To design the Web-GIS
home page, Chameleon was used. Chameleon is a distributed and configurable environment
that incorporates the ability to quickly setup new WebGIS applications from a common
pool of widgets that can be placed in an HTML template file. The widgets provide fixed
functionalities, but the representation of the widget is configurable.

Figure 11 shows the layout of the main Web page used by MapServer to display the
geographical information on historical landslides and floods in Umbria. The Web page is
subdivided into three main areas. The “map area” is located in the central part of the Web
page. In this area, the geographical information is shown as a single map. Tools are

provided to move through the map. Information on the display scale and on the
geographical coordinates is shown below the map. To the left of the central map, the
geographical information available for display is listed. The information is organized by
themes. For each theme, a legend is provided. The order of the themes specifies the
sequence used to prepare the map through overlay of the selected themes. Question marks
are links to Web pages describing the individual themes. In the lower-left corner of the web
page widgets are provided to zoom to a specific municipality, and to change the size of the
map area, e.g. depending on the size and resolution of the computer screen. To the right of
the main map, an index map is shown, and widgets to navigate through the main map are
provided.

Figure 12 portrays an example of a map published by MapServer. The map shows
historical landslides and inundations near Perugia, central Umbria. In the map, historical
landslides and inundations are shown by different symbols, depending on the type of event
and the source of information.

6 Conclusions

The new catalogue of historical landslide and flood events in Umbria was presented. The
catalogue spans the period from 860 to 2001 [14], and lists information on 1,983 landslide
events at 1,327 sites, and on 1,956 flood events at 972 sites. The historical information was
collected through the systematic review of the existing information on historical landslides
and floods in Umbria [2, 4, 5, 10, 12], and the systematic analysis of new information
obtained by searching national and municipality archives and public libraries [14]. Analysis
of the collected historical information allowed investigating the geographical distribution of
the affected sites, and the temporal distribution of landslide and inundation events. A Web
site designed to disseminate the available information on historical landslides and floods in
Umbria was discussed. The site exploits WebGIS technology to show the location of the
sites historically affected by landslides and inundations in Umbria. The Web site is aimed at
a diversified audience, encompassing scientists, decision makers and individual citizens
seeking information on geo-hydrological hazards in Umbria.

Abstract When users need to find something on the Web that is related to a place, chances
are place names will be submitted along with some other keywords to a search engine.
However, automatic recognition of geographic characteristics embedded in Web docu-
ments, which would allow for a better connection between documents and places, remains a
difficult
task. We propose an ontology-driven approach to facilitate the process of
recognizing, extracting, and geocoding partial or complete references to places embedded
in text. Our approach combines an extraction ontology with urban gazetteers and geocoding
techniques. This ontology, called OnLocus, is used to guide the discovery of geospatial
evidence from the contents of Web pages. We show that addresses and positioning
expressions, along with fragments such as postal codes or telephone area codes, provide
satisfactory support for local search applications, since they are able to determine
approximations to the physical location of services and activities named within Web pages.
Our experiments show the feasibility of performing automated address extraction and
geocoding to identify locations associated to Web pages. Combining location identifiers
with basic addresses improved the precision of extractions and reduced the number of false
positive results.

1 Introduction

Web pages often contain geospatial evidence such as place names, addresses, postal codes,
and phone numbers, in a semi-structured fashion. Humans are able to recognize and use
such information and attribute geographic meaning to Web pages, as part of the tedious and
time-consuming process of filtering search engine results to fulfill
their needs for
information. On the other hand, automatic recognition of geographic characteristics
embedded in Web data and documents still remains a difficult task.

People are always looking for Web pages containing useful information about everyday
tasks. Local merchants, services, and news are frequently sought [24]. The Web has the
potential to provide more efficient local information access for consumers (“find me a
nearby restaurant”) and tourists (“show me attractions located within 1,000 meters”), but
current search tools underuse its potential as a repository of geographic information [7, 27,
37]. According to Schockaert et al. [37], current local search services, such as Google
Maps1 or Yahoo! local,2 process queries against a fixed and structured list of businesses. In
spite of much evolution in the last few years, such services still are not able to perform
geographic searching over the unstructured or semi-structured contents that are usual on the
Web, thus people use search engines as an alternative. However, a sentence conveying
geographic intent submitted as a set of keywords still leads to misinterpretation. For
instance, if a user inputs “hotel far from downtown New York”, results are likely to include
New York hotels referenced in sites which contain the words “downtown” and “far”, but the
actual location of the hotels varies. Mapping, routing capabilities, and functions to locate
businesses on maps or on high-resolution satellite imagery make visualization and
interaction easier [32], but do not actually solve search limitations as to user-intended
geographic scope.

Nevertheless, when the user needs to find something on the Web that is related to a
place, chances are place names will be submitted along with some other keywords to a
search engine. Sanderson and Kohler [36] verified that about 18% of keywords submitted
as queries to the Excite search engine contained geography-related terms. In Brazil, a six
month analysis of query logs from TodoBR (a major Brazilian search engine, acquired by
Google in 2005) [13] revealed that 14.1% of queries contained at least one geography-
related term, such as the name or type of a place, a spatial relation, or a word indicating
locality. The study also showed that at least 20% of the Web pages contained one or more
easily recognizable, unambiguous geographic identifiers, such as postal addresses, and
included locally relevant content.

The recent availability and growing popularity of Web-based mapping services in
cellular phones is an example that shows the usefulness of better search tools for a local
scope [44]. Sites such as YouTube increasingly use global coordinates and place names as
part of the content selection resources, improving search by combining location references
to the well-known keyword-based approach employed by search engines. Recognizing
local geographic references embedded in Web data sources is also important
for
applications that support online social interaction, such as blogs (Blogger, Windows Live

Spaces, Twitter), friend finders (Whereyougonnabe, Reunion, Classmates), interest groups
(Buzznet, Flixster), content sharing (Flickr, YouTube), friendship networking (Orkut,
Facebook, MySpace, hi5), and many others. Increased understanding of reference context
and semantics is necessary to fulfill this growing demand [16].

This article presents an ontology-based approach that aims to recognize, extract, and
geocode geospatial evidence with local (urban) characteristics, such as street names, urban
landmarks, telephone area codes, and postal addresses. It focuses on extracting geographic
knowledge from local Web business or service pages. Our objective is to provide support to
location-based services integrating Web pages with urban locations. This meets the users’
growing demand for such services, and has vast commercial, economic, and social
applications

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work.
Section 3 discusses how geospatial evidence with local characteristics can be recognized
and extracted from Web pages. Section 4 presents OnLocus, an ontology developed to
extract geospatial evidence from Web pages. Section 5 shows results obtained from
experiments using OnLocus on Brazilian Web pages. Section 6 presents conclusions and
directions for future work.

2 Related work

Geographic aspects of the Web can be explored using two approaches [2]. The first
approach, Source Geography, uses Internet infrastructure elements to obtain information
about the physical location of hosts, which are then used as a rough approximation for the
user’s location. This approach can lead to imprecise and incorrect locations, since the user
can be connected to a remote server, and pages referring to a location can be stored in
servers located elsewhere. The Source Geography approach can also be applied in the case
of mobile users, in which the location approximation is obtained using various signal
processing and network-based techniques [45]. Using locations based on IP addresses can
be imprecise, but techniques used in mobile computing, which use GPS devices embedded
in smartphones or WiFi-based triangulation can be much more accurate.

The second approach, Target Geography, uses elements contained in the page to deduce
locations. Such elements include place names, postal addresses, and phone numbers. The
challenge for Target Geography involves evidence extraction, semantic analysis, and
interpretation, in order to link Web pages to geographic locations. Previous works [2, 20,
25, 31, 40, 48, 50] have considered using the intended meaning of terms, expressions, and
phrases in natural
language as a useful paradigm for navigating and retrieving Web
geographic information [14].

Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) is an applied research field that

involves
indexing, searching, retrieving, and browsing georeferenced information sources, and
designing systems to execute these tasks effectively and efficiently [28]. As compared with
Information Retrieval (IR), GIR assumes that some geography-related semantic information is
present, in the form of geographic metadata or by the incorporation of semantic notions about
spatial relationships and location. Like IR, GIR includes indexing, storage and ranking, but
browsing requires more sophisticated interfaces (usually Web maps). The recognition and
manipulation of place names, which can function as a special set of keywords, is also critical
for GIR. For that purpose, gazetteers (dictionaries of place names) are often used [23, 42].
Fu et al. [20] and Silva et al. [40] use geographic ontologies to obtain spatial metadata
from Web pages. Based on knowledge from the ontologies and gazetteers, seen here as

612

Geoinformatica (2011) 15:609–631

location knowledge bases, each geographic term found in the page is extracted and linked
to a spatial footprint. Footprints associated with the page are then used to build a spatial
index for a search engine. An extraction ontology [17] is defined as an instance of a
conceptual model which describes an application in a given domain of interest in terms of a
set of objects and relationships. For each set of objects represented in this ontology, there is
a description of its contents using regular expressions3 and keywords. Therefore, an
extraction ontology works as a sort of guide for the automatic creation of wrappers that
perform extraction in a specific domain of interest. When applied to Web pages, it identifies
objects and relationships, and associates them to elements of a conceptual model instance
for that domain. Using this approach, the semantic meaning of each known term can be also
recognized and extracted [17]. Martins et al. [30] use ontologies not only for the recognition
and extraction, but also for the disambiguation of references to places.

An efficient geocoding strategy must exist

Himmelstein [24] discusses the rapid growth of local search, a kind of geographically
oriented search which focuses on the immediate geographic vicinity of the user, such as the
city of neighborhood the user lives in, and explains why this subject is attractive to
commercial and research sectors. Some commercial search tools have recently started
offering geographic search capabilities. Such features allow users to locate places of interest
near a given address and navigate the corresponding Web sites. Services such as Google
Maps use Yellow Page business directories to retrieve information within a specific distance
from a location. An online local search uses addresses for efficient proximity estimation.
to generate coordinates from textual
addresses supplied by a Yellow Pages directory, or found within the text of a Web site.
The quality of geocoding varies according to the strategy that is employed [49], and in turn
the strategy depends on the quality and type of available addressing data. Such data may be
found as numbering ranges over street centerline segments (also known as street geocoding,
based on the TIGER file approach [47]), as numbers associated to land parcel centroids
[35], or as numbers associated to individual buildings [11]. The last strategy has been
developed as a response to addressing problems that are common in large cities of emerging
countries, such as Brazil, due to the common occurrence of problems such as ambiguous
street names and irregular numbering, which often rend commercial geocoding software
useless. Furthermore, geocoding can use additional information to disambiguate and to
approximate locations, such as indirect references to places (postal codes, building names,
and telephone area codes).

Our approach differs from the ones mentioned previously, since it focuses on the local
Web, i.e., pages concerning a given urban location. The approach is based on an ontology
that has been designed to facilitate the process of recognizing, extracting, and geocoding
partial or complete references to places embedded in text. It combines the extraction
ontology approach described earlier with advances on urban gazetteers [42] created from
data available on the Web and geocoding techniques [11]. This ontology, called OnLocus, is
described in Section 4.

3 Geospatial evidence in web pages

Geographic meaning can occur anywhere on a page, making geographic context
recognition a complex task. If we want to associate Web pages to places in a meaningful

employed in text processing [1, 19].

Geoinformatica (2011) 15:609–631

613

way, approximating what humans do and allowing for space-based navigation and selection
of Web pages, we must be able to recognize such evidence and associate it with locations.
This requires much effort towards understanding the semantic context of a page, and
interpreting natural language expressions found in text.

References to places in Web pages can be direct or indirect. Direct references are usually
mentions to place names, complete postal addresses, and sets of geographic coordinates.
References to place names and addresses require additional data to be locatable, i.e.,
translated into a set of coordinates. Indirect references provide means to infer an
approximate location from numeric or alphanumeric codes, such as postal codes and
telephone area codes, or from expressions that indicate relationships to other places, which
are directly referenced (for instance, “The hotel is two blocks from Times Square”). The
association between indirect references and locations can change in time, as in the case of
new postal codes. There can also be vague references, such as “South of France”, for which
no definite boundaries exist, and which vary according to individual perception [26].

Even though many works in the literature use place names as the main geospatial
evidence within a page [25, 29, 40], alternative geospatial evidence in urban areas
remains much less explored [4]. Indirect references, including postal addresses, phone
numbers, postal codes, and landmarks, can be very helpful for both the disambiguation of
references found in text, and to facilitate the determination of a geographic location
corresponding to each reference. Furthermore, indications contained in indirect references
can lead to useful approximate delineations, in an attempt to imitate human spatial
reasoning [3].

We propose a three-phase process for recognizing geographic evidence in Web pages.
The first one, extraction, is supported by extraction ontologies and aims at selecting
relevant Web content. The second phase, recognition, corresponds to isolating references to
places embedded in text and includes dealing with ambiguity. Gazetteers are used to
support the recognition phase. Finally, the location phase obtains locations from the place
descriptions previously recognized, using positioning data from gazetteers or from spatial
databases. Each of these phases will be described in greater detail in the next subsections.

3.1 Extraction

Ontologies can provide semantic support for extracting and structuring semi-structured Web
data [18]. As previously mentioned, extraction ontologies are characterized by their ability
to recognize and classify value strings, especially in semistructured natural-language text.
When applied to a document such as a Web page, an extraction ontology is able to identify
objects and relationships that are associated to object sets and relationships sets within the
conceptual model. As a result, the extraction ontology provides the necessary knowledge to
wrap the page so that it becomes understandable within the conceptualization framework it
encompasses.

Our interest lies in recognizing references to places in an urban context, as usually
required by local searching, so we must create an urban extraction ontology. Such an
ontology must describe rules for identifying elements within its domain that are present in
Web pages, from which regular expressions and keywords indicating geographic context
can be put together. Such rules must approximate the way people reason about the urban
space, and the way they recognize references to places in text. In this work, we propose an
urban place ontology as a resource to facilitate the extraction of geographic context from
Web pages. Such an ontology allows associating a (possibly approximate) location for each
geospatial evidence found, and permits recognizing and interpreting local place terms.

3.2 Recognition

Geoinformatica (2011) 15:609–631

The next phase involves the recognition of terms and expressions as place names. This can
be achieved in a few different ways. Candidate terms and expressions can be compared to a
gazetteer, a dictionary of place names. Alternatively, parsing and pattern matching
techniques can be used to recognize structured references to places, such as postal
addresses or telephone numbers.

Gazetteers such as Alexandria4 and GeoNames,5 online tools modeled after traditional
dictionaries of place names, provide information elements to recognize references to places
[21, 23]. Gazetteers manage place names in a global scale, including names of cities, rivers,
mountains and other geographic features, associating each name to a geographic footprint.
Recognizing place names with the aid of gazetteers is, however, limited by the quality and
level of detail of gazetteer data, and by problems such as place name ambiguity.

According to Fu et al. [20], current gazetteers share limitations that keep them from
being used more intensively in GIR. First, most spatial relationships are not coded in
gazetteers. Second, generic relationships between object types are normally disconsidered,
since they exceed what gazetteers are designed to achieve, but as a result the potential use
of gazetteers with geographic ontologies is limited. Furthermore, geographic feature
properties are defined using a simple representation or footprint, which usually lacks
significant geometric details. Third, gazetteers associate names with such footprints, but
lack support for fuzzy or semantically imprecise locations, such as “Southern California”
[3, 26]. Considering the importance of recognizing place names in text, such limitations
need to be addressed, and a new generation of gazetteers must be created [21], not simple
organized listings of geographic names, but as tools to provide stronger support to GIR-
related activities [50]. We add to those limitations the lack of intra-urban place names used
by urban dwellers as points of reference for location or navigation, such as streets,
neighborhoods, landmarks, references, monuments, and so on [42]. As a result, the current
use of gazetteer data to recognize references to places must be accompanied by some sort of
disambiguation technique.

Postal or street addresses can also be recognized, providing some of the most adequate
geospatial evidence for local search applications. Addresses incorporate a time-proven
system for locating a place based on a formal description. Addresses are practically
universal in urban areas and embed the idea of narrowing down the search for a given place
using a hierarchy of information items: country, state or province, city, neighborhood,
street, building number [11]. Since postal addresses are usually presented in a standardized
way, it is possible to recognize them in text from a previously determined template.

Although addresses are reasonably well-studied, especially for GIS purposes, the lack of
a universal standard for addresses still complicates their recognition [31]. Address formats
vary widely among countries, even though postal address recognition can be well
established within each country [34]. Variations in Web page address elements, such as
abbreviations, punctuation, and line breaks, complicate creating an address parser [39].
There may have some parts missing, such as the country [11, 31]. In such cases, indirect
references serve as additional evidence to determine or to infer the missing pieces. For
instance, if the address is incomplete but there is a postal code, it is possible to infer an
association to a specific part of a country. Ground line phone numbers also carry location
information implicitly, since numbering is usually organized according to geographic

5 http://www.geonames.org/

Geoinformatica (2011) 15:609–631

615

criteria. A complete telephone number identifies country code, area code, and city location.
Since most traffic is local, however, phone numbers often omit country and area codes.
Recognizing phone numbers in Web pages also requires precautions to avoid confusion
with other numeric data, such as serial numbers. Since there exists a wide variation in
number separators, such as dashes, parentheses, and blanks, a parser for phone numbers
must be flexible enough to accommodate variations.

In the absence of addresses, sometimes references to locations can be indirectly
recognized from natural language expressions that are semantically associated to place
descriptions or wayfinding instructions [6, 13]. These expressions usually relate a relatively
less-known place to another, more widely known one (a landmark of some kind), using one
of many expressions that indicate spatial proximity, containment, or coincidence. We call
such expressions positioning expressions [13], and will characterize them in greater detail
in Section 4. Working with positioning expressions is a form of qualitative spatial
reasoning, which implies the need for some tolerance as to imprecision and mismatches,
since many times there is no way to associate concepts with precise locations or geographic
objects. If that is the case, the recognition process must fall back to other evidence of spatial
location contained in the page or use such additional information to infer a more general
(therefore less precise) location from what is available.

3.3 Location

Once a reference to a place is recognized, the next step is to try to determine an actual
location, which will then be associated to the source of the reference. In the case of direct
references, we need to translate a place name or an address into a coordinate pair. This is
achieved using footprint data from a gazetteer or performing a process known as geocoding,
the determination of a location from a description, usually associated with the interpretation
of addresses. In the case of indirect references, an estimation of the location can be made
considering an interpretation of a positioning expression. Next subsections will present
location techniques for each case.

3.3.1 Location of direct references

Once a place name has been recognized and disambiguated, a simple query to a gazetteer
can return its footprint. Even though some places can be quite large spatially, usually a
single coordinate pair will be provided (for instance, New York City is at 40° 42′ 51″N
74° 0′ 21″W).

In the case of postal addresses, some form of geocoding is required. Geocoding is the
process that determines coordinates based on alphanumeric data, such as textual
descriptions. The address is initially parsed into its fundamental components, such as
street name and number, neighborhood name, city/state name, and possibly a postal code.
These elements are then used in two stages: matching and locating. In the matching stage, a
correspondence is established between the identified address and a geographic entity from
the gazetteer (such as a street, neighborhood, or city). In the locating stage, geographic
coordinates are associated with the address. The geocoding process requires the existence of
georeferenced addressing data, possibly down to point-georeferenced individual addresses
or street segments associated to numbering ranges. Results can be exact, when the extracted
address corresponds exactly to an address available in the gazetteer, or approximate, when
the location is estimated from nearby elements, such as the closest building number on the
street or the street segment whose numbering range includes the provided building number.

616

Geoinformatica (2011) 15:609–631

If neither an exact nor an approximate location can be determined, a general location can
often be established using information such as the neighborhood name, postal code, or city
limits [11].

3.3.2 Location of indirect references

Indirect references comprise indications that allow people to approximate locations, as in
the case of postal codes or telephone area codes, and expressions that indicate a location in
relation to other places. In the first case, it is necessary to establish a correspondence
between a code and the area it serves, an approach that can be directly supported by spatial
databases. In the second case, some natural language interpretation is required.

Natural language offers many different ways to indicate the location of something, for
instance, the positioning expression that indicates that “a shop” is located “at the third floor
of” “Big Mall”. Therefore, if we can determine the location of Big Mall (a direct reference
to a place), we are sure to get a good approximation of the shop’s location as well, and the
mall’s address is more widely known. Since indirect references embed a direct reference to
a place,
the techniques presented in the previous section apply. We will cover here
techniques that allow the estimation or approximation of a location based on expressions
that indicate spatial location, i.e. positioning expressions.

A positioning expression is a natural language expression formed by the connection of
two components—a subject and a landmark—using a third component—an expression that
denotes a spatial relation. Therefore, a positioning expression is a triple <S, SR, L>, where
S is the subject, SR is the spatial relation, and L is the landmark. The subject is an entity,
usually a place (‘someone’s house’, ‘a bus stop’, ‘a tourist attraction’), event (‘a burglary’,
‘a public gathering’), or product (‘pizza’,
‘tyres’)—whose approximate location of
occurrence is textually described by a positioning expression. The spatial relation is a
natural language expression that indicates the spatial connection between the subject and
the landmark.6 The landmark is represented in text by a place name, thereby corresponding
to a direct reference to a place.

The interpretation of positioning expressions is based on the cognitive meaning of
landmarks in human spatial orientation. In a previous study [13], we distinguished between
two main groups of expressions that indicate spatial location: expressions that denote
spatial containment or coincidence (for instance, in front of, beside, next to, inside), and
expressions that indicate proximity (for instance, close to, a few minutes from, within
walking distance). In the case of containment and coincidence, a location can be determined
from the landmark’s position. In the case of proximity, determining an actual location is
more difficult, but the immediate vicinity of the landmark would serve as a rough first
approximation. From experiments performed on four million pages from the Brazilian Web,
we have been able to establish an approximate distance that corresponds to each expression
that indicates proximity [13]. We realized that some expressions convey spatial proximity
more emphatically than others. However, regardless of the exact distance,
there is a
semantic equivalence between such expressions, around the concept of proximity.

6 Previous works [15] have precisely characterized spatial relations using point-set and other mathematical
concepts, and named each resulting relation. While these names are traditional in the GIS community, not
everybody uses them in natural language, and their interpretation remains ambiguous for our purposes.

4 OnLocus: an extraction ontology of urban places

Based on the needs for the extraction, recognition, and location of geographic evidence
from text, we propose OnLocus, an ontology of urban places. OnLocus provides a
hierarchical and semantic location structure on urban geographic spaces and their
associations, and therefore can be classified as both a geographic and an extraction
ontology [17] and is domain dependent [8]. It
is a geographic ontology because it
semantically describes concepts related to urban location; it is domain dependent because it
defines a group of concepts that are commonly found in most urban communities.
Furthermore, according to the classification proposed by Spaccapietra et al. [43], OnLocus
includes two ontology types: taxonomic and descriptive. The taxonomic ontology is called
“space taxonomic ontology”, because it explores the hierarchical structure of urban space.
The descriptive ontology considers reference points and various forms of place descriptions
meaningful to the local community. Figure 1 presents a schematic and simplified version of
OnLocus, included here to provide an overview of the ontology. The notation used in the
presentation of OnLocus is described in Fig. 2. Concepts are represented by rectangles and
relationships by lines. To improve semantic representation, some graphic primitives were
introduced to establish a distinction among different types of relationship. A more formal
and thorough encoding of the ontology has been developed using Protégé,7 but we will
refrain from showing it directly due to space limitations.

Place is the main concept of OnLocus. Every instance of Place can be referenced using
a description, which OnLocus defines as a place descriptor. Place descriptors include
addresses, place names, and positioning expressions. Places are specialized into Territorial
Division and Landmark. Each of these concepts is further specialized, as described next.

4.1 Place

The Place concept represents space descriptions related to locations, which can be
identified, or referred to, in various ways. A place is usually represented in a Geographic
Information System (GIS) by its geometry and topology, but for OnLocus it is a concept
includes a cognitive aspect, reflecting how people think geographically and use
that
geographic information in a daily basis. This decision reflects our observation that people
often refer to places in regular speech using approximate references and connections to
more widely-know places, as in the expressions “near the airport”, “down the road from the
conventions center”, or “in the region of the monument”. Such place descriptors are not
recognizable by regular GIS functions or queries, but are very important in the context of
geographic information retrieval.

Each instance of Place is associated to its spatial representation. This representation uses
geometric concepts usually associated to GIS, such as points, lines, and polygons. Line and
polygon geometry can be approximated through the use of minimum bounding rectangles
(MBR). Places are generalizations of descriptions from two other concepts: territorial
divisions and landmarks (Fig. 1).

4.2 Territorial division

OnLocus defines a Territorial Division when an area is recursively subdivided into a set of
smaller ones. The territorial division hierarchy is reflected in the mereologic relationships

among concepts it embodies, such as city, state, area, and country. The concept of territorial
division is related to all kinds of subdivision of space into regions. Such divisions are
commonly used in political and administrative divisions, such as countries, states, and
municipalities, and therefore are usually hierarchical. Figure 3 presents an instance of this
concept for Brazil, showing subdivisions of a country’s territory arranged as a hierarchy.
The finest granularity included in OnLocus corresponds to subdivisions of the urban space.
Notice that, along with divisions that are based on political boundaries, others are defined
by more practical and operational concerns, such as postal code areas and telephone code
areas. In fact, many other kinds of divisions can exist, based on physical characteristics (for
instance, watersheds or terrain slope ranges) or on other kinds of classification (such as
vegetation or soil type). For the sake of clarity, and for keeping up with the objectives of
this article, we will restrict ourselves to divisions that can be relevant for urban applications.

4.3 Landmark

A landmark represents a specific place, such as an urban or environmental point of
reference, which is known by enough people, so that it can be used for spatial orientation.
In OnLocus, this concept comprehends several other types of places that are used as a
reference for spatial navigation or orientation, such as tourist attractions, parks, or
museums. Figure 4 presents several concepts associated to urban places. Landmarks are
specialized beyond the concepts presented in the figure. For instance, a “reference building”
can be a school, hospital, or temple, while a “culture and leisure” landmark can be a
museum, theater or park. This kind of definition is extensively detailed in other ontologies,
such as OpenCyc8 and SUMO,9 as well as in gazetteers such as TGN,10 and can be reused
by OnLocus. However, there are cases in which concept reuse is not entirely possible, due
to differences in hierarchical position and to the use of concepts in the extraction ontology
that characterizes OnLocus and differentiates it from the mentioned ontologies.

4.4 Place descriptor

The concept of place descriptor defines the various ways people use to refer to a place.
Places are most often recognized by their descriptors, which correspond to an address, a
toponym or place name, or a positioning expression. A place can be referred to by more

than one descriptor; for instance, a tourist attraction can be recognized by name (The White
House), but it can also have a corresponding address (1600 Pennsylvania Ave., Washington
DC), and can be located using a positioning expression (close to The Mall). Figure 1
schematically presents place descriptors and their specializations. OnLocus associates each
of the place descriptor types to specifications, such as patterns and regular expressions, that
will be used to recognize references to places in Web pages. The next subsections will
present each specialization of place descriptors in more detail.

4.4.1 Address

In OnLocus, the address concept includes several elements, which vary according to the
purpose for which the address is used and to the place to which the address is associated.
OnLocus divides addresses into three parts: Basic Address, Complement, and Location
Identifiers (Fig. 5). The complement is the set of additional addressing information beyond
the street name and number, including elements such as apartment number, neighborhood
name, suite number and others. OnLocus considers phone numbers as part of the addressing
components. Phone numbers, especially area codes, are instrumental in determining an
approximate location and in resolving ambiguities.

Addresses can be complete, incomplete, or partial. A complete address includes all
components generally associated to postal delivery, such as thoroughfare identification,
building number, complement, city, state, and postal code. Depending on the elements that
are missing, incomplete addresses can be ambiguous, since the same street name can occur
in different cities, or imprecise, since existing elements can be insufficient to allow for an
exact placement. Resolving such ambiguity requires some indication of context, such as a
phone number with area code, leading to a unique place [11, 12]. A partial address includes
only location identifiers, with which only approximate locations can be determined.

Language and local culture must be observed in address recognition. Even though
addresses are used worldwide and are formed of essentially the same components, the
sequence in which these components appear varies among countries (Fig. 5). The parser
must correctly identify the order of address components for extraction [11]. OnLocus may
contain versions adapted to any possible address variation.

Figure 6 shows an example of the expressions that are included in OnLocus as a
resource for recognizing addresses. The expressions are shown in EBNF (Extended
Backus-Naur Form) [38], and present a translated and adapted version of a Brazilian-type
basic address, following the structure presented in Fig. 5. In the first definition, ADDRESS,
“BR” refers to the prefix assigned to all federal highways in the country. In STREET_TYPE,
the idea is to record all possible alternatives of thoroughfare types and their abbreviations,
including capitalization variations. PREP and S1 act as separator stopwords, the first one
corresponding to common prepositions that are included in street names that are composed
of more than a single word (for instance, “Avenue of the Americas”). IDENT and N are
respectively address and number prefixes.

4.4.2 Place name (toponym)

The toponym concept represents the names people give to places. A place can be known by
several different names and is, therefore, subject to ambiguity. Likewise, the same name can
be associated to many different places. In Fig. 1 the association of multiple names to a
place, and of multiple places to a single name, are indicated by recursive relationships.

The extraction of place names is not usually performed using simple regular expressions,
because of the need to disambiguate and to distinguish between place names and other
words. This is done with the help of gazetteers, although most gazetteers do not include
disambiguation tools or information resources, as discussed in Section 2. For that purpose,
we used information from Locus [42], a non-conventional gazetteer developed by our group
that includes intra-urban names and indirect references, to recognize references to places in
text. We are currently enhancing Locus in order to achieve better results in place name
disambiguation for GIR. For the experiments presented here, most place names were

derived from either positioning expressions (as described in the next section) or from postal
addresses. As we will show in the next sections, it is easier and more efficient to use
indirect or structured references such as addresses as unambiguous references to places, but
recognizing place names as such within natural language text remains an important task.

4.4.3 Positioning expression

A positioning expression is a semantic construction in natural language that is frequently
used by people to indicate or to approximate the location of something in relation to some
other place whose location is more widely known. A positioning expression is defined as a
pair <spatial relationship, place name> [13] e.g., <close to, Big Mall>.

Some natural

language expressions that denote spatial relationships are listed in
Section 3.3.2. Table 1 presents some of the most popular positioning expressions in
Portuguese, as found in the Brazilian Web [13], along with their meaning in English.
Figure 7 presents an example of a pattern for a positioning expression, once again translated
and adapted from Portuguese. The example has been formulated from a regular expression,
which is included in OnLocus.

4.5 Relationships

OnLocus considers predefined binary relationships, both conventional and spatial.
Conventional relationships occur between concepts and between properties. Specialization
is a conventional relationship used to create a hierarchy in which generic concepts are
specialized into more specific concepts [41, 46]. Aggregation is a relationship used to
indicate the composition of a concept from a set of properties. It is usually denoted as a
“part-of” relationship, meaning that the more general concept includes all properties of the
more specific concepts. Precedence is a structural constraint between properties in an
aggregation. It defines a standard sequence for the properties, in order to group them
according to an expected set of rules. The resulting sequence causes a concept to be
recognized by its properties. For instance,
is expected that
thoroughfare types come first, then a thoroughfare name, and then a building number. For
U.S. addresses, the correct order would be the building number, then the thoroughfare
name, then the thoroughfare type. Dependency is a relationship that is characterized by an
“instance-of” association, which happens when the value of a property is an instance of
another property. For instance, in Fig. 1 the spatial representation property of the place

in Brazilian addresses it

concept can include instances of the concept geometry. Generic relationships represent
associations between instances of different concepts. A generic relationship is usually
expressed by a verb, chosen according to the semantics of the relationship. For instance, a
place “has” a place descriptor.

Spatial relationships occur only between concepts and belong to three basic types:
topological, “whole-part”, and location. Clementini et al. [10] present five distinct
topological relationships, which occur between point,
line, and polygon geographic
objects. For the purposes of this work, the formal definition of topological relationships is
not as important as the meaning people assign to expressions that denote such relationships
in natural language. The five basic topologic relationship types are touch, in, overlap, cross,
and disjoint. We also define adjacent to and coincide with. These relationships are basically
equivalent to the ones defined by Egenhofer and Franzosa [15] using the 4- and 9-
intersection matrixes. Observe that, even though the relationships receive names that
correspond approximately to their meaning in natural language, people use many other
terms that refer to the same relationships. For that reason, OnLocus does not use the disjoint
relationship. Furthermore, the coincide with relationship is used whenever the same spatial
subdivision is used as a reference for two or more concepts and the adjacent to relationship
is used with planar subdivisions [5], in order to characterize a variation of the touch
relationship. Directional relationships (i.e., to the North of, West of) [22] also fit this
category, with a similar treatment. We will not expand on directional relationships here due
to space limitations.

“Whole-part” relationships are mereologic relationships between concepts. A concept
denoted as Cj is part-of a concept Ci, if Ci has Cj as one of its parts or if Cj is a part-of Ci
such that Cj (cid:1) Ci. Our approach to location relationships is inspired by the work of [9],
who propose the classification of terms into spatially unstructured (e.g. containing indirect
references to places) and spatially structured (e.g., which use unmistakable references to
positions, such as coordinates). In our approach, a location relationship can represent three
types of location: exact, approximate, and generic. Such relationships imply that the
position of an object can be determined relatively to the position of another one, whose
location is a binary relationship usually defined
location is previously known. Exact

624

Geoinformatica (2011) 15:609–631

between geographic objects and known spatial
regions (usually polygon objects).
Approximate location is a binary relationship between geographic objects, in which the
position of an object is approximately determined from the position of another. Generic
location is a binary relationship between spatial objects and space subdivision hierarchies.
When obtaining the exact position is not possible, a generic location is attempted, in order
to determine that a spatial object is located “somewhere” inside a region. In generic
locations there is no assurance of precise location, just the establishment of a relationship
between an object and the region.

4.6 Using OnLocus for the extraction of geographic evidence

Figure 8 presents the main steps of a process for recognition, extraction and geocoding of
geographic evidence from Web pages based on OnLocus. Initially, Web pages are collected
and pre-processed, applying the usual cleanup procedures used in information retrieval,
such as normalization of the set of HTML delimiters, removal of consecutive spaces and
removal of accent marks. After collection and pre-processing, the pages move on to the
recognition and extraction of potential geospatial references, such as addresses, postal
codes, and phone numbers. From the definitions and structure of OnLocus, as presented in
the previous subsections, we specified a number of patterns for the recognition of
geographic evidence from text. Patterns for the recognition of basic addresses, postal codes,

extraction

Geoinformatica (2011) 15:609–631

625

city names, states, and telephone numbers were created using EBNF, as shown in Figs. 6
and 7. Each of these patterns was transformed into a regular expression, which were then
implemented as a Perl script.

As a result of the process, a repository of places is formed. This repository contains, for
each extracted and validated evidence, the URL in which it was found, the pattern used in
the extraction, the extracted terms, the initial and final position of the terms on the page, the
city and state names, a set of geographic coordinates corresponding to the minimum
bounding rectangle (MBR) of the city’s limits, and, if possible, the geographic coordinates
associated to the address.

5 Experimental evaluation

The OnLocus ontology has been employed in several experiments of data extraction from
Web pages, using the WBR05 collection, comprising over 4 million pages from the
Brazilian Web, crawled in March 2005 [33]. This collection is representative of the
Brazilian Web.

Our experiments were designed to determine the efficiency of the retrieval of positions
from addresses embedded in Web pages. Initially, 17 different address patterns were used,
in order to verify which ones would be more useful for retrieval. Each pattern corresponds
to a possible combination of address components in which addresses are usually found in
text. Six of the patterns stood out in the results from this preliminary evaluation [6], based
on their extraction capabilities: PhoneNumber, BasicAddress + CityState + PostalCode,
BasicAddress + PhoneNumber, BasicAddress + CityState, BasicAddress + PostalCode, and
PostalCode. The good performance of these patterns can be explained by the fact that they
correspond to the more usual and conventional ways in which addresses appear in text, a
kind of knowledge that has been included in OnLocus. We also used information from the
Locus non-conventional gazetteer [42] to recognize references to places in text.

These patterns were used over the WBR05 collection. Matches were recognized in
603,798 pages, or 14.8% of the number of pages in the collection, thus confirming previous
results [24, 31]. We recognized 2,137,601 occurrences of the patterns, over 3.5 occurrences
per page. Table 2 shows the distribution of matches among the patterns. Notice that
PhoneNumber accounted for more than half of the matches, and was found in most of the
pages. Most addresses include either the city and state, or the postal code, but only a few
include both. PostalCode was also a frequently found pattern, accounting for almost a
quarter of the occurrences.

We geocoded the patterns we were able to extract, using processes and algorithms
described in more detail by Davis Jr. and Fonseca [11], in order to establish how good a
location we can expect to obtain.

In order to verify the automatic results shown in Table 2, we randomly selected 385
extractions for each pattern for manual inspection. The inspection of the geocoding results
showed that, for the patterns including a phone number, failures resulted from outdated
numbers, with a wrong area code or presented in an unusual format. In patterns including
city/state most problems were in the recognition of the city name. The main issues include
(1) lack of a separator between a neighborhood name and the city name; (2) cities that have
the same name as the state they are in; (3) landmark names used where a city name was
expected; (4) abbreviations in the city name. Overall, from the 2,310 extractions (6 patterns
times 385 pages per pattern) manually inspected, 80% were found to be correct, and were
correctly geocoded. Table 3 details the results for each pattern. The worst performance

occurred in the BasicAddress + CityState pattern, in which the extraction pattern captured
many other groups of words with the same layout, but different meaning. Many mistakes
occurred in the geocoding, although the extraction was correct, showing that the geocoder’s
performance is dependent on the quality of the contents of reference tables for streets and
addresses [11].

Table 4 shows the results of city-level geocoding based on three components of the
recognition patterns: PhoneNumber, PostalCode, and CityState. Results show that the
PostalCode provided the most effective way to obtain approximate locations, with over
97% of success. Phone numbers are also a good indication, with a geocoding success rate
of about 80% (the remaining 20% lack the area code, so they are potentially ambiguous
with phone numbers from elsewhere). Success in recognizing CityState was the lowest.
This can be explained by the fact that this component offers more possibilities for format
variation and misspellings, therefore leading to pattern matching errors. In the pattern in
which both PostalCode and CityState are available, using the postal code also led to better
results.

Notice also that geocoding was more successful in the cases in which basic address data
are available. This can be explained by the fact
that addresses provide additional
disambiguation information. Of course, obtaining a more precise location requires
interpreting the elements that form the BasicAddress component. Since the city is

successfully determined in most of the cases, the possibility of ambiguity in geocoding gets
much lower.

The presence of a postal code suggests the existence of a complete postal address
somewhere else in the page. However, the recognition of postal codes was more successful
than the recognition of the pattern BasicAddress + PostalCode (22% vs. 11%, see Table 2).
This difference shows how hard it is to correctly recognize postal addresses, and indicates
that exploring indirect references such as the postal code or the phone number can lead to
more successful results. However, finding a postal code after a basic address allows us to
avoid confusion with other numerical data presented in a similar format.

6 Conclusions and future work

This paper focused on the local Web and presented an approach based on an ontology of
urban places that allows recognition, extraction, and geocoding of geospatial evidence with
local characteristics. It presented a method to identify the most common patterns for address
extraction and a minimal set of patterns for the extraction of Brazilian addresses was
obtained and validated experimentally using a collection of over 4 million Web pages. We
described experiments evaluating the presence and incidence of urban addresses and
positioning expressions in Web pages. Addresses and positioning expressions provided
satisfactory support for local search applications, since they represented the physical
location of services and activities found in Web pages, and because of the high success rate
achieved in geocoding.

One of the main goals of geospatial evidence recognition is to allow the creation of
mechanisms which enable search engines to perform local and proximity searches, without
resorting to yellow page directories. The experiments presented here showed the feasibility
of performing automated address extraction and geocoding to identify locations associated
to Web pages. The combination of location identifiers with basic addresses improved the
precision of extractions and reduced the number of false positive results.

Results indicate that, in many cases, we were able to obtain geographic references from
Web pages that refer to intra-urban locations. Finding a relationship between a page and a
city, or cities, is currently more efficient, which indicates that substantial improvements can
derive from better and more generic ways to recognize and geocode addresses presented in
irregular formats, as well as from better disambiguation techniques. We were able to benefit
from the non-conventional features of Locus [42], a gazetteer that includes intra-urban

628

Geoinformatica (2011) 15:609–631

names and indirect references. Locus is currently evolving, in order to include additional
disambiguation information and to expand inference possibilities based on spatial
relationships.

The results presented in this article open perspectives for new types of useful
applications which can simplify, improve, and enhance local Web searches. Future work
includes expanding search engine queries using OnLocus to determine semantically-
equivalent positioning expressions or related places, and developing new ways to navigate
between pages considering their geographical relationships to the same or similar places.
We are also considering the use of semantic annotations to indicate relationships between
pages and places.

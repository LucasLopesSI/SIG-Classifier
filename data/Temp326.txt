Abstract. The weights-of-evidence model (a Bayesian probability model) was
applied to the task of evaluating landslide susceptibility using GIS. Using land-
slide location and a spatial database containing information such as topography,
soil, forest, geology, land cover and lineament, the weights-of-evidence model
was applied to calculate each relevant factor’s rating for the Boun area in Korea,
which had suffered substantial landslide damage following heavy rain in 1998. In
the topographic database, the factors were slope, aspect and curvature; in the
soil database, they were soil texture, soil material, soil drainage, soil effective
thickness and topographic type; in the forest map, they were forest type, timber
diameter,
lithology was derived from the
geological database;
land-use information came from Landsat TM satellite
imagery; and lineament data from IRS satellite imagery. Tests of conditional
independence were performed for
factors, allowing 43
combinations of factors to be analysed. For the analysis of mapping landslide
susceptibility, the contrast values, Wz and W 2, of each factor’s rating were
overlaid spatially. The results of the analysis were validated using the previous
landslide locations. The combination of slope, curvature, topography, timber
diameter, geology and lineament showed the best results. The results can be used
for hazard prevention and land-use planning.

Introduction
In Korea, frequent landslides often result in signiﬁcant damage to people and
property, most recently in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2002. In the study area, Boun in
Korea, much damage was caused on these occasions. Therefore, to mitigate any
damage arising from landslides, it is necessary to assess scientiﬁcally susceptible
areas. Thus, the study aims to carry out landslide susceptibility analysis by applying
the weights-of-evidence method with validation of results. As a basic analysis tool,
a Geographic Information System (GIS) was used for spatial and data management
and manipulation.

There have been many studies of landslide hazard evaluation using GIS.
Guzzetti et al. (1999) summarized many landslide hazard evaluation studies.
Recently, there have been studies for landslide hazard evaluation using GIS, e.g.

Randall (2000) and Rece and Capolongo (2002) have applied probabilistic and
statistical methods to landslide hazard mapping. In the present study, landslide
hazard was evaluated using GIS based on the weights-of-evidence model. The
model was originally developed for mineral potential assessment (Agterberg et al.
1990, 1993, Bonham-Carter et al. 1988, 1989, Bonham-Carter 1994, Alok and Hale
2000, Emmanuel et al. 2000, Harris et al. 2000, Venkataraman et al. 2000, Asadi
and Hale 2001). The difference in the present study is the application of the
GIS-based weights-of-evidence method to landslide susceptibility mapping.

The Boun study area experienced substantial landslide damage following heavy
rainfall
in 1998 and was selected as a suitable case in which to evaluate the
frequency and distribution of landslides (ﬁgure 1). The site lies between the latitudes
36‡25’21’N and 36‡30’00’N, and longitudes 127‡39’36’E and 127‡45’00’E, and it
covers an area of 68.43 km2. The bedrock geology of the study area consists mainly
of biotite granite. In the study area, the landslides were mainly soil slides occurring
where the maximum daily rainfall exceeded about 400 mm.

2. Data and methodology

For the landslide-hazard analysis, the main steps were data collection and
construction of a spatial database from which the relevant factors were extracted,
followed by assessment of the landslide hazard using the relationship between
landslide and landslide-related factors, and validation of
the results. A key
assumption of this approach is that the potential (occurrence possibility) of
landslides will be comparable with the actual frequency of landslides. Landslide
occurrence areas were detected in the Boun area by interpretation of aerial
photographs and ﬁeld surveys. A map of recent landslides was developed from
1:20 000 scale aerial photographs, and this was used to evaluate the frequency and
distribution of shallow landslides in the area. Topography, soil, forest, geology,
land cover and lineament databases were constructed for the analysis (table 1).
Maps relevant to landslide occurrence were constructed from a vector type spatial
database using ARC/INFO GIS software. These included 1:5000 scale topographic
maps, 1:25 000-scale soil maps, 1:25 000-scale forest maps and 1:50 000-scale
geological maps. A digital elevation model
(DEM) was created using the
topographic database. Slope, aspect and curvature, which are relevant to the
landslide analysis, were calculated from the DEM. Soil texture, soil material, soil
drainage, soil effective thickness and topographic type were extracted from the soil
database. Forest type, timber diameter, timber age and forest density were extracted
from the forest map. Lithology was extracted from the geological database. The
land-use data was classiﬁed from Landsat TM imagery with 30630 m resolution.
The lineament was detected from IRS imagery with 565 m resolution, using the
expertise of a structural geologist, and distance from lineament was calculated by
buffering. Using the detected landslide locations and the constructed spatial
database,
landslide analysis methods were applied and validated. For this, the
calculated and extracted factors were mapped to a 565 m grid in ARC/INFO

GRID format. Next, using the weights-of-evidence method, spatial relationships
between the landslide location and each of the landslide-related factors, such as
topography, soil, forest, geology, land cover and distance from lineament, were
analysed. The spatial relationships were used as each factor’s rating in the overlay
analysis. Subsequently, tests of conditional independence were performed for the

selection of the factors to be used in landslide susceptibility mapping. The factors’
ratings were summed to calculate a landslide hazard index, and landslide
susceptibility was mapped for 43 combinations of the factors. Finally, the results
of a comparison of the 43 different combinations were validated using previous
landslide locations.

3. Theory
3.1. Weights-of-evidence model

The following formulation of the Bayesian probability model, known as the
weights-of-evidence model, was applied to landslide susceptibility analysis as
synthesized from Bonham-Carter et al.
(1994) and
Emmanuel et al. (2000). For a given number of cells, N{D}, containing an
occurrence, D and the total number of cells in the study area, N{T} (ﬁgure 2), the
prior probability of an occurrence is expressed by

Suppose that a binary predictor pattern, B, occupying N{B} cells, occurs in
the region, and that a number of known landslides occur preferentially within
the pattern, i.e. N{D>B}, then the favourability of locating an occurrence given the
presence of a predictor and the absence of a pattern can be expressed by the

The posterior probability of an occurrence given the presence and absence of the
predictor pattern is denoted by P{D|B} and P{D|B¯ }, respectively; and P{B|D} and
P{B¯ |D} are the posterior probabilities of being inside and outside the predictor
pattern B, respectively, given the presence of an occurrence D. Also, P{B}and P{B¯ }
are the prior probabilities of being inside and outside the predictor pattern. The
same model can be expressed in an odds-type formulation, where the odds, O, are
deﬁned as O~P/(12P). Expressed as odds, equations (2) and (3), respectively,
become:

where O{D|B} and O{D|B¯ } are the posterior odds of an occurrence, given the
presence and absence of a binary predictor pattern, respectively, and O{D} represents
the prior odds of an occurrence. The weights for the binary predictor pattern are
deﬁned as:

where Wz and W 2 are the weights-of-evidence when a binary predictor pattern is
present and absent, respectively. Hence,

Suppose that there are two binary predictor patterns, B1 and B2. It can be
shown that the posterior probability of an occurrence, given the presence of the
two-predictor patterns, is:

If B1 and B2 are conditionally independent of each other with respect to a set of
occurrences, then it indicates that the following relation is satisﬁed:

Similarly, if more than two binary predictor patterns are used, they can be added,
provided that they are also conditionally independent of one another with respect
to the occurrences. Thus, with Bj (j~1, 2, ..., n) binary predictor patterns, the loge

where the superscript k is positive (z) or negative (2) depending on whether the
binary predictor pattern is present or absent, respectively. The posterior odds can
be converted to posterior probabilities, based on the relationship P~O/(1zO), to
represent the favourability of locating an occurrence. Equation (13) deﬁnes the
relationship for two binary patterns, B1 and B2, that are conditionally independent
of each other with respect to a set of points. Algebraic manipulation shows that
equation (13) is equivalent to:

N B1\B2\D

The left side of equation (14) is the observed number of occurrences in the overlap
zone of B1 and B2. The right side is the predicted number of occurrences in this
overlap zone. This relationship leads to a contingency table calculation for the
pair-wise testing of conditional independence.

3.2. Test of conditional independence

In the application of probability and statistical methods, many cases are solved
under the assumption that the population has a normal distribution. Even if the
distribution of the population is unknown, the population is set to a normal
distribution. Hence, there may be errors, and to solve this problem, non-parametric
statistics can be used. The statistics are not based on a speciﬁc assumption of the
population or a sample having a normal distribution. When using non-parametric
statistics, there is a method for testing dependence using x2 (chi-square). The
method can be applied using a contingency table with a table, r6c, having r rows
for certain classiﬁcation criteria and c columns for other classiﬁcation criteria
(table 2).

For a test of independence, in the ﬁrst instance, the new contingency table must
be made under the assumption that the two classiﬁcation criteria are independent.
Next the expected frequencies, fe, and observed frequencies, fo, must be compared.
In comparison, the x2 value, a goodness of ﬁt statistic, is deﬁned as in equation (15):

the degree of freedom is deﬁned as equation (16). The critical value can be

ð
fe, for each item are greater than observed frequencies, fo. That is, when the
expected frequencies, fe, for each item is greater than ﬁve for each item, hypothesis
testing can be done using the x2 test. This is called the ‘rule of ﬁve’ (Bowerman and
O’Connell 1997). If the condition is not satisﬁed, the number of samples must be
increased, or items that have expected frequencies under ﬁve must be integrated.
However, if the items are integrated, because the degree of freedom about x2 is
decreased, the effectiveness of the test is decreased.

4. Calculation and interpretation of weights-of-evidence

Knowledge of the landslide susceptibility in the study area suggested 15 binary
predictor patterns of topographic, soil, forest, geologic, land cover and lineament
features that were likely to be useful evidence for predicting landslide susceptibility.
For each of the landslide-related factors, the weights and contrast were calculated
using the weights-of-evidence method (tables 3–6). The total number of pixels in the
study area was 2 735 776, and the total number of landslide occurrences was 483.
The magnitude of the contrast, C, was determined from the difference, Wz and
W 2, and provided a measure of the spatial association between a set of points and
the patterns. C is positive for a positive spatial association, and negative for a
negative spatial association. The scientiﬁc basis for this is that if more points occur
within a pattern than would be expected by chance, then Wz is positive and W 2 is
negative. Conversely, W 2 is negative and Wz is positive for the situation where
fewer points occur within a pattern than would be expected by chance (Bonham-
Carter et al. 1989). In the tables, the ratio (Wz) is expressed as per cent occurrence/
per cent domain, and C is the contrast. The S2(Wz) and S2(W 2) are variances of
Wz and W 2 and S(C ) is the standard deviation of the contrast. The studentized

value of C, calculated as the ratio of C to its standard deviation, C/S(C), serves as a
guide to the signiﬁcance of the spatial association, and acts as a measure of the
relative certainty of the posterior probability (Bonham-Carter 1994). The standard
deviation of C is calculated as

The relationship between landslide and landslide-related factors is as follows.
In the case of slope (table 3), the steeper the slope, the greater the landslide
probability. For example, below 6‡, the contrast is lower than 21.851, indicating a
very low contrast, and above 31‡, the contrast is greater than 1.183, indicating a
very high probability. It means the landslide probability increases with slope angle.
This may be attributed to that as the slope angle increases, shear stress in the soil or
other unconsolidated material generally increases as well. In the case of aspect
(table 3), the contrast was highest on north-west-facing and north-east-facing hill
slopes, and contrast was lowest on south-facing and south-west-facing hill slopes.
Thus, slopes facing the north-east are highly susceptible to landslides. Curvatures
represent the morphology of topography. A positive curvature indicates that the
surface is upwardly convex at that cell and a negative curvature indicates that the
surface is upwardly concave at that cell. A value of zero indicates that the surface is
ﬂat. In the case of curvature (table 3), the more negative (concave) the value, the
higher the contrast. A ﬂat area has a very low value. The reason is that, following
heavy rainfall, an upwardly concave slope has more water and retains it longer.
According to topographic type (table 3), the contrast value is high in mountainous,
hilly areas, and low in ﬂat areas. In the case of soil texture (table 4), the contrast
value is higher in rocky, sandy loam and sandy loam, and is lower in silt loam. It is
considered that this it is related to soil grain size. When there is heavy rain, if the
grain size is greater, in which case there is more space between the grains, the soil
can contain more water. In the case of drainage (table 4), the contrast value is
higher if the drainage is excessive, and is low if the drainage is poor. When there is
heavy rain, the less drainage there is to control the water ﬂow, the less water
inﬁltration into the soil. For this reason, the landslide probability is lower. In the
case of material (table 4), the contrast value is higher in granite residuum, and is
lower in ﬂuvial alluvium, diluvium and colluviums. The result is related to the
topography and the geology, and the probability value for colluvium is low because
the colluvium has already collapsed. In the case of effective thickness (table 4), the
contrast value is higher with increasing thickness. When the soil is thicker, there is a
higher possibility of landslide. The relationship with forest factors such as type, age,
diameter, and density are as follows. In the case of forest type (table 5), the contrast
value is higher in needle-leaf trees, such as Rigida pine and Korea nut pine, and is
lower in broad-leaf trees, such as artiﬁcial broad-leaf tree and broad-leaf tree. The
reason is that the root system of broad-leaf trees is more widespread than for
needle-leaf trees. In the case of timber diameter (table 5), the contrast value is lower
for very small diameter and is higher for medium diameter. In the case of timber
age (table 5), the contrast value is lower in younger timber and is higher in older
timber except 1st age. In the case of forest density (table 5), the landslide-occurrence
probability value is higher on decreasing density. In the case of lithology (table 6),

805

the contrast value is higher in the Jugjeonri two-mica adamellite areas, and is lower
in pebble-bearing argillaceous and calcareous schist limestone with a dolomite base,
except in alluvium areas. Because of the small area and the fact that a 1:50 000 scale
geological map was used, there is not much variation in lithology in the study area,
so more data are needed. In the case of lineament distance (table 6), the closer the
lineament, the greater the contrast value. This means that the landslide probability
decreases according to distance from lineament. As the distance from lineament
decreases, the fracture of the rock increases and degree of weathering increases. In
the case of land cover (table 6), the contrast value is higher in forest and grass areas
and lower for other land covers. The reason is simply because the landslides
occurred mainly on inclined and mountainous areas.

5. Pair-wise test of conditional independence

The conditional independence was tested before the integration of the predictor
patterns to map the landslide susceptibility. All the pairs of binary predictor
patterns were tested, and a x2 table for testing conditional independence is shown in
table 7. The x2 values for testing the conditional independence between all pairs of
binary patterns for each factor were calculated at the 99% signiﬁcance level and 1
degree of freedom. If the x2 value in the contingency table is below 6.63, the pair of
binary predictor patterns is independent. An example, using the contingency table
to test the conditional independence between the binary patterns of slope (Factor 1)
and binary patterns of the others (Factor 2), is shown in table 8. It can be seen that
the pairs of slope and aspect show a conditional independence, because the x2 is
0.0641 (slope present 0.0516zslope absent 0.0125) relative to the criterion that the
x2 value is 6.63 at the 99% signiﬁcance level. This implies that these binary predictor
patterns could be used together to map the landslide susceptibility. However, the
pairs of slope and material show conditional dependence, because the x2 value is
7.9449 (slope present, 6.3987zslope absent, 1.5462) relative to the criterion of x2
value of 6.63 at the 99% signiﬁcance level. This implies that these binary predictor
patterns could not be used together to map the landslide susceptibility.

6. Data integration and validation for landslide susceptibility mapping

Using the weights-of-evidence method, the spatial relationship and the contrast
value between landslide-occurrence location and each landslide-related factor was
derived. The contrast was set to the rating of each factor, because the contrast is
related to the landslide occurrence probability. Then the contrast of each factor’s
type or range (from tables 3–6) were summed to calculate the landslide susceptibility
index, as shown in equation (18):

LSIc~ X

Fc,

ð18Þ

where Fc is the contrast of each factor’s range or type.

Also, the binary predictor patterns were assigned weights (from tables 3 and 6)

and integrated according to equation (19):

LSIw~ X
where Fw~Wz and W 2 of the binary pattern of each factor’s range or type.

Fw,

ð19Þ

To generate the binary predictor pattern of the 15 factors, the spatial database
was reclassiﬁed into a binary pattern as ‘favourable’ and the other formations as
‘non-favourable’. To generate the binary predictor patterns of each factor, we had

to determine the rating or range for which the spatial association between the
landslide occurrences and each factor is optimal. The optimum cut-off for the
binary pattern was determined by calculating the C/S(C), studentized value of
contrast. Then, the Wz and W 2 values were used as ratings for each factor. As an
example, table 3 depicts the spatial association between landslide occurrences and
the slope range. Because the C/S(C) value range of above 31‡, 10.293, is highest
among the values, the range of above 31‡ was selected as the optimum cut-off

value. So the range of above 31‡ is binary favourable and the other ranges were
used as binary unfavourable patterns in the case of slope. The Wz value (for above
31‡), 1.038, is set as the rating value for the range of above 31‡ and the W 2 value
(for above 31‡), 20.145, is set as the rating value for other ranges (except the range
of above 31‡).

If the LSIc and LSIw values are high,

it means a higher susceptibility to
landslide; a lower value means a lower susceptibility to landslides. Before the
integration, the statistical validity of the resulting predictive maps was examined by
applying an overall test of conditional independence. The 43 combinations of the
factors were determined to be conditionally independent. First, for the Case All
combination, the landslide susceptibility map was calculated using all the factors,
and the LSIc value index for the interpretation is shown in ﬁgure 3. The index was
classiﬁed into equal areas and grouped into 10 classes for visual interpretation.
After the test of conditional
the 42 cases of
combinations (table 9) of the factors were analysed, and the LSIw values were
calculated, for example: using slope, aspect, curvature, soil texture, and lineament
(Case S1), using slope, aspect, curvature, soil texture, geology and lineament (Case
S2), using slope, aspect, curvature, soil texture, geology and lineament (Case S3),
and using slope, curvature,
timber diameter, geology, and
lineament (Case S15, ﬁgure 4) etc. These indexes were also classiﬁed into equal
areas, and grouped into 10 classes for visual interpretation.

illustrate how well the estimators perform with respect to the landslides used in
constructing those estimators (Chung and Fabbri 1999). The range was classiﬁed by
area, which was equal to about 5%. For example, in Case All, an index rank above
10%, could explain 49% of the landslides, and in Case S1, an index rank above 10%
could explained 47% of the landslides. Also, in Case All, an index rank above 30%,
could explain 75% of the landslides, and in Case S1, an index rank above 30% could
explain 79% of the landslides. Among the 42 cases considered, Case S15 showed the

7. Discussion and conclusion

Landslides are one of the most hazardous natural disasters. Government and
research institutions world-wide have attempted for years to assess landslide hazard
and risk and to show its spatial distribution. This study presented a probabilistic,
weights-of-evidence model approach to predicting areas susceptible to landslides
using the GIS.

In the Boun area,

the relationships between landslide and factors were
investigated using the weights-of-evidence method. Then, a test of independence
between each factor was performed, and 42 combinations of the factors were derived.
For the analysis, the calculated contrast, Wz and W 2 values were determined as
each factor’s rating, and were overlaid to calculate a landslide susceptibility index.
Then indexes were mapped, and the results were validated by calculating the
correlation between the observed landslide location and the results. Among the 42
combinations, the combination that used slope, curvature, topographic type, timber
diameter, geology, and lineament showed the best prediction accuracy.

Landslide susceptibility maps are very helpful to planners and engineers for
choosing suitable locations to carry out development. However, the methods used

in this study are valid for generalized planning and assessment purposes, although
they may be less useful on the site-speciﬁc scale, where local geological and
geographic heterogeneities may prevail. For the method to be applied in general,
more landslide location data are needed, as well as application of the method to
more regions. Fortunately, the landslide-related spatial database for topography,
soil, forest, and geology is already available for most areas of Korea; therefore, the
landslide analysis can be performed quickly and cheaply for all of Korea.

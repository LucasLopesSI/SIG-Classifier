A sample of 18th, 19th and 20th-Century historical star atlases from the Royal Institute and Observatory of the Spanish
Navy and the Linda Hall Library have been selected in order to identify the most frequently supplied scientific
information. This work shows how the quality of bibliographic records could be improved, not only by adding more
specialized description fields, but also by ensuring that the existing ones are being properly used by cataloguers. A series of
new technical parameters is proposed, along with guidelines on how to find them, thus making the task of identifying such
parameters easier for cataloguers.

INTRODUCTION

Celestial cartography dates
right back to the start of
civilization (Hoskin, 1999). Our ancestors looked at the sky
and were fascinated by the light that could be seen every night.
The daily arrangement of the bright points they observed was
reﬂected in primitive handwritten records that tried to explain
the regular motions of such points in the night sky.

Over time,

the primitive records became impressive
graphical representations of the heaven, which are known
today as celestial charts or maps. Sometimes, these charts show
a small area of the sky or the entire sky by means of two star
charts called planispheres. Over time, these individual pictures
started to be gathered in voluminous atlases, where the charts
of the sky were sometimes shown alongside terrestrial maps
(Dunn, 1778). Notwithstanding, star atlases and terrestrial
atlases have nearly always followed different paths.

It is important to note that, although a deﬁnition of
‘graphical representation’ has been suggested previously,
‘the essential thing to grasp about the double-hemisphere
star map is that it is not a picture of what is seen in the sky,
it is a conceptual model deliberately plotted in order to
display the entire heavens’ (Whitﬁeld, 1995, p. 2).

Definition of a star chart
A number of deﬁnitions for star chart have been suggested
by scholars. The geographer Pavo´ n-Besalu´ (2013) deﬁnes a

DOI: 10.1179/1743277414Y.0000000093

star chart as a ‘representation of the stars up to a speciﬁc
magnitude from a bounded area of the celestial sphere’.
However, Kanas (2009, pp. 1–5) is in favour of speaking
about celestial maps that he classiﬁes into two groups:
‘constellations maps’, i.e. those maps providing information
about the position of celestial bodies and the relative
position of their components; and ‘cosmological maps’, i.e.
those reﬂecting the social, cultural, and economic state of
the time when such maps were created. In turn, Steiner-
Verlag (1973) deﬁnes a star chart or map as
‘the
diagrammatic representation of the positions of the stars’.
On the other hand, Puente and Cos (1900) also deﬁne a
star chart as ‘a picture, made on a ﬂat surface, where the entire
starry sphere or a portion of it is represented as faithfully as
possible’. However, Lo´pez Menchero (2001) considers star
chart and star map to be synonyms and he differentiates four
types of charts, namely stellar, rotating stellar, astronomical
and planetary. He also deﬁnes star charts as ‘maps where sets
of stars from an area of the Universe are represented, such as a
hemisphere, a galaxy (the Milky Way), or a system (Solar
System)’. Furthermore, Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas,
Fı´sicas y Naturales (1990) does not ofﬁcially consider the
name ‘star chart’ but rather ‘star map’, which is deﬁned as a
‘map where celestial bodies are represented by giving their
positions in the celestial sphere’.

In light of

the deﬁnitions above, a more suitable
deﬁnition could be obtained through a partial mixture

i.e.

of those given by Steiner and Pavon I Besalu´ ,
‘a
diagrammatic representation of the positions of the stars up
to a speciﬁc magnitude from the whole or a bounded area
of the celestial sphere’. We say a ‘partial mixture’ because
celestial planispheres should be included in the deﬁnition.
Indeed, we consider that all celestial planispheres are
celestial charts but not all celestial charts are planispheres.
A planisphere would therefore be the limit of the deﬁnition
of a star chart, since a planisphere is a star chart which
covers the whole vault of heaven.

Evolution and scientific importance of historical star charts and atlases
Despite the fact that many beautiful books have been
dedicated to the history of celestial cartography (Warner,
1979; Snyder, 1984; Stott, 1995; Whitﬁeld, 1995;
Lachie`ze-Rey and Luminet, 2001; Kanas, 2009), in this
section we are interested in revisiting some key aspects of
celestial cartography in order to show its scientiﬁc relevance
throughout history.

As stated above, early charts and maps were based on
naked-eye measurements but later, technological advances
allowed us to design very precise measurement instruments
(Stephenson et al., 2000; Kanas, 2009; Bennett, 1992;
Brooks, 1991). In the words of Perryman (2009, p. 80):
‘Early star atlases were nevertheless primarily works of
science, providing accurate star charts using a consistent
projection scheme on which to plot the changing positions
of planets, comets, and the Moon’. Indeed, from the 16th
century onwards, celestial maps became very specialized
documents where complex techniques of projection,
coordinates and symbols were expressed in graphic form
(Whitﬁeld, 1995, p. 1). By this time, navigation had
become one of the most important reasons why celestial
charts were printed. For instance, The Royal Greenwich
Observatory was founded in England in 1675 by King
Charles II ‘with the purpose of compiling detailed star maps
for navigational purposes’ (Perryman, 2010, p. 51).

Despite 17th and 18th-century celestial maps being
published almost exclusively for an educated but non-
scientiﬁc market, there was a crucial scientiﬁc reason behind
the study of the heavens: to measure time (Whitﬁeld, 1995,
pp. 3–4). In fact, although the calculation of latitude was
not a difﬁcult task, the calculation of the exact longitude
caused a major headache, which could not be solved by
astronomical techniques but relied on the emergence of a
new device known as the chronometer (Sobel, 2011).
Moreover, the observations carried out during this period
have sometimes revealed surprising results. For instance,
one of the stars observed by the Royal Astronomer John
Flamsteed (named 34 Tauri) ended up being an observation
of the planet Uranus before it had even been discovered
(Covington, 2006). Furthermore, from time to time other
to celestial cartography.
ﬁndings also owe themselves
Indeed,
stars commonly known as
supernovas are sometimes recorded as new light points in
the sky that appear suddenly. This light increases and later
vanishes during a relatively short period of time. Despite its
rather short lifetime, the location of the places where there
may be a supernova is essential for some researchers, since
these explosions usually give way to the birth of a black
hole. This is one of the most violent events in the universe

the explosions of

and one of the most studied phenomena in Astrophysics
(IAC, 1999).

The birth of photography changed the methodology
used to produce celestial charts. Hitherto, measurements of
the positions and brightness of the stars was taken and then
transcribed to make a star chart, but thereafter, new
photographic instruments were responsible for capturing
pictures of the sky and the position of the stars deduced
from them (Perryman, 2010, p. 71). Nevertheless, pictorial
star maps did not vanish but, as Whitﬁeld points out (1995:
99), ‘they became conﬁned to popular scientiﬁc publica-
tions, and professional astronomers no longer used them’.
The existence of star catalogues also made the use of star
charts for scientiﬁc purposes unnecessary.

Since these catalogues in book form provided numerical
positions of the stars and many other parameters accurately,
the pictures of the sky no longer satisﬁed contemporary
astronomers’ needs (Alonso-Lifante et al., 2014). In fact, a
number of catalogues from these centuries indicated the
existence of a star atlas made using data provided by the
catalogue, or vice versa according to the epoch. The
unbreakable relation between star catalogues and star
atlases cannot be overlooked, as we will see below.

Nowadays, astronomical information is based on digital
observations, which are uploaded and stored in vast
databases accessible via the Internet. Furthermore, most
of the pictures from these observations have been used to
create famous software like Google Sky (see Alonso-Lifante
and Chaı´n-Navarro, 2013 and references
therein).
Although large atlases are still produced, charts and plates
are the preferred choice of amateur astronomers
to
familiarize themselves with the night sky. However, as
mentioned before, professional astronomers are more
interested in the data supplied by comprehensive star
catalogues, which are compiled with high precision instru-
ments that artiﬁcial satellites carry on board.

The increasing need for more specialized descriptions of astronomical
resources
Astronomical libraries preserve huge amounts of specialized
documents with very useful information for both astron-
omers and historians. Nevertheless, the lack of specializa-
tion of the cataloguing standards used to describe such
documents could cause serious difﬁculties when it comes to
ﬁnding them. Indeed, these resources have become more
and more specialized over time, which is the very reason
why the descriptions should also be more specialized. In
our opinion, documental descriptions of resources should
evolve at a parallel rate as resources themselves.

As stated above, star charts provide relevant scientiﬁc
information. On one hand, charts themselves certainly
contain data of interest for the aforementioned professional
but, on the other hand, atlases where these charts are
compiled often indicate the existence of separate star
(Dien and Flammarion, 1884; Dien and
catalogues
Flammarion, 1887). Indeed, star atlases and star catalogues
were produced almost simultaneously and, although the
catalogue is usually the most important scientiﬁc document,
atlases should also be well described from a documentary
point of view, since ﬁnding an atlas could lead us to the
corresponding catalogue. Furthermore, current atlases

Historical Celestial Cartography

contain star charts with legends, where additional informa-
tion to that which may be recorded in the cataloguing
standards is shown. This shows us that these standards are
still not ready to record information that was considered
important by those who created the charts.

In this sense, the main goal of cataloguing is to identify
and access the documents that are being searched for.
Furthermore, technological improvements have allowed us
to reach a new desired goal: navigating from and to closely
related information (Escolano Rodrı´guez, 2011). However,
since the current interest in cataloguing no longer relates to
the ‘document’ but the ‘data’, our work is directed towards
a third target:
improving the quality of bibliographic
records, not only by adding more specialized description
ﬁelds, but also by ensuring that the existing ones are being
properly used by cataloguers. In this way, users will be able
to ﬁnd the desired information in a more efﬁcient way.
Therefore, it is not about establishing a minimum level of
cataloguing, as was the case in 1979, but rather searching
for
the desirable minimum ﬁelds needed for better
information retrieval. For further details about historical
and current implications of cataloguing quality, see Schultz-
Jones et al. (2012) and references therein. In turn, further
details about
for astronomical
resources involved in the cataloguing standards are pre-
sented in Table 1 of Alonso-Lifante and Chaı´n-Navarro,
2013). For more speciﬁc details see Larsgaard (2006).

the cartographic ﬁelds

In short, better information retrieval may only be possible
when cataloguers have at their disposal the necessary ﬁelds to
describe the content of the resources as faithfully as possible.
Therefore, specialized or technical metadata is needed for
each branch of the documents being dealt with. In this article
we show, on the one hand, that the description of a star atlas
as a monograph may not be enough to satisfy astronomers’
needs and, on the other hand, that further information may
be found and recorded from single charts.

Stars atlases’ collection from the Royal Institute and Observatory of
the Spanish Navy and the Linda Hall Library
Most of the atlases analysed here have been collected from
the Royal Institute and Observatory of the Spanish Navy
(ROA in what follows) and a number of them have been
taken from the Linda Hall Library (LHL in what follows).
The ROA is a scientiﬁc institution of the Spanish Navy that
has focused on the study of Astronomy and Geoscience since
it was founded in the 18th century. Its origins are directly
related to the scientiﬁc policy of the Bourbon Dynasty, which
employed the Navy and Army as instruments to develop
scientiﬁc ﬁelds that had been ignored during the intellectual
isolation of the 17th century in Spain.

In this sense, one of the ﬁrst measures taken by the Spanish
king, Felipe V, was the creation of the Midshipmen Academy in
Ca´diz (1717), a place for specialized education where the main
objective was to provide the Army, and therefore State, with
senior technical staff that were trained to take charge of future
scientiﬁc projects. In 1753, the birth of the ROA took place in
Ca´diz, as a research centre. From the very beginning, its main
goals were education, practice and research, which in turn,
rapidly contributed to the increasing importance of its library,
along with contacts with European astronomers and scientists in
the late 18th century, and the exchange of publications with
other scientiﬁc institutions during the 19th century. Other
important contemporary facts include the ﬁrst systematic plan of
astronomical observations and the ﬁrst Spanish astronomical
ephemerides. Moreover,
in 1827, after the Midshipmen
Academy was closed down, more than ﬁve thousand volumes
were taken to the Library of the ROA, among which there were
works by some of the most prominent authors of modern
science (Newton, Boyle, Hooke, Riccioli, Galileo, Huygens,
Fermat, Bernoulli), together with a lot of contemporary
scientiﬁc works like ‘Astronomical Observations’ from The
Royal Observatory of Greenwich (Bradley et al., 1798–1951),
or the annual volumes of astronomical ephemerides published in
Great Britain and France.

The Library of the ROA, which is one of the most
important research libraries in Spain, currently possesses
more than 30,000 volumes related to Astrometry, Celestial
Mechanics, Geodesy, Geophysics, and time and frequency
Metrology, as well as antiquarian materials comprising more
than 1300 works published between the 15th and 18th
centuries. The library was built in the Defence Library
Network, a network where all library centres belonging to
the Spanish Ministry of Defence were placed, in order to
preserve and disseminate the bibliographic heritage, as well as
improve and increase the quality of
librarian services
(Government of Spain, 2011). A smaller collection of star
atlases can also be found in the library. Speciﬁcally, a
representative sample of them published during the last three
centuries has been selected to carry out this work. Among
them, for instance, we highlight those astrographic plates
belonging to the international astronomical project Carte du
Ciel, San Fernando (1913). Finally, our sample includes a
number of more specialized atlases that were created and
published during the second half of the 20th century.

On the other hand, the Linda Hall Library (LHL in what
follows) is ‘the world’s foremost independent research
library devoted to science, engineering and technology.
Anon-proﬁt, privately funded institution, the library is open
to the public free of charge’ (Linda Hall Library, 2013a).
The library is headquartered in the Kansas City region, and
opened its doors to the public for the ﬁrst time in 1946. Its
name was given in honour of the Georgian Linda Hall who,
together with her husband Herber Hall, amassed a sizable
estate through his grain business and decided to create an
important cultural agency in Kansas, where they lived, since
they had no direct heirs. After extensive research and
meetings with local and regional leaders, the consultants
recommended the creation of a science and technology
library.

The LHL collection policy emphasizes the acquisition of
journals and other serial publications. Although the Library

4

has regularly acquired material since 1946, several acquisi-
tions are worth noting:
the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1946, the
library of the Franklin Institute in 1985 and an acquisition
of the Engineering Societies Library in 1995.

the library collection of

Moreover, according to Linda Hall Library (2013b),
LHL has Digital Collections which provide access to
signiﬁcant rare and fragile materials from the LHL. It has
nearly a quarter of a million digitized images from the
History of Science Collection. Speciﬁcally, ‘Astronomy –
Star Atlases, Charts, and Maps’ is a digital collection which
includes major works in the depiction of astronomical
information, as well as later popular pictorial atlases. In
particular, we have selected the following three atlases of
the 19th century for our sample: Wollaston (1811), Brooke
(1820) and Burritt (1835).

OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

Searching for new description ﬁelds for star charts and
atlases, and making use of some existing cartographic ﬁelds
which are not being widely used, are the two main goals of
the present paper. Thus we will be closer to satisfying the
needs of professionals who use these resources daily.

In order to do this, as commented above, a sample of
18th, 19th and 20th century star atlases from the ROA and
the LHL have been analysed to identify the most frequently
provided scientiﬁc data. With respect to the ROA, this
analysis has been accomplished by querying both the Union
Catalogue of Defence Library Network (commonly known as
Bibliodef) (Government of Spain, 2011) and the printed
catalogue of the mapping collection. Before carrying out
the searches in the OPAC, two lists were developed. The
ﬁrst one consisted of a number of search terms, namely:
celestial chart, star chart, celestial map, star map and
celestial atlas. This last term turned out to be the best
option, since it was the subject used by cataloguers to
collect most of
these resources. The second list was
designed to contain some of the most important star atlases
according to Kanas (2009). This allowed us to perform
more speciﬁc searches. With respect to LHL (Linda Hall
Library, 2013b), other atlases from the collection have been

used, ‘Astronomy – Star Atlases, Charts, and Maps’. Finally,
two further 20th century atlases have been intentionally
chosen in order to complete our sample: Norton’s atlas
(Norton and Inglis, 1959) is one of the most important
works of this century and Millennium Star Atlas was
compiled using the data from the Hipparcos space mission
(ESA, 2007a).

(see References

Once these searches were performed, three new lists were
developed, each one containing 18th, 19th and 20th
century atlases respectively. Only star atlases have been
considered, hence charts or atlases about other types of
celestial objects have been neglected. In total, a sample of
22 star atlases
section) covering the
aforementioned historical periods as well as possible, were
considered (Table 1). Nevertheless, it has not been possible
to cover all decades, due to a lack of documents in the
archives. It is worth noting that, since the ROA was created
in 1753, its library contains fewer documents about this
historical period, and the LHL has only digitized a small
collection of star atlases. Not only that, but it is difﬁcult to
ﬁnd complete digitized atlases from the 18th century or
earlier. Furthermore, it is important to mention that, from
two of these 22 star atlases, only star charts have been found
(Observatorio de San Fernando, 1915; ESA, 2007b), hence
we have not been able to analyse the rest of their sections.
Once sample had been selected, a preliminary study
about the content of the atlases was completed by analyzing
title pages, tables of contents, introductions, star charts, etc.
This information allowed us to develop a new list with the
most
frequently provided data. Thus, a number of
parameters were found and later, an atlas-by-atlas revision
was performed to ﬁnd out the frequency with which each
parameter occurred in the whole sample.

GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF A HISTORICAL STAR
ATLAS

In the same way as a monograph, a star atlas usually
contains a title page, a table of contents, an introduction or
preface and a set of star charts. As shown in Table 2,
although this arrangement has hardly changed over the last
three centuries, all sections have experienced remarkable

changes throughout this period, above all when comparing
20th century atlases with those published earlier.

Nevertheless, some differences can also be seen between
the atlases of the 18th and 19th century in regard to star
charts. Indeed, star charts from the 18th century were
marked by the presence of constellation images (Flamsteed,
1729) that consisted of heroes and heroines, real and
imaginary animals or scientiﬁc instruments according to
ancient myths and tales. Furthermore, another type of
celestial chart was often collected in celestial atlases during
this century. They are the so-called cosmological images
(Doppelmayr, 1742), which ‘consisted of diagrams of
heavenly bodies or of the entire solar system that reﬂected
systems’
both contemporary and ancient cosmological
(Kanas, 2009, p. 1). On the contrary, the 19th century is
known as the century of the transition to non-pictorial star
maps. In fact, constellations images were vanishing during
this century and most of them were replaced with lines
connecting the major stars of the constellations, thus
producing new stick ﬁgures whose representations have
survived up until the present day.

A common feature of atlases from these two centuries is
the table of contents that shows the title of the charts being
placed at the beginning of some of the atlases. This
information may be of great relevance, since the titles
usually provide interesting cartographic information, as we
will see in the section on ‘The table of contents’. Moreover,
it can also be seen that some atlases from the 18th century
show tables with numerical data at the margins of the star
charts, which are actually brief star catalogues inside star
atlases. However, this tradition has not vanished over time.
On the contrary, some star atlases from the 20th century
still include accurate numerical information about positions
of stars, but this data is rather shown outside the charts (just
before or after them). This could be the reason why some
star atlases of this century do not exhibit coordinate
reference frames in their star charts.

It is also important to note that some new specialized
concepts like ‘proper motions’ of the stars, started to be
mentioned in star atlases, as well as in star catalogues,
together with more detailed explanations of the content of
(Dien and Flammarion, 1884; Dien and
star charts
Flammarion, 1887). Furthermore, new celestial objects
also started to be considered (Wollaston, 1811). In fact,
atlases of the 20th century sometimes include sections with
titles like ‘Interesting objects’ (Norton and Inglis, 1959),
which reveals the evolution of the level of specialization of
these astronomical resources. In turn,
the appearance
of these new concepts and objects also caused an evolution

of the quantity and technicality of the information provided
by introductions and prefaces. For instance, a short course
on celestial mechanics can be observed in Proctor’s atlas
(Proctor, 1886). See also Brooke (1820) and Cottam
(1889). Finally, a last comment concerns the 20th century.
Unlike any previous century, the birth of Radioastronomy
allowed us for the ﬁrst time, to see the Universe at different
wavelengths. This was a milestone in the history of
Astronomy.

The title page
As it is well known, the information provided by title pages
of any document is usually essential for the cataloguing
process, and much more important when dealing with
astronomical resources. In this context, as pointed out in
Alonso-Lifante et al. (2014), this information may be
classiﬁed into two groups: common information and
technical information. Common information is related to
the data one can ﬁnd in almost any document, such as the
title, author, publication year or printing data, among
others. On the contrary, technical information is related to
the speciﬁc data one will only ﬁnd in a star atlas or similar
astronomical resource. Therefore, since common informa-
tion is already present in the cataloguing rules, we will focus
on technical information.

As commented in the section on ‘Objectives and
methodology’, in spite of our sample being a selection of
22 atlases, only 20 title pages have been analysed because
two of them could not be consulted. Thus, we only found
technical information in 11 of these 20 title pages (55%). In
fact, Table 3 shows a number of technical parameters that
can be identiﬁed in the title pages of star atlases of the 18th,
19th and 20th centuries, together with their frequency of
occurrence. It is important to note that no technical
information has been found in the atlases of the 18th
century, and there are some atlases that exhibit a short table
of contents in the title page itself, see for instance Peters
(1882).

As we can see in Table 3, the hemisphere is the most
frequently supplied parameter in the title pages (.63%).
This parameter leads astronomers to take a ﬁrst approach of
the area of the sky covered by the atlas. This approach is
speciﬁc when the exact range of coordinates is given, which
is in fact another parameter that was often supplied along
with the epoch, the observation place and period, and the
magnitude [for
these
further details about
parameters see Angelo (2006)]. This last parameter is
essential in Astronomy and Astrophysics since, for instance,

by measuring the brightness of certain stars known as
supernovas, scientists may know how far away these stars
are, and this information can be used to determine how
quickly the Universe has been expanded since the explosion
of the star.

As observed, there are some parameters whose frequency
of occurrence is lower but whose importance may become
paramount in the near future to achieve a satisfactory level
of information retrieval. Indeed, many databases (not only
in Astronomy) include in their records some links to those
documents closely related to that searched for. In the case
of star atlases, some of them have been compiled from
others, whose references are sometimes shown in the title
pages. It can therefore be said that these atlases should
be considered as ‘root documents’ rather than ‘related
documents’. On the other hand,
it is well known by
astronomers that there are different types of celestial atlases
depending on the type of celestial charts they provide,
namely star atlases, cosmological atlases, planetary atlases,
and even hybrid atlases housing a mixture of this kind of
charts. If this is taken into account when ﬁlling in the
bibliographic records, users will ﬁnd the desired documents
more easily. Finally, Figure 1 shows an example of one of
these title pages where six of the eight technical parameters
previously considered have been framed inside a red box.

The table of contents
Besides the title page, the next most frequently consulted
part of any document is undoubtedly the table of contents.
In this sense, some authors like Breeding (2010) have
already pointed out the need to take into account this
information in order to extend the scope of traditional
library catalogues.

With this in mind, the information provided by the table
of contents of the atlases of our sample, have also been
analysed. Speciﬁcally, 12 of the 20 atlases exhibit an index
(60%) with valuable information of the content of the atlas.
In fact, Table 4 shows a list of the technical parameters
found while analysing the table of contents of our sample,
together with their frequency of occurrence. Even though
the hemisphere is again the most frequently supplied
parameter, and some of the previous parameters can also
be found here, it is a remarkable fact that some of these
indexes show the title of each star chart included in the
star atlas
information (see
Doppermayr, 1742; Samuel Dunn, 1778; Bode, 1801;
Charles Dien, 1884/1887; Cottam, 1889; Burritt, 1835).
These titles usually give the name of the constellation or
constellations shown in the chart, which is actually celestial
cartographic information to be taken into account in the
same way as terrestrial cartography reﬂects every landform.
In particular, 7 of the 12 atlases with table of contents show
this information (.58%).

(Figure 2a), among other

On the other hand, as we approach the 20th century,
tables of contents become more similar to those we ﬁnd in
books nowadays (see for instance the great Norton’s atlas
(Norton and Inglis, 1959) and Figure 2b). These ‘new
indexes’ usually show interesting cartographic information,
like the projection or the nomenclature used to denote the
stars. With respect to the projection, the exact name of the
projection used is sometimes indicated. Nevertheless, this

information is often unclear, hence it should be deduced by
consulting some specialized handbooks (Snyder, 1987;
Jime´nez Pelayo et al., 2001). With respect
to the
nomenclature of the stars, some of them (Bayer’s letters,
Flamsteed’s numbers, etc.) have been designed throughout
history to designate the stars, which is necessary to locate
them inside the corresponding constellations.

Prefaces, introductions and notes
After title pages and tables of contents, both prefaces and
introductions are probably the least frequently read parts of
any document when cataloguing, due sometimes to the
original language of the text. This statement is best seen
when observing the bibliographic records of the atlases of
our sample. Indeed, it is a fact that most of the important
technical information provided by prefaces and introduc-
tions is not usually shown in these records by the British
Library, for instance. Such was the case that the only record
we have found where part of this information has been
clearly included is shown in Figure 3a.

This ﬁgure shows the bibliographic record of Cottam’s
atlas by the British Library (Cottam, 1889). On the one
hand, since the coordinates of the atlas are shown in the
title page as part of the title, the cataloguer registered them
only in the ﬁeld 245 (MARC 21), but this information does
not appear in the corresponding cartographic ﬁeld (255$c).
On the other hand, note that this cataloguer read the
preface of the atlas, since he or she has literally transcribed
the ﬁrst sentence of the section where the information
about the scale is shown: ‘The scale is one-third of an inch
to a degree of a great circle’ (see Figure 4). Note also that
this information does appear in the record by ROA’s library
(Figure 3b). Notwithstanding, there are other important
cartographic parameters in this preface (see again Figure 4),
namely the projection (conical or cylindrical), the epoch
(1890) and the magnitudes that the cataloguer could have
registered respectively in the ﬁelds 255$b-Projection,
255$c-Equinox/Epoch or, in the case of the magnitude,
in the ﬁeld 500-General note. In short, a better cataloguing
process could be as simple as reading beyond the title page.
In fact, some atlases provide detailed descriptions of the
charts they show (Dien and Flammarion, 1884; Dien and
Flammarion, 1887; Brooke, 1820) and this information is
usually very helpful for both cataloguers and astronomers.
In short, 14 of the 20 atlases from our sample (70%)
exhibit a preface, introduction or introductory notes where,
as well as the previous parameters, some new ones may be
found, such as instruments, perspective, objects of special
interest, wavelength, or the classical scale (see Table 5). The
parameter labelled ‘instruments’ concerns those tools used
to make the observations or the measurements, such as
telescopes, micrometers and so on. In turn, ‘perspective’ is
related to the shape of the constellations, such as they are
seen from either inside or outside the vault of heaven. For
instance, under a geocentric perspective, images of con-
stellations are seen from left-to-right reversed, with respect
to the opposite perspective commonly known as external
(see Figure 5). Moreover, due to the advances concerning
like nebulae or
instrumentation, new celestial objects
galaxies have been distinguished in the night sky, and
therefore they have been reﬂected in the atlases. Finally, the

parameter ‘wavelength’, which is less common but certainly
not one to be overlooked, allows astronomers to calculate
the range of the spectra where photographs of certain areas
of the night sky have been taken. Indeed, with the birth of
Radioastronomy scientists started to observe the Universe
at other wavelengths out of the visible range, which was
actually one of the most important advances in Astronomy.
In our opinion, if the charts of any atlas show the outer
space at any other wavelength, they should certainly be
recorded for the beneﬁt of their potential users.

Star charts inside the star atlas
As discussed previously, the main reason why star atlases
exist is because of the need to collect study and disseminate
those star charts produced in conjunction with the
observation project. Nevertheless, these charts can often
i.e.
be found alone in many astronomical

libraries,

separately from any atlas, hence these charts have to be
catalogued as standalone documents. In this subsection, we
will look in more detail at the most frequently supplied data
by star charts, thus providing new descriptors for both star
atlases and individual star charts. Note that, as previously
stated, this analysis has been accomplished by taking into
account the 22 atlases in our sample.

Table 6 shows the whole set of technical parameters that were
considered during the analysis of the sample. As we can see, this
table is slightly different with respect to the previous ones, since
some new columns have been added. These columns indicate
whether the corresponding parameter is explicitly given in the
corresponding atlas, or whether, on the contrary,
it can
somehow be deduced. For
the row labelled
‘Projection’ shows that this parameter is explicitly given in 2
out of the 22 atlases (9.1%), but it can be deduced when dealing
with the rest of the atlases, hence the projection can be obtained,
with more or less difﬁculty, from the charts of all the atlases.

With respect to the rest of the parameters, most have
been explained previously, except for one: ‘Constellation
images’. The presence of this parameter is an added bonus
for historians who are interested in issues such as myths
beyond the pictorial star maps and the evolution of the
Indeed,
system of constellations
although this purpose seems less scientiﬁc than the main
goals of this paper, historians are not only an important
group of potential users of star charts but it is also well
known that the presence and future of any science cannot
be determined without detailed knowledge of its past.

throughout history.

It is worth adding some extra comments at this stage. On
the one hand, like with terrestrial cartography, some star
charts show the classical scale (Cottam, 1889; Carte du
Ciel, 1913; Smithsonian, 1969) and, on the other hand, it
is interesting how some atlases have charts where no system
of coordinates is shown, since these coordinates have been

indicated just before the charts in a table with numerical
data (Henry Brooke, 1820; Vehrenberg, 1963). In turn,
other parameters like perspective can always be deduced, if
possible, from the constellations of the chart as indicated in
Figure 5. If there are no constellations in the charts, the
perspective is usually geocentric because the chart is almost
always the result of a photograph taken from the Earth’s
surface, which is always a geocentric viewpoint.

Another important matter concerns the name of the
constellations where a star chart is located. On the one
hand, we can see that most star charts exhibit the name of
the constellation or constellations in the title of the chart,
which in our opinion should be recorded, as commented
above. On the other hand, sometimes there are no titles in
the chart but the name of the constellations is exhibited
inside the charts themselves, hence it is not necessary to
deduce their names but rather explore within the chart.

10

The Cartographic Journal

Figure 4. Sections of the preface of Cottam’s star atlas (Cottam, 1889), where one can see the technical information shown, namely scale,
projection, constellation boundaries, star magnitudes, epoch and lettering. Moreover, one can see the exact sentence that the cataloguer
decided to include in the 255$a MARC ﬁeld (see Figure 3)

Nevertheless, there are occasions where constellations are
shown neither in the title nor inside the chart. In this case,
we are probably looking at a chart where an area of the sky
that is smaller than a constellation region is shown. In these
cases, it is important to know that this chart always belongs
to a constellation, which can be deduced from the interval
of coordinates as indicated in the box of the chart (see
Figure 6). As a ﬁnal consideration, although the coordi-
nates always give the exact location of any area of the sky,
indicating simultaneously the constellation to which that
area belongs to, could be crucial when looking for celestial
cartography in OPACs by both professional and amateur
astronomers. Above all, the latter group is usually more
used to thinking in constellations than in coordinates.

RESULTS: PROPOSAL OF PARAMETERS FOR
DESCRIPTIONS OF STAR ATLASES OF THE 18TH, 19TH
AND 20TH CENTURIES

As shown in the previous sections, a number of parameters
have been listed which could be helpful to improve the
bibliographic descriptions of star atlases and charts. We
know that some of these parameters are already present in
the cataloguing rules. However, several of them have still
not been broadly used by cataloguers for different reasons,
namely the difﬁculty in managing this kind of resources and
the lack of time staff have to carry out more detailed
descriptions, among others.

be considered is the information provided by the table of
contents of each atlas. In our opinion, since many atlases
exhibit comprehensive tables of contents with very important
information about them, adding these tables to the biblio-
graphic records would be really useful for users as it would
give them a general idea of the content of the document.

PLACES WHERE THE PROPOSED PARAMETERS CAN
OFTEN BE FOUND IN HISTORICAL STAR ATLASES

Once the technical parameters that better deﬁne the
cartographic content of a star atlas have been found, we
think it is also important to point out the places where these
parameters are located in the atlases. Thus, we will help

In this sense, Table 8 shows the places where the
proposed parameters may often be found in historical star
atlases, which is in fact a summary of the results presented in
the previous tables. The ﬁrst and second columns are the
same as in Table 7 and the rest of the columns refer to each
part of a star atlas according to the section on ‘General
arrangement of a historical star atlas’. The percentages
offered in the header of each column correspond to the
number of atlases that contain technical information in the

two sub-columns labelled ‘G’, which means that

means that the parameter has to be deduced. As an

parameter is explicitly given in 18.2% of the star charts but it
has to be deduced in 81.8% of them.

CONCLUSIONS

As commented in the section on ‘Evolution and scientiﬁc
importance of historical star charts and atlases’, some star
maps appeared together with terrestrial maps in the same
atlas. It can therefore be said that
the former were
supplementary maps used to show the Universe as seen

from the Earth, hence many of these atlases offered a great
coverage of terrestrial and celestial geography. From a
documentary point of view, these resources have been
traditionally catalogued as monographs, without taking into
account several of the most frequently supplied mathema-
tical and cartographic data (see the section on ‘General
arrangement of a historical star atlas’). Thanks to the joint
efforts of the expert cataloguers and the bibliographic
agencies, a collective consciousness is arising little by little in
an attempt to improve the descriptions of cartographic
resources. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of work to be
done. Indeed, astronomers’ needs for information increase
day by day due
in Astronomy.
Additionally, star maps are becoming a more interesting
resource for a wider audience headed by amateur astron-
omers. Accordingly, we think that our proposal of
parameters (summarized in Table 7) could allow catalo-
guers to improve the descriptions of star atlases and star
maps, thus achieving better information retrieval and more
specialized access to these resources.

Finally, we also think that information professionals
should work to improve the search functionalities for the
Next-Generation Catalogues, thus carrying out the same
tasks as current astronomical databases (mainly SIMBAD
and NED) (CDS, 2013; NASA, 2013), which incorporate
new parameters as science progresses and design new search
interfaces as astronomers’ needs for information increase.

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES

Ma Pilar Alonso Lifante
(Yecla, Murcia,
Spain,
1986), is currently a PhD
in Library and
student
Information Science, Uni-
versity of Murcia (Spain).
She was granted a Fellow-
ship by the Fundacio´ n
Se´neca (Science and Tech-
nology Regional Agency
of Murcia) in 2010. Her
research focuses on astro-
nomical information retri-
eval. In particular, she is
interested in the study of
historical astronomical documents in order to improve
bibliographic descriptions of these resources and, thus,
better information retrieval.

Abstract
Many methods for modeling urban expansion are available. Most of these computational models demand
a variety of large-scale environmental and socio-economic data to investigate the relationship between
urban expansion and its driving forces. These requirements are not always fulﬁlled, particularly in devel-
oping countries due to a lack of data availability. This necessitates methods not suffering from data limi-
tations to ease their application. Consequently, this research presents a morphological approach for
predicting urban expansion on the basis of spatiotemporal dynamics of urban margins by investigating
the interior metropolitan area of Tehran, Iran as a case study. To assess the model’s performance, urban
expansion is monitored from 1976 to 2012. The proposed model is evaluated to ensure that the predic-
tion performance for the year 2012 is acceptable. For the year 2024, the model predicts Tehran’s urban
expansion at an overall R2 of 88%. Accordingly, it is concluded that: (1) although this approach only
inputs urban margins, it represents a suitable and easy-to-use urban expansion model; and (2) urban plan-
ners are faced with continuing urban expansion.

1 Introduction

Due to the recent population and economic growth in developing countries, urban expansion
dynamics are attracting increasing amounts of attention (e.g. Verburg et al. 2002, Pijanowski
et al. 2002, He et al. 2006, Verburg 2006, Shalaby and Tateishi 2007; Dewan and Yamaguchi
2009, Batisani and Yarnal 2009, Serra et al. 2009, Tayyebi et al. 2010). This results in a
variety of techniques for spatiotemporal monitoring, land-change modeling and exploring the
causes and consequences of urban expansion (Burgi et al. 2004, Long et al. 2007, Catalan
et al. 2008), including cellular automata models (CA) (e.g. Clarke and Gaydos 1998, Han
et al. 2009), Markov models (e.g. Kamusoko et al. 2009), logistic regression models (e.g. Hu
and Lo 2007, Jokar Arsanjani et al. 2013), agent-based models (ABM) (e.g. Robinson et al.
2007) and urban gradient analysis (e.g. Yu and Ng 2007, Hedblom and Söderström 2008).
These methods all have some limitations:

1. CA models are based on grid representations determined by the underlying remote sensing
images. To reduce computational burdens, these models commonly stick to data with a
mid-range spatial resolution (e.g. Jokar Arsanjani et al. (2013) used Landsat images with
30 m spatial resolution). Furthermore, CA models need a set of holistic and predeﬁned
rules to describe expansion dynamics which result in different outputs. However, the rules
have to be adapted to the local circumstances of physical and socio-economic factors.

2. Markov models avoid rule deﬁnitions, but clearly lack their non-spatiality, which requires
complex coupling of different models (e.g. a hybrid CA-Markov model, Kamusoko et al.
2009). This means that they are not easily accessible to non-experts.

3. Despite the fact that logistic regression may possibly consider spatial dependence through
autoregressive model parameters (Hu and Lo 2007), this model family is based on a
number of explanatory variables (e.g. household income), which are rarely available on an
appropriate scale (e.g. census tract level) for several time stamps.

4. ABMs follow a bottom-up principle and model urban expansion on the basis of a priori
deﬁned agents (e.g. Heppenstall et al. 2012), which mimic the locational choice of
households migrating to the suburban fringes. Like CA, these models necessitate com-
prehensive knowledge of complex human behavior, represented by preliminary deﬁned
rules.

5. Finally, urban gradient analysis has been coupled with landscape metrics to understand
urban expansion processes (Luck and Wu 2002, Kong et al. 2006, Kong and Nakagoshi
2006). Extensive data preparation and prospective analysis properties are the bottlenecks
to this approach.

Eliminating these limitations of established urban growth models demands a new mod-
eling technique. The new technique must be easy to apply, have low data requirements, and at
the same time should be able to predict future urban boundaries precisely. The present study
seeks to bridge this identiﬁed research gap. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to
present an approach for exploring past developments and predicting future urban expansion
based on morphological urban patterns. Furthermore, by addressing the rapid urban expan-
sion of Tehran, Iran, the suitability of the approach is empirically tested, and relevant insights
for urban managers and policy makers are achieved.

The proposed approach incorporates models dealing with the spatiotemporal change of
urban margins (UMs). Moreover, in comparison to the aforementioned models, this approach
enables the urban planners to:

1. Delineate the boundary of cities and their administrative margins;
2. Control urban expansion along cardinal directions and direct further developments

towards in-ﬁll and vertical constructions; and

3. Reduce expenditure on supplying infrastructure for the recent developed areas, and to
protect the neighboring lands, which are mainly farm lands and forests (American
Planning Association 2002, Bengston and Youn 2006, Gunn 2007, Acevedo et al. 2008,
Han et al. 2009, Jokar Arsanjani et al. 2013).

This is even more necessary in developing countries such as Iran, where infrastructure
establishment and development have to be supervised more closely and dynamically due to
rapid urban expansion; respective governmental organizations ought to consider the conse-
quences of urban planning strategies before putting them into practice (Madanipour 2006,
Ziari 2006, Zamani and Areﬁ 2012). Despite urban growth models being developed (e.g.
Jokar Arsanjani et al. 2013), less attention has been paid to studying UMs so far. With the
exception of Tayyebi et al. (2011a, b), no empirical investigations explicitly utilize UMs and
further investigations are required.

The article is structured as follows. Section 2 brieﬂy discusses the relevance of urban
expansion margins in planning. Section 3 introduces the model, presents major results, and
discusses the model’s performance. Finally, Section 4 concludes with model- and planning-
speciﬁc implications, as well as identifying future research endeavors.

2 Urban Growth Margins as a Planning Concept

Urban growth margins (UGMs) are a management and planning concept of local administra-
tions to constrain urban developments (Calthorpe and Fulton 2001, Phillips and Goodstein
2000). UGMs assist the authorities in encouraging greater urban concentrations around the
urban core and, conversely, protect farming lands and forested areas (Kong and Nakagoshi
2006). Furthermore, the cost of urban infrastructure advancement and transportation is
diminished by more compact urban patterns (American Planning Association 2002). Besides,
local administrations are able to estimate future land demand for urban planning (Yu and Ng
2007).

One of the earliest uses of UGMs was in the United Kingdom to delineate green belts
around London to protect rural areas by isolating urban areas with the boundary (Elson
1993). It was also used in Japan and France in the 1960s for delineating the UM (Eaton and
Eckstein 1994). Turner et al. (1992) developed a tool – the so-called “yellow line system” – to
deﬁne inhabitant centers in order to separate urban and rural areas. UGMs have been imple-
mented in North America in a variety of ways, for instance, in California for detecting urban
growth areas (Knaap and Hopkins 2001, Wassmer 2002, Syphard et al. 2005, Jaeger and
Plantinga 2007), and in Tennessee for deﬁning long-term city boundaries in order to monitor
and control urban expansion (Cho et al. 2010). In Texas, UGMs as “Extra Territorial Jurisdic-
tional Boundaries” are used to draw future city expansion with the intention of minimizing
competitive annexations. Smith and Hald (2004) used UGM as a regional planning instrument
to restrict urban expansion in the Canadian cities of Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and Water-
loo (Gordon and Vipond 2005). Furthermore, UGMs have been applied more frequently in
areas with rapid expansion as a useful concept in order to preserve the natural spaces around
large and highly sprawling cities (American Planning Association 2002, Fan et al. 2009).
Examples include China (Han et al. 2009), Iran (Tayyebi et al. 2011a, b), Australia (Coiacetto
2007) and Korea (Bengston and Youn 2006).

3 Materials and Methods

3.1 Study Area

Tehran is the capital of Iran and the administrative center of Tehran province. The population
of Tehran city nearly doubled, from 4.53 to 8.78 million, between 1976 and 2012 (World
Gazetteer 2012; http://www.world-gazetteer.com/). Tehran has an interior core containing the
main cities of Tehran, Shahre-Rey and Shemiranat, while it also has an exterior (greater) met-
ropolitan area containing a number of nearby cities (Zebardast 2006). Therein, Islam-Shahr,
Nasim-Shahr and Shahre-Ghods are named. These nearby cities are growing even faster with
higher rates of expansion due to affordable house prices and cheaper living costs. As people
commute every day, the population of Tehran during the day differs greatly from that at night
(Madanipour 2006, Zebardast 2006). This study deals exclusively with the interior metropoli-
tan area, where the urban center is located at a latitude of 35.696°N and longitude of
51.423°E. Tehran’s altitude varies substantially from 1,000 to 3,800 m above sea level.
Although Tehran is physically limited by mountainous areas in the north and the east, it is still
growing in all directions, albeit at different rates (Jokar Arsanjani et al. 2011). Despite the
multi-centric structure of many developed countries, Tehran is a commercial, ﬁnancial and
educational capital.

3.2 Data and Data Preprocessing

The prime data needed for the UGM model are temporal boundaries of built-up areas. Such
data can be collected either through the administrative data archives or by extracting them
through remote sensing. In this article, the UMs are derived from mid-resolution remote
sensing images from the Landsat satellites. These images are freely available through the
NASA Landsat Program via the Earth Science Data Interface and offer a rich temporal cover-
age of images from 1972 to the present day (Patino and Duque 2013). Images from the follow-
ing years are collected: 1976, 1988, 2000 and 2012. The land cover ﬁles are extracted from
these images at 30 m resolution for the TM and ETM+, and 79 m resolution for the MSS. Sub-
sequently, these images are classiﬁed by using the maximum likelihood algorithm in accord-
ance with Anderson et al.’s (1976) classiﬁcation standard. The resulting land cover maps
contain six major land cover classes as follows: water bodies, agricultural areas and orchards,
built-up areas, parks and open lands with more and less than 10% slope. Thereafter, they are
reclassiﬁed into binary ﬁles containing built-up and non-built-up areas so that margins of
built-up areas illustrate the urban margin dataset for each timeframe. The accuracy of the land
cover maps is veriﬁed with Kappa indices of 88, 91, 93 and 90%, respectively. Additionally, as
discussed below, these boundary representations are further post-processed in a GIS. This is
crucial for subsequent analysis tasks (i.e. transect calculations) and to avoid unreliable esti-
mates of the UGM model.

3.3 Urban Growth Margin Model and its Application

The UGM model considers the spatial movement of urban margins over time. In effect, it com-
putes rate-of-change statistics for a set of temporal urban boundaries. The workﬂow of the
UGM model is summarized in Figure 1.

The following three main elements are crucial for the UGM model:

1. UMs, which refer to the lines indicating the temporal position of UMs (red line in
Figure 2). Each UM vector embodies a speciﬁc situation of the physical extent of an urban
area in time.

2. The baseline serves as a starting point of transects to cross the UMs. It acts as a reference
line paralleling the general orientation of the historical UMs and can be drawn either
manually by visual observation or through buffering the UMs.

3. The transects that intersect each UM line to mark measurement points required for com-
puting several change rates along each UM. They indicate the width of expansion within
each time period by being cast over the UMs. The intersection points provide position and
time to calculate rates of change (Thieler and Danforth 1994, Moore 2000).

Step 1: Delineation and modiﬁcation of the urban margins

The UM dataset provides a historical representation over time. As mentioned earlier, to create
UMs, three main procedures could be followed:

(a) Delineating through satellite images and aerial photos;
(b) Using preliminary drawn UMs; or
(c) Using already available land cover/use data and reclassifying built-up areas from other

existing classes.

The ﬁrst option was used here but, due to the coarse resolution of Landsat images, the UMs
are non-smooth and curvy, so need to be modiﬁed to give a better representation and to ease the
computation process. This was carried out by applying GIS-based generalization and smoothing
algorithms to simplify margins for removing extraneous bends and preserve essential shape, and
to smooth margins for smoothing sharp angles in lines in order to improve cartographic and aes-
thetic quality. Figure 2 represents the temporal UMs as well as the cast transects.

Step 2: Determination of the baselines

The baseline dataset is a reference line showing the general orientation of the past UMs and it
is utilized to compute rate-of-growth statistics for the temporal UM dataset (Smith and
Cromley 2012). The transects which intersect UMs at the measurement points are required to
estimate UM change rates. In general, the baseline can be delineated in two ways: “OnCity”
and/or “OffCity”, where OnCity stands for casting transects towards the city core and OffCity
stands for casting transects towards the suburbs; however, both can be applied together. As
urban expansion is an accretion process, the OnCity form is performed by buffering the UM of
1976 (in this case 250 m), i.e. the transects will be drawn outwards from the city. In practice,
the shape of the baseline is essential and its orientation inﬂuences the transects’ pattern.

Step 3: Casting transects

After generating baselines, the transects are generated at 50 m intervals and with a length of
25,000 m. This interval value is reasonable because sufﬁcient transects are generated, avoiding
unnecessary computations. In addition to the perpendicular transect calculation, an alternative
approach for generating solar-like transects is tested, which generates a centric shape starting
from the urban center (Figure 3). These two baselines are inputted and two different forms of
transects are generated for the comparison. Both transects are created outwards from the city,
i.e. drawn from the city center towards the suburbs. The intersection of transects with UMs
provides measurement points, where statistics are computed in the next step. Figure 3 shows
how transects commence from the starting points and cross the UMs. The perpendicular
transect approach and the alternative solar approach are both taken into account and two dif-
ferent transects are generated. The main difference between both transects is the angle of inter-
section, which is 90° degrees at the crossing point with the baseline for the perpendicular
transects and variably for each transect line using the solar transects.

Step 4: Calculation of descriptive indices

All processes for computing UM growth rates are based on the measured differences between
UM positions over time. The result expresses the amount of expansion in meters along each
transect per time period. The model facilitates the derivation of the following three indices for
urban expansion analysis (Figure 4):

(a) The Urban Margins Change Envelope (UMCE), which reports the distance between the
UM farthest from and closest to the baseline at each transect. This represents the total
change in UM movement for all margin positions regardless of their temporal states.
(b) Net Urban Margin Movement (NUMM), which indicates the distance of the nearest and
farthest margin from the baseline for only two UMs. It represents the distance between
the ﬁrst and earliest urban margin for each transect.

(c) Finally, the End Point Rate (EPR), which is calculated by dividing the distance of UM
movement by the time elapsed between the ﬁrst and the most recent margin. This index
results in the growth rate per year.

3.4 Model evaluation

In order to evaluate this morphological urban expansion model, the model is applied to
predict the UMs of 2012 for the two transect forms. The UMs of 1976, 1988 and 2000 are
utilized. Thereafter, the predicted UMs of 2012 are compared statistically with the actual UM
of 2012 using the Kappa index (Pontius Jr and Malanson 2005). Kappa indices of 89.5 and
83.6% for the perpendicular and solar-form transects, respectively, are achieved. While both
indices refer to reliable models, it additionally veriﬁes that the perpendicular transects type
is even more appropriate than solar-based transects for casting transects to predict future
UMs.

3.5 Predicted urban margins for the year 2024

The future urban margin (i.e. 2024) is predicted by ﬁtting a least-squares regression to every
UM intersection point, where the response represented by the distance from the baseline is cal-
culated for each UM intersection with transects by using the UM dates as independent vari-
ables. The slope of the regression line represents the growth rate, where distance along each

transect is the dependent variable and date is the independent variable in the regression (Genz
et al. 2007). The enlarged transects, of which their endpoints illustrate the future UM, are
drawn by delineating them from the starting points on the baseline. The end points of the
transects are connected to draw the predicted UM for 2024, as shown in Figure 5 for the per-
pendicular (upper panel) as well as the solar approach (lower panel).

In order to analyze the predicted UM, a mean R2 of all transect measurement points is cal-
culated. The perpendicular approach results in a global R2 of 0.881 (with a range of 0.62 to
0.99), while the solar approach leads to a lower global R2 value of 0.878 (with a range of 0.63
to 0.98). Thus, the perpendicular transects approach again seems a better approach for pre-
dicting the future UM of 2024. However, the difference between both ﬁts is minor. Further-
more, following Bhatta et al. (2010) the variation of mean R2 within eight different sectors on
the basis of cardinal directions is evaluated. The results are depicted in Figure 6. A visual com-
parison of the two predicted margins with the latest actual margin (i.e. 2012), as well as the
physical circumstances through overlaying the Google Earth maps, reveals the following
results:

• Northern sector: The R2 values report a minor difference in favor of perpendicular
transects. As the area in the north of the study area is mountainous, less growth in this
direction is expected due to physical and administrative constraints, hence the margin pro-
jected by using perpendicular transects seems more likely to occur.

• Northeastern sector: The R2 values show minor differences in favor of perpendicular
transects. Due to the establishment and expansion of the Lashgarak highway, new settle-
ments are being constructed. Therefore, the perpendicular transects showing a smooth
margin seem more realistic.

• Eastern sector: A slight difference in favor of the perpendicular transects is apparent.
Whereas the solar transects predict future expansion towards the Sorkhe Hesar national
park in the east of Tehran, the perpendicular transects prediction is rather more acceptable.
• Southeastern sector: Little difference in terms of the R2 on the side of the perpendicular
transects is reported. As the Emam-Reza expressway is located in this sector and develop-
ment has taken place along this expressway, the UM predicted by the perpendicular
transects seems more likely to happen.

• Southern sector: No R2 differences are apparent in the southern sector but, as the Varamin
highway is located towards the 2024 margin predicted by the perpendicular transects, the
perpendicular transects also seem to be a better predictor in this sector.

• Southwestern sector: Similar to the southern sector, the reported R2 values are equal;
however, they are the lowest values compared to the other directions. This means that the
UM movement was substantial and could not easily be ﬁtted linearly. Furthermore, non-
linear regression models may result in a dissimilar prediction, however this study is limited
by an insufﬁcient number of UMs. Nonetheless, nothing can be added based on the visual
interpretation as no evidence can be referred.

• Western sector: The resulting R2 values are identical here. As the movement in this direc-
tion over time has been signiﬁcant, visual interpretation is not helpful. Besides, the model
performance may fall in non-linear regression models.

• Northwestern sector: The reported R2 values are equal. The urban expansion in this direc-
tion has been remarkable as large areas of open land have been available for development.
However, as the UM has now reached the mountainous areas, less expansion than in the
past is expected in this sector. Therefore, the perpendicular transect prediction is more
probable here as well.

In addition, the coverage area for each UM of each year is measured (see Table 1). It
shows a substantially increasing amount of urban expansion in the past as well as for the
upcoming years. There is a 3% difference in the projected area for 2024 from the two
methods. The perpendicular transect method predicts 70,886 ha of development, 17.2% more
than the latest timestamp (i.e. 2012).

In this article, a morphological-based approach, namely the UGM model, is presented as a
practical model to monitor and predict urban expansion. In principle, urban expansion mod-

eling techniques require a number of input variables in order to measure future urban changes.
These models are highly vulnerable to the input variables because different outcomes are deter-
mined as the number of inputs changes. In some cases, particularly in developing countries due
to a lack of quality data, comfortable techniques are those that require fewer input variables.
Besides, in regional and global studies easier and faster solutions are needed, due to difﬁculties
accessing some data, voluminous input data and data incompatibility.

Amongst the developed land change modeling techniques such as CA, Markov chain
models, rule-based modeling, logistic regression models and agent-based modeling, the UGM
model is suitable and is able to fulﬁll the aforementioned criteria. Thus, in this article, the
UGM model was implemented and applied in order to realize its performance for the simula-
tion of urban expansion. Therefore, urban margins of Tehran were explored, monitored and
predicted in order to evaluate and adopt the model for urban growth studies. The empirical
results clearly demonstrate that the UGM model is a simple and straightforward technique
that inputs only the urban margins for different temporal states. To predict future urban
margins at any preferred timeframe based on linear regression, two different approaches for
delineating the baseline were illustrated: perpendicular and solar transects. Both approaches
were applied to predict the UMs of 2012 and compare it with the actual map of built-up areas
for the year 2012. Independent of baseline delineation, Kappa index analysis conﬁrmed a high
model performance for 2012, which justiﬁes the prediction of the future UMs of 2024 using
the two transect types. Although the outcomes show minor differences in the predicted margin
for the year 2024, the perpendicular transects represent more reliable results with an overall
R2 value of 0.881. This was conﬁrmed by sectorial comparisons of model performance
towards different ordinal directions.

This technique has some advantages and disadvantages. For the disadvantages, since the
boundaries are smoothened and simpliﬁed, the urban margins do not represent the real physical
extent of the urban areas exactly, leading to under- and over-estimates. Furthermore, as no envi-
ronmental and socio-economic variables are taken into account, emerging and diffused urban
patterns cannot be described. Its prediction is expectedly rough and linear, while in some areas
expansion may not follow a linear function. The advantages are that this model is very simple
and requires fewer inputs and variables. Furthermore, it does not require extensive computa-
tional resources. After all, this model helps land managers and policy makers to estimate urban
expansion roughly at any given time without collecting and importing several variables and with
less prior knowledge of environmental interactions and activities in study areas.

As proven by this research, the UGM model is a useful technique for measuring spatio-
temporal urban expansion. It requires the input of a minimal number of variables to predict
future changes based on the trend of changes in the past. To sum up, in consensus with
Jackson et al. (2012), it is a highly practical and straightforward model for computing rates of
change for dynamic urban boundaries for discrete time stamps. Moreover, this technique can
be used for a wide variety of planning purposes related to urban management issues, including
policy making, separation of ecological sites and urban landscapes, natural resource investiga-
tions and infrastructure provision.

ABSTRACT
The geometry of impounded surfaces is a key tool to reservoir
storage management and projection. Yet topographic data and
bathymetric surveys of average-aged reservoirs may be absent for
many regions worldwide. This paper examines the potential of
contour line interpolation (TOPO) and Structure from Motion
(SfM) photogrammetry to reconstruct the topography of existing
reservoirs prior to dam closure. The study centres on the Paso de
las Piedras reservoir, Argentina, and assesses the accuracy and
reliability of TOPO- and SfM- derived digital elevation models
(DEMs) using diﬀerent grid resolutions. All DEMs were of accepta-
ble quality. However, diﬀerent interpolation techniques produced
diﬀerent types of error, which increased (or decreased) with
increasing (or decreasing) grid resolution as a function of their
nature, and relative to the terrain complexity. In terms of DEM
reliability to reproduce area–elevation relationships, processing-
related disagreements between DEMs were markedly inﬂuenced
by topography. Even though they produce intrinsic errors,
it is
concluded that both TOPO and SfM techniques hold great poten-
tial to reconstruct the bathymetry of existing reservoirs. For areas
exhibiting similar terrain complexity, the implementation of one or
another technique will depend ultimately on the need for preser-
ving accurate elevation (TOPO) or topographic detail (SfM).

Introduction

World’s rivers are impounded by more than 45,000 large dams, from which about 60%
operate primarily or exclusively for irrigation and water supply (WCD 2000). Although many
dams were built recently – or are currently under construction –, the average large dam
today is about 50 years old. Aged dams providing water from reservoirs face a number of
problems. From these, two major concerns are (i) the increased demand for water, owing to
population growth and increased consumption per capita, and (ii) the gradual loss of the
reservoir storage capacity by sedimentation, all of which prevents the supplying service for
which the dam was designed and reduces its operating life (Annandale 2013, Kondolf et al.
2014). Furthermore, increasing concern on the impacts of climate change has motivated

substantive (re)evaluations of the ability of completed dams to yield water at some level of
reliability, including assessment and projections of reservoir storage capacities (Kang et al.
2007, Kim et al. 2009, Watts et al. 2011, Ceylan and Ekizoglu 2014, Soundharajan et al. 2016,
Ehsani et al. 2017, Ho et al. 2017). Aside from the evaluation of changes in water inﬂows and
outﬂows, assessment and projection of reservoir storage capacities involve an accurate
appreciation of the impounded geometry. This is achieved based on historic topographic
data, bathymetric surveys, remote sensing data, and sedimentation models. Indeed, the so-
called area-volume-elevation curve (AVE) is a key tool to manage the reservoir storage
capacity (Cross and Moore 2014, Sayl et al. 2017).

One major concern is that detailed topographic data prior to dam closure are
unavailable for many projects, and bathymetric surveys allowing reconstructing rates
of reservoir sedimentation may be absent or discontinuous in space and time. Therefore,
rates of capacity loss remain unknown – or need to be updated – for many reservoirs
worldwide. In the absence of historic topographic and bathymetric surveys, the surface
impounded by average-aged reservoirs may be reconstructed using two historical
sources of elevation data: (i) contours extracted from topographic maps, and (ii) histor-
ical aerial photographs. Both data sources are widely available and provide detailed
information on terrain elevation and forms. Yet the process for extracting and proces-
sing elevation data from these sources presents a number of pros and cons. Contour-
and photogrammetry-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) are standard tools in
geosciences, and their applicability to Earth surface and environmental analyses has
been tested and proved by countless studies. However, the quality of contour-derived
DEMs is markedly aﬀected by the processing technique (interpolation and sampling)
relative to the density of contours and the conﬁguration of the terrain surface (Wise
2000, Hengl et al. 2004, Fisher and Tate 2006). On the other hand, photogrammetric
techniques are frequently time-consuming, necessitate a more expensive equipment,
and require specialized user expertise. In recent years, the Structure from Motion (SfM)
has developed into a fast, low-cost and user-friendly tool to obtain three-dimensional
data (dense point clouds) of a scene from a series of unordered overlapping images and
ground control points (Westoby et al. 2012, Fonstad et al. 2013, Micheletti et al. 2015a,
Carrivick et al. 2016). SfM has known an expansion in various ﬁelds because of its greater
ease of use where expert supervision is unnecessary (Micheletti et al. 2015b). However,
the focus of most SfM applications has been the collection and analysis of new photo-
graphy (Warrick et al. 2017). Recent studies have tested the compatibility of SfM with
pre-existing aerial photography to detect changes in volcano landscapes (Derrien et al.
2015, Gomez et al. 2015),
landscapes (Warrick et al. 2017), and in glacier
landscapes (Mertes et al. 2017, Mölg and Bolch 2017). They found that historical photo-
graphs might fulﬁl quality and overlap requirements, which implies a great expansion of
SfM applications.

This paper examines and compares the potential of traditional contour line interpola-
tion and new SfM photogrammetry to reconstruct the topography beneath aged
reservoirs using two aﬀordable and widely available sources of elevation data. It seeks
to address two major questions: (1) how accurate and reliable are the DEMs obtained
from historical sources of elevation data given their inherent quality issues; and (ii) for
similar processing-related time cost and expertise, what is the processing technique that
best ﬁt to reconstruct the bathymetry of average-aged reservoirs in regions where

topographic surveys prior to impoundment are unavailable or unreliable. In addition to
providing a new example of the application of SfM photogrammetry using historic aerial
photography, this study implements a robust methodology allowing determining the
quality of DEMs reproducing past topography. The DEMs produced herein have direct
applicability as a proxy of historical bathymetric data. Bathymetric reconstructions of
aged reservoirs underpin further development of sedimentation models and hydrologi-
cal derivatives, and therefore have great potential for applicability as a water manage-
ment tool.

Materials and methods

Study site

The study centres on the reservoir Paso de las Piedras on the Sauce Grande River, a
middle-size basin excavated within a dry sub-humid, sub-mountain plain located in
south-western Buenos Aires, Argentina (Figure 1). Mean annual rainfall decreases from
800 mm in the uplands to 640 mm in the lowlands, and elevation ranges from 1240 m in
the headwaters (Ventania Range) to 60 m on the frontal scarp that separates the plain
from the coastal zone. Dominant land uses are rain-fed agriculture and livestock grazing
of unimproved grasslands; population density within the river basin is very low. The
reservoir operates since 1978 for drinking water supply to a population that today
exceeds 350,000 people and concentrates in the cities of Bahía Blanca and Punta Alta.

At full supply, it has a surface area of 36 km2, depth of 25 m, and maximum capacity of
328 m310−6 (Schefer 2004). The river ﬂow regime is rain-fed and ﬂashy; mean annual
ﬂow is 4.54 m3 s−1, and peak ﬂows may reach more than 1000 m3 s−1 in few hours. Inter-
annual ﬂow variability is marked, and linked primarily to alternating phases of El Niño –
Southern Oscillation phenomenon (Scian 2000) inducing episodes of drier- and wetter-
than-normal climate (Campo et al. 2009, Bohn et al. 2011). Increasing water demand due
to population growth and decreasing water availability due to recurrence of drought
combine to generate low resilience to water scarcity, and impact very seriously on the
eﬃciency and sustainability of local water resources management.

DEM processing

We have produced eight DEMs using a combination of (i) two processing techniques,
contour line interpolation and SfM photogrammetry, and (ii) four diﬀerent output
resolutions (5, 10, 30, and 50 m). The models were produced for a sample area of
455 km2 delimited within the middle river basin (Figure 1). In addition to containing the
topographic depression impounded by the reservoir, this area is particularly interesting
because it includes a combination of ridges, plains and valleys providing a variety of
landforms on which to test the accuracy and the reliability of the DEMs. Elevation within
the sample area ranges from 295 m on the top ridge to 128 m on the valley bottom.
Note that the area used to extract the models was reduced by 2.5-km side to avoid
boundary distortions during model processing. All models were projected using UTM
coordinates to ensure compatibility between diﬀerent sources of information; elevation
values, however, refer to the Campo Inchauspe datum as it constitutes the reference
system used in Argentina until the 90’s.

Topographic data extraction
The sample area is located at the intersection of four contiguous topographic map
sheets (1:50,000) produced between 1962 and 1968 by the Instituto Geográﬁco Militar,
now Instituto Geográﬁco Nacional (IGN, Argentina). Scanned versions of the maps (600
dpi) were corrected by polynomial restitution using the intersections of the projection
grid (Gauss-Krüger). From these, we have extracted four sets of topographic data
(Figure 2). These included (i) 10-m interval contour lines, (ii) streamlines, (iii) spot
elevations in visible ground locations such as road junctions and parcel plots (calibration
points), and (iv) spot elevations in less visible ground locations such as topographic and
geodesic benchmarks (validation points). It should be noted that both contour- and SfM-
derived DEMs were produced using the same set of calibration points to ensure
coherence of the results.

Contour-derived DEMs
The models were created using the Topo to Raster command in ArcGIS (TOPO), a thin plate
spline method based on the algorithm developed by Hutchinson (1988, 1989)).
Interpolation used contours as primary type of elevation data, calibration points, and
streamlines (Figure 2). In addition to working intelligently with contour data (primary type
of input data), TOPO infers ﬂow paths and removes false sinks to produce a hydrologically
correct raster surface. TOPO does not require prior transformation of the input data, yet one

must ensure that streamline arcs point in the downstream direction and that contour lines
for equal elevation levels are merged correctly.

SfM-derived DEMs
SfM is a new photogrammetric technique for surface restitution relying on the most
recent automated image matching approach (Fonstad et al. 2013, Warrick et al. 2017).
This study uses SfM to (i) produce dense clouds of topographic points from sequences of
historic aerial photography, and (ii) create a DEM from interpolation of the dense point
cloud. SfM analysis was conducted entirely in Agisoft PhotoScan Pro (v.1.2.5). Inputs
included 31 scanned aerial photographs (1200 dpi) dating from 1961 (1:35,000; IGN).
Photo quality index ranges between 0.81 and 0.94, photo end lap is ~ 60%, and photo
side lap is ~ 30%. By default, PhotoScan estimates intrinsic camera parameters for photo
alignment based on the information contained in EXIF meta-data. In the absence of EXIF
ﬁles, camera groups were calibrated manually by ﬁxing the focal length (shown in the
inscription of the photographs) and the pixel size (calculated as the quotient between

6

the number of pixels and the image size). Other pre-processing steps included (i) setting
the camera precision according to the measurement accuracy of old photographs, and
(ii) masking the lateral inscriptions of the photographs and boundaries exhibiting a high
degree of distortion.

DEM extraction followed the standard SfM workﬂow, namely (i) photo alignment, (ii)
3D point cloud extraction, and (iii) DEM generation (Westoby et al. 2012, Fonstad et al.
2013). As camera positions were unknown, photo alignment used high accuracy and
generic pair preselection settings. It also constrained features by mask to avoid including
photo boundaries and lateral inscriptions in the alignment process. Initial camera posi-
tions were optimized using a set of 35 Ground Control Points (GCP) corresponding to
the set of calibration points extracted from the topographic maps (Figure 2). Unlike
conventional photogrammetry, SfM requires a small number of GCP to scale and
reference point clouds (Fonstad et al. 2013, Micheletti et al. 2015b). The 3D point
cloud was extracted from optimized camera positions using aggressive depth ﬁlter to
remove small surface details. In the second step, results were classiﬁed to diﬀerentiate
ground points from noise and unclassiﬁed elements of the terrain surface such as
vegetation and buildings. The DEM was generated using the cloud of ground points
only. This last step permitted to eliminate some errors of the model automatically. The
models were then exported into .tiﬀ format to be incorporated in ArcGIS.

DEM quality assessment

One of the greatest challenges to assess the quality of DEMs that reconstruct past
topography is the overall lack of historic elevation data on which to base descriptive
statistics of error. In areas impounded by average-aged reservoirs, such as it is the focus
of this study, this challenge is even greater because the terrain surface has been
progressively covered by water. Since the elevation parameters of both TOPO and SfM
models build on the pre-existing cartography, it follows that elevation values obtained
from the topographic maps provide the most reasonable basis on which to test the
vertical accuracy of the models. However, this procedure provides a simple, global
summary of error, and may not assist in identifying the source of error (Wise 2000). As
reported by Fisher and Tate (2006), elevation-based DEM quality assessments may fail to
describe the spatial pattern of error, and in a DEM errors are likely to vary spatially. This
study implements an integrative DEM quality assessment that considers (i) the DEM
accuracy to reproduce actual terrain elevation and shapes, and (ii) the DEM reliability to
preserve spatial patterns of topography (Figure 3). Whereas accuracy measures the ﬁt
between de DEM and the terrain surface, reliability measures the quality of DEM-derived
products (Desmet 1997, Wise 2000, Hengl et al. 2004), namely area–elevation relation-
ships for the purpose of this paper.

Accuracy assessment
The ﬁrst step in assessing the DEM accuracy consisted in determining the ﬁt between a
sample of elevation points extracted from the models (ZDEM) and known elevations
extracted from the topographic maps (ZREF). Errors were reported as the mean error (ME)
and the root mean square error (RMSE), both metrics being popularly used as an indicator
of bias and statistical distribution of error, respectively (Fisher and Tate 2006). A more

et al. (2004); right: modiﬁed from Fawcett (2006).

comprehensive approach, however, consists in determining DEM errors based on patterns
of values rather than on isolated samples (Wise 2000). These errors are commonly referred
to as relative errors, and may be detected using neighbourhood analysis in a Geographic
Information System (GIS). According to Hengl et al. (2004) two common types of relative
error are (i) padi terraces or cut-oﬀs, deﬁned as artiﬁcial ﬂat areas where all cells have the
same elevation value; and (ii) outliers, deﬁned as isolated cells with anomalous, improbable
elevation values.

Padi terraces were detected using metrics of variety, which computes the number of
unique cell values within focal neighbouring windows (Figure 3). For a 3 × 3 neighbouring
window variety ranges from 1 to 9, where 1 indicates that all nine cells have the same
elevation value and 9 indicates the opposite. The algorithm requires integer values as
input, so that DEMs were multiplied by 100 to preserve 1 cm-precision in cell elevation
values. Outliers were detected using the statistical approach of Felicísimo (1994), which
builds on probability distributions of error across the entire DEM. Errors were calculated on
a cell-by-cell basis by comparing the original elevation value of a DEM (Zi) with the
elevation value estimated from its neighbours (Ẑi
NB). Given the assumption of smooth
terrain, diﬀerences between Zi and Ẑi
NB should be small (Wise 2000). Outliers are therefore
detected from extreme deviations of normalized residuals using a simple Student’s t test
(Figure 3). For the two-tail 99.9% probability (α = 0.001) the value of t is 3.291.

Absolute and relative accuracy metrics were computed globally as well as separately
for areas exhibiting diﬀerent degree of terrain slope. This provided an idea of the spatial
distribution of errors across the models. Slope classes include ﬂatlands (<0.5°), lands
gently inclined (0.5° to 2°), and rolling lands (>2°).

Reliability assessment
The DEM ability to reproduce area–elevation relationships for varying reservoir water
levels (or reservoir depths) was inspected using the Receiver Operating Characteristics

(ROC) approach (Figure 3). Reference surfaces were obtained from classiﬁcation of 17
Landsat images (30 m-resolution) capturing the reservoir lake for varying water levels
ranging from low (143 m a.s.l.; 3 m-depth) to high (165 m a.s.l.; 25 m-depth). The vertical
spacing between consecutive reference surfaces is ± 1 m, except for reference surfaces
between 145 and 154 m a.s.l. where the vertical spacing is ± 3 m. Image classiﬁcation
was achieved in ArcGIS using near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands to
clearly diﬀerentiate the waterbody delineated by the reservoir lake (Frazier and Page
2000). Corresponding surface estimates were obtained from reclassiﬁcation of the DEMs
into two classes delimited by the absolute water levels identiﬁed above. This produced
17 maps by primary model type and sampling resolution (i.e. 136 maps in total)
reproducing the surface that would be impounded for a given reservoir water level
(or reservoir depth).

Confusion matrices classiﬁed the DEM-derived surface for a given water level (esti-
mated impounded surface) against the reference surface extracted from satellite ima-
gery (real impounded surface). This provided four classes of outcomes by reservoir water
level: (i) impounded surfaces classed as impounded surfaces counted as true positives; (ii)
impounded surfaces classed as not impounded surfaces counted as false negatives; (iii)
not impounded surfaces classed as not impounded surfaces counted as true negatives;
and (iv) not impounded surfaces classed as impounded surfaces counted as false
positives. This matrix constitutes the basis for a number of common metrics of model
performance, namely, sensitivity (or recall), false alarm, precision and accuracy (Fawcett
2006). ROC curves usually compare true positive rates (i.e. proportion of positives
correctly classiﬁed relative to the total positives) and false positive rates (i.e. proportion
of negatives incorrectly classiﬁed relative to the total negatives) to illustrate trade-oﬀs
between model sensitivity (or recall) and false alarm (Fawcett 2006). This study uses the
metric of precision (i.e. proportion of true positives relative to the sum of false positives
and true positives) instead of the false positive rate because in spatial analysis the total
number of negatives may be as large as the area delimited for analysis. As argued by
Saito and Rehmsmeier (2015), precision-recall curves (PRC) perform better when evalu-
ating binary classiﬁers on imbalanced datasets, such as it is the case in spatial analysis.

Results

DEM accuracy

Coeﬃcients of determination between elevation estimates and known elevations
extracted from the topographic maps (validation points) were close to unity for all
eight DEMs suggesting well-ﬁtted models (Figure 4). The ME was between −0.3 and
−0.4 m for TOPO models, and between 1.7 and 1.8 m for SfM models; the error
dispersion (RMSE) ranged from 2.2 to 3.3 m, and from 5.3 to 6 m, respectively.
Interestingly, minimum absolute errors increased in magnitude with increasing grid
cell size for both model types. This indicates a tendency to lowering elevation with
increasing terrain smoothing, the coarser DEMs (50 m-resolution) showing the greatest
RMSE. Another interesting aspect is that the ME was negative for all models. Although
small ME values indicate that positive and negative bias are uniformly distributed, the

negative sign indicates an overall tendency to underestimation of elevation irrespective
of the processing technique and the sampling resolution of the DEMs.

Figure 5 illustrates the distribution of elevation errors as a function of varying terrain
slope. Errors from TOPO interpolation were more pronounced in ﬂatlands (class 1) and in
rolling lands (class 3) than in lands gently inclined (class 2), and increased with increas-
ing grid cell size at rates of between 3 and 7% (class 1) and between 3 and 60% (class 3).

This indicates a complex relationship between contour density, grid resolution and
terrain complexity. Errors in ﬂatlands result from inadequate contour density to derive
an accurate interpolation of the terrain surface in areas of low relief, and increase
gradually with increasing grid cell size as a consequence of terrain smoothing. As the
terrain slope increases, the density of contours increases as well and the vertical model
accuracy improves. Yet the RMSE in rolling lands remains higher than the RMSE in lands
gently inclined. This occurs because, in areas of high relief, such as hills and ridges,
extrapolation from closed contours or scale-dependent suppression of contours may
result in large elevation errors. A second aspect to highlight is the inadequacy of the
coarsest TOPO models to reproduce the complexity of the terrain surface. Relative to
10 m-TOPO, the RMSE from 30 m-TOPO increments by 7% (class 1) and by 60% (class 3),
and the RSME from 50 m-TOPO increments by 11% and by 112%, respectively.
In
opposition, errors from SfM restitution were notably more aﬀected by terrain slope
than by varying grid cell size. The RMSE increased with increasing terrain inclination
up to 15% between class 1 and 2, and up to 54% between class 2 and 3. An interesting
aspect is that elevation errors were relatively fairly distributed for all terrain classes and
model resolutions, and exhibited an overall tendency to underestimation of altitude that
was notably most marked in areas of steep terrain. These aspects indicate deﬁciencies in
DEM processing relative to the quality and texture of the photographs, the accuracy in
the identiﬁcation of ground control points, or both.

Contrasting results emerged from pattern-based error assessment. SfM models exhib-
ited the greatest variety in neighbouring elevation values for all sampling resolutions
(Figure 6 (a)), with diﬀerences of up to + 15% relative to TOPO models of equal
resolution. Variety distributions with varying terrain slope diﬀerentiated SfM from
TOPO models as well (Figure 6 (b)). Whereas SfM models exhibited similar variety
distributions for all three terrain slope classes, TOPO models showed clear concentration
of low variety values in ﬂatlands (e.g. variety is less than 4 for 29% of cells in 5 m-TOPO)
and high variety values in rolling lands (e.g. variety is more than 6 for 57% of cells in
5 m-TOPO). Despite these variety diﬀerences between primary model types, the propor-
tion of paddy terraces (i.e. cells showing equal elevation values) decreased with increas-
ing grid cell size for both SfM and TOPO models. Naturally, padi terraces are increasingly
removed with decreasing resolution because elevation values result progressively from
interpolation of greater neighbouring elevation areas.

On the other hand, outlier assessment revealed that both TOPO and SfM models
perform ﬁne. Percent of outliers (i.e. proportion of anomalous cell values relative to the
total number of cells) was near 1% for all eight DEMs (Figure 7), although TOPO models
exhibited smallest error ranges than SfM models (−0.9 m to 4.9 m and −28.1 m to
11.7 m, respectively). Interestingly, outliers in TOPO models increased in proportion and
magnitude with increasing grid cell size, whereas outliers in SfM models decreased in
proportion but increased in magnitude. This is closely related to the way errors dis-
tribute across the models, relative to the conﬁguration of the terrain surface and to the
method used to detect them. Outliers in SfM models distribute randomly on the terrain
surface reﬂecting texture changes between overlapping images, and tend to cluster in
noisy areas were reﬂectance is aﬀected by topographic eﬀects (e.g. 45 to 53% of outliers
are localised in rolling lands). Isolated anomalous cell values are increasingly removed
with increasing grid cell size as a consequence of terrain smoothing. Outliers clustered in

tions by terrain slope class (b).

steep areas, however, are not necessarily removed with increasing grid cell size but
increased in magnitude because the diﬀerence between original elevation values and
elevation values estimated from the neighbouring cells also increases. This tendency is
also found in TOPO models, where outliers are markedly clustered in rolling lands and
increase in proportion with grid cell size from 83 to 87%. In these cases, outliers may not
necessarily indicate a source of error but the inability of low-resolution models to
reproduce elevation in areas of steep terrain accurately.

DEM reliability

Irrespective of accuracy-related disagreements, both TOPO and SfM models are
highly reliable to reproduce impounded surface areas for varying reservoir water
levels (Figure 8). Linear correlations are close to unity in all cases, although
residuals occur and are most marked in the lowest extreme of the distribution.
This indicates a better model adjustment to simulate area–elevation relationships at
inability to reconstruct such relationships with
high reservoir levels, but a model

area-elevation reference maps for the lowest reservoir water levels is ± 3 m,
it
follows that vertical errors may attain as much as ± 3 m depth. In terms of surface
area, expressed as the proportion of the real surface area impounded for a given

elevation level, residuals were up to + 93% (SfM; 143 m a.s.l.) and −43% (TOPO;
145 m a.s.l.). The inﬂuence of varying topography on the reliability of TOPO- and
SfM-derived DEMs was notably more important than the inﬂuence of varying DEM
resolution.

This latter aspect is clearly reﬂected by PRC curves (Figure 9). Classiﬁers appearing in
the upper right corner (1, 1) represent the best compromise between the model
sensitivity to estimate the surface impounded for a given reservoir water level and the
model precision to avoid classiﬁcation of surfaces that are not really impounded for that
reservoir water level. Such classiﬁers correspond to maps reproducing impounded
surfaces for medium to high reservoir water levels (≥ 151 m a.s.l.). As the vertical spacing
it follows that TOPO and SfM models are not only
between these maps is ± 1 m,
performing to reproduce area–elevation relationships within the topographic depression
that contains the reservoir lake but also to maintain such relationships within a range of
vertical error smaller than 1 m-depth. As for the lowest reservoir water levels (i.e. water
levels near the maximum reservoir depth), PRC curves separate TOPO and SfM models
into two well-deﬁned, contrasting groups. TOPO models produce the lowest true
positive rates (0.44 < tp< 0.76) with the highest precision rates (0.84 < p < 0.92), whereas
SfM models produce the highest true positives rates (0.81 < tp < 0.95) with the lowest
precision rates (0.42 < p < 0.77). This indicates that TOPO models tend to underestimate
the surface area impounded for low reservoir water levels (true positive rates are low),
even though the impounded surface extracted from them remains within the limits of

Discussion

Reconstructing the bathymetry of aged reservoirs is inherently complex because eleva-
tion data sources decrease in availability and reliability with time backwards. In addition,
the time and the cost inherent to conducting bathymetric surveys make this kind of
information unavailable or discontinuous for many regions worldwide. Topographic data
prior to dam closure remain essential because they reveal terrain forms that provide
crucial insights for reservoir storage capacity management and projection through area-
volume-elevation curves (Cross and Moore 2014, Sayl et al. 2017). Furthermore, the
understanding gained from sedimentation models run on the basis of accurate and
reliable parameters of the reservoir geometry is essential for predicting the future
response of reservoirs to population and climate changes (Watts et al. 2011, Kondolf
et al. 2014, Ehsani et al. 2017).

This paper tested and compared the accuracy and the reliability of TOPO- and SfM-
derived DEMs of varying resolution to reconstruct the topography of an average-aged
reservoir prior to dam closure. Although all DEMs were of acceptable quality, there were
slight quality disagreements between primary model types and sampling resolutions.
TOPO DEMs emerged as the most accurate models in terms of vertical ﬁt;
i.e. they
showed the lowest RMSE, and a low proportion of outliers with the lowest magnitude.
On the other hand, SfM DEMs emerged as the most accurate models in terms of
elevation variety; i.e. they provided the greatest topographic detail. However, diﬀerent
interpolation techniques produced diﬀerent
types of error, which increased (or
decreased) with increasing (or decreasing) resolution as a function of their nature, and
relative to the terrain complexity. Errors in contour-derived DEMs result from deﬁciencies
of the interpolation algorithm relative to the relationship between the density of
contours used in interpolation and the complexity of the terrain surface (Wise 2000,
Hengl et al. 2004, Fisher and Tate 2006). TOPO DEMs were aﬀected by this relationship in
various ways. First, elevation errors were linked to the contour spacing relative to terrain
characteristics Since heights between contours are not necessarily equally distributed –
such as it is assumed by the interpolating algorithm – errors in ﬂatlands may be as large
as the contour interval (Carrara et al. 1997), and will tend to decrease with increasing
terrain energy unless slopes are too steep (Hengl et al. 2004), or are heavily dissected by
steeped terrain forms (Wise 2000). Second, elevation errors increased with increasing
grid cell size, and revealed a clear tendency to lowering elevation with resolution
irrespective of the terrain characteristics. Vertical accuracy loss with lowering resolution
has been reported elsewhere (Gao 1997, Pardo Pascual et al. 2002, Ziadat 2007), and
results from a systematic attenuation of the relief as the DEM resolution becomes
coarser (Grohmann 2015). Third, TOPO DEMs were aﬀected by artefacts, with a clear
dominance of ﬂatland terracing and outlier clustering in rolling lands. Artefacts result
from limitations of the interpolation algorithm relative to the contour spacing and shape
(Hengl et al. 2004), and their distribution on a DEM was therefore found to be spatially
correlated to terrain forms (Bonin and Rousseaux 2005, Carlisle 2005, Erdoğan 2010).
Interestingly, artefacts were found to behave diﬀerently with increasing grid cell size.

Whereas elevation variety improved notably, outliers increased in proportion and mag-
nitude. These trends may be explained using the approach of Xie et al. (2003). Flatlands
are represented by single-value cells or SVC (i.e. cells deﬁned by one single contour) and
by no-value cells or NVC (i.e. cells estimated by interpolation of nearby SVC). As the grid
resolution increases, elevation variety increases as well because NVCs and SVCs are
progressively integrated into multi-value cells or MVC. In areas of steep slope, however,
interpolation from two or more contour lines fails to address elevation in large MVCs,
and so local outliers increase along with grid cell size.

Errors in photogrammetry-derived models may involve a variety of sources including
camera internal parameters, imaging settings, and processing algorithms and software (Dai
et al. 2014). Although SfM restitution solves the camera pose and scene geometry simulta-
neously and automatically (Westoby et al. 2012), SfM works by matching image texture in
diﬀerent photographs as in traditional photogrammetry (James and Robson 2012, Fonstad
et al. 2013, Micheletti et al. 2015b). It therefore follows that SfM-derived DEMs will reﬂect
intrinsic image texture-related limitations. For example, areas showing little texture or diﬀer-
ent coloration at diﬀerent orientations will yield poor point clouds and may not be recon-
structed (James and Robson 2012, Fonstad et al. 2013), and locations occluded from multiple
viewing such as areas masked by vegetation or shadows may lead to incomplete point cloud
coverage as well (Dandois and Ellis 2013, Micheletti et al. 2015a). Texture-related changes in
multiple viewing images may explain a good proportion of artefacts within SfM DEMs
presented herein. Although dense vegetation and artiﬁcial structures are absent, our study
area exhibits alternating crop, grazing and fallow ﬁelds that may induce local variations of the
ground level in ﬂatlands, and is dissected by steeped terrain forms (valleys and hills) that may
aﬀect restitution results in rolling lands due to the eﬀects of shading. Artefacts will therefore
cluster in noisy areas where reﬂectance or topographic eﬀects diﬃcult detection of key points
and tie point matching (Mölg and Bolch 2017). Furthermore, the quality of DEMs derived from
dense point clouds will be additionally aﬀected by the eﬃciency of the interpolating algo-
rithm relative to the point density. Unfortunately, PhotoScan provides too little information on
the interpolation technique it uses to create DEMs. It is mentioned, however, that DEMs are
built using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation.
IDW could be
responsible for a good proportion of error in ﬂat areas because of the low point density on
which to base an accurate interpolation. Despite these limitations, SfM DEMs were of high
relative quality, and elevation errors remained within the error range reported for other SfM-
derived DEMs (e.g. −6.6 to 10.5 m SfM-LIDAR diﬀerence in Pedernales River; Fonstad et al.
2013, 4.9 m RMSE in Zmuttgletscher glacier; Mertes et al. 2017, 4.4 m RMSE in Ny Ålesund
glacier; Mölg and Bolch 2017).

In this case,

On the other hand, reliability analysis revealed that all eight DEMs were highly consistent to
reproduce area–elevation relationships irrespective of the primary model type and resolution.
This was particularly true for medium and high reservoir water levels; as for the lowest
reservoir water levels (or the highest reservoir depths), TOPO DEMs were comparatively less
sensitive (i.e. area–elevation relationships were underestimated), and SfM DEMs were com-
paratively less precise (i.e. area–elevation relationships were overestimated). These results
indicate the eﬀects of complex topography on the bottom of the reservoir lake. Indeed, the
river ﬂowed conﬁned within a broad, deeply incised valley ﬂanked by steeped terrace levels. It
is therefore not surprising that DEMs are less reliable to reconstruct area–elevation relation-
ships within such a contrasting topographic setting. Yet diﬀerent processing methods

16

A. CASADO ET AL.

produce diﬀerent types of error: (i) TOPO DEMs underestimate area–elevation relationships
because the interpolation algorithm fails to estimate altitudes within semi-closed contours
representing a roughly ﬂat valley ﬂoor (Wise 2000); (ii) SfM DEMs overestimate altitudes due to
the fattening eﬀect induced by complex terrain against the uniform motion assumption
(Jalobeanu 2011). Irrespective of the direction of error, low reliability in low-level area-eleva-
tion estimations will logically propagate into storage capacity predictions, and will have a
direct impact on computations of capacity loss because they aﬀect the zone allocated to the
dead volume; i.e. the reservoir zone where sedimentation occurs. Thus, volume calculations
derived from the DEMs produced herein should be conducted carefully, as DEMs must be
corrected prior to computing AVE-based estimates and derivatives.

Which model to choose then?

Results from this investigation revealed that there is no clear superiority of one
processing method to reproduce accurate and reliable terrain elevation and forms.
One major advantage of new SfM photogrammetry over traditional contour line
interpolation is that it allows reconstructing topography with acceptable quality
and ﬁne resolution for large-scale areas in few hours.
In addition, using SfM with
aerial topography brings new and interesting possibilities for environmental analysis
through diachronic applications (Derrien et al. 2015, Gomez et al. 2015, Mertes et al.
2017, Mölg and Bolch 2017, Warrick et al. 2017). From a hydrological point of view,
SfM models may have several additional beneﬁts over traditional contour-derived
DEMs. First, the relative accuracy of SfM DEMs was markedly superior and, in DEM-
based hydrological analysis, accuracy in the representation of terrain forms is notably
more important than accuracy in terrain elevation (Kenward et al. 2000, Wise 2000).
Second, SfM models provided detailed information on microforms that may be very
useful to compute sedimentation rates because they allow detecting zones that
promote or prevent sedimentation. Yet SfM models are markedly aﬀected by image
texture homogeneity and/or change from multiple viewing (James and Robson 2012,
Fonstad et al. 2013). Furthermore, there is still a number of questions to solve
regarding the use of aerial photography as input for SfM models, especially regarding
intrinsic image resolution, quality, geometry and overlapping issues (Gomez et al.
2015). As for the choice of a given model resolution, previous experience has
demonstrated that coarser resolutions are more suitable for hydrological modelling
(Wang et al. 2000, Le Coz et al. 2009, Nourani et al. 2013), whilst hillslope and other
hydrologically signiﬁcant terrain details can be lost (Hancock 2005, Grohmann 2015).
We therefore suggest restricting the use of ﬁne DEM resolutions (<10m) for analysis
requiring high topographic detail, such as computation of sedimentation rates, as
coarser DEM resolutions have little inﬂuence on large-scale hydrologic predictions
and contribute to accelerate the time required for processing notably.

Conclusions

This paper tested the applicability of two robust and widely applicable techniques – traditional
contour line interpolation and new Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry – to obtain
topographic data allowing reconstructing the bathymetry of average-aged reservoirs prior

to dam closure. Results outlined that both techniques hold great potential to reconstruct past
topography with low money and time investments, and require a low level of expertise. Yet
they both present intrinsic limitations, and the DEMs derived from them must be corrected to
improve their hydrological plausibility. The greatest advantage of contour line interpolation
over SfM photogrammetry is that intrinsic errors are well-known, and advances in computing
and GISciences allow improving the quality of contour-derived DEMs notably. Indeed, SfM is a
new automated technique developed to work intelligently with recent photography, and
there is still a number of questions to solve relative to its performance with historic aerial
photography and inherent resolution, quality, geometry and overlapping issues. Yet SfM DEMs
provide the greatest variety of terrain landforms with high topographic detail, all of which
opens an array of possibilities for environmental monitoring, prediction and management. It is
therefore concluded that, for areas with similar terrain complexity, the implementation of one
or another technique will depend ultimately on the users’ need for preserving accurate
elevation (contour interpolation) or topographic detail (SfM). In areas strongly vegetalized
and/or exhibiting great terrain complexity, however, traditional contour-derived DEMs are
expected to be more performant than new SfM DEMs for similar processing-related time cost
and expertise.

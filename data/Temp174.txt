The main goal of this research is to investigate the influence of a map’s background colour on user preferences regarding
labels’ typography, including their size, shape, orientation and texture. Four sets of backgrounds were tested: blank maps,
grey scale, hot colours and cold colours. The foreground of these maps is populated with name labels, which are associated
with point objects or areal objects. Bertin’s visual variables were applied to this set of name labels, both separately and in
combination. User preferences of different typographic variations were registered and compared on the basis of different
background colours using a one-way ANOVA. The results indicated that the typographic design of the map labels should
not be adapted according to the map’s background colour.

Keywords: map background colour, typographic design, text perception, users’ preference, digital maps

INTRODUCTION

A map is a composition of feature representations, which
are generalized and visualized using three object types:
points, lines and areas. Each of these objects is symbolized
and visualized using a set of visual variables: colour,
orientation, size, shape, texture and value. Bertin (1970)
studied these visual variables and linked them with
perceptual properties (associativity, selectivity, order and
quantity) to set rules for their appropriate use. The goal
of Bertin’s rules was to improve the design of the indivi-
dual elements on a map so that map users could interpret
and understand the map’s content more efﬁciently.
Combinations of these visual variables are frequently used
within one map element; for example, a thicker blue line
indicates a more important (size indicating order) river
(colour indicating selection). Over the years, extensions to
these basic rules have been proposed, especially with the
rise of
three-dimensional and dynamic representations
(MacEachren, 1995). Garlandini and Fabrikant (2009)
rightly noted that very few of these long-standing carto-
graphic design principles had ever been tested with actual
map users. They concluded from their experiment that the
visual variable size was considered the most efﬁcient and
effective variable for visual communication.

In addition to points, lines and areas, name labels are an
object type that is often overlooked. These labels can
present much more information than other
types of
symbols, as they contain two ‘levels’ of information. First,

they inform the map reader about the toponym of a certain
geographical location, information that cannot be presented
using another type of symbol. Second, their typography and
placement may stress the hierarchy, classiﬁcation and/or
spatial structure of the associated object (Imhof, 1975).
Fairbairn (1993) considered text to be an indispensable
(fourth) map element in addition to points, lines and areas.
He extensively described the different purposes that text may
have on maps. Normally, text is placed on top of other map
layers representing, for example, thematic information such
as property values. As a consequence, these underlying map
elements – and especially their colour – may inﬂuence the
user’s perception of the text.

Bartz (1970) discussed the inﬂuence of typographic size
and its appropriate dimensions using time measurements.
Her study was limited to topographic maps printed on
paper. However, she concluded that the ﬁgure–ground
relation, location on the map, relation and contrast with
other labels are much more important than size variations
when locating target labels. Starting from Bertin’s work on
visual variables, Kraak and Ormeling (2010) suggested a set
of rules related to the correct use of typography on maps.
labelling
These rules concern hierarchical and nominal
presentation; the authors proposed boldness, size, spacing,
colour value and case style to indicate hierarchy. In
addition, they proposed using colour, shape and italiciza-
tion to indicate nominal differences. The inﬂuence of word
crowding, which is affected by line spacing and word
spacing, on the speed of reading plain text, was studied by

Yu et al. (2011). In addition, demonstrating the legibility of
serif and sans serif fonts was the main concern of Arditi and
Cho (2005), who investigated normal reading tasks on
plain text. The serif font was found slightly more legible
than the sans serif font. Sans serif fonts were tested by
Feldmann and Kreiter (2006) on topographical maps.
Laboratory tests of Arial, Univers and Frutiger revealed
similar reading speeds for the sans serif fonts. The variation
in the typographic preference of different users considering
their experience and gender was studied by Deeb et al.
(2012). The authors used blank maps and located some
differences between the investigated user groups.

Based on the work of Bertin (1970), text characteristics –
such as size, colour, spacing, upper and lower case – can be
linked to a certain visual variable and thus to certain
characteristics of perception by the map reader. Therefore,
the function of a label is determined by its own design and
inﬂuenced by the surrounding elements. The combined
application of visual variables on map objects may cause
unwanted inﬂuences on the interpretation of the objects
themselves or on neighbouring objects. Special care should
be taken when using colours. Cleveland and McGill (1983),
for example, investigated the inﬂuence that colours have
on users’ perception of object sizes. They used a simple
thematic map representing counties in the state of Nevada
(USA). Different colours were used to create different
stimuli. The authors concluded that the use of colours on
maps can cause optical illusions: areas represented in red
were thought to be larger despite having the same size.

The colour of the objects in a choropleth map may also
inﬂuence the perceived colour of adjacent objects, due to
lateral inhibition. When two objects are represented with the
same shade of grey, they will appear differently if they are
surrounded by objects with a darker shade or a lighter shade
of grey (MachEachren, 1995; Monmonier, 1996). Brewer
(1996) suggested avoiding the combination of complemen-
tary colours within one map. She discovered that if an object
is surrounded by objects with a different colour, its colour
will shift towards the complement of the surrounding colour.
A number of user studies focused on determining users’
preferences regarding the use of certain colours or colour
combinations (Granger, 1955; Ou et al., 2004 among
others). Ou et al.  (2004) studied the relation between the
preference of colour combinations on the one hand and
colour emotions or colour harmony on the other hand.

However, previous studies did not consider the relation
with other map objects. Steiniger and Weiber (2007)
investigated the horizontal relationship between objects
and their relation to map constraints and cartometric
measures including geometric, topological, semantic, sta-
tistical and structural properties of map objects. They
proposed a typology to formalize these relations, which can
be used as an aid in the automated generalization. This
study, like most other related studies, did not consider text
to be an independent object.

Most

studies mentioned earlier

investigated users’
performance measures, not their preference of typography
given a certain stimulus (map in this case). Wood (1993)
described different levels at which a users can express their
preference. He

artistic. In this case, the map is seen only as a piece of art. At
the second level, the overall structure and balance of the
map and its composing elements are considered. These
elements include symbolization, colour and typography
(Karssen, 1980; Wood, 1993).

This paper considers the users’ preference response at
both levels. The users’ preferences
towards a certain
functional typography of labels are studied in combination
with varying background colours of the maps. Thanks to
modern cartography and display methods, maps can be
visualized and manipulated on screen. Because the old
typographic research considered only paper maps,
it is
important to consider new aspects that are inherently
related to digital maps, such as (limited) screen sizes and
resolutions (Peterson, 2003). When considering the quality
of a website (which may include maps), user preferences
cannot be ignored. The number of websites that currently
contain maps is unmeasured and increases every day.
Therefore, preference is an important aspect when design-
ing maps for websites to ensure that users continue to
visiting them. The goal of
studying user preferences
(regarding the design of texts) is the improvement of the
maps’ design to facilitate the communication process: a
certain message must be transferred to the map reader. The
main goal can be subdivided into two objectives. First, it is
important to identify the impact of using different options
regarding visual variables on the map users’ preference.
Second, the research investigates the inﬂuence of the map
background onto users’ preference for the typographic
foreground. In the next sections, the design and results of
this study are described in detail.

METHOD

An experiment was conducted to examine the inﬂuence of
the
map background colours on users’ preference of
typographic design. This user study utilized choropleth
and topographic maps as backgrounds and different label
typographies on the foreground. This combination was
made for four background colour designs.

Participants
Four groups were formed, each containing 50 participants.
To maintain homogeneous characteristics along with the
four groups and prevent any bias due to participants’
characteristics (Nielson, 1993; Rubin and Chisnell, 2008;
Aykin, 1989), all groups had 25 participants with a high
level of experience (experts) and 25 participants with a low
level of experience (novices). The expert users had obtained
at least a master degree in Geography or Geomatics or had a
high interest in cartography, its applications and research
ﬁelds. The novice users were students who had just begun
their BSc education. None of them received any carto-
it was
graphic training before the study. In addition,
attempted to keep the gender balanced: there were 25
females and 25 males in the ﬁrst group, 26 females and 24
males in the second group, 23 females and 27 males in the
third, and 23 females and 27 males in the fourth group.
Furthermore, all participants had normal vision or vision
that had been corrected to normal.

Figure 1. A comparative example of test stimuli of the four background types, areal labelling (left) and point labelling (right)

Stimuli
In total, 41 different maps were presented to each
participant, using a questionnaire presented on a screen
(Lime Survey package was used). Each of these digital maps
was combined with one or two other maps so that the
participant could compare them, resulting in a total of 66
different questions. Four different questionnaires were
made, related to the background colour of the maps. Map
combinations always had the same type of background but
differed in the label typography (size, boldness, font, etc.).
Four phases of the experiment were made with the four
described map backgrounds. The four different types of
maps are illustrated in Figure 1 and designed as follows:

1. Maps whose background is blank (Blank Map, BM):
only point objects or area boundaries were depicted in
the background. As a consequence, this type of map
will not experience any influence from background
colours (Hue50u, Saturation50%, Value5100%; see
Figure 1, top row).

2. Maps whose backgrounds are depicted in different
shades of grey (Grey Scale, GS), illustrated in Figure 1,
second row.

3. Maps whose backgrounds are filled with colours whose
hue ranges from 0u to 90u and 270u to 360u. Based on
the colours contained in these intervals, these will be
called Hot Colour (HC). Figure 1, third row illustrates
examples of these maps.

4. Maps whose backgrounds are filled with colours whose
hues range from 90u to 270u. Based on the colours

contained in this interval, these will be called Cold
Colour (CC). Examples are illustrated in Figure 1, last
row.

To avoid measurement biases due to resolution and size
differences, all participants completed their test on a ﬂat
screen with 128061024 resolution and a size of 17 inches.
The stimuli were presented in the same order to the
participants of the four questionnaires. The visual variables
were grouped together in individual blocks. Therefore, the
users can determine their preference between different
options of the same variable (for example, different sizes).
The design of the maps will be discussed in detail in the
next sections.

Map design
Labels’ designs on the maps (stimuli) varied in size, shape,
orientation and texture. An extensive explanation of these
visual variables can be found in the work of Bertin (1970),
and their application on map labels was described by Deeb
et al.  (2012). These different design criteria were applied
individually or combined (for example, a serif font and a
large corpus). Fictive toponyms were placed on the map to
ensure that participants would not recognize the location,
as their ability to do so could bias the results due to
previous knowledge. The position and content of the
labels were equal on all maps, but their length varied
between the maps. Two different labelling options were
considered: labels associated with areal objects and labels

associated with point objects. To visualize different
categories of the labels and their associated (point or
areal) objects, the graphical variables of size, shape and
texture were applied to the associated name labels. In
addition, variations in the labels’ orientation were also
tested on choropleth maps.

As mentioned earlier, four different groups were formed
based on the background colour of the maps: blank maps
(BM), grey scale maps (GS), hot-coloured maps (HC) and
cold-coloured maps (CC). Demonstrated in Figure 1, the
maps with point data were based on the Belgian topographic
map series of 1 : 10 000. The hot-coloured maps, on the one
hand, show urban areas which were mainly depicted in colour
hues ranged within [0u–90u, 270u–0u], including yellow,
orange and red. The cold-coloured maps, on the other hand,
show rural backgrounds whose colour hues ranged within
[90u–270u], including shades of blue and green.

The choropleth maps

illustrated in Figure 1,

(depicting areal data) were
visualized by ﬁve classes, ranging from a light to a darker
colour,
left column. The hot-
coloured backgrounds thus corresponded to an orange
colour ramp; the cold-coloured maps corresponded to a
green colour ramp. The blank maps with areal data only
showed the boundaries of the areas without any differentia-
tion of the ﬁve classes. Table 1 shows the HSV parameters
of the used classes for grey scale maps (GS), hot colour
maps (HC), and cold colour maps (CC).

Task
The stimuli were implemented in an online questionnaire
that allowed users to express their preference for a certain
map (design). In each question, two or three maps were
presented simultaneously, and participants could rank these
maps according to their preference. On average, this task
was completed within 20–30 minutes. The result was an
indicating a
ordered list of maps for each participant,
personal preference for the application of graphical variables
on map labels. Four sets of data were collected, each related
to one of the background types (blank, grey, hot colour and
cold colour). This design enabled a comparison of the
preference data of the four background types.

RESULTS

In the results, the users’ preference for a certain label
typography between the four map background colours was
compared. In addition, a distinction was made between
labels associated with areal data and those associated with
point objects. The results of the user study are described in
the following section, structured according to object type
(point or area) and typography.

Table 1. HSV parameters of the map designs

Labels associated with areal data
As described before (see the section on ‘Map design’), the
areal data were presented by choropleth maps, and four
different colour ramps were used: no colour ramp (BM),
grey colour ramp (GS), orange colour ramp (HC) and
green colour ramp (CC). The graphic variables that were
applied to labels associated with areas were as follows: size,
shape, texture and orientation. Size can be applied to texts
by using a different corpus, using bold texts and using case
styles. The shape of a label was determined by its font style,
font family (serif versus sans serif),
letter spacing or a
combination of these. Variations in texture were obtained
by combining typographic options such as bold, narrow,
and italic. Orientations can be studied within the labels
(italic versus straight) or by varying the angle of the labels.
A more detailed description of the application of these
variables on the labels’ design can be found in a study by
Deeb et al. (2012).

Size of the labels
The test name labels were designed in Arial using four levels
of dot sizes: 8, 10, 12 and 14. A bold Arial font was added,
as it also enlarges the characters of the labels. These sizes
were compared pair-wise for the four types of background.
The frequency of users’ preference of each size was counted
and analysed statistically.

The study of the font sizes was made in two steps. First,
the difference between bold and non-bold (within a same
dot
size) was considered, and users’ preference was
compared between four corpus sizes (both bold and non-
bold). Because boldness enlarges the size of the label, bold
labels were compared pair-wise to non-bold labels sepa-
rately for each of the four map backgrounds. The results,
depicted in Figure 2, show the general trend in user
preferences for the different label sizes for all background
colours. Figure 2 illustrates the mean user preferences for
each dot size. This graph shows that the users did not prefer
a large label size (12 or 14 dots) in bold as much as they did
for non-bold labels. The preferences regarding the smaller
font sizes (10 and 8 dots) are less different. These results of
the four background maps were tested pair-wise (non-bold
versus bold) for each individual dot size using one-way
ANOVA; user preferences did not differ
signiﬁcantly
between size 8 non-bold and 8 bold (F50.018,
P50.899), and user preferences did not differ signiﬁcantly
between size 10 non-bold and 10 bold (F54.079,
P50.090). Meanwhile, user preferences for size 12 non-
bold and 12 bold were signiﬁcantly different (F564.286,
P50.000). In addition, user preferences for size 14 differed
signiﬁcantly between non-bold and bold (F5394,636,
P50.000). Overall, the users appeared to have a higher

ANOVA, a signiﬁcant difference was found across different
sizes for non-bold fonts (F513.006, P50.000) and bold
(F511.147, P50.001). In addition, a one-way

Second, the user preference of the four dot sizes (8, 10,
12 and 14) was compared pair-wise. The preference
regarding the size was analysed and compared along the
four map backgrounds. The frequency of each size
preference was counted and accumulated to have a
weighted value of
size preference regarding the four
background types, which is illustrated in Figure 4. The

background colours: a size of 10 dots has the heights

preference. Approximately 55% of the users preferred this
size in the four map types (blank map, grey map, hot-
coloured map, cold-coloured map). These percentages are
calculated based on a maximum frequency of 200 (50 users,
4 colours) for each size. The lowest preference (approxi-
mately 10%) was associated with size 14 dots. The
accumulated data were statistically analysed using a one-
way ANOVA. These tests showed no signiﬁcant difference
in users’ responses between the four sets of maps (F50.11,
P50.95).

Shape of the labels
To acquire a clear overview of the relationship between the
map background colour and the preference in the labels’
shape, a ﬁxed corpus size was used in combination with
different typefaces. These variations in shape were obtained
using a combination of the following parameters; formality
(artistically different ranging from the old hand writing to
machine fonts), (sans) serif and spacing. For each shape
group, three options were depicted simultaneously to the
user, who could rank the three maps according to one’s
preference. The exact fonts that were used (each with a size
of 12 dots) in each group are:

1.

Formality: (A) Blackadder–(B) Comic Sans SM–(C)

Spacing and serif: (A) You Yaou–(B) Times New

The users’ preferences for each of these options and for the
four backgrounds are depicted in Figure 5. However, users

signiﬁcantly different

had a distinct preference for a certain label shape among the
three options shown simultaneously. A one-way ANOVA
test was used to investigate users’ preferences towards the
three categories of each group where some signiﬁcant
differences of their choices were located. The preference of
formality categories was signiﬁcantly different (F1545.079,
P150.000), as users preferred Times New Roman the most.
In addition, the degree of preference within serif categories

Noticeably, users preferred Times New Roman among this
group’s options. Furthermore, the preference of spacing &
serif categories was signiﬁcantly different (F4586.470,
P450.000) with a signiﬁcant preference of You Yaou.
Moreover, the preference of spacing and sans serif cate-
gories was signiﬁcantly different (F558.908, P550.007),
as Arial Bold was signiﬁcantly the least preferred shape.
On the contrary of that, users’ preference of spacing cate-
gories was not signiﬁcantly different (F253.915, P25
0.06).

Illustrated in Figure 5,

the preference values were
compared statistically across the four background types
for each of the group options. Using a one-way ANOVA,
no signiﬁcant difference was found regarding the back-
ground colours for the ﬁve proposed options; formality,
spacing, serif, spacing and serif, and spacing and sans serif
(F15F25F35F45F550.000, P15P25P35P45P551.000).

Texture of the labels
Texture can be seen as a set of consistent graphic patterns.
The texture of labels was varied using a combination of
three parameters: italic, bold and narrow. Three combina-
tions were applied to the labels using an Arial font with four
sizes (8, 10, 12 and 14 dots). The participants had to
express their preference for each of these combinations:
italic versus bold italic, bold versus narrow bold and narrow
bold versus narrow bold italic.

Figure 6 illustrates the mean values of user prefer-

described before where no signiﬁcant difference was
found for the ﬁrst comparison (F153.724, P150.063)

other two texture (F254.888, P250.035; F3542.994,

Orientation of the labels
Considering  the  orientation  of  labels,  two  levels  were 
investigated.  First,  the  orientation  of  the  overall  label 
was  considered.  Three 
sets  of  orientation  were 
presented  simultaneously  to  the  participants:  horizontal; 
horizontal  if  possible,  otherwise  under  an  angle  which 
corresponds  to  the  general  orientation  of  the  polygon 
(mixed);  and  always under  an  angle  in  correspondence  to 
the  shape  of  the  object  (tilted).  The  preferences  linked 
with  orientation  options  were  compared  with  the  four 
background  types.  Second, the  orientation  of  the  label 
syllables  (as  straight  versus  italic)  was  compared.

The recorded preference values (in %) for the orientation
of the overall label are listed in Table 2. The same trend was
recorded for the four backgrounds. The majority of the
participants tended to prefer the horizontal orientation
(.60%); the two other orientation options were almost
equally preferred. Most slightly higher preference was
measured for the ‘mixed’ option, except for the blank
background. User preferences for the three tested orienta-
(one-way ANOVA,
tions were
F5324.476, P50.000). The similarity of responses towards
the different background colours was also statistically
conﬁrmed (one-way ANOVA, F50.39, P50.996).

The obtained preference data concerning the label
syllables is illustrated in Figure 8, in which the trend of
the user preferences regarding the labels’ orientation was
compared with font size (8, 10, 12 and 14 dots). Generally,
the straight version of the labels was preferred over italic
labels. Using one-way ANOVA, a signiﬁcant difference was
found (F529.985, P50.000) between straight and italic

four  backgrounds.  No  signiﬁcant 
difference  was  found  in  user  preferences  against  the  four 
background colours (F50.418, P50.741) when testing the 
second  level  of  orientation.  Users’  preference  for  the 
straight  versus  the  italic  orientation  variable  of  the  four 
tested sizes regarding the inﬂuence of background colour is 
illustrated in Figure 9.

Labels associated with point data
The points were distributed randomly over the map image
to mimic a realistic scene. Therefore, the associated name
labels were distributed accordingly. A combination of
several visual variables was applied to these labels to create
different categories and hierarchical
levels. Labels are
ﬂexible symbols because of a broad array of visualization
options in which they can be applied to the same placement.
This ﬁnding can be divided into two levels: the same layout
for all labels on the map surface, and variations in the layout
of  individual labels on the same map surface.

between the variation in case style and font
Three sets of the case styles were tested for Arial and
Times New Roman: all characters in lower case, the ﬁrst
character in upper case, and all characters in upper case.
User preferences are listed in Table 3. Therefore, a
comparison was made of the preference data regarding
the two font types across the four backgrounds (Arial
versus Times New Roman, TNR): one-way ANOVA
showed a signiﬁcant difference in users’ preferences in the
case style variations across Arial and Times New Roman
(F5535.297, P50.000). Figure 10 illustrates this differ-
ence. Using one-way ANOVA, the preferences for these
case styles were compared along the four background
types. The obtained data showed no signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on the background colour on users’ preference for a
certain case style (F50.000, P51.000).

Combining the variations of labels
Finally, a combination of multiple visual variables was
applied to the labels within one map: different fonts
(shapes), case style variations, boldness and three size
variations (8, 10 and 12 dots). In each map, three levels of
hierarchy were presented using these variables. Accordingly,
four different maps were formed and examined in pairs,
resulting in six comparisons. No signiﬁcant difference in
user preferences regarding these four maps was found of the
background colour (one-way ANOVA, F50.62, P50.60).

DISCUSSION

This study shows that the combination of the typographical 
design,  which  involves  the  application  of  visual  variables  to 
introduce  different  labelling  functions  with  the  maps’ 
background  colour 
inﬂuence  on  users’ 
introduces  no 
preferences  regarding  these  visual  variables.  The  ﬁndings 
show a consistent agreement of users’ preferences regarding 
the  four  map  backgrounds  (blank  background,  grey  scale 
background,  hot-coloured  background  and  cold-coloured 
background).  As  a  consequence,  the  typographic  design  of 
screen  maps  should  not  be  adapted  according  to  the  map’s 
background  colour.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the 
perception  of  the  horizontal  relationship  between  typo-
graphic objects and their design, discussed by Steiniger and 
Weiber (2007), is not inﬂuenced by background colours. In 
addition to that, this result contradicts the ﬁndings of Bratz 
(1970),  who  found  that  the  ﬁgure–ground  and  the 
surrounding  relationships  show  more  of  an  inﬂuence  than 
the  typographic  design.  However,  her  results  described 
users’ ability to locate varied labels.

Previous

studies concerning the typographic design
described its inﬂuence on readability. Unlike Arditi and
Cho’s (2005) conclusion from their experiment on the
efﬁciency of normal reading, where the serif font was more
efﬁcient than the sans serif
font, users’ preferences of
reading map labels were oriented towards the use of sans
serif fonts for the three case styles (all letters in lower case,
letters in upper case). In
ﬁrst letter in upper case, all
addition to that, the users’ preferences for the sans serif
fonts Arial Narrow Bold, Arial Bold and Comic Sans SM are
signiﬁcantly different from Feldmann and Kreiter’s (2006)
ﬁndings in terms of efﬁciency measurements.

It is noteworthy to stress that users’ preference for larger 
sizes decreases when using bold labels. In addition to that, it 
should  be  mentioned  that  using  different  textures  of 
labelling  –  with  variation  in  italic,  bold  and  narrow  styles  –
carries  signiﬁcant  differences  in  the  preferences  of  users, 
who appear to prefer a combination of fewer visual variables.

Texture of labels
The hierarchy of labels (and their associated objects) can be
expressed through a combination of multiple visual vari-
ables. A ﬁrst option is to vary the size of the labels. Because
a bold representation of
size,
differences in preference may occur. Therefore, a collection
of two sets of maps were presented to the user: one without
bold labels and one with all labels presented in bold. The
labels on the two maps were both visualized in Arial or
Times New Roman, resulting in four maps that were tested
pair-wise. In a ﬁrst sub-collection, only two levels of
hierarchy were presented in the map image, using label
sizes of 10 and 12 dots. A comparison of users’ preference
along the four backgrounds resulted in no signiﬁcant
differences (one-way ANOVA, F50.07, P50.97). The
second sub-collection has four maps with labels varying
between three sizes (8, 10 and 12 dots) to express
hierarchy. The maps, combining bold and non-bold
representation with Arial and TNR, also showed no
signiﬁcant difference along the four backgrounds as
measured by one-way ANOVA (F50.42, P50.73).

Next, user preferences

these textures were
examined, with the maps used previously mixed to create
new pairs. In this case, the maps with two levels of hierarchy
(10- and 12-dot label sizes) were compared with maps that
have three levels of hierarchy (8-, 10- and 12-dots label
sizes). Here, a distinction was made between the Arial and
Times New Roman fonts. Using a one-way ANOVA, the
results over the four background types were analysed, but
no signiﬁcant difference was found in the users’ preferences
between the Arial font (F50.22, P50.88) and the Times
New Roman font (F50.04, P50.98).

The Cartographic Journal

Considering  the  orientation  of  labels,  users  signiﬁcantly
preferred  the  horizontal  orientation  for  all  background
colours;  this  ﬁnding  is  likely  due  to  the  high-frequency  use
of horizontal orientation, especially on small-scale maps and
the  habitual  orientation  of  normal  reading  as  well.  This
result is consistent with that of Deeb et al. (2012) when they 
investigated  the  preference  of  orientation 
for  two  user
groups  considering  expertise  and  gender  variations.
Furthermore,  the  straight  orientation  was  highly  preferred
over the italic orientation.

Regardless of whether the design of labels over maps
considers two or three levels of hierarchy and whether this
hierarchy is visualized using an Arial font or Times New
Roman font, no signiﬁcant difference could be attributed to
the relation between the hierarchy composed of two or
three sizes (normal or bold).

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

Maps are composed of several different elements (points,
lines, areas and labels) that are all symbolized using (one or
a combination of) visual variables. The application of these
variables has an inﬂuence on how the object is perceived,
but also affects the perception of neighbouring objects. In
particular, the use of colours has an inﬂuence on adjacent
objects. The perception of the cartographic elements thus
depends on the overall design of the map, which in turn is
dependent on its type, function and content. Labels can be
considered the fourth object type in map design and are
commonly placed on top of all other layers of information.
Consequently, the visualization of this background infor-
mation inﬂuences the perception of the labels.

The goal of this study was to detect whether different
background types have a profound impact on map users’
preferences regarding the visualization of the labels them-
selves (their typography). For completeness, two types of
objects were considered: areal objects and point objects.
Different labelling options were created and compared,
allowing users to express their preference given digital
maps. These labelling options include: size, font, case styles,
bold, italic and combinations therein. These maps were
integrated in four sets of similar questionnaires. The
difference of these questionnaires was the background
colour used: blank background, grey background, hot-
coloured background and cold-coloured background. This
the results and the
design enabled a comparison of
detection of possible inﬂuences of
these background
colours. The results obtained during this study can be
summarized as follows:
N For each of the variations in typography, none of the
tested variations showed a significant difference in user
preferences related to the background colour of the
maps. However, the experiment conditions showed that
the grey scale background and hot-colour backgrounds
had a significant difference on user preferences between
non-bold and bold labels.
N The preference of different shape characteristics con-
sidering three escalating categories of formality, serif,
sans serif, serif and spacing, and finally sans serif and
spacing, showed a tendency towards the moderate visual

variation of each category. This was not the case for
formality: users preferred fonts with a high level of
formality.
N The horizontal orientation was the most preferable
direction to position labels. A horizontal orientation
enables the constant reading of labels despite potentially
exceeding the available space. However,
it has the
disadvantage that the overall orientation of the associated
(areal) object is not stressed, potentially leading other
objects be overlapped. The italic presentation of labels was
significantly less preferred than a straight presentation.
N The most preferred font type was Arial in a pair-wise
comparison with Times New Roman. This result was
valid for the three case designs (all lower case, first letter
in upper case, all upper case).
N Comparing the application of multiple typographic
options resulted in no significant differences in the
preference values. Therefore, further investigation con-
cerning individual texture preference was required.

that

colour

It can be concluded that the background colour had no
signiﬁcant impact on users’ preferences regarding several
typographic options. This ﬁnding indicates
the
typography of maps should not be adapted when changing
the background colour in digital maps. In thematic maps,
the same typography can thus be used with a wide range of
different
applied to choropleth maps.
Moreover, topographic maps can present a wide range of
different region types, which must be visualized accord-
ingly. These different visualizations will consequently not
inﬂuence users’ preferences towards the typography of the
labels. This study does not fully cover the visual variables
introduced by Bertin (1970). More research must be
conducted to test
the application of colours on the
cartographic labels themselves.

ramps

A  next  step  in  the  research  will  be  the  assessment  of  the 
efﬁciency of the user when different typographic options are 
used on the map. These efﬁciency measurements may or may 
not  correspond  to  the  preference  values  of  the  users; 
something  the  user  ﬁnds  aesthetically  attractive  is  not  de 
facto  ‘better’  for  the  user.  Efﬁciency  could  be  measured 
using  response  time  measurements  when  users  must 
complete a task on the map. Furthermore, the level of users’ 
experience may be crucial when testing efﬁciency.

Abstract
This research develops a new temporal Geographic Information System (GIS) frame-
work and applies it to compare General Circulation Model (GCM) products and
reanalysis datasets in order to discern differences in patterns and locations of change
as a proof of concept. The proposed framework incorporates the concept of kinemat-
ics to represent the movement of isolines as advection displacement vectors. Com-
parison of displacement vectors from the four datasets shows differences in isotherm
shifts for both median values and interquartile ranges along with several prominent,
well deﬁned difference regions across the globe. Among the four datasets used in the
study, the two reanalysis datasets have the smallest median difference in displacement
vectors indicating the least spatiotemporal difference. As both reanalysis datasets are
based on actual observations, this result validates the displacement vector represen-
tation. The CNRM CM3 20C3M dataset contains an Antarctic Cooling that led to
most of the differences in displacement vectors against the other datasets. The research
shows the effectiveness of GIS enabled displacement vectors analysis to elicit spatial
differences in climate patterns among GCM data and reanalysis data. While tempera-
ture data were used in the case study, the proposed method is based on concepts
applicable to other isolines of geographic variables (such as isobars or isohyets).

1 Introduction

One challenge of examining GCM products and reanalysis data relates to the massive
voume of spatiotemporal data and the difﬁculty of determining meaningful patterns of

change from a temporal set of gridded data (Sauchyn et al. 2004). GCMs and other
spatially explicit environmental models produce massive raster based time series of
geographic ﬁelds (e.g. temperature, precipitation) that call for effective GIS approaches to
elicit temporal information embedded in these model outputs. Statistical analysis of
GCM data at ﬁxed locations over ﬁxed time intervals is currently supported by statistical
and reanalysis tools at the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory (Kalnay et al.
1996). Analysis of the dynamics embedded in the output of these sources is a daunting
task due to the lack of descriptive terminology for ﬁelds of scalar data that change with
time (Sauchyn et al. 2004).

To meet the challenge, the research transforms gridded datasets to isolines of
geographic properties similarly to the use of classiﬁcations of 500 mb heights in Huth
(2000). Isoline displacement vectors are calculated to capture the rate of change and
spatial distribution of change over time. The rate of change is determined by novel
applications of image motion detection algorithms of Horn and Schunck (1981) to
isolines of geographic properties. Furthermore, GIS algorithms are then developed to
discern regions exhibiting signiﬁcant differences among data from GCMs and reanalysis.
Displacement vectors capture both rate and direction of change simultaneously.
Additionally, displacement vectors’ differences may suggest regions with conﬂicting
climate change patterns from the different models. This research focuses on the global
statistics of displacement vector differences and on regions of statistically large displace-
ment differences between datasets. The global characteristics demonstrate the capture of
fundamental dataset spatiotemporal differences. The validation of regions characterized
by statistically large differences in displacement vectors is based on citations from climate
research.

2 Comparison of Model Data in Climate Change Research

Comparative studies of climate model data are common to enhance the level of conﬁ-
dence in patterns and effects of climate change. Much research has investigated correlates
of climate change to storm tracks, precipitation, climate classiﬁcations and other mani-
festations of climatology. In each of these comparisons, similar climate system response
across the different GCMs added support to the predicted impact of climate change on
the manifestation of climatology under study. This research adds the ability to compare
and contrast the output of climate models based on the spatiotemporal characterization
of scalar climatic ﬁelds such as temperature. Comparisons based on manifestations of
climate are dependent on the locations and time scales typical of the manifestations. The
spatiotemporal characterization developed in this research is dependent on the temporal
span and spatial resolution of the data instead of the manifestation. The differences
between the GCM outputs are used to provide a description of the potential range of the
response to climate change.

Comparison of multiple model outputs helps draw conclusions on regional patterns
of climate change. Hansen et al. (2006) determined that the increased Equatorial Paciﬁc
West–East temperature gradient during the last century might have increased the likeli-
hood of strong El Niños. Similarly, likely future precipitation pattern changes from
climate change were found by Ulden and Oldenbourgh (2006) when they studied ﬁve
GCMs and concluded signiﬁcant differences in circulation patterns would occur. Past
work with reanalysis datasets included Hu and Fu’s (2007) determination of a poleward

shift in the Hadley cells during the last half-century, based on similarities in three
meteorological reanalyses and three outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) datasets.

Other research focused on differences in GCM products. Arzel et al. (2006) and
Lefebvre and Goosse (2008) identiﬁed the uniqueness of CNRM model output with its
depiction of cooling in the Weddell Sea area at the southern tip of the Atlantic Ocean.
Holland and Bitz (2003) determined that the CNRM model produced a slower ice melt
rate than the NCAR model. In all researched instances of GCM output comparison the
basis has been phenomena that enabled the researcher to focus on speciﬁc regions to
determine the similarities or differences between model outputs.

2.1 Approaches to Analyze Temporal Gridded Datasets

Expanding upon the ideas of ﬂuid velocity and local trend classiﬁcations, this research
develops a GIS framework to analyze and compare spatiotemporal patterns based on
temporal gridded data. Fluid mechanics utilizes velocity and pressure ﬁelds to analyze the
ﬂow of ﬂuid around a ﬁxed object (Braza et al. 1986). This research extends the concept
of ﬂow to shifts in a temperature ﬁeld characterized by temperature transitions over
space. Displacement vectors of temperature change over space represent the direction of
the temperature transition and the magnitude of temperature change. Displacement
vectors derived from temporal gridded datasets highlight patches of differences in change
patterns suggested by GCMs and reanalysis data.

2.2 Research Hypotheses and Goals

The premise of this research posits the use of displacement vectors as measures of the
direction and magnitude of changes over space and time. The chosen geographic
attribute, temperature, is representative of continuous ﬁelds in which changes are tran-
sitional as ﬂows. Comparisons of displacement vectors help identify regions of differ-
ences among the tested datasets, and hence suggest the need for future study of potential
causes. Under the premise, the research attempts to test the following two hypotheses
with four temperature data sets: two GCM model outputs and two climate reanalyses:

1. The differences are expected to be larger between types of data sources (i.e. GCM data

versus reanalysis data) than within the same types of data source.

2. Displacement vectors are able to reveal meaningful patterns of differences among the

four datasets.

The introduction section covers the concepts and approaches in developing the
proposed GIS method for spatiotemporal analysis of temporal gridded datasets. Com-
parative studies of multiple data sources are used to draw conclusions about climate
change patterns that lead to the research hypotheses. The following sections elaborate on
the proposed GIS method with temperature data from four climate datasets. The data
section discusses the sources and nature of the datasets used in the study as well as the
rationale and procedures for data selection and processing. The methods section details
the proposed method for computing displacement vectors and comparison. The results
and discussion section evaluates differences of displacement vectors among the data
sources (Hypothesis 1) and relates the research ﬁndings to previous climate research to
assure that the patterns of temperature change identiﬁed are meaningful (Hypothesis 2).

Finally, the intellectual contributions of the research are summarized and opportunities
for future research are discussed.

3 Data Sets Used in the Study

Four datasets, two reanalysis products and two GCM products from the Climate of the
20th Century experiments (hereafter, 20C3M datasets) were used for this study. Reanaly-
sis data were obtained from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP NCAR, Kalney et al. 1996) and European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-40 projects. The two
GCM products were obtained from the “Climate of the twentieth Century Experiment”
(20C3M); one was based on the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
Community Climate System Model (CCSM3, Collins et al. 2006) and, the other, on the
Center National Weather Research (CNRM) global ocean-atmosphere coupled system
(CM3, Salas-Mélia et al. 2005).

Two from each type are chosen to allow comparisons within the reanalysis products,
within the 20C3M datasets and between the reanalysis and 20C3M datasets. The
reanalysis datasets are single realizations based on historical observations whereas the
20C3M datasets are GCM model estimates. Both source types have all the variability of
the climate intact. Differences are expected to be smaller within a dataset type but larger
between the dataset types.

The ERA-40 reanalysis dataset is based on meteorological observations from
September 1957 to August 2002 (Uppala et al. 2005). The goal of ERA-40 reanalysis was
to provide a uniform analytical technique for meteorological value interpolation through
the use of the ECMWF’s Integrated Focus System (IFS, Caires and Sterl 2003). The
data collection tools changed signiﬁcantly over the reanalysis period, with increasing
dependency on satellite data from the 1970s onwards (Uppala et al. 2005), resulting in
a wider spread for the location and temporal coherence of cyclones captured (Bengtsson
et al. 2004).

On the other hand, NCEP/NCAR re-analysis aimed to produce a 40-year record of
global analyses of atmospheric ﬁelds for the research and climate monitoring communi-
ties (Kalnay et al. 1996) through the recovery of observational data from land surface,
ship logs, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite and other data sources for the period 1957
through 1999. The data assimilation system used for reanalysis remained unchanged
throughout the data auditing and assimilation processes so as to eliminate perceived
climate jumps associated with changes in data assimilation systems (Uppala et al. 2005).
The initial data assimilation scheme for the ERA-40 reanalysis was more dependent
on satellite data than the NCEP scheme which was initially mostly constrained by
observation stations (Bromwich and Fogt 2004). The different assimilation dependencies
led to substantial differences in the reanalysis datasets until satellite data became the
main data source in the 1970s for both. The ERA-40 and NCEP reanalysis products
agree closely for most ﬁelds (e.g. sea level pressure and zonal winds), especially after
1970. (DeWeaver and Bitz 2006).

The 20C3M datasets include the Center National Weather Research global ocean-
atmosphere coupled system (CNRM-CM3) from France and the National Center for
Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model (NCAR-CCSM3) from the
U.S. The two GCMs are chosen as the different surface grid resolutions (Table 1) gave

opportunities for the proposed method of displacement vectors to demonstrate the
robustness of analysis of difference in change with respect to grid resolution. Both models
use the Hadley Centre’s global sea-ice and sea surface temperature data set (Raynor et al.
1996) for surface temperature on non-land areas (Folland et al. 2002).

Temperature is chosen as it is a spatially continuous property that ﬁts well with the
concepts of ﬁelds and thus provides a good test case for the proposed displacement vectors.
Additionally, temperature is a common proxy for evaluating the impacts of anthropogenic
causes on climate. Climate observations and modelling efforts have produced diverse
ranges of climate data and model outputs. Comparison of temperature patterns is
important to determining whether suggested patterns of climate change are compatible.
The temperature data for this research was obtained from the Earth System Grid
(ESG) data site, the ECMWF data server and the Earth System Research Laboratory. The
data are in different grid sizes as a result of balances between output resolution and
computation power available in different modelling processes (Table 1). The cost of
reanalysis acquisition increases rapidly with resolution so the ECMWF ERA40 reanalysis
model uses a lower resolution (Uppala et al. 2005). The effect of horizontal resolution on
GCMs have been studied since the 1970s and increased resolution does not lead to a
guaranteed improvement in the model (Manabe et al. 1978, Wellck et al. 1971, Miya-
koda et al. 1971). Manabe et al. (1978) showed that some phenomena, such as low-level
westerlies, can degrade with increased resolution. Baumhefner and Downey (1978)
showed that increased resolution beyond a limit does not necessarily guarantee better
accuracy.

A set of isotherms is used as reference features to determine changes in a temperature
ﬁeld. The isotherms are 14-year means using the years 1958–1971 for the 1971 mean and
the years 1986–1999 for the 1999 mean. There is a 14-year gap from 1972 through 1985
that ensures signiﬁcant changes between the 1971 and 1999 mean values. When tem-
perature changes over space, isotherms shift accordingly. The proposed method calcu-
lates the displacement vectors of isotherm shifts to measure the direction and magnitude
of temperature change; for example, when the 10°C isotherm shifts north. The values of
reference isotherms used in the case study, (-20, -16, -12, -8, -4, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 26°C), were chosen using the Koppen Climate Classiﬁcation
temperature division lines with further subdivisions to provide a more complete sampling
of the scalar temperature ﬁeld (Figure 1).

4 Methods and Methodology

The proposed method transforms a time series of scalar ﬁelds, such as temporal grids of
temperature, into displacement vectors to reveal the spatiotemporal patterns of change in
the GCM or reanalysis datasets. Conceptually, the proposed technique is applicable to
any resolution and interval as long as due consideration is given to the rate at which the
phenomena traverse the data ﬁeld. The method identiﬁes regions in scalar data that are
changing at different rates between two datasets (Figure 2).

4.1 Displacement Vectors and Comparisons of Differences

This research is built around the concept of kinematics and the utilization of the rich
history of kinematic analysis in meteorology. The foundation of kinematic analysis is the
change in velocity for both latitudinal and longitudinal ﬂow (Bluestein 1992). This
research applies kinematics to a virtual ﬂow that reﬂects the spatiotemporal changes of
scalar attributes over the Earth’s surface.

Kinematics states that the change rate of ﬂow at a ﬁxed point

is equal to the

total rate of change of the ﬂuid particle (dF/dt) minus the ﬂow velocity at a location (V)
multiplied by the ﬁeld’s gradient (material derivative or advection term).

This research makes the assumption that the attribute values are transported by

constant value particles and thus there is no change in the total rate of ﬂow; i.e. (
is equal to zero.

All change at a given location, (∂F/∂t), is the result of the advection, (-V·(cid:2)F), of

constant value particles.

Determination of V requires locating the most likely location from which the new
value of F is advected. The velocity ﬁeld (V) is determined through the use of surrogate
objects with boundaries deﬁned by a range of threshold values. From the temperature
grids, the borders of multiple surrogate objects are deﬁned using isotherms of annual
mean temperature. The assumption of particles with unchanging attribute values leads to
Equation (3) which is equivalent to the Optical Flow Constraint equation (Horn and
Schunck 1981) where I represents the image intensity.

Using attribute value instead of intensity enables the determination of the velocity of
the isotherm aligned with the local gradient ((cid:2)F) using the optical ﬂow approach (Horn
and Schunck 1981) with modiﬁcations for the use of the isotherm location at the next

time instance. Fiat boundaries based on subjective criteria (Smith and Mark 1998),
isotherms in this study, are used to spatially delineate surrogate objects. The surrogate
objects can be traced across multiple time instances and displacements calculated for the
object’s boundaries using optical ﬂow analysis. The displacement vectors for each dataset
are calculated based on contour matching from image processing algorithms developed
in previous work (Bothwell and Yuan 2010; Figure 3).

An attempt is made to create a vector parallel to the time T0 local temperature
gradient that started on a time T0 isotherm and ended on a time T1 isotherm with the
same value. Interpolation is used to assign displacements to all grid points without an
explicitly calculated displacement. Differences in the displacement vectors for each grid
point are then calculated for each pair combination (Figure 4).

The displacement difference vectors contrast the shifts in isotherms in the two
datasets being compared. The differences in the x and y directions are converted to points
with magnitudes and angles at locations.

The Iterative Self Organizing (ISO) clustering tool is used to identify regions of
similar differences of displacement vectors based on maximum likelihood classiﬁcation
functions. These identiﬁed clusters may relate to underlying geophysical phenomena. All
difference vectors outside the deﬁned large vector region are removed from the map to
remove the spatial and temporal randomness intrinsic to the models (Caires and Sterl
2003). The remaining difference vectors are symbolized as arrows with orientation
dictated by the displacement vector’s direction.

This research utilizes a pairing approach for analysis of differences by comparing the
difference in displacement vectors among the four test datasets by examining the six
possible pairings. This simplistic approach is taken for this research for two reasons: the

number (4) of models in the comparison is manageable for direct comparisons and pair
wise comparison supports the recognition of differences that are unique to a particular
model.

The differences in displacement vectors between the CNRM 20C3M dataset and the
NCEP reanalysis dataset are depicted in Figure 5 as a kinematic analysis example
(Figure 5).

The differences are calculated by subtracting the NCEP longitudinal and latitudinal
displacement values from the CNRM values. The large magnitude northward arrows in
the Weddell Sea, at the center of the map north of the Antarctic, result from the CNRM
dataset portraying a northward shift of the isotherms, i.e. cooling. The northward arrows
over Africa result from the larger northward shift in isotherms for the CNRM dataset
than the NCEP dataset as well. There is good agreement between the two datasets in the
southern mid latitudes of the oceans depicted by the light blue in Figure 5.

5.1 The Findings

The differences for the six possible permutations of pair wise kinematic differences of the
four datasets are calculated at each grid point. The difference sets are leptokurtic with a
kurtosis value from four to six. The NCAR CNRM difference dataset histogram is show
in Figure 6. The Kurtosis values indicate that data variance is the result of less frequent
but larger deviations than a normal distribution. The mean and standard deviation do
not apply to datasets with such a large deviation from a normal distribution. The median
and box plot interquartile range (IQR) of 25% to 75% are used to compare data with
a non-normal distribution. The median difference and difference IQR are displayed in
Table 2 for comparison purposes.

The ANOVA F-test is applied to the six differences datasets which had a total of 43776
data points, 5 degrees of freedom in the numerator and 43,771 in the denominator. The
F-test result is 466 indicating an almost certainty of the datasets having different means.

6 Discussion

Comparisons between the two reanalysis datasets and the two 20C3M datasets produced
two sets when the medians and IQR of the longitudinal displacement are evaluated. The
reanalysis datasets and the NCAR 20C3M dataset have less difference in longitudinal
displacement difference median and IQR and, therefore, the two reanalysis datasets
along with the NCAR 20C3M dataset appear to have the most similar spatial patterns
of temperature change on the 14-year mean temperature. The kinematic similarity of the
NCAR 20C3M dataset with respect to the reanalysis datasets supports the CO2 forcing
built into the NCAR model (Collins et al. 2006). The larger differences between the
CNRM GCM and all the others indicates that the CNRM 20th Century has unique and
signiﬁcant differences in the movement of isotherms during the period used for this study.

6.1 Difference Maps

The results exhibit clusters of comparatively larger displacements in the Arctic, Antarctic
for CNRM, Greenland, several ENSO regions and other spatially disjoint regions
(Figures 7–12). A literature review on the Antarctic and the CNRM CM3 GCM (Fig-
ures 7, 8 and 11) was conducted to locate past research that corresponds to the patch of
larger differences in all three comparisons with CNRM products. Findings from addi-
tional literature reviews for the Arctic, Greenland and ENSO regions with respect to 20th
Century climate validate several of the regions identiﬁed.

study. Several researchers have found similar results when examining outputs from the
CNRM CM model. Similarly, using the CNRM CM3 20C3M dataset, Lefebvre and
Goosse (2008) and Arzel et al. (2006) both identiﬁed a signiﬁcant sea ice increase in the
Weddell Sea predicted for the late 20th century. According to the CNRM CM3 the overall
global climate is wetter and colder than the observed climate in the 20th century (Salas-
Mélia et al. 2005). In addition, displacement vectors of CNRM CM3 show a cooling
trend as the -16°C isotherm north of the Waddell Sea moved further north. While the

isotherm movement is unique among the four datasets, the ﬁnding is supported by the
studies of Arzel et al. (2006), Cavalieri et al. (2003) and Lefebvre and Goosse (2008)
who all suggested that an increase of 1.3 · 105 km2 in sea ice occurred from 1981–2000
in the Southern Hemisphere. In addition, Doran et al. (2002) concluded that the Ant-
arctic station data showed an East Antarctic coast cooling in recent decades.

6.1.2 NINO3.4 region based on differences in displacement vectors with
CNRM datasets

A common region, NINO3.4, appears in comparisons of displacement vectors with
CNRM datasets (Figures 7, 8 and 11). The NINO3.4 regions are attributable to the
model’s implementation of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection
which is considered a dominant pattern of ocean–atmosphere variability with substantial
global climate impacts. Studies on the climate of the 21st century show that anthropo-
morphic CO2 emissions could result in a wide range of effects on the ENSO phenomena.
No deﬁnitive studies that would attribute the NINO3.4 area differences in Figures 7, 8
and 11 to a speciﬁc model or models were found. The appearance of the NINO3.4 region
for all comparisons involving CNRM suggests that an investigation of the CNRM
implementation of ENSO may yield interesting results.

6.1.3 Greenland and North Atlantic region based on differences of displacement
vectors with NCAR 20C3M datasets

The differences of displacement vectors based on NCAR 20C3M and the reanalysis
datasets show signiﬁcant difference regions in the vicinity of Greenland (Figures 9 and
12). The largest region in this area results from the comparisons based on NCAR 20C3M

GIS Temperature Change Pattern Analysis

915

and the NCEP datasets. The differences of displacement vectors show a large area of the
Northern Atlantic at ~57° latitude along Bafﬁn Bay, the Davis Strait and Labrador Sea.
These differences are indicative of a signiﬁcant disagreement on how rapidly the sea
surface temperatures in the region increased during the 20th century. The departure of
NCAR 20C3M from ERA-40 in displacement vectors also suggests a smaller region of
disagreement around Greenland (Figure 9).

Around the area of inland Greenland, displacement vectors from the CNRM CM3
dataset exhibit warming differences from the other three datasets (Figures 7, 8 and 11).
Holland and Bitz (2003) determined that the CNRM model produces a slower ice melt
rate than the NCAR model. The differences in displacement vectors suggest a higher rate
of northward ﬂow in the CNRM datasets than the other three datasets. This ﬂow
difference is in the opposite direction than what would be expected given the slower ice
melt in the CNRM dataset. This paradox is explained when isotherms used in the
datasets are examined. The -20°C isotherm from the NCAR 20C3M for 1971 (Fig-
ure 13) and 1999 (Figure 14) is conﬁned to the Greenland region and shrinking.

The result is a ring of displacement with the northern boundary of the -20°C region
generating displacements to the south. A similar region around Greenland is evident in
both reanalysis datasets as well. The differences seen in the Greenland region are the
result of all but the CNRM 20C3M dataset having displacement vectors with a southern
orientation. The CNRM dataset has a -20°C isotherm in the Arctic that changes little
from the 1971 position to the 1999 position (Figure 15) and generates very small
magnitude displacement vectors in the Arctic region. The smaller displacement vectors
are a result of slower ice melt in the CNRM dataset (Holland and Bitz 2003).

7 Summary, Intellectual Contribution and Future Study

research demonstrates that: (1) displacement vectors can effectively elicit meaningful
change patterns from temporal gridded datasets, but (2) projected climate patterns are
not more similar within the same types of data sources (such as comparison within GCM
products or within reanalysis products) than data sources from different realizations (i.e.
GCM products versus reanalysis data). Differences of displacement vectors are greatest
when comparisons are made with the CNRM 20C3M dataset. The other 20C3M
dataset, from NCAR, have climate change patterns that were more similar with the two
reanalysis datasets than with the CNRM dataset. The impact of the Weddell Sea cooling
captured in the CNRM output, but missed in the other three datasets, is the primary
cause of this unexpected result. Arzel et al. (2006) and Lefebvre and Goosse (2008)

validated the Weddell Sea cooling in the CNRM dataset and along with Cavalieri et al.
(2001) provided evidence that the cooling was a real event in the Antarctic. The equal
level of similarities of climate change patterns between the reanalysis datasets and NCAR
20C3M dataset supports the inclusion of the greenhouse gas and other forcings in
the NCAR model. Overall, the proposed method of displacement vectors allowed the
researcher to quickly locate potential regional differences among the two GCM and
two reanalysis datasets. The GIS provided an analysis framework and a visualization
environment that allowed the determination of where and at what rate isotherms were
moving across the earth’s surface. The method identiﬁed and geographically located the
Antarctic cooling contained in the CNRM output. Care must be taken when interpreting
differences in displacement vectors, as contours can be complex in shape.

The proposed method uses displacement vectors to capture change in continuous
ﬁelds. Central to the proposed method is the concept of ﬂows that progressively move
across a continuous ﬁeld. By extracting isolines of ﬂows from temporal gridded datasets,
the research deﬁnes displacement vectors as shifts in contours of deﬁned values over
space and time. The method successfully captured the spatiotemporal characteristics of
a scalar ﬁeld as portrayed across a time interval. The method can be applied to any scalar
that is continuous in nature, as long as the time between grid instances is chosen so as to
exhibit a change that generates signiﬁcant displacement vectors. Through the case study
of changes in temperature ﬁelds, this research demonstrates the effectiveness and value of
the proposed method of displacement vectors in identifying differences in spatiotemporal
patterns of climate change.

The proposed method can be further used to analyze the members of an ensemble
and of the mean ensemble value to assess the similarity of climate change projections for
IPCC scenarios. Displacement vectors for the ensemble should fall within the envelope of
displacement vectors aggregated from the members of the ensemble as a validation of the
proposed method. Regions of signiﬁcant differences in displacement vectors suggest areas
affected by different assumptions or parameterizations in climate models and opportu-
nities for further investigations of climate mechanisms responsible for the differences.

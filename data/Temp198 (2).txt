ABSTRACT
One of the main objectives of land-use change models is to
explore future land-use patterns. Therefore, the issue of addres-
sing uncertainty in land-use forecasting has received an increasing
attention in recent years. Many current models consider uncer-
tainty by including a randomness component in their structure. In
this paper, we present a novel approach for tuning uncertainty
over time, which we refer to as the Time Monte Carlo (TMC)
method. The TMC uses a speciﬁc range of randomness to allocate
new land uses. This range is associated with the transition prob-
abilities from one land use to another. The range of randomness is
increased over time so that the degree of uncertainty increases
over time. We compare the TMC to the randomness components
used in previous models, through a coupled logistic regression-
cellular automata model applied for Wallonia (Belgium) as a case
study. Our analysis reveals that the TMC produces results compar-
able with existing methods over the short-term validation period
(2000–2010). Furthermore,
the TMC can tune uncertainty on
longer-term time horizons, which is an essential feature of our
method to account for greater uncertainty in the distant future.

1. Introduction

One of the primary goals of land-use change models is to forecast possible future
land states. Although uncertainty is an inherent feature of any forecast, few land-
use change models consider uncertainty as a component of the model structure.
Because predicting future land-use pattern is diﬃcult, land-use change models can
be regarded as exploratory tools to assist in the decision-making by exploring
various scenarios. Pontius and Neeti (2010) discuss two contrasting views concern-
ing the role of uncertainty in scenario-based analysis. One view considers that
uncertainty is irrelevant to scenario-based analysis because storylines are not pre-
dictive. Some studies have simulated future land-use change without accounting
for uncertainties (e.g. Poelmans et al. 2010). The other view considers that uncer-
tainty is important in scenario-based analysis which takes into account the link
between the qualitative storyline and its quantitative expression. Following this
second view, our study proposes a method that can be applied to account for
uncertainties.

In a comprehensive review of 114 land-use change applications, Van Vliet et al. (2016)
found that only 17% of the reviewed applications addressed uncertainty. Uncertainties
may arise from many sources. Pontius and Neeti (2010) identiﬁed three groups of such
sources: the data, the model, and future land change simulation. First, errors in the
model’s input data are likely to exist and have been investigated in some studies (e.g.
Tayyebi et al. 2014). Second, the construction of the model may contain uncertainty
associated with its algorithms (Pontius and Neeti 2010). Third, future simulation involves
two main types of uncertainty, namely the estimation of the future change amount
(quantity uncertainty) and the spatial allocation of land-use changes. Figure 1 depicts
the diﬀerence between quantity uncertainty and spatial allocation uncertainty.

The quantity uncertainty is captured in many land-use models by simulating various
scenarios that diﬀer in the quantity of change (e.g. Cammerer et al. 2013, Landuyt et al.
2016). The spatial allocation uncertainty is associated with the potential nonstationary
character of the spatial distribution of land-use types. Generally, land-use models extra-
polate calibrated allocation results to simulate future landscape. Thus, these models
implicitly assume that the calibrated parameter set is valid for the future and do not
consider the nonstationary features of the land-use allocation related to the political,
economic, and/or environmental conditions that are known to be nonstationary (Van
Vliet et al. 2016). Our main focus in the present study is related to the spatial allocation
uncertainty. The uncertainty in the allocation process has been addressed in some
studies using fuzziness (e.g. Wang et al. 2013) or randomness by introducing a stochastic
component (e.g. Yang et al. 2008). The randomness ensures that each run can produce a

diﬀerent land-use pattern and that some patterns can be accurate by chance (Brown
et al. 2005, Van Vliet et al. 2016). Some of the current techniques for embedding
allocation uncertainty in land-use change models incorporate a stochastic disturbance
(SD) term or a Monte Carlo simulation (MC) method. Feng (2017) and Yang et al. (2008)
introduced an SD term, after White and Engelen (1993), whereas Li and Liu (2006), Liu
et al. (2008), and Wu (2002) used an MC method in their models to consider uncertainty.
The primary goal of this paper is to tune the degree of allocation uncertainty over
time so that the uncertainty degree varies between the immediate future and the
distant future. Our approach, following Wu (2002), compares the transition probability
from one land-use state to another in each land unit with a random number. However, a
major diﬀerence of our work lies in generating a uniform random number drawn over a
dynamic range associated with transition probabilities from one land-use state to
another, and this range increases over time.

We incorporate our method in a cellular automata (CA) model to simulate urban

1990–2000, and the validation interval 2000–2010. After calibrating and validating the
model, we compare the results obtained by our method and those by the two most
widely used methods, SD and MC. The comparison demonstrates the robustness of our
method against SD and MC methods.

for

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we review SD and MC methods and
then describe our method. Section 3 presents the land-use change model, study area,
and data.
In Section 4, we show and discuss our results. Section 5 presents our
conclusions.

2. Modeling spatial allocation uncertainty

In this section, we review the SD method proposed by White and Engelen (1993) and the
MC method proposed by Wu (2002) for incorporating uncertainty into land-use change
models. Thereafter, we introduce the proposed method, the Time Monte Carlo (TMC)
method. Once the transition probability has been computed for each landscape unit, the
SD term perturbs each probability score in its vicinity by a random number that can be
calculated as follows (White and Engelen 1993):

SD ¼ 1 þ (cid:2) ln γ

ð

Þσ;

(1)

where γ is a uniform random number between 0 and 1, and σ is a parameter that allows
control of the magnitude of the SD. When σ is set at 0, the model behaves determinis-
tically. In contrast, when σ is set at high positive values, the model follows a random
process.
Introducing an SD term in the transition probabilities may bias the model
outcomes because cells with very low transition probabilities would be able to change
their state (Wu 2002, García et al. 2011). Wu (2002) proposed an alternative method that
employs an MC procedure for modeling spatial allocation uncertainty. In this approach,
after computing the transition probabilities, a cell in the landscape is randomly selected,
its probability is compared with a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and
1, and the state of a cell will change if its probability score is greater than the generated
random number. One of the shortcomings of this approach is that it does not allow

4

control of the degree of randomness. Therefore, Wu (2002) transformed the transition
probability of each cell by comparing it with the largest available probability at each
time-step, as follows:

(cid:1)
(cid:1) (cid:3)
Pi0t ¼ Pitexp½(cid:2)δ 1 (cid:2) Pit=max Pt

(cid:4)

;

(2)

where Pi’t is the updated transition probability for cell i at time-step t, Pit is the original
probability, δ is a dispersion term, and max(Pt) ﬁnds the maximum transition probability
at time-step t. The dispersion term, δ, in Eq. 2 plays a role equivalent to σ in Eq. 1. When
δ is set to high values, transition probabilities decrease away from the maximum
in particular for cells with a lower probability score.
probability at each time-step,
Thus, a distinct diﬀerence results between cells with higher probabilities and those
with lower probabilities, and there will be less chance for land-use change in cells
with lower probabilities.

Although the two methods explained above are widely used to model the spatial
allocation uncertainty, neither method ensures that the degree of uncertainty can vary
over time. In reality, the distant future involves more uncertainty about aspects such as
the economic value of land, available communication means, and social/household
preferences. All these aspects play a key role in land allocation and become less
predictable into the distant future. A few studies have attempted to demonstrate the
increase in uncertainty as a model simulates land-use change further into the future (e.g.
Pontius et al. 2006, Pontius and Neeti 2010). Our study is one of the ﬁrst studies that
propose a Monte Carlo process to increase the degree of uncertainty over time in land-
use change modeling.

The proposed TMC method uses an MC procedure as in Wu (2002). At each time-step,
a cell is selected at random, and its computed transition probability is compared with a
uniform random number within a dynamic range. The proposed method is distinguished
from the method of Wu (2002) is that Wu deﬁnes this range between the minimum and
maximum probabilities,
i.e. 0 and 1. We set this range variable to allow tuning the
degree of uncertainty over time. At each time-step, the computed transition probabil-
ities are sorted in a descending order, with the most suitable cell at the top of the list.
Typically, the top-scoring cells from the sorted list change their state until they meet the
requested change quantity. To consider uncertainty, the model randomly selects one
cell in a set of cells with the largest probabilities. The size of this set of the cell is initially
determined by the quantity of change and subsequently increased to include more cells.
Thereafter, the model compares the transition probability of the selected cell to a
uniform random number and the cell changes its land-use state according to the
following equation:

(cid:5)

Sitþ1 ¼ change; Pit>rand

non (cid:2) change; otherwise0

(3)

where Sit+1 is the state of the cell i at the next time-step, Pit is the computed transition
probability at time-step t, and rand is a uniform random number between randmax and
randmin. We set rand_max and rand_min as follows:

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

randmax ¼ max Ptð
ð
randmin ¼ trans q þ t (cid:3) ϕ (cid:3) q
Þ

Þ;

ð

Þ

(4)

where max(Pt) returns the maximum probability at time-step t; and trans(q+(t × ɸ × q))
returns the transition value of a cell during time-step t from the sorted list whose
location is determined by q, the change quantity per time-step, and ɸ is a speciﬁc
percentage of q. In this way, the model behaves deterministically at the beginning but
slowly behaves more stochastically as the model operates over time.

Figure 2 illustrates an example of the method. In this example, the model sorts the
cell values in a descending order according to their transition probabilities. Assuming
that q = 8 and ɸ = 25%, the model randomly selects 8 cells out of 10 (Figure 2 from the
sorted cells list in time-step 1), 8 cells out of 12, and 8 cells out of 14 in time-steps 1, 2,
and 3, respectively. The cells that are converted to another land-use are selected by
comparing the transition probability with a random number according to Eq. 3.

3. Land-use change model

In this study, we apply a grid-based CA land-use change model to simulate the gain of
the urban category in Wallonia (Belgium), as a case study, between 1990 and 2010.
Urban land-use maps of 1990 and 2000 are used to calibrate the model parameters. The
calibrated parameters are then used to simulate the spatial allocation of the 2000–2010

step, and black: changes done in the previous time-septs.

urban gain. We validate the model by comparing the simulated urban gain during
2000–2010 with the observed urban gain during 2000–2010. The model has two main
modules: the demand module and the allocation module. Our emphasis is not on the
quantity uncertainty, but rather on the allocation uncertainty, and therefore we assume
that the annual demand for increasing urban land is the same from 1990 to 2000 (for
calibration) and from 2000 to 2010 (for validation) divided by 10 (the number of years).
The allocation module allocates new urban cells based on transition probabilities.
Two major components shape the transition probabilities following the approaches by
Mustafa et al. (2018a), Poelmans and Van Rompaey (2010), and Wu (2002). The ﬁrst is
based on a set of urbanization driving forces. The second component concerns the
dynamic interaction between neighborhood land uses. The transition probability P for
cell i at time-step t is computed as follows:

Pit ¼ Pidð

Þ (cid:3) Pinð

Þt(cid:3)conð:Þ;

where (Pid) is the urbanization probability based on urbanization driving forces, (Pin)t is
the neighborhood interaction, and con(.) is restrictive conditions for land-use change.

where count(s = urban) represents the number of urban cells amongst the Moore n × n
neighborhood. In each time-step, representing one year, the model converts the non-
urban cells according to Eq. 3, until meeting the required change amount.

3.1 Validation

The validation process involves assessing the goodness of ﬁt of the logit model and the
allocation accuracy of the model. The validation is done while eliminating the observed
urban cells at the initial time-step from the spatial extent. The goodness of ﬁt of the logit
model is assessed using the McFadden pseudo R-square (PR2) and the relative operating
characteristic (ROC) procedure (Pontius and Parmentier 2014). The PR2 mimics the
R-squared statistic of linear regression models. A value of 1 shows a perfect ﬁt; a PR2
of 0 indicates a random ﬁt (Mustafa et al., 2018c). The ROC compares the transition
probability map, generated with Eq. 6, to a map with the observed changes. It deﬁnes a
number of cut-oﬀ points and calculates the rate of the true-positives and the false-
positives at each cut-oﬀ point and relates these rates to each other in a graph. The ROC
measures the area under the curve (AUC). AUC = 0.5 means allocation as good as
random and AUC = 1 means perfect allocation.

We evaluate the allocation performance by showing the hits (H) indicating that the
expansion areas in the observed map were simulated as expansion; misses (M) indicat-
ing that the expansion areas in the observed map were simulated as no-changes; false
alarms (FA) indicating that the no-changes in the observed map were simulated as
expansion; and correct rejections (CR) indicating that the no-changes in the observed
map were simulated as no-changes, following the approaches by Liu et al. (2014) and
National Research Council (2014). This evaluation is performed for the urban gain.

3.2. Case study area and model implementation

The land-use model (section 3) is applied to the Wallonia region (Figure 3). The region
occupies 55% of Belgium with an area of 16,844 km2. The urban land-use maps for 1990,
2000 and 2010 were produced using Belgian cadastral vector data (CAD) from the Land
Registry Administration of Belgium. We rasterized the CAD data at a spatial resolution of
2 m. The rasterized maps were then aggregated to a resolution of 100 m. Each
aggregated cell was assigned a density value by counting the number of 2 m cells.
The aggregated data were then classiﬁed into non-urban with a density <25 and urban
with a density ≥25. As the average area of a building in Belgium is about 100 m2
(Tannier and Thomas 2013); a density value of 25, representing an average-sized build-
ing of 100 m2, is selected to ensure that each aggregated cell has at least one building.

The urban conﬁguration in this case study is the entire polycentric urban system,
suburbs and rural areas. The data show no loss of urban.

Table 1 lists the driving forces used in the model based on a literature review (e.g.
Dubovyk et al., 2011, Poelmans and Van Rompaey 2010, Cammerer et al. 2013) and the
ﬁndings of previous work on our study area (e.g. Mustafa et al. 2018a, 2018b).

The slope data are generated based on a digital elevation model (DEM) made
available by the Belgian National Geographic Institute. Accessibility factors include the
Euclidean distance to roads in 2001, railway stations in 1999, and Belgian cities. Roads
are categorized into four classes: RC1 (highways), RC2 (main roads), RC3 (secondary
roads), and RC4 (local roads). Large-sized cities represent all Belgian cities with a
population > 90,000 in 2000, whereas medium-sized cities are all cities with a population
between 20,000 and 90,000 in 2000. The employment rate and richness index in 2000
are used as socioeconomic factors. The zoning map is based on the Wallonia zoning plan
adopted between 1977 and 1987. Since 1987, changes in the zoning plan have been
very limited in space and size. All zones where urban development is legally permitted
are encoded as 1 and all other zones are encoded as 0. We standardized the driving
forces as our aim is to elucidate relationships. To minimize the potential of spatial
autocorrelation, which could bias the estimates of parameters in the logit analysis
(Overmars et al. 2003), we used a data sampling approach following Poelmans et al.
(2010), Cammerer et al. (2013), and Mustafa et al. (2017). A set of 20,000 cells was
randomly selected, with an equal number of no-changes and changes. Existing urban
cells in 1990 were excluded from the sampling. After 100 runs of the logit model with
diﬀerent sets of samples, we selected the set with the best area under ROC curve (AUC).

4. Results and discussion

In this section, we highlight the result of the logit calibration and discuss the allocation
uncertainty. The estimated coeﬃcients of the logit model are shown in Table 2.

The PR2 of the logit model is 0.295. Although PR2 and R-squared values both range
from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating a better ﬁt to the model, PR2 values are not
equivalent to OLS R-squared values. As the logit model
is a maximum likelihood
estimation method, the PR2 values tend to be considerably lower than the OLS
R-squared (McFadden 1977). Domencich and McFadden (1975) state that PR2 range of

SD and the MC methods, we examine the model performance with respect to each
individual method. The SD is introduced in the model by updating Eq. 5 as follows:

Pit ¼ Pidð

Þt(cid:3)conð:Þ (cid:3) SD

(9)

We use diﬀerent values of σ (Eq.1) to investigate its eﬀect on the model. For the MC method,
Wu (2002) suggests that the range of δ is usually 1–10. Accordingly, we set δ at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and
10. With higher values of δ, the model tends to produce strongly skewed probabilities that
cause the computation time to increase exponentially. For example, when δ was set at 20 the
cells with original probabilities of 0.9426 and 0.5854 become 0.5121 and 0.0002 after imple-
menting Eq. 2. The computing time with a high δ value is long; for instance, one run using
δ = 15 is ~1.8 h, and one run using δ = 20 is ~23.9 h. Table 4 presents the average computation
time per run for each method. We implemented our model in MATLAB, running on a desktop
computer clocked at 3.60 GHz with 32.0 GB RAM. The results indicate that the TMC method is
faster than the SD and the MC methods.

Many simulations are required to investigate the properties of the model in the dynamic
environment of diﬀerent random noises; we therefore ran the model 9,000 times (500 runs per
conﬁguration). The simulated allocation error (AE) for new urban cells is given in Table 5. Based
on the experimental results, the TMC method with ɸ = 0.01, 0.02, and 0.1 in the model slightly
improves the averaged AE. This is also the case for the SD method with σ = 0.01 and 0.05.
Increases in both ɸ and σ decrease the averaged AE as the model involves more randomness.
In contrast, the MC method projects an increase in the averaged AE with higher values of δ as
the result that δ controls the exponential curve that scales the transition probability.
Consequently, higher δ values cause a more skewed curve, and the chance of cells with higher
transition probability values also increases.

Figure 5 presents H, M, and FA for the validation time interval for the deterministic

model.

Figure 6 illustrates the future urban patterns for 2030 and 2100. We set a ﬁxed simulated
quantity per time-step, one year, equal to the observed quantity during 2000–2010 divided
evenly by 10. Figure 6 demonstrates that the MC method cannot produce simulations similar
to the results from deterministic model. Furthermore, this comparison becomes more diﬃcult
with lower values of δ. In contrast, the SD method with a very low degree of σ produces
simulations that are similar, with some marginal diﬀerences, to results from deterministic
model, which can be expected as the model tends to evolve to a stable state with lower
degrees of σ. By increasing the degree of σ, the model produces simulations that are quite
diﬀerent from those produced in a deterministic way. Figure 6 conﬁrmed that the proposed
TMC method inherits well the randomness in the model. The TMC model produces simulations

that are similar, with marginal diﬀerences, to the results from deterministic model at the earlier
time-steps (e.g. 2030) and tunes the simulations far from the deterministic-based simulations
as the model simulates further into the future (e.g. 2100). One could ask why the SD method is
not used to tune uncertainty over time since it produces comparable results with the TMC
method, and we can increase the degree of randomness over time via σ. A key feature of the
TMC method is that the TMC keeps the original transition probabilities, which is not the case
with the SD method. Retaining the original transition probabilities enables retrospection of the
land-use change process in which the landowners may resort to speculative motives for

hoarding land, in anticipation of the potential urban development in the future. Regarding the
magnitude of uncertainty, which is controlled by ɸ or σ, Table 6 shows that the TMC method
controls the degree of randomness more eﬃciently than the SD method.

Table 6 gives the number of new cells that were diﬀerently allocated between every two
runs of the 500 simulations for each conﬁguration. For example, in case of the TMC with
ɸ = 0.01 the maximum allocation diﬀerence between two runs in 2030 is 1.37%; the model
allocates 22,107 cells out of 22,414 new cells in the same locations in the two runs while
allocates 307 cells diﬀerently. The table illustrates the dependence of model results on the
degree of the randomness parameter. The results reveal that the SD method generates
landscape patterns for 2100 that are more similar to each other than the patterns generated
for 2030. This is also the case for the MC method. This is against expectations because the
distant future is more uncertain than the near future. One explanation for this is that the logit
model, based on the factors presented in Table 2, eﬃciently narrowed the potential areas to be
urbanized in the future; thus, the future simulations tended to be similar when reaching the
maximum potential values. Both the SD and the MC methods are set at a constant change
amount per time-step, whereas the available number of cells that can change their land-use
state decreases with later time-steps. If the number of available cells is lower, as is the case in
2100, the possibility for the available cells to be randomly selected during each run is higher. In
contrast, the TMC method is set at a ﬁxed change amount and the number of cells that can
change their state increases with time. As a result, the TMC method is able to increase the
degree of randomness over time.

If the simulations are uniform, a speciﬁc number of cells will change their state in most of
the simulations resulting in lower diﬀerences in the allocation process. In contrast, if the
simulations are very variable, many cells will change to another state in each simulation, and
therefore the diﬀerence between each simulation is high. Forecasting and interpreting the
future simulations would be challenging if the model generates land-use patterns that are very
diﬀerent from each other. With a lower degree of randomness, the SD-based model generates
similar landscape patterns in the distant future, such that the future simulations can be
considered as an extrapolation of the past trends. The TMC method with ɸ = 0.01 produces
patterns with small diﬀerences for the near future (e.g. 2030) and greater diﬀerences for the
distant future. Notably, by 2100, the TMC method is still able to generate patterns that are not
very diﬀerent from each other.

Our proposed method assumes that all projections are exposed to the same
sources of allocation uncertainty. Therefore, further research is required to examine
how to quantify several sources of spatial allocation uncertainty such as uncertainties

related to the model structure, model simpliﬁcation, and model parameter estimates.
For example, our model was calibrated and validated with 1990–2010 data.
Throughout this period, there were no major urban transition breaks and the land-
use dynamics were considered rather consistent over time. In contrast, applying our
model to urban land over a distant past, for example, from 1950 to 2010, would allow
us to analyze uncertainties related to major development breaks, such as the shift
from a train-based to a car-based city in the 1950s and 1960s, the succession of
diverging economic cycles, or the adoption of legally binding land-use regulation in
the late 1970s. Therefore, extension of this study will examine the non-linear type of
change and include a longer period in model calibration and validation.

5. Conclusions

We have proposed the Time Monte Carlo method (TMC) to introduce randomness in land-use
change models with the aim of modeling spatial allocation uncertainty. The method is based
on a Monte Carlo simulation in which a cell in the landscape is randomly selected and its
transition probability from one land use to another is compared with a random number
uniformly distributed within a dynamic range that increases over time. We compared the
proposed method with two widely used methods to introduce randomness in land-use
change forecasting: stochastic disturbance, and Monte Carlo simulation. The three methods
were introduced into a logistic regression-cellular automata model that was developed to
simulate urban expansion in Wallonia (Belgium) between 1990 and 2010.

Our analysis reveals that the TMC method produces results comparable with the
existing methods over the short-term validation period (2000–2010). Furthermore, the
proposed method is capable of tuning uncertainty on longer-term horizons. Controlling
the degree of randomness over time is an important feature of the TMC method as the
distant future is characterized by more uncertainty than the near future.

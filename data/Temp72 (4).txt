Abstract. As an object moves through space, it creates a track (or path) repres-
enting the object’s past and present position and associated attributes. If data
capture fails, then positions along the tracks are unknown. The particular problem
we address in this paper is to create tracks of moving objects with missing data.
We implement and test two techniques that create continuous tracks of two
primate species (Ateles geoVroyi, the red spider monkey, and Cebus capucinus, the
white-faced capuchin). Continuous tracks were needed to calculate home range
and to analyze daily ranging patterns for each species. Establishing continuous
tracks of primates through ﬁeld data alone, however, was impossible due to
challenging ﬁeld conditions. The results of the analysis using tracks with inter-
polated positions helped establish that Ateles tend to move directly to their
destination while Cebus tended to follow a more wandering track.

Introduction
As an object moves through space, a track (or path) can be recorded that
represents its past and present positions and its attributes. If data capture fails, then
positions along the tracks are unknown. The problem we address in this paper is to
create complete tracks of moving objects when some of the positions are unknown.
Examples of moving objects are ﬂeet management operations (Pfoser and Jensen
1998); hurricane and tornado tracks (Georges et al. 1993, Brotak and Le Comte
1994); movement of animals (Crist et al. 1992, Wilson 1994); avalanche movement
(Walsh et al. 1990); airplane movement (Brunk and Davis 2002); and events along
storm drains (Carapella 1997). Attributes of the object can be recorded at positions
along the track. For example, node values may record the ‘behaviour of the animal’
or ‘intensity of the storm’. We have begun to see geographical information systems
(GIS) designed to display tracks. Nevertheless, tools to manipulate and analyze
tracking data are not well developed conceptually or are not yet implemented. For
example, the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) oﬀers Tracking

Analyst as an extension to ArcViewA, which has several display functions but few
data manipulation or analytical options. The data manipulation techniques presented
in this paper extend the options available to scientists studying spatial processes
along tracks.

In this study, we develop and test two methods to interpolate missing data along
tracks to create a representation of a moving object in both space and time. The
ﬁrst approach we develop and test is based on linear weighted distances, which we
simply call a straight line method; and the second is based on a constrained random
walk. The straight line approach simply involves creating a new track by drawing a
straight line between two known points and distributing the new points evenly along
the track. The second approach, the constrained random walk, incorporates direction
change and altering the speed of travel into the algorithm.

A major application area of tracking moving objects is animal movement. We
therefore test our interpolation methods on the movement of two primate species in
Costa Rica (Ateles geoVroyi, the red spider monkey, and Cebus capucinus, the white-
faced capuchin). The estimated locations are combined with known observed posi-
tions to answer two basic research questions: (1) what is the home range for each
species?, and (2) what are the daily ranging patterns for each species? Scientists
interested in animal behavior have long recognized that individuals and groups
occupy a ‘home range’, discrete geographical areas used over the course of their
lives. To identify the home range for an individual or a group, a spatially and
temporally continuous representation of animal positions is required. However, it
may not always be logistically possible to do this. For example, at La Selva Biological
Station in northeastern Costa Rica, establishing continuous tracks of primates was
impossible because the animals’ range over large distances, and dense vegetation,
hilly terrain, and heavy rainfall impeded continuous monitoring of their positions.
A need therefore arose to develop a method for estimating their positions when their
actual positions were unknown.

2. Background

There is a related GIScience literature on how to represent moving objects and
to assess uncertainty of their positional accuracy. Moreira et al. (1999) develop a
method to represent and query moving points derived from sensors (e.g. Global
Positioning System). Moving objects are represented as tuples deﬁned with a unique
identiﬁer, valid time interval, and an initial state (the location). The data model we
use has similar characteristics, although we structure ours based on a speciﬁc time
stamp rather than an interval. Pfoser and Jensen (1998) examine the positional
uncertainty of moving objects. They quantify measurement uncertainty (in their case
due to potential inaccuracy of GPS) by creating ellipses that represent regions of
possible positional error.

Moving objects create tracks or paths through space. Positions along the track
need to be estimated when data capture methods fail (e.g. GPS signal unavailable).
The largest body of literature on interpolating the position of moving objects is
based on tracking animal movement. Scientists track animal movement to determine
microhabitat, to better understand resource use, to establish behavior response to
habitat structure, and to ﬁnd the nesting sites of secretive animals (Wilson 1994,
South 1999). Most research has been based on tracking animal
locations and
attempting to monitor their behavior continuously. Methods of tracking animals
include direct observation, use of a spool-line, sensors put directly on animals,

photographs of animals taken at regular intervals, and satellites (Priede and French
1991, Waturu and Yuzuriha 1993, Wilson 1994). With some techniques (e.g., spool-
line and sensors put directly on the animals), the continuous locations of the animals
are monitored. Their activities (e.g., sleeping, grooming, and eating), however, are
not recorded. For microscopic organisms, photographs are taken at regular intervals,
recording both their location and the activity. Waturu and Yuzuriha (1993) placed
sensors on marine animals to collect data on water temperature, depth, and light
intensity. Although they did not collect location information in this study, sensors
could be added to collect this type of information.

A more technical approach for recording the movement of animals and allowing
for the simultaneous recording of location and behaviour data is through radio-
tracking (Rothstein et al. 1984, USGS 1997). The problems, however, are that
visibility, animal
fears, and other physical constraints prevent data from being
collected continuously. Consequently, simulation of animal movement and triangula-
tion are techniques used to estimate the locations of the animals when they are not
being tracked. Animal movement has been simulated through fractals, negative
binomial distributions, correlated random walks, and Monte Carlo simulations
(Schmutz and White 1990, Crist et al. 1992, Gautestand and Mysterud 1993, Turchin
1996, Schippers et al. 1996, Tischendorf 1997, Tischendorf et al. 1998). These
approaches utilize a broad spectrum of methods to approximate animal movement,
but none can be applied generically to interpolating positions of moving objects.
Some have been developed with a particular application context and data set in
mind. For example, Schippers et al. (1996) use a random walk model to simulate
animal dispersal in a heterogeneous environment.

There is recent interest in utilizing GIS for studying marine animal movement,
as demonstrated by Hooge and Eichenlaub (1997), Bian (2000), and Hooge et al.
(2001). Bian (2000) evaluates the merits of an object-oriented environment for
modelling mobile objects, using the movement of animals in a marine environment
as a case study. Although Bian (2000) deals with the problem of objects moving to
new locations, the data type is based on the objects rather than the tracks. Hooge
et al. (2001) wrote extensions to the ArcViewA environment to analyze the spatial
patterns and movement patterns of marine animals. Their extensions, however, are
generic enough that they can be applied to terrestrial animal movement as well. The
analytical methods described by Hooge et al.
(2001) are extensive and include
random walks and other techniques for animal movement simulations.

3. Methods
3.1. Study L ocation

Empirical data for our study were collected from La Selva Biological Station, a
rainforest research station in north-eastern Costa Rica, 10° 25∞ N, 84° 01∞ W, (ﬁgure 1).
La Selva is in the tropical wet forest life zone with precipitation averaging approxi-
mately 4000 mm (Sanford et al. 1994). Bisecting the dense vegetation and hilly terrain
are approximately 45 km of ﬁxed trails. Three primate species are present, Alouatta
palliata (the mantled howling monkey), Ateles geoVroyi (the red spider monkey),
and Cebus capucinus (the white-faced capuchin). The combination of dense vegeta-
tion, heavy precipitation, and hilly topography, make
extreme ﬁeld
conditions for studying fast-moving primates. The study reported here was the ﬁrst
long-term study of primate ecology at La Selva despite its many years of operation,
due expressly to diﬃcult observation conditions.

3.2. Data

For the study reported here, positions of one group of Ateles geoVroyi, the red
spider monkey, and one group of Cebus capucinus, the white-faced capuchin, were
collected at a ﬁve-minute sample rate by direct observation for a 10-month period
from March to December 1991. During the study period, each group was observed
for eight consecutive hours, two days per week. Radios were used to help locate the
animals while we were walking through the forest with handheld receivers (Campbell
and Sussman 1994). The density of the rainforest prohibited us from pinpointing the
exact locations using radios alone. Their positions were determined by following the
animals and marking trees in which they were observed. The trees were later recorded
by mapping their position relative to other known locations in the forest.

The ﬁnal data set consists of two types of records. Mapped points, deﬁned by
a=(x
), are records for which the location was known (Ateles,
n=1446; Cebus n=1294). Records for which the location was unknown are referred
to as intermediate points, i=(x
) (Ateles, n=2183; Cebus, n=2471). Intermediate
points occurred either when contact was maintained with the primates, but due to
characteristics of the dense rainforest habitat, their precise location was unknown,
or when contact with the primates was not maintained at all. If the intermediate

and the position (x

A connected temporal sequence of mapped and intermediate points represents
the possible track the group of primates might have taken. Sequences of mapped
points when connected are referred to as known segments. Sequences of intermediate

x, y coordinates for the intermediate points to create estimated tracks of the unknown
segments. The known segments and the unknown segments are then connected to
create complete tracks of primate movement.

The overall method for creating the complete tracks involves implementing and
comparing two interpolation methods, a linear weighted distance interpolation and
a random walk interpolation (ﬁgure 2). In Step One, the known segments, their
endpoints, and the time interval (t
) of the unknown segments are identiﬁed. The
assessment of two interpolation methods takes place by applying both interpolation
techniques to the begin and end points of the known segments (Step Two) to create
predicted positions of the known segments. These predicted known segments were
then compared to the observed known segments (Step Three). Step Four involves
selecting the best interpolation method for each primate species based on several
error measures. Finally, complete tracks are created by interpolating all values of

(x
) for the unknown segments and combining these interpolated segments with
the observed known segments (Step Five). The remainder of this section describes
details on each step.

3.3. Interpolation algorithms

The two interpolation techniques implemented in this study were: (1) a linear
weighted distance and (2) a constrained random walk. The ﬁrst method creates new
points by generating a straight line from the last known point to the start of the
next known segment and distributing intermediate points evenly along the interval.
This approach was selected for its simplicity, but it may over-simplify the shape of
the track. The second method utilizes a constrained random walk to estimate the
shape of the track. The constrained random walk was selected to avoid the assump-
tion that anything other than a random process controls the movement in space.
Although other techniques (e.g. fractals) could be used to simulate processes, we
chose to start with these two. The algorithms were implemented with a suite of Java
programs with output in ASCII text format, suitable for display and subsequent
analysis in most GIS software.

3.3.1. L inear weighted distance

The ﬁrst approach implemented was based on linear weighted distances, which
we also call the ‘straight line method’. We assumed that the locations of the inter-
mediate points were distance-weighted averages of data points occurring immediately
before and after the mapped point. The following equations were used to interpolate

3.3.2. Constrained random walk

The constrained random walk method used a combination of Monte Carlo
methods and space-time prism concepts (ﬁgure 3). Details of the algorithm are
described with pseudocode in the Appendix. Monte Carlo methods are mathematical
experiments that use random numbers to simulate processes; they are used in a wide
range of disciplines from nuclear physics to biology (Hammersley and Handscomb
1964). The constrained random walk interpolation algorithm also utilized space-
time prism concepts, initially developed to model movement of people (Ha¨gerstrand
1970). A three-dimensional prism is constructed that forms the possible space within
which an individual can move in a given time. Theory and methods for describing
and using space-time prisms continue to evolve (Hariharan and Hornsby 2000) and
are often used to describe accessibility, particularly in the ﬁeld of transportation
geography (Burns 1979, Miller 1991). The constraints associated with space-time
prism concepts applied here were (1) individuals have a maximum speed at which
they can travel; and (2) their movements require the use of time, that is, they do not
end up at their destination instantaneously (Burns 1979).

A two-dimensional random walk (a Monte Carlo simulation) represents a
sequence of movements in which each step is independent of the previous step. In
the case of tracking data, the assumption of independence was maintained but

dependent on a probability of turning for each step. To increase the chance of turning
in a particular direction, a constraint was created using a frequency table, which is
built from the number of turns made in each direction in the observational data. In
our study (described below), a ﬁve-direction frequency table (right, left, ahead, back,
and stay) was utilized. In this example, a random number was generated between 1
and the highest number in the frequency table to assign the turn direction. If any
direction other than ‘stay’ was selected, a second random number was then generated
between the minimum and maximum angles for the assigned direction. For example,
if the ﬁrst random number indicates an ‘ahead’ direction, a second random number
between −45° and 45° was generated. This second random number represented the
bearing taken during the next step, which required that a current bearing exists.
When no current bearing existed (i.e. when the previous turn was ‘stay’), the bearing
was measured from the known start point (x

) to the end point (x

, y

, y

).

The distance of each step in the interpolation was constrained by utilizing
concepts of the space-time prism model. Based on the space-time prism, given a
speciﬁed elapsed time, there is a maximum distance an observer can travel. This
distance, d, was calculated by multiplying an adjusted maximum speed, v
, by the
time interval for each step. Assuming a homogeneous surface and no spatial barriers,
the distance d was used as the radius of a circle around the originating point. This
circle identiﬁed the spatial extent within which the object can travel in a single step
from the given point (x
, was used
instead of the known maximum speed (v
) because we found that the radius of a
max
circle calculated with the known maximum speed was too large, which meant in
many cases the destination could be reached in very few steps. v
was determined
by starting with the known average speed (v
until
a usable speed was found or until the known maximum speed was reached. For each
step (i), a distance (d

The random walk for interpolating tracks was further constrained because the
travel time remaining (t
) and the ﬁnal destination (x

(1998) refers to this type of random walk as a biased random walk. To account for
this constraint, space-time prism concepts were again utilized. A circle was generated

maximum speed, v

calculate the radius, a large circle was produced. A large circle allowed the random
walk track to ‘wander around’ at the beginning of the interpolation and then be
forced to make a ‘beeline’ to the destination at the end. The adjusted maximum
speed was a speed that allowed the destination to be reached based on the distance
and time between known points. The resulting radius (d
) was proportional to the
average speed of travel and the time needed to get to the destination for that step i.
If x
, calculated from equations (3) and (4), did not fall within this circle, the
destination could not be achieved in the time remaining. These x, y coordinates were
then thrown out and a new pair was generated until the resulting point fell within
the circle. After a suitable point was found, the destination circle was reset based on
the new travel distance (d

The random walk model was deliberately calibrated to over-predict because the
ultimate goal was to use the model to estimate tracks along unknown segments. The
straight line distances of all the unknown segments were longer than the known
segments, therefore the primates need to travel
faster and farther to reach the
destination. Faster travel along the unknown segments makes sense because this was
one reason why the ﬁeld biologists lost contact with the animals.

3.4. Interpolation assessment

Before complete tracks could be generated, the interpolation methods were tested.
Using the begin and end points of the known segments, predicted segments were
generated with both interpolation algorithms (ﬁgure 2, Step Two). For each observed
known segment and predicted segment, distance, speed and sinuosity were calculated.
Given the variable nature of the random walk method, the simulation was run 50
times and distance, speed and sinuosity were averaged. Distance and average speed
are directly correlated, but speed is standardized by the elapsed time. Only those
points that were within one standard deviation from the mean were used in the ﬁnal
analysis. Sinuosity is a ratio between the straight-line distance between end points
and the distance measured along the track (equation (5)). The resulting value is a
real number between 0 and 1 (0.0<sinuosity∏1.0), where 1.0 represents a straight
track.

All cases in which the observed data reported no movement (track distance=0) were
dropped from the sinuosity analysis to avoid dividing by zero.

Distance, speed, and sinuosity of observed known segments were then compared
with the predicted values using several error statistics described by Willmott (1984)
(ﬁgure 2, Step Three). Summary univariate measures were calculated: mean of the
observed (O: ), mean of the predicted (P: ), and the standard deviations (s
). Five
diﬀerence measures were also calculated. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the
root mean square error (RMSE) are average diﬀerence measures. RMSE is the error
measure mostly commonly computed in geographical applications, but MAE is
sometimes preferred because it is less sensitive to extreme values. Also calculated
were the systematic and unsystematic root mean square errors (RMSE
).
Systematic RMSE assesses whether the model errors are predictable in some fashion.
Unsystematic RMSE identiﬁes those errors that are not predictable mathematically.
The ﬁnal error measure, d, was used to estimate the overall relative degree to which
O is approached.

In testing the random walk method, we could have used a type of jackkniﬁng
but we chose not to because it would have little eﬀect on the ﬁnal outcome. As a
reminder, the random walk model is created with a frequency table of turns (n=726
for Ateles and n=543 for Cebus) determined from the known segments (n=155 for
Ateles, n=158 for Cebus). Any one of the known segments contains at least two and
at most eight turns. Those segments represent only a range of 0.3% to 1.5% of the
total number of turns, implying that any one of the known segments contributes
only a small amount to the overall model.

3.5. Home range calculation and daily track analysis

After the best interpolation method for each species was selected, complete tracks
were created by combining the observed known segments with the interpolated
unknown segments (ﬁgure 2, Steps Four and Five). Complete tracks were then used
to answer two basic research questions: (1) What is the home range of each species?,
and (2) What are the daily foraging habits of each species?

We deﬁne home range as the area used by the group in its normal daily activities
over time (National Research Council 1981). There are numerous methods to estim-
ate home range size, both non-statistical methods (e.g. minimum convex polygon
and grid cell) and statistical methods (e.g. kernel density, harmonic mean, Fourier)
(Worton 1987, 1995, Loehle 1990, Seaman and Powell 1996, Herbinger et al. 2001).
Although other methods may be used more commonly in other areas of wildlife
biology, the grid cell method was selected to be consistent with other primatology
research (Altmann and Altmann 1970, Rasmussen 1982, Chapman 1988, Castro
1991, Ostro et al. 1999, Fashing 2001, Kaplin 2001, Singleton and Schaik 2001). In
this study, a grid composed of 1-ha (100 m×100 m) cells (National Research Council
1981) was superimposed over a map of the site. Home range was calculated by
summing the number of grid cells entered by each species during the 10-month study
period. Overlap area was calculated by identifying those areas shared by both
primate species during the study period.

Seaman et al. (1999) report that more than 50 samples are needed for home
range size to reach asymptotic levels when using kernel density methods. They also
report that other studies have found 100–300 samples are needed for the home range
size to stabilize using the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method. No studies were
found that describe sample size tests using grid methods. To test whether the home

range size was an artifact of sample size, we calculated home range estimates on
random samples of 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1800, and 2100 observations from the set of
mapped points. These were then compared to home range estimates on random
samples of 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1800, 2100, 2400, 2700, 3000, and 3300 observations
from the complete tracks. The complete tracks contained both the mapped points
and interpolated positions of the intermediate points.

To gain better insight into the foraging behaviour of both species, a daily track
analysis was performed. For each day, track length and total observation time
(track duration) were calculated from the complete tracks. Summary statistics of
track length and track duration were calculated and completed tracks were analysed
through a simple linear regression.

4. Results
4.1. Interpolation assessment

To build the random walk interpolation, frequency tables for direction change
were generated from the known segments (table 1). Calculating direction change
required that at least three consecutive mapped points existed. For both species,
‘stay’ was the most frequently chosen option. The known segments were also used
to generate maximum speed and average moving speed, two parameters used in the
random walk algorithm (tables 2 and 3).

Scatterplots of observed track distance versus model-predicted distance are dis-
played in ﬁgure 4 (a. Ateles, n=155; b. Cebus, n=158). Scatterplots of observed track
speed versus the model-predicted speeds for the known segments are displayed in
ﬁgure 5 (a. Ateles, n=154; b. Cebus, n=157). The scatterplot graphs demonstrate
that there is a systematic and fairly linear relationship between both models and the
observed data for the distance and speed variables. Scatterplots were not generated
for sinuosity values; predicted sinuosity values for the straight line model were always
equal to 1.0 (given the deﬁnition of sinuosity, equation (5)). In the case of the random
walk model, a simple linear regression showed little relationship between observed
versus predicted sinuosity values (Ateles r2=0.40, n=65 and Cebus r2=0.34, n=
105). This occurs because when a three-point segment contains one ‘stay’ and one
‘move’, a straight line results with a sinuosity value of 1.0. The predicted sinuosity
values, however, deviated from the straight line movement.

For distance, the straight line method under-predicted the distance values and
the constrained random walk over-predicted, for both Ateles and Cebus. Likewise,
speed and sinuosity were under-predicted for the straight line and over-predicted for
the random walk method for both species. For Cebus, the random walk method
results in smaller diﬀerences than the straight line for both distance and speed. These
simple measures suggest that the random walk method is slightly better than the
straight line for Cebus.

The ﬁve diﬀerence measures (tables 2 and 3) were also used to assess performance
of the models. For distance and speed, MAE, RMSE, and d indicated the straight

The interpolation method best suited to each species was applied to the unknown
segments. The straight line model performed slightly better than the constrained
random walk when comparing observed and predicted segments for Ateles. For
Cebus, the random walk model performed better. Overall, however, both the straight
line and the constrained random walk generally performed better for Ateles than
they did for Cebus, suggesting that the movements of Ateles can be modelled more
easily. The predicted unknown segments were then combined with the known seg-
ments creating complete tracks, which constitute one complete day at ﬁve-minute
intervals. Figure 6 illustrates ﬁnal tracks for both species for one day using both
interpolation methods.

(b) mapped and interpolated intermediate points). Cebus consistently had a larger
home range than Ateles when calculated with and without the interpolated points.
Ateles home range, however, experienced a greater percentage increase when compar-
ing the interpolated to the home range size without using interpolated points (32%
increase versus 17% increase in Cebus). They shared 118 ha, or 38.5% of the combined
range using interpolated points and 33.6% without.

The size, location, and degree of overlap of home ranges for both species varied
over time (table 5). Similar to the overall home range, Cebus consistently had a
larger home range when calculated with and without the interpolated points. For
Ateles, home range varied from a minimum of 13 ha in March to 96 ha in April
when using the interpolated points. Mean monthly home range size over all months
was 49 ha (n=3465 over 10 months, standard deviation=27.1). For Cebus, the
minimum home range was 31 ha in March to a maximum of 99 ha in Septem-
ber, with a 56 ha mean home range size (n=3494 over 10 months, standard
deviation=19.2). Generally, monthly home ranges were larger for Cebus than for
Ateles, even though the number of observations was similar.

Despite a home range overlap of 118 ha overall, in any particular month the
shared home range was relatively small, ranging from 0 ha in May to 24 ha in
September. This possibly suggests that despite a moderate amount of overall common
usage of forest, interaction between species may be minimal. Although evident with

the mapped points alone, the pattern is stronger when the interpolated data are
included in the home range calculation.

Figure 8 displays the results of our assessment on whether the increase in home
range size was an artefact of sample size. For both Cebus and Ateles, smaller sample
sizes resulted in smaller home range estimates for the mapped points alone and the
combination of mapped and intermediate points. For Cebus (ﬁgure 8(a)), for any
given sample size, the home range size remained larger with the mapped points and
smaller using points from the straight line mapped and intermediate points. The
trend for each method is similar and home range size does not appear to stabilize
at any sample size. In contrast, for Ateles (ﬁgure 8(b)), when the sample size was
900, 1200, and 1500, the mapped points alone estimated a larger home range size
than the same sample size from the mapped and intermediate points. For both
interpolation methods (random walk and straight line), it appears that the home
range size stabilized when the number of samples reached 3000. For the mapped
points alone, it is possible that the home range size stabilized when the sample
number reached 1200, but the trend is not long enough to conﬁrm this.

4.3. Daily track analysis

All daily tracks are summarized in table 6. Overall mean length for Cebus was
longer than Ateles even though mean duration was similar, suggesting that Cebus
tend to have more continuous travel. The high standard deviation for mean length
and duration for both species, however, suggests extreme variation in their travel
patterns.

Many of the tracks containing only the mapped points are short in duration
(less than 25 minutes). This was due to factors such as losing the animals or animal
entry into areas where access by researchers was prohibited. The relationship between

639

track length and duration using just the mapped points is not simple or linear
(r2=0.00 Ateles and r2=0.11 Cebus). This is particularly apparent for Ateles, where
track lengths vary from 0 m to 668 m for a 10-minute duration. Even when analysing
only those tracks with a 25-minute duration, this relationship improves for Cebus
(r2=0.33), but does not change for Ateles (r2=0.00).

A clearer pattern emerges when the track analysis is performed using interpolated
points. The resulting tracks are longer in duration because known segments are
combined with unknown (interpolated) segments and represent travel for a single
day rather than pieces of a single day. For Ateles, the relationship is stronger
(r2=0.33) although for Cebus, it is still stronger (r2=0.77).

5. Discussion

It could be argued that the interpolated points and the resulting complete tracks
may not represent true positions and therefore results and conclusions drawn from
them are potentially spurious. Further investigation, however, reveals that the results

not only represent reasonable approximations of primate positions, but they actually
reﬂect ﬁeld observations of the movement patterns of both species. The development
of these two algorithms supported observational hypotheses on primate behaviour
that was only speculative before.

In the assessment of the two interpolation models for each species, the straight
line model performed better for Ateles and the random walk model performed better
for Cebus. This result agrees with observational experience, which indicates that
Ateles tend to stay in one place for fairly long periods of time then move in a
systematic and straight path toward their destination. Their feeding habit is to move
directly from one feeding tree to another (Chapman 1988). In this situation, the
straight line model is likely to be a better representation of their movement. Field
observation of Cebus suggested that movement patterns are not straight and system-
atic due to their omnivorous feeding habits. Their habits involve stopping to forage
for insects while moving between feeding trees (Chapman 1988). For these reasons,
the constrained random walk did a better job of simulating their movement patterns.
The comparative assessment of foraging habits of the two species is further
evaluated with an examination of their home ranges. Two distinct patterns are
apparent: (1) in six of the ten months studied, the home range of Ateles and Cebus
diﬀer notably, with Cebus greater in all but one month; (2) in four of the ten months
studied, the home ranges of both species were strikingly similar. The larger home
ranges of Cebus suggest that although these primates do not travel as fast as Ateles,
they travel more continuously using more overall forest space. Examination of
monthly home range sizes further conﬁrms this. This interpretation could have been
drawn using the mapped points alone, but a larger home range was reported when
using the interpolated points. A larger home range provides conservation agencies
with data to justify making recommendations to policy makers to protect larger
areas of land.

Although conservationists prefer to report a need for larger home ranges, the
results of assessing sample size to calculate home range size are not conclusive. The
estimation of home range size using mapped points alone did not stabilize for either
species, so it is diﬃcult to assess whether the increase in home range size using
interpolated points is misleading. The home range size does stabilize for Ateles,

however, when the combination of mapped points and interpolated points is used.
This suggests that for this species, the home range size reaches equilibrium when
3000 samples or more are used to estimate home range size.

We do not believe the results of the sample size assessment impact our reasoning
for creating the interpolated segments and using them to estimate home range size.
This rationale is based on the fact that both species must have traveled along some
path over the unknown segment. We know that we lost the animals at the end of a
known segment (point (a), for example) and found them again at the start of the
next known segment (point (b), for example). The unknown segment from the end
of (a) to the start of point (b) is part of their home range and part of their daily path
and some estimation of these locations should be included in the analyses.

Unlike home range results that could have been made without the interpolated
points, the results from daily track analysis without the interpolated points would
have been more diﬃcult to interpret. For Ateles, no relationship between travel
distance and time emerged using only the mapped points or using the complete
tracks. This is because these primates spend long periods of time in one location
and then move quickly and directly to the next destination. In many cases, it was
during this travel period that visibility with the animals was lost. We know, however,
that they started at one location and eventually ended up at an observed destination,
so clearly there must be a track between the two points. Field observations of Cebus,
on the other hand, suggest they tend to move more slowly and more frequently,
implying a more linear relationship between travel distance and time. Using only
the mapped points, this relationship is weak (r2=0.11) because, like Ateles, they
were occasionally not visible or entered a restricted area of the forest limiting the
monitoring of them. Using the constrained random walk interpolation, a data set
was created containing approximations of their positions and a stronger relationship
between travel distance and time (r2=0.77) emerged.

6. Conclusion

With continued pressure of tropical deforestation and the protection of species,
research to understand movement patterns of primates is critical. This research
introduced two approaches to interpolating tracking data to explore and to analyse
the tracks of two primate species in Costa Rica. This study helped to identify that
Ateles tend to move directly to their destination, thus the straight line method
performed reasonably well. Cebus, on the other hand, tended to follow a more
wandering track, so the random walk model performed better. The ﬁnal interpolated
tracks assisted in calculating the home range and in describing the daily ranging
habits for each species. Future research will
involve describing the patterns of
concentration in their home range, identifying the core area, and attempting to
understand why these patterns emerge. Seasonal changes to home range size and
distribution will also be compared with variations in plant phenology and seasonal
climate variations.

Future research could also involve modiﬁcations to the interpolation methods.
We could modify the random walk method to generate missing track segments
through a local interpolator rather than a global interpolator. The current approach
involves creating a large scale model of their movement patterns and then creating
turns to generate tracks at a smaller scale, similar to global interpolators regression
analysis and trend surface analysis. Creating a local interpolator for creating missing
track segments may reﬂect possible patterns currently lost at the local scale.

E. A. Wentz et al.

Other modiﬁcations can be made to both interpolation models. One possibility
is to create weighted distances with a non-homogenous surface representing imped-
ances to travel or to include barriers to travel (e.g. a large body of water that the
primates are unable to cross). Another modiﬁcation could be to use the model to
extrapolate points either prior to the beginning of the known data or past the last
known point. These modiﬁcations are not included in this implementation but may
be required depending on the application.

Although the present research represents only one empirical study, two algorithms
for interpolating tracking data have been presented and evaluated. The development
of these tools represents new methods to assist researchers as they examine the
complex spatio-temporal relationships of tracking data. Although we present data
on animal tracking, results of our research can be expanded to other types of tracking
data. We would anticipate that the algorithms could be expanded to objects in a
constrained trajectory (Moreira et al. 1999). In this context, researchers could, for
example, interpolate and potentially assess bus, truck, and automobile movement in
an urban street network. We hope that this research is simply the ﬁrst step in building
more extensive tools for analysing tracking data.

Appendix

Set the following variables:

Set numRight=number of times movement is between 135 and 45 degrees
Set numLeft=number of times movement is between −135 and −45 degrees
Set numAhead=number of times movement is between 45 and −45 degrees
Set numBack=number of times movement is between 135 and −135 degrees
Set numStays=number of times no movement occurred
Set numMoves=numRight+numLeft+numAhead+numBack

For a known starting point (xPrev, yPrev) and a known destination (xNext, yNext)
and at least one point (i>=1) in between that needs to be interpolated, do the
following:

Set the following variables:

Set goRatio=D * ((numMoves/(numMoves+numStays))+1) /* a ratio used to
decrease the possible distance travelled from the origin so that the random walk
does not wander around the origin and then need to make a beeline to the
destination in order to arrive in time. the represents a compromise between the
true goRatio, which would be numMoves/(numMoves+numStays, and a ‘going
all the time ratio’ (i.e. 1).
Set maxSpeed=a speed that will work based on the distance and time between
known points, using the known average speed as a starting point and
incrementing at 0.5 * known average speed until a usable speed is found or
until the known maximum speed is reached. The algorithm rejects speeds if the
destination cannot be met in the time given.
Set deltaTimePC=time from previous known point to the current point to be
interpolated. This is usually a ﬁxed time interval for the entire interpolation, but
the data may have ﬂuctuations in it
Set maxDistPC=maxSpeed * deltaTimePC /* maximum distance that can be
traveled from previous known to the point that needs to be interpolated.

For all the points i between two known points, do the following:

Get the coordinates for the previous known point, xPrev, yPrev
Set deltaTimeCN=time from current point to be interpolated to the next known
point—the destination (xNext, yNext)
Set maxDistCN=maxSpeed * deltaTimeCN /* the maximum distance that can
be travelled from the destination point in the time remaining. This decreases as
the number of points left to interpolate goes to zero
If maxDistCN=0, multiply numStays by 10 /* This gives a higher chance for
a stay

Do the following loop:

Set ranDistPC as a random distance between 0<=maxDistPC
Set ranAngle as an angle based on a frequency table:

Select a random number between 1 and numMoves+numStays:
Set Case RIGHT: If the random number is >1 and <numRight then Set
ranAngle=a new random number between 135 and 45 degrees
Set Case LEFT: If the random number is >numRight and <numRight+
numLeft then Set ranAngle=a new random number between −135 and −45

Systems and Science: the (cid:142) rst 10 years

1.

Introduction
The (cid:142) rst issue of the Internationa l Journal of Geographical Information Systems
appeared in 1987. This year sees the 15th year of continuous publication of the
journal which for 10 years was given that title, and more recently has been the
Internationa l Journal of Geographical Information Science.

One of the most important ways to assess the achievements of any journal is by
its Citation Rating. The Institute for Scienti(cid:142) c Information produces the Science and
Social Science Citation Indices in a bold attempt to catalogue all citations made to
all published papers, providing an invaluable tool for researchers wishing to track
down the literature in diŒerent areas of research. IJGIS is listed in these indices and
categorised in the Social Science Citation Index under the two subject categories
Geography, and Information Science and Library Science.

There are many problems with these Citation Indices. They depend upon correct
entry of references (including author, title, journal, volume, page numbers, etc) by
authors of articles, correct transcription of those entries by data collectors for the
Citation Indices, and correct identi(cid:142) cation of the appropriate abbreviation of the
journal title, as well as the fact that many journals are not included in the listings
at all. These, and other, limitations notwithstanding, the information is used in all
sorts of ways by libraries, publishers and academic promotion committees. In this
editorial, I brie(cid:143) y explore some aspects of the position of IJGIS within the
Citation Indices.

2. General position (Journal Citation Ranking)

The system of citations used by the ISI allows calculation of a number of
indicators of journal performance. The most important of these is the Impact Factor,
which is ‘a measure of the frequency with which the average article in a journal has
been cited in a particular year’ (ISI 2000). The other important performance index
is the immediacy factor which shows how rapidly papers are cited (ISI 2000).

The most recent issue of the Journal Citation Ranking for 1998 shows that when
journals are ranked by impact factor, IJGIS is 14th (of 30 journals) in the Geography
listing (that is Human Geography) and 10th (of 54) in the listing for Information
Science and Library Science. These both show IJGIS to be one of the leading
journals in both the academic areas in which it is catalogued by the ISI. In the 1997
listings for the same categories it was 8th of 31 and 6th of 56 in the respective
categories. In that year it was also listed with the Geography journals in the SCI,
and there it was 4th. In earlier years it has (cid:143) uctuated around these values. In the
1994 listing, for example, it was 15th and 9th in Geography and Information Science
and Library Science.

Editorial

To provide a more realistic list of journals with which to compare IJGIS for
geographers, I have collected together all Geography journals (from the SCI and
SSCI rankings) as well as those in Remote Sensing. IJGIS comes in 26th out of 54
journals in 1998 and 13th out of 56 in 1997. The Immediacy is not so high, being
20th in 1998 and 27th in 1997. Unfortunately we cannot compare IJGIS with
those journals with which it competes directly (including T ransactions in GIS,
GeoInformatica, Geographical Systems, URISA Journal and Geographical and
Environmental Modelling) because none are listed in the citation index, largely because
they are too recent to be included.

IJGIS papers have a ‘half-life’ in the Citation Rankings of 5 years in 1997 and
5.7 years in 1998. There is nothing particularly judgmental about this index, but it
is indicative of the lifetime of a paper in the journal. While this index is undoubtedl y
volatile like the others, the time period appears to be extending as might be expected
from a relatively new journal, such as IJGIS. It does, however, indicate that judge-
ments on papers from less than 5 years ago are unreasonable and that judgements
on ones published up to 10, or even 15, years ago (the whole run of IJGIS publication)
are at least provisional.

3. Citations

Given the indication of half-lives of IJGIS papers, I have reviewed the citation
rates of papers in the (cid:142) rst 10 years of publication of the journal, but in the (cid:142) gures
which follow I show the (cid:142) rst 12 years to indicate the drop-oŒwithin that half-life.
In that time a total of 326 papers have been published of which 286 have been cited
at one time or another (87% of papers). This shows that the majority of papers are
attracting an audience. The actual rates of citation of papers are variable, however.
The most cited paper has been referenced on 67 separate occasions. This is most
unusual ((cid:142) gure 1), and the ratio of the total number of citations of papers published
in the (cid:142) rst ten volumes of the journal to all papers published in that time is 7.97;
on average there have been almost 8 citations to each paper published. This (cid:142) gure
will change in the future as more citations are made to these papers, but the (cid:142) gure
seems quite satisfactory although comparative values for other journals are not
available.

citations was 67, but many papers are only cited once or twice.

A graph of the number of citations to papers published in each year as a ratio
of papers published in that year ((cid:142) gure 2), shows that papers in the (cid:142) rst (cid:142) ve years
of publication (except the second) are cited equally frequently. The value drops from
volume 6 onwards, but that may be due to these papers being relatively recent (less
that 2Ö half-life). On the other hand, the ratio of papers being cited per year to the
number of papers published is often as high as 1, meaning that all papers published
in that year have been cited at some time ((cid:142) gure 3).

4. Special issues

In publishing journals Special Issues are always somewhat suspect, being seen as
a way of avoiding some part of the peer review process (although this is not the case
with Special Issues of IJGIS). Eight Special Issues have been published in the (cid:142) rst
10 years of the journal. Three have citation rates which are equal to or higher than
the mean value for all issues ((cid:142) gure 4), and obviously Volume 4 Issue 3 (Methods of

Spatial Analysis in GIS) has received a great deal of attention by citation. On the
other hand, papers in the other (cid:142) ve Special Issues have citation rates markedly lower
than the overall average, although no one is particularly low. In three Special Issues
all articles have been cited at some time ((cid:142) gure 5), but interestingly this is not the
case for Volume 4 Issue 3. Figures 4 and 5 show that on the whole papers published
in Special Issues are very similar to the general run of articles; few attract high
citation rates, but most attract some attention.

5. Most popular papers

The rate of citations of articles ordered simply by the number of citations is
shown in (cid:142) gure 1. A detail of the 50 most cited papers ((cid:142) gure 6) shows that a small
number of papers (the (cid:142) rst 6) are undoubtedl y the most cited papers. A further
break-point in the graph coincides with the 10th ranked article. Table 1 shows these
10 most cited papers. We can see that without doubt the paper by Egenhofer and
Franzosa (1991 ) has received the greatest recognition and those by Openshaw et al.
(1987), Heuvelink et al. (1989), Davis et al. (1990), Abler (1987) and Goodchild

popular group. It is interesting that four of these top six papers report original
research (the purpose of the journal) while that by Goodchild is more of an opinion
piece as is Abler’s manifesto for the NCGIA (Note: I have of course just increased
the citation rates of these 10 papers by citing them here).

6. Conclusion

The problems of working with citation indices notwithstanding, it is possible to
draw some conclusions from this review. First,
the Internationa l Journal of
Geographical Information Science has provided a valuable vehicle for the publication
of material arising from GI research. It has repeatedly been ranked high in both the
Geography and the Information Science and Library Science rankings. The majority
of articles have been cited at least once, and some have been cited widely. In the
categories in which it is listed in the Citation Rankings IJGIS performs well, although
its actual position (cid:143) uctuates. Furthermore, Special Issues attract as much attention
and as much variety of attention as do regular issues.

The editorial team at IJGIS will continue to provide the service it has striven to
provide of the last 15 years; prompt review, and relatively rapid publication in a
widely read and recognised referred journal. The mix of special and regular issues

will continue, as will articles across the diversity of areas of research in Geographical
Information Science.

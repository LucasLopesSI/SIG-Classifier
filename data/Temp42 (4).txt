Perceptions and Practices: Employers, Educators,
and Students on GIS Internships

Abstract
Within an increasingly competitive job market, academic internships have become an important source of
work experience for students with career interests involving geographic information systems (GIS) and
related geospatial technologies. However, while GIS internships offer beneﬁts to employers and students,
their structure and objectives may be viewed differently across stakeholder groups such as private industry,
government, and academia. In this article we evaluate how GIS internships are valued and perceived by
employers, educators, and the interns themselves using quantitative and qualitative measures collected
though web-based surveys and semi-structured telephone interviews. Data analysis helped us determine
the relative importance of technical and non-technical skills needed by students in preparation for GIS
internships. Our ﬁndings reveal relatively few differences in scores assigned to technical and non-technical
skills when comparing employer and educator ratings. Educator ratings were higher for nearly all technical
and non-technical skills. In comparison, employers placed greater emphasis on technical skills involving
data entry/manipulation and non-technical skills such as ﬂexibility/adaptability. The survey also revealed
differences in employer and educator perceptions of internship goals and administration. Telephone sur-
veys with former interns supplemented information from employer and educator surveys in developing
“best practices” that may be useful in the design and administration of GIS internships.

1 Introduction

From the perspective of employers, experience remains a paramount factor in hiring decisions.
Recognizing the importance of work experience, an increasing number of colleges and univer-
sities encourage students to participate in programs that enhance skills and competencies
within professional settings. Among these, academic internships have emerged as gateways
between academic and work environments that address gaps in knowledge and/or competen-
cies. Today, more than a million college students participate in internship opportunities each
year (Renz 2015), including those which target students with academic preparation in geogra-
phy, remote sensing, cartography, and related areas. For example, the US Geological Survey
has offered a formal internship program since 1965 (US Geological Survey 2012) and the
National Geographic Society since 1981 (National Geographic Society 2015). As GIS applica-
tions have expanded, an increasing number of internships have been established within private
companies, not-for-proﬁt organizations, and local, state, and federal agencies.

Given steady growth in geospatial applications and the increased demand for new GIS pro-
fessionals, this article explores how internships are valued and perceived by employers, educa-
tors, and interns. Beginning with a review of the internship literature, we evaluate how
employers and educators perceive the skills needed by GIS interns. The principal data for

comparisons is provided by web-based surveys of employers and educators with supplementary
data collected through telephone interviews of former GIS interns. Finally, we discuss major
gaps in how GIS internships are perceived and valued by each group and offer examples of
“best practices” based on our ﬁndings.

2 Internships, Experiential Learning, and GIS

Along with practicums and service learning, academic internships are considered a form of
experiential learning. Internships generally involve a formal arrangement where students work
within a professional setting under the supervision of experienced practitioners. For internships
that carry academic credit, a faculty member serves as the instructor of record and is responsi-
ble for monitoring the student’s progress and assigning a ﬁnal grade. As noted by Jackson and
Jackson (2009), internships can be directed or semi-directed. Directed internships involve a
pre-established relationship between an academic department and an employer. Because the
relationship has been formalized and is ongoing, directed internships provide an opportunity
for faculty members and employers to work together in deﬁning students’ activities, desired
learning outcomes, and expected competencies. More ad hoc in nature, semi-directed intern-
ships are developed in the absence of formal ties between an academic department and
employer.

A few researchers have looked in greater depth at the structure of internships. For example,
Jackson and Wirt (1996) and Sovilla (1998) argue that successful internships emerge from
strong working relationships between employers and educational institutions. Ideally, intern-
ships are developed with clear learning objectives and outcomes, with a student’s workload
tied to credit hours earned. Most importantly, there should be regular contact between the stu-
dent and faculty member and between the faculty member and employer. In addition, the stu-
dent should receive regular performance appraisals from their employer.

The literature offers abundant examples documenting the beneﬁts of internships. For
example, internships play a role in building conﬁdence (Ginn 1979, Cross 1994), enhancing
students’ attractiveness to recruiters (Pedro 1984, Zhou et al. 1999, Devine et al. 2007), and
expanding networking skills (Gault et al. 2000). Along with helping to improve technical abil-
internships have been shown to enhance communication and management skills
ities,
(Knemeyer and Murphy 2002, Solem et al. 2008) and may lead to higher starting salaries
(Coco 2000, Carpenter 2003). In addition to their role in developing student competencies,
internships offer beneﬁts to organizations where students serve as a fresh source of ideas (Thiel
and Hartley 1997). Most important, internships offer a chance to assess a student’s potential
for possible full-time employment (Foster 1982, Leach 1998, Williams 2012). As noted by the
National Association of Colleges and Employers (2011), about 60% of US internships led to a
job offer. Internships have other advantages. Compared to the long-term commitment associ-
ated with regular hiring, an internship carries low cost and minimal risk for the employer.
Along with their role in supporting general knowledge and skill building, internships offer a
venue that promotes “. . .self-understanding, self-discipline, and self-conﬁdence. . .[at] the heart
of the experience” (Sweitzer and King 1999, p. 12).

Most faculty members and employers involved in the development of internships know
they are time-consuming to establish and administer. Academic departments without formal
and directed programs may struggle under the workload necessary to organize and maintain
meaningful non-directed internships. For example, faculty members may have limited time for
corresponding with employers and monitoring student interns (Sublett and Mattingly 1995).

Employers may also experience challenges when there is a misalignment between a project
timeline and a student’s 10-week quarter or 15-week academic semester (Wentz and Trapido-
Lurie 2001). Students themselves often have difﬁculty balancing the demands of internship
work with other responsibilities, such as regular coursework, especially when travel to an
internship location is necessary (Sweitzer and King 1999). As a result of time commitments,
students sometimes delay internships until late in their academic programs (Schambach and
Dirks 2002).

Compared with general research about experiential

learning or internships, research
focused speciﬁcally on GIS internships is limited in scope. For example, McKay (1999)
describes an experiential GIS curriculum combining concepts and theory learned in-class with
practical experience gained through an internship. Additionally, Wentz and Trapido-Lurie
(2001) discuss the value of GIS internships for improving transferable skills such as critical
thinking and problem-solving. Most recently, Kopteva et al. (2015) advocate a stepped
approach to geospatial internships where students move from basic to more advanced assign-
ments as their skills improve.

While most research explores the positive aspects and elements of internships, there are
also criticisms. For example, Gore and Nelson (1984) raise questions about the ability of expe-
riential learning to accomplish academic objectives. Others express concern about faculty time
needed to supervise internships (Krohn 1986) or the lack of compensation and recognition
associated with the administration of internship programs (English and Lewison 1979). The
question of paid vs. non-paid internships has also become an issue for many students, especially
those who must decide to “give up a paycheck, but also pay tuition” for academic credit
(Yagoda 2008, p. A36). With these issues in mind we examine employer, educator, and student
perceptions of GIS internships.

3 Methods

Given questions about their value in workplace and educational settings, we evaluate GIS
internships with a focus on the preparation needed by interns, the tasks interns are assigned,
and ways to improve internship experiences. Two sources of data were used in our assessment.
The ﬁrst component involved web-based surveys of GIS employers and educators using themes
and issues speciﬁc to each group as well as general topics that would facilitate comparisons.
Survey questions were designed to address internship phases (e.g. application, training, experi-
ence, evaluation), as well as educator and employer perceptions about the importance of vari-
ous GIS-related and work-related skills within the framework of an internship. A total of 18
questions were included on the survey completed by employers and 14 questions on the educa-
tor survey.

Employers and educators were identiﬁed using Internet keyword searches. Although not
comprehensive, the selection of potential respondents was determined to be fairly representa-
tive and mostly without bias. The list included a wide diversity of persons across higher educa-
tion organizations (e.g. public/private institutions) and employer categories (e.g. public/private/
not-for-proﬁt organizations). In March and April 2015, 655 GIS educators and 417 GIS
employers were sent a brief description of the project along with a request to complete the
survey.

As a supplement to information collected in web-based surveys, semi-structured telephone
interviews were completed with a sample of former GIS interns, identiﬁed using an email
request sent in May 2015 to department chairs at 20 college or university departments located

in the US that offer GIS courses, certiﬁcates, and/or degrees. Departments were selected to rep-
resent a diversity of program types (i.e. those offering GIS degrees, but also programs that
offered courses only) and institution types (from community colleges to doctoral programs).
Department chairs were asked to forward the request to up to three current or former students
known to have participated in a recent GIS internship. Interviews were subsequently set up
with students who responded to the request. Some questions used in the telephone survey
addressed topics covered in employer and educator surveys; others were designed to allow for-
mer interns to reﬂect on their workplace experience. An advantage of the open-ended format
used for telephone interviews was the possibility of posing follow-up questions.

4 Results

Web-based surveys were completed by 106 employers with 45 returned as undeliverable, mak-
ing the response rate 28.5%. The response was slightly lower for educators with 104 com-
pleted, yielding a response rate of 19.7% after accounting for undeliverable surveys. The
largest number of employer responses came from government agencies (89.2%) followed by
private GIS ﬁrms and consulting companies (8.9%). A focus of the survey was to capture per-
ceptions of the relative importance of technical and non-technical skills needed by GIS interns.
Respondents were asked to rate skills as very important, important, neutral, unimportant or
very unimportant. Following Wikle and Fagin (2015), the Mann-Whitney test was used to eval-
uate perceived differences among employers and educators in ratings assigned to each technical
and non-technical skill associated with GIS internships. An a priori level value of 0.05 was
established as a threshold for identifying signiﬁcant differences in scores assigned by each
group. Two questions on each web-based survey were left open-ended. Although these were
often skipped (about 50% in each group), the textual data collected was coded to identify
themes and patterns.

The relatively high levels of importance assigned by employers and educators to technical
and non-technical skills needed by GIS interns were fairly consistent with a few noteworthy
exceptions (Table 1). Skills involving data queries, cartography/graphic design, and data edit-
ing were assigned high scores by both employers and educators. Within this top group of tech-
nical skills, data editing was rated as more important among employers than among educators.
A second tier of technical skills included analysis, working with projections/georeferencing,
digitizing/scanning, database management, and data editing. With the exception of digitizing/
scanning, educators assigned more importance to these skills than employers (Figure 1). Tech-
nical skills receiving the lowest ratings included ﬁeldwork, programming/scripting, model
building, working with remotely sensed datasets, and maintaining computer systems and soft-
ware. Educators also tended to rate these skills as more important for GIS interns than did
employers.

Among non-technical skills, critical thinking and problem-solving skills emerged as the
most important for GIS interns with more than 95% of employers and educators assigning a
rating of “important” or “very important.” Other non-technical skills that received high rat-
ings were ﬂexibility/adaptability,
time management/multitasking, and creativity. Ratings
assigned by employers and educators were similar except for problem-solving skills, rated as
more important by educators than by employers. In comparison, communication skills such as
writing and verbal ability received higher ratings from educators than employers.

Along with questions about speciﬁc skills, employers and educators were asked additional
questions about students’ participation in internships (Table 2). More than 95% of employers

and educators thought that students who participate in GIS internships are better prepared for
full-time employment. Greater than 90% also identiﬁed internships as positive experiences for
both students and employers and 85% indicated a belief that students who complete intern-
ships are more successful that others in locating full-time employment. Although not a statisti-
cally signiﬁcant difference, a higher number of employers (74%) compared to educators (59%)
rated the work assigned to students as “meaningful and challenging.” In addition, a larger per-
centage of employers (69%) compared to educators (55%) believed that GIS employers provide
adequate supervision and feedback for interns. However, a smaller percentage of employers
(47%) than of educators (76%) believed that GIS educators understand the range of skills and
competencies needed to prepare students to serve as interns. In comparison, fewer educators
(78%) than employers (83%) believed that employers appreciate the importance of student
growth and learning during an internship experience.

In the ﬁnal component of our investigation we completed semi-structured interviews with
former GIS interns. In lieu of interviewing a large number of students, we elected to focus on a
smaller number (N56) of detailed interviews. Participants represented six states (California,
Kansas, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, and Texas). Three former interns worked in govern-
ment agencies, two in private industry, and one in a not-for-proﬁt organization (Table 3). In
terms of academic standing, two participated in internships as undergraduates and four during
their graduate studies. Students’ internship programs ranged from 10 weeks to a full year.
Within our sample, two reported having completed more than one GIS internship, while three
out of six received academic credit for their internship (one was a mandatory part of a student’s
degree program), and all but one former intern received an hourly wage (ranging from $7.25 to
$18.00 per hour). All six former interns characterized the majority of their time as being dedi-
cated to tasks involving data entry, data editing, or digitizing, with just two reporting having
been involved with spatial analysis tasks and two others having collected data in the ﬁeld. The
majority of interns described their participation as part of a long-term project, and all but one
felt that her/his internship was a meaningful component of professional development involving
skills that could be transferred to other GIS work settings.

5 Discussion

The ﬁndings presented here offer clues as to how employers, educators and interns perceive
academic preparation needed for an internship involving GIS. As previously noted, employer
and educator perceptions were fairly consistent across the majority of technical skills and non-
technical skills with some noteworthy exceptions. For example, employers tended to place
greater emphasis on skills involving data editing and comparatively less emphasis on higher-
level skills such as analysis, programming, and model building. This may reﬂect the applied
nature of work assigned to interns who are perceived as needing time to be brought up to speed
about an organization’s GIS activities and projects. A tendency to assign higher ratings to tech-
nical and non-technical skills may reﬂect the underlying mission of educators who view

participants. Again, lower ratings assigned by employers to some non-technical skills such as
writing and verbal communication may be tied to the nature of work assigned to interns. The
combined ﬁndings of the web-based surveys and semi-structured interviews provide an oppor-
tunity for additional observations about major gaps among stakeholder groups regarding skills
most important for GIS interns. In addition, they offer an opportunity to assess how employers,
educators, and students perceive each other’s responsibilities related to internships. In a ﬁnal
section we explore ﬁndings from the employer and educator surveys in greater detail and com-
pare them with supplemental information gathered during our telephone interviews with for-
mer interns.

Clearly, some employers perceive interns as lacking skills needed for higher-level work.
In fact, when asked about skills, 85% of employers reported GIS interns as possessing either
minimal or basic skill levels. This is consistent with Sweitzer and King (1999) who found
most interns to be marginally prepared for their work assignment. In addition, interns often
lack the ability to apply contextual meaning, deﬁned as the ability to use skills effectively in
speciﬁc situations. Although based on a small sample, in-depth interviews with former
interns suggest a narrow focus among employers who tend to assign interns to tasks related
to GIS data manipulation/editing in lieu of more advanced activities such as modeling or
analysis.

Some challenges in developing effective internships may be tied to how they are perceived
within higher education. For their part, educators may not understand or appreciate needs and
expectations within the GIS workplace. Our survey revealed that educators often view intern-
ships within the context of opportunities for students to experience a range of skill develop-
ment and reinforcement opportunities (see Unwin et al. 2012), rather than in-depth experience
with real world problem solving. Indeed, interns may experience frustration when they are not
prepared for tasks associated with higher level assignments. The majority of former GIS interns
indicated that they felt underprepared for some tasks assigned during their internships with one
noting, “I would have been better prepared by completing my applied GIS coursework ﬁrst.”
This is consistent with Blanchard et al. (2014) who recommend that students delay internships
until their junior or senior year of college, or until such time as they had acquired advanced
skills and knowledge. Despite the need for more preparation, our survey suggested that educa-
tors may be encouraging students to participate in internships before they were prepared. More
than 70% of educators who participated in the survey required students to complete six or
fewer credit hours of GIS coursework prior to enrolling in internship hours. The survey also
revealed differences in the ways employers and educators perceive the administration of intern-
ships. At least some employers feel that educators do not understand the professional world
while some educators believe that employers may not appreciate educational goals critical to
student learning or skill development.

Former interns also shared ideas about how their respective internships might be improved.
One common issue was a perceived disconnect between skills acquired through GIS course-
work and the application of those skills within internships – again, contextual meaning. Former
interns were surprised at how “real world” GIS datasets in the workplace were messy and dis-
similar to datasets experienced within their coursework. The ad hoc nature of internship work
was appreciated by one former intern who suggested that the lack of structure provided expo-
sure and immersion in GIS techniques beyond what would be offered in a classroom or lab set-
ting. Former interns had mixed feelings about the level of feedback and supervision provided
by their employer or supervisor. Consistent with Schindler and Babbitt (2013) who cite lack of
accountability as a warning sign of poorly administered internships, one former intern noted,
“I felt I could have done nothing and no one would have noticed.” Another intern remarked

that almost everything learned during their internship was “on the ﬂy” rather than introduced
through formal or informal training. Only one of the six former interns was provided with
training involving the organization’s operations, and most were expected to learn unfamiliar
techniques or GIS software without assistance from their employer. This reveals a potential
issue in the way some internships are structured where students who are accustomed to formal
learning environments may need transitional help, especially as they ﬁrst enter a professional
setting. To provide more structure, Sweitzer and King (1999) suggest the concept of a “learning
contract” between the intern, employer, and potentially the educator (if there is academic
credit to be assigned). The contract is simple in format and provides clarity for all parties about
additional training, work assigned, and expected learning outcomes.

To explore ways to make GIS internship experiences more effective, employers, educa-
tors, and former interns were asked to offer advice to other stakeholder groups. Employers
expressed hope that GIS educators would stress the importance of internships to their stu-
dents. Some suggested involving GIS professionals in the development of instructional materi-
als and GIS curricula as a means of addressing changes taking place within industry. A few
employers also emphasized the importance of going beyond basic classroom exercises so that
activities better emulate the real world. Some also recommended involving students in projects
currently underway in GIS organizations. Employers emphasized the use of “real” data or
what one employer described as data that is “less than perfect.” Some employers also offered
suggestions about ways to improve critical thinking through problem-solving introduced as
part of applied coursework. A few others suggested the introduction of a greater variety of
GIS software and giving students experience with coding and programming earlier within their
coursework.

Educators also offered ideas for improving internship experiences by suggesting the impor-
tance of interns being viewed simultaneously as employees and as students. Educators noted
the need to develop meaningful mentor/mentee relationships between existing employees and
interns. Many educators stressed that internship assignments should be varied to incorporate
technical and non-technical skills and that whenever possible, employers should plan challeng-
ing and meaningful projects for interns based on students’ strengths and knowledge. One sug-
gested that a well-rounded internship involves “. . .a single project-driven task as the core of the
internship. . .involve[ing] students in as many project meetings, technical sessions, and mentor-
ing sessions as possible.” Finally, most educators believed that GIS interns should be compen-
sated for their work.

In offering advice to interns, both employers and educators suggested that interns go
beyond assigned tasks. One respondent proposed that students should think of their internship
not as a job, but rather, “. . .as additional education and experience that will pay later.” A few
employers and educators suggested that students not limit themselves to a single internship.
Employers and educators also reinforced the importance of developing critical thinking skills
and networking with others in the GIS industry. Several used the opportunity to provide addi-
tional comments to remind prospective GIS interns that they should expect to be involved in
“grunt work.” A few defended such routine tasks, noting their importance for the completion
of projects. One employer noted,

. . .GIS students can grasp the theoretical GIS concepts just ﬁne, but they really struggle
with some of the “boots on the ground” activities that GIS work involves. Most stu-
dents get frustrated at being assigned what they consider grunt work of data editing,
data organization, QA/QC, or basic map preparation. That’s what a lot of day-to-day
GIS is.

Former interns also offered suggestions, noting the importance of receiving help from
employers in managing day-to-day tasks within the context of larger projects. They also sought
“safe learning environments” where they would feel comfortable asking questions. A common
theme regarded the extent to which interns were trusted with more challenging assignments as
opposed to repetitious tasks. Interns felt more valued when employers showed interest in their
input or perspective on projects or problem solving techniques. When asked about advice for
educators, former interns suggested the need for applied coursework that emulated the work-
place, together with a greater variety of coursework (i.e. programming, database editing, etc.).
Finally, former interns hoped for assistance from educators in securing positions with local,
state, and national organizations.

6 Best Practices

Having considered ﬁndings from our surveys and interviews, we offer ﬁve “best practices” for
guiding employers and educators in developing effective GIS internships. While the ﬁrst two
are general and could apply to any internship, three others are speciﬁc to GIS internships.

Best Practice #1: Create a Work/Learning Contract

One of the most common issues noted by former interns was the skill/knowledge disconnect
between coursework and internship assignments. From using “messy” datasets to learning new
GIS software packages “on the ﬂy,” former interns struggled when there was an absence of
clearly stated work objectives and learning outcomes. Although interns should be treated as
employees, their work assignments provide the greatest beneﬁt when deﬁned simultaneously
around project objectives and learning outcomes. As suggested by Sweitzer and King (1999)
and others, creating a “learning contract” among intern, employer, and supervising educator
ensures that all parties understand professional responsibilities and educational goals tied to a
given internship experience. Additionally within the learning contract, a clear mentor should
be designated for interns as their “go to” person within the organization for help and guidance.

Best Practice #2: Pay Interns

Some employers defend the practice of volunteer internships by emphasizing their educational
beneﬁts. As suggested in recent literature, competition has contributed to the expansion of
unpaid internships (Yagoda 2008, Gardner 2011). However, employers are sometimes
unaware of the ﬁnancial burden carried by students who pay tuition and internship-related
costs that may include travel and housing. Many educators remain adamant that employers
provide compensation to alleviate a portion of the burden on students since costs can deter stu-
dents from pursuing GIS internships. Even those scholars who support the concept of unpaid
internships, encourage students to do so only if the experience “. . .exposes [them] to a dynamic
work environment, and includes challenging and intellectually demanding work related to
[their] ﬁeld of study,” and importantly, where no equally qualiﬁed paid internships exist
(Blanchard et al. 2013, p. 50).

Best Practice #3: Incorporate Problem-Based Leaning within GIS Coursework

A consistent theme within our survey of employers and discussions with former interns was a
need for more problem-based learning (PBL) in GIS coursework. Drennon (2005, p. 385) notes

that PBL provides an opportunity for students to explore theoretical foundations and real
world problems as “. . .constitutive of one another”. Former interns described PBL as offering a
venue that helps transfer knowledge and skills obtained in the classroom to their internship
work. As noted by employers, PBL enables students to escape from “cookbook-style”
laboratory assignments and focus instead on critical thinking skills where GIS functions as a
“solution tool,” as opposed to the solution. The importance of integrating PBL in GIS
coursework has been noted by, among others, S¸eremet and Chalkley (2014), as a means of con-
necting theoretical knowledge and applied GIS skills. Using PBL in GIS education forces stu-
dents to become a part of the learning process, rather than “empty” receptacles for GIS
knowledge.

Best Practice #4: Build Solid Partnerships among GIS Educators and Employers

Surveys of employers and educators suggest that no single factor may be more beneﬁcial in
improving GIS internships than regular communication among employers and educators.
Along with improving the structure of internship opportunities and deﬁning expectations, an
ongoing dialogue between employers and educators may provide ancillary beneﬁts such as
opportunities for employers to visit GIS classrooms and for educators to introduce students to
professional settings (S¸eremet and Chalkley 2014). Partnerships may also lead to opportunities
for students and instructors to engage in collaborative projects in conjunction with GIS organi-
zations (e.g. Bednarz et al. 2008, Barcus and Muehlenhaus 2010). As a result of such exposure,
students may feel more comfortable and conﬁdent in their (future) internship experiences.

Best Practice #5: Empower Interns as Team Members

Interns appear to beneﬁt most from internship assignments associated with longer-term proj-
ects on which they served as a major contributor. As noted by Wentz and Trapido-Lurie
(2001), an ideal internship experience would offer a student the chance to complete an entirely
stand-alone GIS project with the intern involved in each work phase. However, the nature of
GIS work is rarely structured in such a way; many projects are developed over years within a
team environment that involves specialization of tasks. Jackson and Jackson (2009) note from
their survey of former GIS interns, the top two recommendations to improve internships are
better mentoring and more meaningful internship work. With this in mind, internship experien-
ces involving a single, mentored project instead of many disjointed tasks offer a chance for
interns to feel a sense of ownership and accomplishment.

7 Conclusions

Not surprisingly, the ﬁndings presented here demonstrate that most GIS employers and educa-
tors have similar perceptions about the skills needed to prepare students for GIS internships,
save for a few notable gaps. While both groups agreed on internships as arenas to develop a
variety of technical and non-technical skills, educators were more likely to view internships as
venues for developing and improving a breadth of skills needed in the professional world. In
contrast, employers have a narrower view of preparation needed, with a focus on a few speciﬁc
skill areas such as data editing. Such differences reﬂect a broad-based educational mission in
colleges and universities compared to task and project-based agendas common in most profes-
sional settings. Despite the success of experiential leaning, students continue to experience chal-
lenges in making the transition between higher education and professional settings. Although

valued for their ability to bridge these two worlds, internships often fail to reach their full
potential. Survey and interview ﬁndings suggest that a cornerstone for successful GIS intern-
ships is regular communication among employers and educators. Early and ongoing dialog
may beneﬁt student preparation through curriculum and course design, as well as improve
decision-making involving the placement of students within organizations. At the same time,
formal agreements involving the employer, educator, and intern may help in deﬁning explicit
work responsibilities and anticipated learning outcomes, offering beneﬁts to employers, educa-
tional programs, and students.

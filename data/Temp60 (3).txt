Abstract
The present study describes a procedure for quantitatively analyzing satellite telemetry
data to identify interspeciﬁc land use differences among four threatened crane species.
The inherent inaccuracy of satellite telemetry data points, the temporal autocorrela-
tion of those points, and the resolution of two land-cover imagery products from the
IGBP-DISCover Global Land-Cover Characterization Project (derived from AVHRR
data) were assessed and integrated in a GIS. Satellite telemetry is a system where animals
are  tracked  using  battery-operated  transmitters  and  locations  are  calculated  using
triangulation from satellites. Using the variable spatial inaccuracy of the telemetry
locations, each point was buffered using a radius based on the accuracy of the point,
and then intersected with the land cover imagery. The research concluded that the
methodology  is  valuable  for  studies  of  birds  at  a  regional  scale,  with  interspeciﬁc
differences clearly evident, but that diurnal and nocturnal differences were not dis-
cernable due to the coarse resolution of both satellite telemetry and land-cover data.

1 Introduction

The  application  of  satellite  telemetry  to  wildlife  tracking  research  has  proven  valuable
for a diverse range of terrestrial and aquatic animals (Folkow and Blix 1992, Hays 1992,

Mills  and  Gorman  1997).  A  summary  of  methods  for  researching  migratory  trends,
especially for birds, can be found in Webster et al. (2002). By the early 1990s transmitters
(Platform  Telemetry  Terminals  or  PTTs)  were  reduced  in  size  and  weight  so  that  it
was  feasible  to  attach  them  to  large  birds  such  as  swans  (Nowak  et  al.  1990)  and
albatross (Jouventin and Weimerskirch 1990). A large-scale study of crane migration
in  Asia  gave  the  ﬁrst  detailed  look  at  the  migration  patterns  for  a  suite  of  threatened

Previous  studies,  with  limited  sample  sizes,  have  suggested  that  satellite  telemetry
data could provide information beyond the deﬁnition of migration routes of cranes, and
are applicable to ecological studies of habitat use in combination with satellite imagery
(Kanai et al. 1994, 2000; Kondoh et al. 1994; Tamura et al. 2000). While examples of
research  combining  GIS  with  either  satellite  imagery  (Debinski  et  al.  1999,  Penhollow
and Stauffer 2000) or satellite telemetry (Mills and Gorman 1997) can be found in the
literature, few studies have been found that combine all three technologies (Kanai et al.
1994, Kondoh et al. 1994). A consistent and rigorous GIS methodology could tackle the
inherent  weaknesses  of  satellite  telemetry  data  thereby  ensuring  the  best  analytical  use
of  the  available  data.  For  example,  error  in  spatial  location  of  data  collected  via  tele-
metry  is  dependent  upon  the  accuracy  of  the  unit  as  well  as  locations  of  the  available
satellites.  Each  data  point  collected  is  assigned  a  location  accuracy  code  in  order  to
maintain a history of the location accuracy (Georges et al. 1997). The GIS methodology
varies the spatial analysis based on the location accuracy code.

This  study  develops  a  GIS  methodology  for  an  ecological  analysis  of  land-cover
usage by four crane species. The primary objectives were to determine the area of each
land-cover type associated with each species of crane, and compare the results to deter-
mine  if  there  was  a  consistent  pattern  among  the  species  during  a  given  season,  or  if
there were species-speciﬁc use patterns. Using variable buffer sizes to account for spatial
error in the telemetry and imagery data, the crane locations were intersected with land
cover  imagery.  The  frequencies  with  which  each  land-cover  class  coincided  with  crane
locations were compiled for each individual within the species, and used to represent the
land  use  pattern  of  each  species.  The  individuals  were  grouped  by  species  to  represent
the species response pattern, and these frequencies were then compared interspeciﬁcally
using  non-parametric  statistical  tests.  Further,  using  GIS  to  combine  satellite  telemetry
with  satellite  image-derived  land-cover  is  the  ﬁrst  step  toward  predictive  modeling  to
identify speciﬁc sites valuable for crane conservation. 

2 Methods

2.1 Study Site and Crane Species

Of  the  15  crane  species  worldwide,  there  are  four  that  are  considered  threatened
or  endangered  within  Northeast  Asia:  the  Siberian,  Red-crowned,  White-naped  and
Hooded Cranes (Collar 1994, Hilton-Taylor 2000). This is the greatest concentration
of  threatened  crane  species  to  be  found  in  any  single  region  of  the  world.  These
species  are  all  migratory  and  travel  routes  up  to  3,000 km  between  wintering  and
summering sites that transect some of the most remote and politically sensitive areas of
the region.

Individual cranes (
58) were captured and tagged with transmitters on either autumn
staging  sites  in  Northeast  Asia  or  on  wintering  grounds  in  Japan  between  1991  and
1996 (Higuchi et al. 1992, 1994a, b, 1996; Kanai et al. 2002). Transmitter reception by
satellite was managed by CNES/Service Argos, a joint venture between France and the
United  States  formed  to  give  researchers  access  to  the  data-reception  capabilities  of
NOAA satellites. The service was employed to receive transmitter signals, calculate the
estimated  position  of  the  transmitter  and  assign  a  location  accuracy  class  (NQ)  to  the
data record. 

Transmitters  were  attached  by  harness  to  the  backs  of  cranes  and  weighed  up  to
120 g, which is about 1.2% of the body weight of an adult crane (Figure 2). Each unit
was programmed to repeatedly cycle through periods of rest or transmission to preserve
battery  life.  These  are  termed  the  duty  cycles.  Signals  can  be  received  from  the  trans-
mitter when the satellite is above the horizon. If the duty cycle is active during a satellite
pass then a location can be calculated, and several location points can be received within

quick  succession.  Other  studies  that  have  used  PTTs  have  varied  the  duty  cycle  from
twice a day (Bonadonna et al. 2000) to 30, 60, or 90 days (Sedberry and Loefer 2001)
depending on the migration application. During the six years of satellite telemetry used
in  this  study,  several  duty  cycles  were  used  depending  on  the  type  of  battery  in  the
transmitters,  which  varied  over  the  period.  In  general,  transmission  frequency  was  set
to a pulse interval of 60 seconds between signals followed by a period of inactivity. This
duty  cycle  was  intended  to  extend  the  life  of  the  battery  and  gather  data  over  periods
up  to  6  months.  Since  transmitter  signal  reception  depends  upon  the  location  of  the
satellite in its orbit and the status of the duty cycle, data are not received every day, and
can be received more often during certain times of the day for a speciﬁc transmitter.

On  occasion,  transmitters  would  cease  to  function  before  the  individual  left  on
migration or during the migratory journey. These birds gave useful data while the trans-
mitters  were  operating  so  these  incomplete  migrants  are  included  in  the  data  set,  but
lead to varying sample sizes during some seasons because not all birds could be located
during all seasons.

Several  inherent  sources  of  error  exist  for  satellite  telemetry  data.  The  primary
source  of  error  is  the  spatial  inaccuracy  of  the  telemetry  data.  Each  data  point  is
assigned a location (in latitude and longitude) as well as a location accuracy code based
on  the  receiving  system  conditions  (CNES/Service  Argos  1992).  CNES/Service  Argos
classiﬁes  each  location  point  as  0  through  3,  with  increasing  accuracy.  The  estimated
accuracy by class is: 0 – unknown, 1 – 1 km, 2 – 350 m, 3 – 150 m. The located codes
are  estimated  and  it  is  suggested  that  users  analyze  the  locations  to  determine  the  best
accuracy for each data set. Therefore, using known starting locations a comparison was
made  between  the  known  locations,  the  recorded  locations,  and  the  location  accuracy
code.  Comparing  the  standard  deviations  of  the  errors,  one  can  compare  the  actual
locations to the predicted and derive a measure of error (Table 1).

In this study, standard deviation was accepted as the estimate of error, rather than
the  speciﬁed  measurement  error,  because  the  distances  more  closely  represented  this
database and the users of the satellite telemetry technology are advised to measure error
independently rather than use the stated error estimates. Surprisingly, the locations did
not increase in error as documented. For example, at two standard deviations, LC 0 was
  3.88 km).  Although  this  was
more  accurate  (radius 
unexpected,  other  researchers  have  also  documented  this  error  reversal  (Keating  et  al.
1991, Keating 1994). To determine the most appropriate buffer size (radius) a sensitivity

analysis was performed on a subset of the crane data set, juvenile White-naped Cranes
 5). Four different buffer sizes, based on incremental increases in
during migration (
standard deviation of estimated error were applied to the data points and subsequently
intersected with the classiﬁed Land Cover imagery (Table 1). Results showed that buffer
sizes  based  on  2,  3  and  4-standard  deviations  of  the  error  resulted  in  no  signiﬁcant
0.05).  Therefore,  the  buffer  distance  for  two-
differences  (Wilcoxon  rank  sum, 
standard deviations of error (2sd) was the size appropriate for accounting for the spatial
inaccuracy  of  telemetry  data.  The  results  were  consistent  to  land  cover  analysis  at  this
scale, so this was accepted as the buffer radius for further analyses. Essentially, there is
a 95% chance that the actual location of the crane is included within the buffer. Unlike
other analytical techniques where point locations are intersected with other data layers
and attributed based on the point-in-polygon algorithm, the buffer approach identiﬁed
all land cover attributes within the accuracy of the data.

The  buffer  also  functioned  to  alleviate  a  problem  with  temporal  autocorrelation
within telemetry data. Reception frequency is dependent on the active duty cycle of the
transmitter coinciding with satellite location, so subsequent data points can be separated
by  minutes,  hours  or  days.  Since  the  frequency  of  reception  at  any  one  location  is
dependent  on  the  duty  cycle  and  satellite  location,  multiple  data  points  at  a  similar
location cannot be considered statistically independent. Traditional radio telemetry gen-
erally  attempts  to  maintain  temporal  independence  either  by  control  of  the  reception
schedule (not possible with satellite telemetry) or by sub-sampling the data. To consider
dependent location data in an analysis would bias the results because the frequency with
which  data  points  occur  at  a  location  do  not  reﬂect  any  relative  difference  in  the  time
spent by an individual among multiple sites. The important factor to realize here is that
the data represent an unstructured or biased representation of the true locations of the
birds.  The  data  are  gathered  when  it  is  feasible  for  the  satellite  to  gather  information
and  when  the  transmitter  is  transmitting.  Therefore,  it  is  incorrect  to  analyze  the  data
based on the frequency of land cover use and more appropriate to identify the total area
used by each crane, similar to an analysis of home range. It recently has been suggested
that  sub-sampling  to  reduce  temporal  autocorrelation  can  delete  potentially  important
data when analyzing home ranges (De Solla et al. 1999), so the present data set was not
sub-sampled.  However,  in  order  to  mitigate  any  temporal  autocorrelation  bias  in  the
frequency with which land-cover classes were used, the buffers were merged where they
overlapped, and the area used by the birds was analyzed.

Telemetry  data  were  categorized  by  individual,  season,  and  time  of  day.  The  data
separated  each  individual  bird’s  data  points  by  autumn,  migration,  winter,  and  spring
seasons. The start and endpoints of migration were used to divide the seasons. The
beginning  of  migration  was  considered  to  be  the  ﬁrst  day  with  a  movement  of
≥
100 km  and  a  sustained  pattern  of  directional  movements  after  that.  The  end  of
100 km  and  no  subsequent  directional
migration  was  the  ﬁrst  day  with  movements 
movements. This determination was made subjectively by observing the satellite telemetry
data as a point theme.

To facilitate the comparison of diurnal and nocturnal location data, each data point
was classiﬁed  as occurring either  before  or  after sunset/sunrise. Diurnal  data  were  cat-
egorized as those data points occurring after sunrise until just prior to sunset (sunset –
  2  hours)  until  just  prior  to
2  hours).  Nocturnal  data  were  those  after  sunset  (sunset 
sunrise (sunrise – 2 hours). Locations at times around sunrise and sunset were therefore
excluded  from  analysis  because  it  could  not  be  determined  that  the  birds  were  at  a

roosting  site.  To  make  the  diurnal/nocturnal  determination,  the  time  of  sunset  and
sunrise was calculated for each latitude, longitude and date. This was accomplished by
applying a variation of the “Equation of Time,” using a Microsoft Excel macro, which
predicts the sunrise and sunset times based on the relative angles of the Earth and Sun
at  any  given  longitude,  latitude  and  date  (Lammi  2001).  Results  were  spot-checked
against similar estimations by the United States Naval Observatory (2001). 

2.3 Land-cover Imagery

This research utilized version 1.2 of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme,
Data and Information Systems (IGBP-DIS) Global Land-Cover Characterization Project
(Loveland  et  al.  2000).  An  unsupervised  classiﬁcation  method  was  used  to  investigate
average monthly NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) imagery from 1992–1993
AVHRR satellite images (Loveland et al. 2000). This resulted in 961 Seasonal Land-cover
Region (SLCR) classes world-wide, limited to 255 for each continent (Loveland et al.
1995,  1999,  2000).  The  SLCR  classes  were  aggregated  to  conform  to  the  Global  Eco-
systems  classiﬁcation  scheme  (Olson  1994),  which  has  94  classes  world-wide.  This
study utilized imagery in both the SLCR and the Global Ecosystems schemes in separate
analyses  of  the  satellite  telemetry  data.  To  facilitate  analysis  of  habitat  use  by  area  an
Equal-Area projection was used in which the imagery is fortunately available (Lambert’s
°
°
 E). These data are distributed
 N, 100
Azimuthal Equal-Area projection, with origin at 45
by the EROS Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center where detailed geographic
characteristics of the imagery are also available (United States Geological Survey 2001).

Limitations of the IGBP-DISCover imagery are described expertly in several publica-
tions  (Loveland  and  Brown  1999;  Loveland  et  al.  1999,  2000).  Of  primary  import-
ance  to  this  research,  image  processing  techniques  included  classifying  cells  as  water
bodies based on the Digital Chart of the World (DCW) (Danko 1992), and classifying
cells as barren or sparsely vegetated classes when the NDVI was below a threshold value
that  indicated  vegetated  cover  of  less  than  5–10%  (Loveland  et  al.  2000).  Using  the
DCW  to  map  the  open  water  bodies  may  have  inadvertently  removed  non-water  land
cover types. Therefore, it is possible that wetlands or other land cover types that border
water  bodies  were  classiﬁed  as  “water.”  Additionally,  as  is  the  case  in  all  mapping
projects, land cover types that occupy areas that are smaller than the spatial resolution
of  the  imagery  (such  as  small  wetland  areas)  can  lead  to  mixed  pixel  classiﬁcation
problems (Oleson et al. 1995, Foody 2000, Jensen 2000, Verhoeye and De Wulf 2002).
Cranes are generally considered to heavily use wetlands, and so this potential loss
of wetland habitat classiﬁcation from the imagery was considered a shortcoming of the
land cover type analysis; however, given this knowledge of the imagery it was possible
to identify the land cover types used, such as water, and the locations in these categories.
During the analysis, data points were analyzed to determine the relative locations such
as within water but near the shoreline and this helped to alleviate the wetlands issue.

Cranes also heavily use agricultural and grassland areas, and these land cover types
are deﬁned well by AVHRR (Cracknell 1997). Thus, the results of this study expected
to  show  a  diversity  and  detail  in  agricultural  and  grassland  land-covers,  but  likely
under-represent the wetland component of crane habitat. Alternative imaging methods
that are more suitable for wetland delineation do exist, such as Landsat TM, but classi-
ﬁed products at the regional scale necessary for this study were not available. The open
availability of the IGBP-DISCover imagery and large (global) geographic extent, makes

it extremely attractive to a wide variety of users, and this study illustrates some of the
beneﬁts and drawbacks of using these data for wildlife studies.

2.4. Data Processing and Spatial Analysis

Geographic  point  ﬁles  for  each  individual  crane  were  created  from  the  telemetry  data-
base  and  projected  to  conform  to  the  land-cover  imagery  (Figure  3).  Secondly,  each
individual observation point was attributed by season in order to compare habitat uses
among species by season (Figure 4). The projected point ﬁles were buffered to produce

with land-cover imagery to create grids with land-cover classes by location. Location data from

a polygon buffer around the location points (Plate 2). The circular buffers were created
using the radii based on two-standard deviations of the error estimate for the location
class of each point (Table 1). The areas of overlap between the individual point buffers
were dissolved, producing a polygon region. The polygon data were converted to a grid,
in  order  to  make  them  consistent  with  the  land-cover  data’s  raster  format  of  1,000 m
grid  cells.  When  buffering  produced  internal  polygons  (or  holes)  it  was  necessary  to
attribute  these  polygons  with  a  speciﬁc  code  so  that  grid  processing  with  the  imagery
removed these cells from the analysis.

The ﬁnal stage of GIS processing was to intersect the buffer and the land-cover data,
both  in  grid  format.  The  only  pre-processing  applied  to  the  land-cover  data  was  to
clip the Eurasian image down to represent only Northeast Asia (25–72º N, 100–135º E).
Resulting  grids  were  visually  error-checked  and  the  frequency  table  (number  of  cells
by land-cover type) for each ﬁle was exported to a database. For each ﬁle, the frequency
with which each land-cover class occurred was converted to a percent of total area by:

The data output from processing were the percent area of each land-cover class by

analyses with Kruskal-Wallace rank sum at a 0.05 conﬁdence level for all species, and
Wilcoxon rank sum analysis at 0.01 conﬁdence level for two-species comparisons.

The satellite telemetry data used in this study were from 58 individuals of four species
with a total of 15,173 location points. The average number of points per individual was
  standard  deviation).  The  data  were  segmented  into  four  seasons
262 
and two times of day. Location data not within deﬁned limits for diurnal and nocturnal
periods  were  excluded  (less  than  one  percent  of  the  total  number  of  data  points).  The
quantity of data available for each seasonal category varied, with migration and winter-
ing generally providing fewer data points per species due to the short duration of those
two seasons (Table 2). Shortly after arrival at wintering sites, the batteries of the trans-
mitters tended to decline and this resulted in a short time period of data reception during
the winter season. Migration is an event of relatively short duration, therefore returning
few data points. Despite having fewer location points, the migration season resulted
in  larger  area  than  other  seasons  due  to  the  cranes’  directional  movements  and  vast
distances  covered  during  the  migration  period.  By  contrast,  during  the  non-migratory
seasons  the  birds  are  focused  in  a  particular  area  and  this  resulted  in  merged  or  over-
lapping buffer area and a resulting smaller geographic area.

resulted, predictably, in higher numbers of classes used by each species when compared
to  the  Global  Ecosystem  classiﬁcation.  The  proportion  of  classes  that  were  signiﬁcant
varied between the two systems, with the Global Ecosystem scheme generally returning
10% more signiﬁcantly different classes in most seasons.

The  results  of  analyses  using  Global  Ecosystem  land-cover  classiﬁcation  imagery
clearly  showed  broad  patterns  of  usage  between  the  species,  and  comparison  of  those
results to that from Seasonal Land-Cover Region imagery provided further clariﬁcation
in many cases. For example, Global Ecosystem has broad agricultural classes, and many
of  the  cranes  used  areas  classiﬁed  as  “Crops  and  Town,”  which  although  it  clearly
suggests  that  there  is  a  rural  population  present,  the  type  of  agriculture  is  unclear.
Comparisons with the results of the SLCR often clearly showed the nature of the agri-
culture  present,  although  it  did  not  indicate  the  human  component  (Figure  5).  Similar
examples are found in grassland and forest classes. Global Ecosystems and SLCR had
equal occurrence of water, labeled “Inland Water” and “Water,” respectively, and labeled
“Inland Water/Water” in this discussion. 

3.2.1 Autumn Land Cover Use
Autumn  total  area  for  each  species  ranged  from  972  to  5,433 km2  (Table  2).  The
intersection  of  bird  location  buffers  with  Global  Ecosystems  and  SLCR  land-cover
imagery  resulted  in  25  and  49  classes,  respectively.  Results  from  the  autumn  season
clearly  differentiated  Siberian  Cranes,  with  high  occurrence  in  tundra-related  classes
reﬂecting  the  far  north  environment  (Plate  3).  Red-crowned  and  White-naped  Cranes,
which  occur  in  the  same  latitudinal  range  for  breeding  and  during  the  autumn  staging
season prior to migration, showed many similarities in land cover classes, but the areal

extent  for  many  land  covers  differed  between  the  species.  Red-crowned  Cranes  used  a
high  percentage  of  agricultural  classes,  represented  by  “Crops  and  Town”  in  Global
Ecosystem imagery but more clearly identiﬁed as “Cropland (Spring Wheat, Soybeans)”
in SLCR, while White-naped Cranes often occurred in grassland and savanna land-cover
classes  (Kruskal-Wallace  rank  sum,  p  <  0.01).  A  caveat  to  interpreting  these  results  is
that  even  though  the  species  are  known  to  occur  at  some  of  the  same  sites,  the  indivi-
duals mapped during this project rarely occurred at the same sites. The reason for this
lack of overlap in territory is due to the preferential capture of a particular species at a
given site rather than capturing birds and attaching transmitters at all known locations.
This  bias  does  not  detract  from  the  validity  of  the  analytical  method.  Comparisons
among  species,  using  the  Kruskal-Wallace  rank  sum  test  on  Global  Ecosystem  data,
showed  that  autumn  staging  had  19  of  25  classes  with  signiﬁcant  differences  amongst
all  the  species  (Kruskal-Wallace  rank  sum,  p < 0.05).  Two-way  species  comparisons,
using  Wilcoxon  rank  sum  analysis  (p < 0.01),  clearly  separated  the  use  pattern  of
Siberian  Cranes  from  the  three  other  species,  particularly  in  tundra  related  classes.
Red-crowned  Cranes  showed  signiﬁcant  differences  from  White-naped  Cranes  in  four
land cover classes (crops and town, woody savanna, grass crops, and crops grass shrubs)
and from Hooded Cranes in two classes (semi-desert shrubs and cold grassland). White-
naped and Hooded Cranes showed no differences (Table 3).

3.2.2 Migration Land Cover Use
Migration  buffers  ranged  in  size  from  1,467  to  7,824 km2,  and  returned  39  (Global
Ecosystems)  and  111  (SLCR)  classes.  The  migration  season  showed  a  greater  diversity
of  classes  than  any  other  season,  and  illustrated  signiﬁcant  differences  among  the
species (Figure 6). For example, the use of “Inland Water/ Water” by Red-crowned Cranes
is  suggestive  of  an  association  with  wetlands,  which  are  probably  correlated  with  the
“Inland  Water/ Water”  class  as  discussed  above.  Red-crowned  cranes  used  a  smaller
amount of agriculture classes during migration, and the “Inland Water/ Water” class was
greater during migration than in autumn and also used in larger amounts than any other
species during migration. The Red-crowned Crane migration route follows the coastline
for a large distance, and this helps to explain the high occurrence of the “Inland Water/
Water”  class  (Figure  7).  The  birds  may  have  been  using  estuaries,  mudﬂats  or  other
wetland  habitats,  but  the  IGBP-DISCover  imagery  cannot  deﬁne  those  classes  accur-
ately,  and  so  high  occurrence  of  the  “Inland  Water/ Water”  class  can  only  suggest  the
use  of  wetlands  by  the  species.  Both  SLCR  and  Global  Ecosystem  returned  consistent
frequencies of water occurrence.

Another challenge to ecological interpretation of land-cover use is demonstrated by
the association of Siberian Cranes with agricultural classes, which were largely located
at stop-over sites in the extensively farmed Manchurian (Songnen) Plain of Heilongjiang
Province,  China.  The  association  is  inconsistent  with  reports  that  the  species  does  not
use uplands in the region, but rather utilizes pockets of wetlands exclusively (Meine and
Archibald 1996). The apparent association of Siberian Cranes with agriculture must be
interpreted  as  one  of  adjacency  to  ecologically  valuable  habitats.  The  resolution  and
limitations  of  AVHRR  for  wetland  classiﬁcation  are  likely  responsible  for  this  result.
Classes  which  show  relatively  minor  occurrence  in  the  Siberian  results  are  considered
the  important  ecological  habitats  for  the  birds,  such  as  several  grassland  and  savanna
classes, and the agriculture is interpreted as being the prime factor limiting the distribu-
tion of these classes and fragmenting the habitat.

Ecosystems  imagery  during  migration  season  for:  (a)  Red-crowned,  (b)  Siberian,  (c)  White-
naped, and (d) Hooded Cranes. Sample sizes (number of birds) are given in the upper right

The  White-naped  and  Hooded  Cranes  showed  apparently  valid,  heavy  occurrence
of  agricultural  classes,  and  thus  SLCR  imagery  was  useful  for  more  speciﬁc  ecological
interpretation of those results. Migration season showed signiﬁcant differences in 13 of
39 classes (Kruskal-Wallace rank sum, p < 0.05) (Table 3).

3.2.3 Winter Land Cover Use
Winter  buffers  ranged  in  size  from  547  to  3,373 km2.  Global  Ecosystem  land  cover
returned 22 classes, and SLCR identiﬁed 57 classes. Unfortunately, the data for Siberian
and  Hooded  Cranes  had  low  sample  sizes,  but  Red-crowned  and  White-naped  Cranes
had larger number of birds tracked, and all species showed signiﬁcant differences when
compared  statistically.  Siberian  Cranes  did  show  clear  association  with  margins  of
Poyang  Lake,  the  last  major  wintering  site  known  for  the  species,  which  is  a  site  with
complex hydrology that is threatened by construction of the Three Gorges Dam on
the Yangtze (Chang) River. Wintering season showed signiﬁcant differences in 12 of
22 classes (Kruskal-Wallace rank sum, p < 0.05) (Table 3).

3.2.4 Spring Land Cover Use
Spring  buffers  ranged  in  size  from  1,110  to  6,096 km2  for  Hooded  and  White-naped
Cranes,  respectively.  Global  Ecosystems  returned  21  classes,  while  SLCR  showed
47  classes.  Spring  season  showed  no  signiﬁcant  differences  between  adult  (N  =  4)  and

sub-adult  (N  =  5)  age-classes  of  White-naped  Cranes,  and  an  analysis  between  White-
naped and Hooded Cranes was not calculated due to low sample size of the latter.

3.3 Data Analysis by Time of Day

Occurrences of each land-cover class for nocturnal location data were similar to that of
diurnal  data.  There  were  no  signiﬁcant  differences  between  time  periods  within  any
species (Wilcoxon signed-rank, p > 0.01). The results are ecologically inconclusive because
the  scale  of  analysis,  required  to  mitigate  inaccuracy  of  telemetry  data,  may  have
obscured  any  actual  differences.  It  is  possible  that  the  cranes  select  areas  that  have
habitats for day and night within a small area, and the buffers applied to each location
point may have included both areas, and therefore cannot discriminate between the two. 

4 Conclusions

The results of analyses using Global Ecosystem land-cover classiﬁcation imagery clearly
showed broad patterns of usage by the species, and comparison of those results to those
from Seasonal Land-Cover Region imagery provided further clariﬁcation in many cases.
In  autumn,  Siberian  Cranes  use  tundra-related  land  cover,  Red-crowned,  White-naped
and Hooded Cranes occur in the same latitudinal range however the Red-crowned use
a  higher  percentage  of  agricultural  land  while  White-naped  and  Hooded  Cranes  use
grassland. During migration the species overlap in their routes, use different land cover
types  than  the  autumn  staging  sites,  and  interestingly  the  Red-crowned  predominately
use natural land covers while White-naped and Hooded increase their use of agricultural
classes. The winter season is dominated by water use with only the Red-crowned Cranes
using a diversity of land covers in the Korean Peninsula and coastal China. 

Interspeciﬁc  differences  in  land-cover  use  were  shown  among  the  four  species  of
cranes.  This  assists  in  broadening  the  applications  of  satellite  telemetry  from  simple
descriptive  reporting  of  movements  to  comparative  ecological  analysis.  The  use  of  a
buffering  procedure  to  accommodate  spatial  inaccuracy  of  the  telemetry  data  appears
effective  in  the  determination  of  land-cover  types  utilized,  but  could  be  improved  if
satellite telemetry studies can determine if there is a spatial trend in error. For example,
it  has  been  proposed  that  the  error  is  not  equal  in  all  directions  but  can  be  elongated
along an axis determined by the location of the transmitter and the location of satellites
receiving  the  signals  (Keating  1994).  However,  more  investigative  work  needs  to  be
conducted  to  ﬁnalize  this  hypothesized  non-uniform  error  with  speciﬁc  estimates  of
error.

Although the buffer radius was based on the accuracy of the transmitter and satellite
receiver, the buffers did not show any difference in land cover use between diurnal and
nocturnal  locations.  The  distances  between  day  and  night  locations  were  greater  than
the spatial accuracy of the technology. Improving spatial accuracy of the telemetry data
may  assist  in  clarifying  these  differences,  but  are  unlikely  with  conventional  trans-
mitters. A new generation of GPS loggers, with satellite uplink of data, promises more
accurate spatial data.

Overall, the Global Ecosystem scheme showed the primary differences amongst the
species,  and  the  shift  between  seasons,  but  lacked  the  gradation  in  classes  that  would
allow  greater  ecological  interpretation.  While  the  strength  of  SLCR  is  in  its  variety  of

classes,  some  degree  of  collapsing  similar  types  would  beneﬁt  most  ecological  studies,
but the method of doing so would be speciﬁc to the organisms being studied. In studies
such  as  this  one  where  the  species  has  a  predilection  for  wetlands,  both  classiﬁcation
schemes have an inherent weakness in wetland discrimination. However, currently there
is  no  other  classiﬁed  land-cover  imagery  product  that  has  a  good  representation  of
wetlands  and  covers  a  large  region  of  the  Earth.  One  solution  would  be  to  use  these
image  products  for  studies  such  as  this  one  where  a  regional  perspective  is  important,
and  then  use  the  results  to  obtain  more  information  for  speciﬁc  areas  of  interest.
Depending on the region, economics, and interest, higher resolution satellite or airborne
imagery may be obtained for more in depth analyses.

The  1,000 m  resolution  of  the  IGBP-DISCover  land-cover  data  is  appropriate  for
the  present  study,  but  the  lack  of  wetland  data  is  a  weakness  to  drawing  ecological
conclusions  for  cranes.  For  wetland  species,  imagery  derived  from  satellite  sensors
capable of receiving soil-moisture data would be valuable. Resampling of those data, with
weighting of wetland classes, to a 1,000 m resolution would be useful in order to reduce
the volume of data for regional scale studies, or smaller areas can be analyzed with full
resolution imagery. Another option to improving the predictive capability of these data
is  to  use  surface  drainage  patterns  and  terrain  analysis  for  predicting  where  wetlands
could be located without actually having these features identiﬁed in the imagery.

Future  studies  may  utilize  the  methods  of  the  present  research  to  create  predictive
models for suitable habitat. Due to disturbance factors or low population numbers in many
species, including cranes, all suitable sites may not be inhabited. Using GIS to combine
satellite telemetry with satellite image-derived land-cover could be the ﬁrst step to predict-
ing sites, outside those directly visited by marked cranes, valuable to crane conservation.

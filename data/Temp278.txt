Species distribution models (SDMs) are an important tool in biogeography and ecology
and are widely used for both fundamental and applied research purposes. SDMs require
spatially explicit information about species occurrence and environmental covariates
to produce a set of rules that identify and scale the environmental space where the
species was observed and that can further be used to predict the suitability of a site for
the species. More spatially accurate data are increasingly available, and the number of
publications on the inﬂuence of spatial inaccuracies on the performance of modelling
procedures is growing exponentially. Three main sources of uncertainty are associated
with the three elements of a predictive function: the dependent variable, the explana-
tory variables and the algorithm or function used to relate these two variables. In this
study, we review how spatial uncertainties inﬂuence model accuracy and we propose
some methodological issues in the application of SDMs with regard to the modelling
of fundamental and realized niches of species. We distinguish two cases suitable for
different types of spatial data accuracy. For modelling the realized distribution of a
species, particularly for management and conservation purposes, we suggest using only
accurate species occurrence data and large sample sizes. Appropriate data ﬁltering and
examination of the spatial autocorrelation in predictors should be a routine procedure
to minimize the possible inﬂuence of positional uncertainty in species occurrence data.
However, if the data are sparse, models of the potential distribution of species can be
created using a relatively small sample size, and this can provide a generalized indica-
tion of the main regional drivers of the distribution patterns. By this means, ﬁeld surveys
can be targeted to discover unknown populations and species in poorly surveyed regions
in order to improve the robustness of the data for later modelling of the realized distri-
butions. Based on this review, we conclude that (1) with data that are currently available,
studies performed at a resolution of 1–100 km2 are useful for hypothesizing about the
environmental conditions that limit the distribution of a species and (2) incorporating
coarse resolution species occurrence data in a model, despite an increase in sample size,
lowers model performance.

Introduction

V. Moudrý and P. Šímová

It is extremely important in biogeography and ecology to understand the relationship
between species and their habitats, because this relationship is fundamentally tied to
questions of distribution and abundance (Huston 2002). Species distribution models
(SDMs) are an important tool for understanding these relationships and are used for the
purposes of both fundamental and applied research. For example, SDMs have been used
to evaluate the relative role of environmental factors affecting the distribution of a species
(e.g. Storch et al. 2003, Gottschalk et al. 2007), to assess the potential distribution of
invasive species (e.g. Hallstan et al. 2009, Chytrý et al. 2012), to evaluate the conserva-
tion status of endangered species (e.g. Jackson and Robertson 2011), to forecast shifts in
the geographic distributions of species under climate change (e.g. Hongoh et al. 2012,
Renwick et al. 2012), to obtain range estimates for assemblages of species (Amboni and
Laffan, in press), and to assess the possible impact of changes in land use on species distri-
bution (e.g. Schleupner and Link 2008). Numerous methods can be used to model species
distributions (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000, Franklin 2009), often in conjunction with
geographic information system (GIS), and many studies have attempted to evaluate their
predictive performance (Pearce and Ferrier 2000, Elith et al. 2006, Tsoar et al. 2007).

Species distribution modelling requires species occurrence data and environmental
variables in order to produce a set of rules that identify and scale the environmental
space where the species was collected or observed and can further be used to predict the
suitability of a site for the species (Araújo and Guisan 2006). Unfortunately, there are
many inherent sources of uncertainty in SDMs, which can affect the model performance.
Uncertainty arises from differences between the complex, continuous nature of the real
world and the simpliﬁed, discrete representation of samples in GIS.

Three main sources of uncertainty are associated with the three elements of a pre-
dictive function: the dependent variable, the explanatory variables and the algorithm or
function used to relate these two variables. Concern about uncertainty in spatial data, its
propagation through the modelling processes and its inﬂuence on model performance is not
new (Heuvelink 1998) and has been widely studied in recent years. Some of the possible
sources of uncertainty related to species occurrence data are sample size (Stockwell and
Peterson 2002, Hernandez et al. 2006, Guisan et al. 2007b, Kaliontzopoulou et al. 2008,
Wisz et al. 2008, Reside et al. 2011), positional accuracy (Graham et al. 2008, Johnson
and Gillingham 2008, Fernandez et al. 2009, Osborne and Leitão 2009, Naimi et al. 2011)
and availability of true-absence data (Lobo et al. 2010, Lobo and Tognelli 2011). There are
also many concerns about uncertainty in environmental variables, for example, selection
of relevant environmental variables (Austin 2007, Austin and Van Niel 2011, Synes and
Osborne 2011, Williams et al. 2012), data origin (Müller et al. 2009) and spatial resolution
(Ferrier and Watson 1997, Tobalske 2002, Graf et al. 2005, Guisan et al. 2007a, Heikkinen
et al. 2007, Kaliontzopoulou et al. 2008, Seo et al. 2009, Gottschalk et al. 2011). Despite
the well-known limitations of the spatial data used in SDMs and their impact on model
interpretation, many analysts use spatial data non-critically, without regard to these issues
(Hunter et al. 2009). Moreover, many studies appear to use only data that are readily at
hand, without a detailed examination of its quality or an explanation of the relevance of the
selected environmental variables (Elith and Leathwick 2009, but see Williams et al. 2012).
Further research on this topic is therefore warranted (Graham et al. 2008, Austin and Van
Niel 2011, Hanberry et al. 2012).

Due to the extensive use of SDMs and increasing awareness and understanding of
uncertainty in spatial data, the attention given to this issue has increased gradually over the
last decade. Several reviews have contributed to this topic. Regan et al. (2002) developed a

taxonomy of uncertainty for ecology, and Elith et al. (2002) used this taxonomy to out-
line common sources of error in habitat modelling, along with a review of aspects of
uncertainty and suggested methods for investigating and mapping uncertainties. Jager and
King (2004) proposed a taxonomy of approaches to clarify the relationship between spatial
uncertainty and ecological model predictions, and Barry and Elith (2006) reviewed errors
resulting from data deﬁciencies and errors introduced by model speciﬁcation. Heikkinen
et al. (2006) reviewed several factors which may contribute to uncertainty in SDMs, with
emphasis on the impact of these uncertainties on the predictions of the potential species
distributions under climate change. Recently, Rocchini et al. (2011) reviewed the most
important sources of uncertainty, which formed during species distribution data acquisition
procedures.

Species occurrence data and environmental explanatory variables that have been
obtained recently tend to be accurately located (Franklin 2009) and, as brieﬂy outlined
above, the number of publications on the performance of several correlative modelling
procedures, which aim to estimate the potential or realized distributions of species, is grow-
ing exponentially. In this study, we review how spatial uncertainties arising from spatial
deﬁciencies in species occurrence data and environmental explanatory variables inﬂuence
model accuracy, and we examine the main methodological issues in the application of
SDMs with regard to modelling the realized and potential distribution of species. More
speciﬁcally, we discuss positional accuracy, sample size and scale, which are inextricably
linked. Our review here is a contribution to knowledge in relation to the ‘data model’ for
SDMs (Austin 2002, 2007, Williams et al. 2012).

Modelling the potential distribution versus the realized distribution
To create an accurate SDM, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between potential distri-
bution and realized distribution models (sensu Jiménez-Valverde et al. 2008). The range
of environmental conditions that species are physiologically able to tolerate deﬁnes their
potential distribution in geographical space (ecological niche models sensu Soberón 2010).
This has also been termed the physiological niche and relates to the fundamental niche of
a species (Austin et al. 2009, Soberón and Nakamura 2009). Due to other factors such as
competition or disturbance, species typically occupy a subset of their potential distribu-
tion. This is termed the realized distribution (distribution models sensu Soberón 2010) and
is also known as the actual distribution (Soberón and Nakamura 2009). Importantly, both
concepts – potential and realized distributions – refer to a particular moment or a discrete
period in time (Soberón 2007), and a mismatch between the time ranges of species occur-
rence data and environmental variables can result in poorer distribution models (Roubicek
et al. 2010). The occurrence data and environmental variables should have comparable
temporal resolution.

We suggest that this theoretical concept should be particularly followed when the inﬂu-
ence of possible uncertainties (e.g. positional error) is tested. For example, in a study by
Graham et al. (2008), when only climatic and topographic variables were used, the perfor-
mance of the models was better with degraded species occurrence data with an artiﬁcially
incorporated random 5 km shift than with the original data. On the other hand, models
which additionally included soil, vegetation and disturbance variables performed better
with the original data than with the degraded data. At ﬁner resolution, species are often
absent from a suitable habitat. For example, species may be absent because of disper-
sal limitation (Kadmon and Pulliam 1993), biotic interactions (Araújo and Luoto 2007,
Chee and Elith in press) and historical events (Syphard and Franklin 2010). Models need

to include variables related to these stochastic or ecological processes, allowing a more
comprehensive model of the realized niche to be developed. Moreover, an appropriate val-
idation of the realized distribution requires true-absence data (Václavík and Meentemeyer
2009). The use of pseudo-absence data generates different model predictions in the gra-
dient between potential and realized distributions, depending on the method for selecting
the pseudo-absence data (Chefaoui and Lobo 2008). Models that exclude these ﬁne-scale
determinants of distribution, and consider only the ‘main effects’ related to physiological
responses, such as suitable climate and soils, provide a partial expression of the potential
distribution of a species (Jiménez-Valverde et al. 2008). In addition, arbitrary selection of
different sets of climatic variables, without a clear ecological rationale, results in variation
in the modelled distribution of species (Synes and Osborne 2011).

Species distribution data uncertainty
Positional accuracy

Species distribution modelling assumes that species occurrence data are accurate in their
location. Most spatial data are now collected using global positioning system (GPS) tech-
nology with ﬁne positional accuracy, and recent species occurrence records can have
positional accuracy down to 1 m, if the satellite signal is not attenuated by site conditions.
Recent devices for tracking animals with GPS equipment integrated into them (e.g. into
a collar) are often biased, because vegetation and terrain may interfere with the satellite
signal (Frair et al. 2004). Moreover, a vast amount of species occurrence data in muse-
ums, atlases and natural history collections often lacks the desired geographic accuracy
(Graham et al. 2004, Newbold 2010). For example, retrospectively geo-referenced museum
data collections have uncertainty associated with lack of geographic details in the textual
descriptions (Wieczorek et al. 2004). Automated processes have been developed for geo-
referencing species occurrence data and assigning accuracy attributes to them (Guralnick
et al. 2006, Hill et al. 2009). Knowledge of location sampling uncertainty enables the inclu-
sion of covariate predictors to be tested in the model or to up/down weight the importance
of a site and can be devised to help account for bias in SDMs (see Carroll et al. 2006).
However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have attempted to use positional error
directly as a covariate or a weight in the models.

Positional error can mischaracterize the conditions under which a species occurs, par-
ticularly in areas with rapidly changing conditions (e.g. mountainous areas) and can lead
to overestimation of the species habitat areas (Feeley and Silman 2010). Obviously, the
scale of the study is an important determinant of the effect of location positional error
on SDM performance (Osborne and Leitão 2009). At ﬁner resolutions, there is a risk of
exacerbating the inﬂuence of positional error in the geographical location of a species on
SDM performance. For example, species occurrence records can be located in a cell repre-
senting a different habitat from the one where the species actually occurred (Guisan et al.
2007a). The inﬂuence of the magnitude of the positional error on SDM performance must
be considered, particularly in relation to the resolution and extent of the study. It is there-
fore advisable to establish the appropriate plot size for sampling the species occurrences
for particular species and purposes (Pandit et al. 2010).

Some recent studies have made an effort to use accurate species occurrence data gath-
ered with GPS to quantify the inﬂuence of artiﬁcially incorporated uncertainty on model
performance. Graham et al. (2008) carried out their study with a cell size of 1 km2 and
0.01 km2 for some regions, and incorporated locality spatial uncertainty (positional error)
by using a random 5 km data shift radius. They conclude that certain methods, such as

2087

maximum entropy (Maxent) algorithm (Phillips et al. 2006) and boosted regression tree
(BRT) techniques are robust to positional error. To establish the relationship between the
magnitude of the spatial uncertainty and SDM performance, Osborne and Leitão (2009)
randomized the location in various resolution intervals (0–1, 2–3, 4–5 and 0–5 km) and
found that model runs with degraded species occurrence data resulted in less accurate
models for most cases, but the effect on model performance was small. However, the
conclusions from both studies are limited because they used presence-only species data
and additionally evaluated the predictive performance of the models using the area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which has been seriously questioned
(e.g. Golicher et al. in press, Jiménez-Valverde 2012). Fernandez et al. (2009) measured
the performance indirectly, and Johnson and Gillingham (2008) used presence–absence
species data. Fernandez et al. (2009) simulated extreme positional error by randomizing
the location in various intervals (0–5, 5–10, 10–25 and 25–50 km). They showed that
with increasing interval (uncertainty) the results are less consistent, though the modelling
method has a more than 10-fold larger effect on the results. Johnson and Gillingham (2008)
performed their study in ﬁner resolution (cell size 0.062 ha) and incorporated positional
error by shifting the animal location in 50 m increments from 50 to 1000 m. They found
that positional error was the greatest contributing factor to reduced accuracy of the results.
The different results for the inﬂuence of positional uncertainty in species occurrence data
on prediction accuracy may be explained through increasing spatial autocorrelation in the
predictors, which reduces the impact of positional uncertainty on the predictions (Naimi
et al. 2011).

According to the ﬁndings of Graham et al. (2008) and Fernandez et al. (2009), mod-
elling techniques are not equally inﬂuenced by positional error. However, these authors
disagree on the sensitivity of certain methods. Similarly, Naimi et al. (2011) assessed
model performance through AUC and kappa statistics. They concluded that there is a dif-
ference in the performance of the modelling methods, and that presence–absence methods
performed better than presence-only methods.

It is clear that improvements in data quality related to positional certainty in the loca-
tion of species occurrence data and the spatial resolution of predictors may lead to major
advances. However, there is still intrinsic error in measured phenomena resulting from
inherent uncertainty existing in the real world. To avoid the bias resulting from the use of
real data, we encourage the ongoing use of artiﬁcial species for further study of the inﬂu-
ence of positional error on SDMs (e.g. Naimi et al. 2011), which offer perfect knowledge
of relevant environmental variables and are able to provide an exact measure of the perfor-
mance of the models (Hirzel et al. 2001, Meynard and Quinn 2007, Santika and Hutchinson
2009). We also encourage the development and use of sampling covariates or weights on
response locations directly in predictive models to explain some of the error associated
with positional accuracy, where this is known.

Sample size
The accuracy of SDM performance also relies on the sample size used to build the models.
The sample size used in ecological studies varies from just ten to thousands of cases, and
there is concern about the minimum number of records required for effective modelling
and how these records are distributed in environmental predictor space (e.g. Pearson et al.
2007, Wisz et al. 2008). It is important to study how sample size affects model predictive
performance, and to identify techniques that are robust to variations in sample size. The
sample size should be set to meet the objectives of the study (Foody 2011). In general, the

V. Moudrý and P. Šímová

broader the suite of explanatory variables and the more complex the responses (in terms of
shape and interaction), the more data are required to construct a reliable model, and vice
versa (Barry and Elith 2006).

The predictive accuracy of methods is clearly related to sample size, and predictions
based on a small number of records are unlikely to be as good as those based on a large
number of samples (Pearce and Ferrier 2000, Stockwell and Peterson 2002). Each sam-
ple size event (presences or absences) is important in representing the environmental
gradients, regardless of the relative size of the event (Jimenez-Valverde and Lobo 2006,
Jiménez-Valverde et al. 2009). However, if sampled by strata, one can deliberately aim
to sample the gradients representatively within the ecological range of a species, and
this will result in less bias for fewer samples (Austin and Heyligers 1989, Wessels et al.
1998). Unfortunately, the amount of data available is limited for many taxa and regions,
and the modelling of rare or sparsely sampled species is challenging (Raxworthy et al.
2003, Pearson et al. 2007, Rebelo and Jones 2010). For example, decreasing the number
of species occurrence data required for SDM from 200 to 10 would increase the number
of bird species in Mexico that could possibly be modelled more than sixfold (Stockwell
and Peterson 2002). In better cases, a choice can be made between many low-precision
records and a smaller number of high-precision records. According to Engler et al. (2004)
and Kaliontzopoulou et al. (2008), models based on high-precision data performed better
than those based on lower-precision data, even if the sample sizes are higher for the lower-
precision data. Similarly, Reside et al. (2011) found that incorporating coarse resolution
historic species occurrence data to increase data sample size lowered model performance.
With regard to uneasy detection of models with positional error in species occurrence data
judged by AUC (Osborne and Leitão 2009), it is advisable to use data ﬁltering methods,
although this results in fewer records and potentially fewer species that can be modelled
(Feeley and Silman 2010).

Although recent studies have shown that prediction success generally increases with
sample size, these studies have also revealed the possibility of developing models with
small sample sizes for some species (Hernandez et al. 2006, Guisan et al. 2007b, Wisz et al.
2008). Ideally, a predictive system that converges quickly to the greatest accuracy would
be preferred. According to Stockwell and Peterson (2002), machine-learning methods
reached nearly the same accuracy when there were around 50 samples as with 100 samples.
Similarly, Wisz et al. (2008) emphasized that no algorithm predicted consistently well with
sample size lower than 30 samples. However, both studies used 100 samples at most per
species. Hanberry et al. (2012) compared models with sample sizes ranging from 30 to
2500, and observed that models with a sample size of 200 and lower tend to be inaccurate.
Only the study of Jiménez-Valverde et al. (2009) used artiﬁcial species and found that,
once the model reaches a value of around 70 samples, its reliability measured by AUC
became independent of sample size, compared with models with sample size lower than
200 samples. Investigations of possible trade-offs between model performance and sample
size indicated that the Maxent algorithm (Phillips et al. 2006) is quite robust to variations
in sample size and produces useful results with sample sizes as small as 30 occurrences
(Hernandez et al. 2006, Guisan et al. 2007b, Kaliontzopoulou et al. 2008, Wisz et al.
2008).

A consistent outcome of these studies is that geographical predictions developed from
small numbers of occurrence records will be of limited accuracy. Small sample sizes allow
only the detection of relatively large differences (Foody 2011). Moreover, data are often
spatially and temporally aggregated, and more records are required to accurately map the
actual limits of the ranges of a species (Feeley and Silman 2011). Models developed with

2089

small sample sizes should be interpreted as identifying regions with similar environmen-
tal conditions to those where the species is known to occur, and not as predicting the
actual limits of the range of a species (Pearson et al. 2007). Nevertheless, the results are
encouraging for identifying potentially suitable areas for species, or for targeting ﬁeld
surveys to discover unknown populations and species in poorly surveyed regions (e.g.
Raxworthy et al. 2003, Funk and Richardson 2005, Pearson et al. 2007, Hernandez et al.
2008). This increases the relevance of sparse data in museum collections (Graham et al.
2004, Newbold 2010). For example, Ferrier (2002) designed a general framework for
improving and iteratively modelling species information by coupling it with the identi-
ﬁcation of knowledge gaps in survey data toward improving the robustness of the data for
later modelling of the realized distributions.

Explanatory variables data uncertainty
Scale

Most ecological processes occur over a limited range of spatial areas (spatial scale) and
temporal duration (temporal scale). As a consequence, understanding the dynamics of a
particular process (or a phenomenon such as the distribution of a species) requires mea-
surements of explanatory variables on appropriate spatial and temporal scales (Huston
2002). Spatial scale governs what environmental variables can be hypothesized to operate
in determining species distribution and abundance (Pearson and Dawson 2003). A mis-
match in scale between species occurrence and the explanatory variables may result in a
clear decrease in the performance of the model. Scale issues must therefore be handled
properly, and possible uncertainties must be described when implementing the models and
their predictions in practice (Knegt et al. 2010). Spatial scale is a key characteristic of the
data, and determines the purpose to which the data can be applied. The intrinsic error in the
species observation locations should be lower than the resolution of the environmental vari-
ables. However, the choice of spatial scale in the explanatory/environmental data depends
on the resolution of the available spatial data that are of relevance to the prediction.

In compiled ecological data, the spatial scale of the sample location may vary, as
may the sampling methodology applied in detection, and may have an important effect on
model accuracy (e.g. Reese et al. 2005, Braunisch and Suchant 2010, Pandit et al. 2010).
To account for variation in detection or in sampling method between surveys, it is desirable
to include covariates which describe contextual or methodological differences in detecting
the presence of a species as explanatory variables (e.g. MacKenzie et al. 2002, Schmidt
2005). Alternatively weights can be attributed to the response to up- or down-weight the
importance of particular locations, whichever is more appropriate (e.g. Carroll et al. 2001).
The spatial scale of the environmental data is determined by the resolution (grain size)
and the extent of the study area (Morrison and Hall 2002). It is critical to know whether the
grain size of the study and the extent are appropriate for the phenomena being studied; oth-
erwise, the results may be misleading (Guisan and Thuiller 2005). It is likely that different
species respond to their environments at different spatial scales (Holland et al. 2004, Graf
et al. 2005) and that these scales may be related to the home ranges of the species (Addicott
et al. 1987). Moreover, the modelled relationships between the dependent variable and the
environmental explanatory variables changes over space (Osborne et al. 2007, Miller and
Hanham 2011).

Environmental variables with coarse resolution lead to a bias against rare environ-
mental entities. For example, the distribution of species may be dependent on such
rare environmental entities as small or temporary water bodies (e.g. habitat for birds

and amphibians), which cannot be detected using coarse resolution data but do exist in
the natural world. In general, ﬁner spatial resolution environmental data lead to better
predictive models, assuming that the data quality associated with the response variable
is adequate and does not lead to truncated distributions (Huston 2002). Some authors have
compared environmental data sets of land cover variables of different resolution derived
from remote sensing platforms and have found no difference in their explanatory power
(Seoane et al. 2004, Venier et al. 2004). This is apparently because the resolution of
explanatory variables in the study of Seoane et al. (2004) fell within a relatively ﬁne class
(30–250 m). The resolution of the response was set to correspond with the resolution of
explanatory variables from 857 survey data points. In the study of Venier et al. (2004), the
resolution of the explanatory variables was ﬁne (200 m and 1 km) relative to the resolution
of the response at 5–10 km2.

Several studies have coarsened the resolution of data to examine its inﬂuence on SDM
performance. Coarsening the resolution can diversify nearby environmental variables and
cause the model to identify spurious combinations of suitable environmental variables for a
species, and/or the presence and absence pattern of species may be inﬂuenced. For exam-
ple, Ferrier and Watson (1997) used ﬁne and coarse environmental data to evaluate the
effect of spatial resolution (grain size) on SDM performance. The study used ‘ﬁne-scale’
data for a 4-ha grid and a ‘coarse scale’ with the same variables generalized to a 25-km2
grid, and they found degraded model performance using the ‘coarse scale’. Guisan et al.
(2007a) conclude that 10-fold (1–100 km2) coarsening of resolution does not substan-
tially change the performance of SDMs. However, Kaliontzopoulou et al. (2008) reported
degraded model performance for 10 km2 grain size in comparison with 1 km2 grain size.
By contrast, Tobalske (2002) observed better model prediction using their coarse scale
(4 km2) than when using their ﬁne scale (1 km2). In addition, Graf et al. (2005) increased
the resolution stepwise from 1 ha up to ∼11 km2 and found that the predictive power
was highest using the intermediate scales (∼1 and ∼2 km2). However, Heikkinen et al.
(2007) developed more accurate models for resolutions of 1 and 25 ha than for 1 km2. The
most comprehensive study carried out recently (Seo et al. 2009) examined SDM dynamics
across a 64-fold (1–4096 km2) change in resolution and found that the decline in model
performance generally accelerated between 64 and 256 km2 grain size.

From the papers cited here, it seems that the widely used 1–100 km2 grain size is
ideal for identifying the environmental range limits of species and is thus appropriate for
modelling species distributions with currently available data. However, the appropriate res-
olution will differ according to the species under study, the landscape of interest and the
environmental variables of relevance to the study. Moreover, these studies did not use grain
size ﬁner than 1 ha and, according to the recent ﬁndings of Gottschalk et al. (2011), remote
sensing data with ﬁner spatial resolution are most promising. Additionally, all studies were
performed on real data. With regard to their contrasting ﬁndings, we suggest that artiﬁcial
data may be helpful for identifying and resolving the reasons for the differences. It is a
matter for further research to investigate whether the lost information from using coarse
resolution environmental variables in SDM inevitably degrades the predictive performance
of the model.

Conclusions

As this review has shown, positional accuracy, sample size and scale are complex, closely
interlinked themes, which unquestionably limit the accuracy of SDMs and should be con-
sidered at the outset of any modelling process. With currently available species distribution
data, which may contain inaccuracies (e.g. positional error), and environmental variables

with spatial resolution usually in the order of several hundred meters or more, the current
literature suggests that studies performed at resolution of 1–100 km2 over large areas are
suitable for identifying the environmental range limits of species and are thus appropriate
for modelling species distributions. It is important to note that this recommendation will
probably change when more accurate and ﬁner resolution data become readily available.
From the papers cited in this review, it is clear that incorporating coarse temporal and spa-
tial resolution species occurrence data in a model lowers performance, despite an increase
in sample size.

With regard to modelling the realized and potential distributions of species, we distin-
guish two cases suitable for different data accuracy. For modelling the realized distribution
of a species, particularly for management and conservation efforts which require uncer-
tainty to be minimized, we suggest using spatially accurate species occurrence data with
large sample sizes. Accurate species occurrence data can be obtained through appropriate
data ﬁltering. An examination of spatial autocorrelation in predictors will help to min-
imize the possible inﬂuence of positional uncertainty in species occurrence data and to
avoid wrongly targeted conservation efforts. Additionally, covariates that describe varia-
tion in positional accuracy or contextual or methodological differences in detecting the
presence of a species can be included as predictors (explanatory variables) or used to gen-
erate weights applied to the response variable, whichever is most appropriate. However,
if the data is sparse, models to support the generation of hypotheses about the potential
distribution of species can be created using a relatively small sample size. Modelling of the
potential distribution of species should be directed towards predicting the regions that best
meet the minimum physiological requirements of the species. Generally, such data suggest
species from poorly surveyed regions, for which models can help to target ﬁeld surveys to
discover unknown populations.

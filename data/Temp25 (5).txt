Abstract. The paper describes a problem faced by National Statistical O(cid:129) ces
when publishing the results of decennial censuses for small geographical areas. If
they publish statistical tables for two or more sets of areas, users can compare
the tables and produce new statistics for the areas formed by di(cid:128) erencing, which
may have populations below con® dentiality thresholds. To investigate the prob-
lem, the authors construct a software system and carry out a series of experiments
using a large synthetic population base for Yorkshire and Humberside. The results
indicate that publishing statistics for zones close in size to the primary areas is
not safe unless the zones have been carefully designed. However, publishing
statistics for su(cid:129) ciently large areas such as 5 km grid squares or postal sectors
alongside enumeration districts is safe.

1. Context

This paper addresses a problem faced by National Statistical O(cid:129) ces ( NSOs)
when producing statistical tables from census returns for geographical areas. The
problem is whether it is possible to publish tables for more than one set of unrelated
areas. We show how simple operations common in geographical information systems
use such as overlaying and point-in-polygon counting can be used to assess the risks
in such publication. A set of programs is developed to carry out experiments to
discover the empirical extent of the di(cid:128) erencing problem. The software system
developed has considerable potential for use by national census o(cid:129) ces, and has been
transferred for use by the O(cid:129) ce for National Statistics.

1.1. Statistical disclosure control

When NSOs publish data from censuses they generally do so under a legal
obligation to protect the privacy of individuals. NSOs use a variety of techniques to
prevent disclosure of information about individuals, and these techniques are termed
statistical disclosure control (SDC). Concern is greatest where tables or other extracts
of information refer to only a few people, because in those cases it is easier to
distinguish individuals with unique combinations of identifying characteristics. For
the purpose of this investigation the ability to isolate an individual with a unique
set of characteristics is considered a case where there is a risk of identi® cation.

Geography is an important factor in SDC, as the larger the areas for which data
are tabulated, the greater will be the number of inhabitants, and thus the smaller
the risk of disclosure of information about particular individuals. NSOs are concerned

that if data are published for more than one geography , then it may be possible to
combine data to determine counts for very small areas, which may contain few
people. Such cases may lead to a risk of information about individuals being disclosed.
This paper describes a software system used to examine the practical risk of such
disclosure from data published from the 1991 Census of Population in the United
Kingdom, and reports on the conclusions reached.

1.2. User requirements for area statistics

Tables of data describing the population in particular sub-national areas of a
state can be called area statistics, and as these areas become smaller in size and thus
greater in number they are termed small area statistics. The term implies that the
areas are su(cid:129) ciently small to warrant further protection methods before publication.
Such protection measures include record swapping, re-coding, cell suppression,
rounding and random cell perturbation. In the United Kingdom, the smallest units
for which Census data are published are Enumeration Districts ( EDs) in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland, and Output Areas (OAs) in Scotland. There were
155 180 of these small areas in the United Kingdom ( Denham 1993, table 3.1 and
Rees 1995, table 2.6 ) with an average 1991 Census population of about 366. For
each of these geographical areas some 86 tables of statistics containing about 9000
counts were produced.

However, these units do not provide a spatial system that satis® es all users of
census data, and thus there is demand for alternative geographies . This demand has
been met in the past by the production of tables for more than one geography. For
example, additional tables were produced for postal sectors in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland, and for ward electoral areas in Scotland. However, it remains
unclear what level of risk of disclosure this creates, or what threat would be posed
by further additional geographies. Meetings of users of census data following the
1991 Census identi® ed a number of competing requirements for output from the
census ( Rees 1997 ).

L ocal government users in England and Wales were insistent that the census
o(cid:129) ces publish area statistics for exact local government units. The reason for this
insistence was the key dependence between central government grants to local
authorities and the size and characteristics of local authority populations as recorded
in the decennial census. Users in the National Health Service and Business sectors, in
contrast, argued strongly for use of postal geography. The key argument was the
extensive use (in patient or customer records) of the postal address as a reference in
non-census databases. This argument had already gained recognition by the Census
O(cid:129) ces in two respects. The General Register O(cid:129) ce Scotland (GROS) decided to
base its output strategy on use of the unit postcode from the early 1970s and released
area statistics from the 1991 Census for output areas built up from unit postcodes
( Denham 1993 ), whereas in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland census
collection area or enumeration district ( ED) was used. The primary area statistics
in Scotland were therefore for output areas based on unit postcodes and for pseudo-
postal sectors ( larger postal zones). In England and Wales area statistics for postal
sectors were produced as secondary output ( i.e. after the primary area statistics based
on the ED had been produced ).

Academic users employed both administrative and postal zones in their work but
had other important requirements. They wanted area statistics for zones that matched
those in the previous census in order to monitor change in populations over time.

Comparison between the 1981 and 1991 Censuses was possible using Scottish area
statistics, except where the scheme of postal coding had changed, as in the Aberdeen
area. In England and Wales and Northern Ireland, some sets of EDs and wards
remained the same between the two censuses but for any given study area this could
not be guaranteed. There was also a secondary demand for zones which formed a
regular grid which could be related to environmental data gathered using a raster
grid and which could be conveniently used in simulation models. Such area statistics
had been produced in 1971 for Great Britain and were available via special tabula-
tions for Northern Ireland in 1971, 1981 and 1991 although the number of counts
was small ( 800 in 1991) in comparison with the area statistics.

To summarise, user consultation revealed that there were competing demands
for area statistics based on administrative geographies, postal geographies, grid
geographies and time-comparable geographies. Users wanted area statistics for these
four standard geographies. These demands on the part of users constitute both an
opportunity for and a threat to NSOs. The opportunity is to create several sets of
small area data which can be sold to customers and which will meet their needs
more precisely. The threat is that posed to con® dentiality: would the existence of
more than one, internally safe, area statistics dataset lead to the creation by users
of other unsafe datasets from which information about identi® able individuals could
be accessed?

1.3. T he problem of di(cid:128) erencing

To prevent disclosure one of the key protections applied by NSOs to geographical
tables is to set minimum thresholds of persons and households for the area for which
statistics are being output. However, if statistics are published for two di(cid:128) erent
geographies, then it may be possible to subtract one set of tables from the other to
obtain statistics for sub-threshold areas. The general overlapping of two sets of
geographical boundaries does not necessarily create a disclosure problem because
we cannot derive exact information about the population located in the intersections,
unless one area is known to have a zero population (or a zero count for a variable
of interest). The use of a minimum population threshold before statistics are generated
for an area is intended to minimise the risk of there being single cross-classi® ed
counts or cells with zero counts that establish accurately that all persons with
characteristic x also have characteristic y. Broad-coding is used to reduce the informa-
tion that this yields. In addition, cell perturbation is also used as an additional
protection to ensure that an investigator cannot be con® dent that any tabulated
count of zero is in fact correct. The danger in di(cid:128) erencing comes when it is possible
to nest small areas from one geography into sets of areas from another geography.
Figure 1 illustrates a topological con® guration of zones in which this might happen.
The top map shows geography A with nine areas making up a region. The second
map shows geography B where it overlaps with the A regionÐ
some nine areas
overlap although only two are wholly contained within the region de® ned by geo-
graphy A. We have statistics for both the A areas and the B areas. What is it possible
to ® nd out about the intersecting areas in terms of statistics? We examine each of
the areas in turn to see if one or more of the other set nest inside. Examining the B
areas we ® nd that area A4 nests wholly inside area B3. This is shown in the third
map. This is the only example of nesting for the B areas. The third map shows the
e(cid:128) ect of overlaying the two geographies, with intersections being labelled according
to their two parent areas, with area B3 highlighted by a heavy border. When area

A4 (shown dot shaded in the fourth map) is subtracted, the remainder of B3 becomes
the inner halo. By considering the remainders of the zones that intersect with B3
other than A4, we can derive the outer halo of B3, which is shown with wide stripes
in the fourth map.

How many of such di(cid:128) erenced areas fall below the con® dentiality thresholds and
in what kind of circumstances in terms of the two geographies being compared? It
is di(cid:129) cult to answer that question without access to geocoded census household and
communal establishment records. Such data are not, of course, available in the UK
outside of the Census O(cid:129) ces because the data are con® dential. In general, the census
records have not been geocoded (e.g. assigned a one metre National Grid reference)
except in the case of the areas to be used in the June 1997 Census Test. We therefore
develop a synthetic database in which we can assign an exact location to each
household and communal establishment. This database is described in § 2.

1.4. Structure of the paper

This paper describes a software system arranged to compare two geographies,
and to test whether or not it is possible to determine counts for sub-threshold areas.
Section 2 brie¯ y describes the various components of the experimental software
system used to compare geographies, and also describes a database of households
and individuals used to ensure that all geographies are consistent. The manner in
which the experiments were conducted is described in greater detail in § 3 and a
worked example is used to illustrate the method. In § 4, the series of experiments
carried out are described and their results assessed. The ® nal section of the paper
makes recommendations about safe publication strategies for small area statistics.

2. The experimental system

A system of databases and software was set up to test the safety of producing
more than one set of area statistics. The elements in the system are shown in ® gure 2.
There are three largely separate systems that are used in this paper. Firstly, a
program called SYNTHPOP is used to generate a synthetic population database.
This is necessary because we do not have access to a real database of individuals of
su(cid:129) cient complexity. Secondly, a program called SDCTOOL is used to generate
tables of statistics based on the microdata created by SYNTHPOP. The program
has a variety of sophisticated features for tabulation and protection, but they are
used in a very basic way for the purposes of this paper. Finally, the results generated
by SDCTOOL are analysed by a program called DIFFER, which does the majority
of the work described in this paper. Full descriptions of the 1991 Census data for
England and Wales employed in the paper are provided in Dale and Marsh ( 1993)
and Openshaw ( 1995 ).

2.1. A synthetic database of households and persons

In order for geographies to be systematically compared, and for the number of
households and individuals within them to be counted for any given area, it is
necessary to have a detailed database of household locations, coupled with informa-
tion about the individuals who inhabit them. Access to genuine information of this
kind is restricted, and therefore a synthetic database of households and persons was
constructed.

This database, which was created using the SYNTHPOP program, is a random
replication of the Household ( 1%) Sample Anonymised Records (SARs) from the

1991 Census of Population to form the 2 million households and 5 million people
living in Yorkshire and Humberside in 1991 (see ® gure 3 ). The region is home to
8´6% of the UK population. This region can usefully be seen as representative of the
country, as it contains both major cities and large, sparsely populated rural areas.
The synthetic population was created using a set of ED boundaries, together with
data from the published Small Area Statistics (SAS) regarding the number of house-
holds in each ED. In each ED, a number of points were randomly selected, one for
each household counted in the SAS. A household from the 1991 Household SAR
(Marsh 1993 ) was allocated at random to each of these points, with a certain number
of households in each ED being additionally tagged as `imputed’ using the count
taken from table S19 of the SAS. This population has a realistic spatial distribution,

but little or no spatial patterns in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, because
of the random allocation of households. This is therefore a highly arti® cial population
but one that can be counted and processed like the real census population.

This synthetic population is stored in a master ®

le which gives a point location

for each household, together with some additional information such as the number
of individuals in the household and whether the household has been tagged as
imputed. Any suitable Arc/Info polygon coverage (such as that for EDs, postal
sectors and grid squares) can then be used to generate a geography-speci® c look up
table ( LUT) which contains an entry for each area in that geography listing identi-
® cation numbers of all the households that fall into the area. Such a table could be
constructed using Arc/Info directly, but in order to more easily cope with the large
amount of data to be processed, and to write the output tables with the required
structure, a separate program called IDENTITY was written in FORTRAN 90 to
perform this task.

The population data above were taken from the Household SAR (Marsh and
Teague 1992). This places some limits on the tables which can be generated, because
of the coding used for particular variables. One of the main di(cid:128) erences between the
SAR and the dataset needed for the current work is the treatment of imputed
households. Imputed households are households which failed to return a completed
census form, which were con® rmed by the enumerator as being present and for
which a record was invented. These are not included in the SAR, but it is desirable
to place them in the synthetic population. If it is recognised that individuals resident
in imputed households cannot, by de® nition, be fully identi® ed, then the numbers of
imputed households may have a signi® cant in¯ uence on the risk of disclosure for
individuals in a small area. For this reason, some households are tagged as `imputed’.
The number of imputed households in each ED can be discovered from the SAS,
and thus the spatial distribution of such households can be considered to be reason-
ably accurate. When data are prepared for the tabulation program, SDCTOOL, it
is necessary to modify the original SAR data for these `imputed’ households.
Speci® cally, the additional person type `absentÐ
imputed’ has to be allowed for in
the data, and residents in imputed household need to have their person type variable
changed.

2.2. Bou ndary data sets for alternative geographies

All boundary sets are stored and manipulated using the GIS package Arc/Info,
and as such new geographies must be introduced to the system as a set of digital
boundaries which can be read by Arc/Info. The GIS package is used in several ways:
to overlay two coverages to generate a list of intersections, to generate a contiguity
matrix, to display results and to use as an exploratory tool to check unexpected or
confusing results. An external program called IDENTITY is used to create look up
tables which list the identi® cation numbers of households within each area of a
newly supplied geography.

2.3. T able generation and modi® cation

In order for two geographies to be compared, it is necessary to have accurate
statistics relating to the areas in each geography. In one of the sets of experiments
described in this paper, statistics published as part of the 1991 Census were used to
provide this information, but in general the statistics have to be generated from
primary microdata.

A program called SDCTOOL was used to generate tables of area statistics for
any polygon based geography from household and individual microdata. Tables are
constructed for all areas in a given geography detailing only the numbers of house-
holds and of individuals in each area.

587

2.4. Comparing geographies

Once SDCTOOL has been used to generate tables of area statistics for the two
geographies to be compared, a separate program called DIFFER is used to process
these results. The program requires as input sets of area statistics for two geographies,
together with a table detailing the list of intersections between all areas in the two
geographies. It then searches for cases where statistics for new small areas can be
derived by subtraction of data relating to one or more areas in one of the geographies
from one or more of the areas in the other geography. Statistics about the nature of
those areas are then collated.

3. The methods used in the experiments for di(cid:128) erencing geographies

This section describes the methods used in the di(cid:128) erencing experiments to gener-
ate the required data and to test whether or not overlaying two geographies could
reveal new sub-threshold areas.

In any attempt to di(cid:128) erence two geographies, three sets of data are required:

1. accurate population counts for areas in the ® rst geography
2. accurate population counts for areas in the second geography
3. a list of intersections between areas in the two geographies.

The various sets of experiments carried out used di(cid:128) erent methods to generate
the above data, but then analysed them in the same way. There were two general
methods for compiling the required information: the ® rst was to generate it directly,
using digital geocoded microdata in conjunction with boundary data, and the second
was to use the published Census data for areas and a look up table relating one
geography to another.

3.1. Using published digital boundaries to build required data

Two sets of previously published boundaries were used for enumeration districts
( EDs) and postal sectors ( PSs). EDs were mapped using the standard 1991 ED-line
Consortium ED boundary sets distributed as part of the ESRC/JISC Census data
dissemination programme. The situation with respect to boundaries for postal sectors
was slightly more complicated. It was decided to use boundaries relating to the ® rst
quarter of 1996, published by GEOPLAN and acquired for and distributed to the
academic community via a CHEST agreement, as these were the most complete and
detailed boundary set available. The 1996 boundaries were thus used as if they were
the 1991 boundaries. As the 1996 and 1991 postal sectors are not being analysed
together, the di(cid:128) erences between them are irrelevant.

The ® rst task was to build sets of accurate population counts for the two
geographies. In order to do this, a simple run of the SDCTOOL software was
required for each geography. The system was set up to build and report a simple
table for each area in the geography. This table contained counts of the number of
individuals and the number of households, and was constructed with minimum
thresholds set to zero and with no disclosure control algorithms applied, so as to
exhaustively report correct data for each area. These households and individuals
were taken from the synthetic population described in § 2.

A table of intersections was then constructed by using the Arc/Info command
identity, which was used to overlay the two geographies and create a new coverage
consisting of all intersections, with all polygons in the new coverage having two

labels, one from each source geography. These label pairs were written to an external

le for use in the experiment.

3.2. Creating new digital boundaries

For experiments with grid based geographies, new sets of digital boundaries had
to be created for input to Arc/Info in order for data to be tabulated. In the case of
regular grids, the task of creating a grid of cells of the required size was trivial.
However,
for the variable sized grids a rather more sophisticated program was
required.

The program IDENTITY, described above in § 2.1 uses a quadtree structure
( Finkel and Bentley 1974) in order to build an index for the data it handles. The
program was modi® ed so as to allow more ¯ exible construction of these quadtrees,
and to output the results in the form of a set of boundaries. A set of labels is also
generated which mimic postal sector labels in order to facilitate further processing.
The quadtree approach was carried out in the following manner. Initially, a
bounding box was constructed which contained all the household location points in
the region. A recursive routine then analysed this box, and counted how many points
were inside it. If the number of points was greater than a certain threshold, the box
would be split into equal quadrants, and each new zone analysed in turn in the same
way (i.e. the number of points was counted, and the zone split if the number exceeded
the threshold ). When a zone was found that contained fewer than the required
number of households the recursive decomposition process would stop, and the
program would return to a higher branch in the tree, in order to examine other
zones. When all branches had reached a point at which the de® ned zone contained
fewer than the threshold number of points, the resulting grid contained a set of cells
which covered the entire region, with each cell containing fewer
than the
pre-determined threshold number of households.

The above method could then be subjected to an aggregation routine, so that all
end zones could be merged together with neighbours having the same parent in the
quadtree, until each new cell contained more households than the minimum thresh-
old. This permits the creation of a network of variable sized grid cells, all of which
contain more than a threshold number of households. Figure 4 provides an example
of a variable sized grid which was created using this method. The initial bounding
box was decomposed until all cells contained fewer than 128 household points, and
then sibling zones were aggregated until they had more than 128 points. Comparison
with a map of the region’s settlements will show that the variable cell size approach
leads to large cells in rural areas, and small cells in urban areas. The major towns
and cities of the region are all easy to detect. The method employed does lead to
unnecessarily large zones being created around the edge of the region; however, it is
felt that the grid is still su(cid:129) ciently good at mirroring the known settlements of the
region to be used in the current experiments.

3.3. Using published tabular data

The alternative to using digital boundaries and SDCTOOL to construct the
required data was to use existing published tabular data. From the 1991 Small Area
Statistics (SAS) were extracted counts of usual residents and numbers of households
for both EDs and postal sectors. Both these values can be found for all areas prior
to modi® cation by blurring or by reassignment due to the thresholding process.

The list of area intersections was obtained from a subset of the published post-

code-to-ED ( PC/ED) directory, which lists a series of intersections of 1991 EDs and
1991 postcodes, and also gives the number of households in each intersecting area.

3.4. Di(cid:128) erences between the data sources

Both the digital boundaries approach and the tabular data approach were used
to compare EDs and postal sectors. There are a number of di(cid:128) erences in the quality
of the data derived by the two methods which are worth noting.

Firstly, it is important to note that the digital boundaries method used postal
sector boundaries dating from 1996. Comparison with the postal sectors listed in
the PC/ED directory indicate that there have been a number of changes since 1991:
speci® cally some 1991 sectors appear to have been relabelled. Such a comparison
cannot indicate whether or not sector boundaries have altered while retaining the
same label, but it seems probable that this will have occurred in some cases. Raper
et al. ( 1992 ) compared two editions of the Postcode Address File ( PAF) and found
that on average 0´2% of unit postcodes ( UPCs) changed per month. It is inevitable
that some changes will a(cid:128) ect sector boundaries, as will the allocation of new UPCs
for new housing. In itself, any change in sector boundaries is not a problem for the
present analysis: the method still allows the di(cid:128) erencing tests to be carried out,
because the three data sets used for the tests are all internally consistent having been
built from the same data source (the synthetic population). However, it is recognised
that the overall
intention of this experiment was to assess the degree to which
di(cid:128) erencing could have ( potentially) revealed information about areas with sub-
threshold populations using published data from the 1991 Census. The analysis
would have been improved if the 1991 boundaries had been used rather than the
1996 boundaries.

A more signi® cant problem occurred with the tabular data method, and arose
from the PC/ED directory. It is known (Cole 1996, personal communication) that

le. When extracting the
there were a number of errors in the initial releases of this ®
data required for this experiment (all entries in the ®
le which had an intersection
with an ED in Yorkshire and Humberside) one obvious error was found, where an
incorrect letter was contained within the outcode (the ® rst half ) of one of the
referenced postal sectors. This error was detected by the processing software because
the postcode as given was invalid (it was a letter pair which is not used by the Post
O(cid:129) ce). However, further errors may have been undetected because they referenced
a postal sector which was valid but incorrect.

3.5. Comparison of geographies using DIFFER

In all cases the data were processed in the same way by the program DIFFER.
This section will provide an account of how the program works by describing an
illustrative example taken from the comparison of EDs and postal sectors. The
technique applies in exactly the same way to the grid geographies.

The DIFFER program operates in the following manner. First, the ®

les containing
population and household counts are read and re-written in a format more readily
usable by the program. At the same time, the labels of all zones are stored, so that
the consistency of the intersection pairs can be checked later. The next step is for
the ®
le of intersections to be read. This is used to build two tables: one lists the
identi® cation numbers of all EDs which intersect with a given postal sector, the
other lists the identi® cation numbers of all postal sectors intersecting with a given
ED. Special cases occur where a postal sector or ED overlaps with the `background’.
The set of postal sectors chosen was those which overlap to any extent with the
EDs used. Thus, around the edge of the region the postal sectors tended to partially
overlap with EDs, and partially overlap with the `background’. Where di(cid:128) erent
geographies are constructed for di(cid:128) erent purposes, it is inevitable that they will not
necessarily share regional boundaries. Figure 5 shows that the problem occurs even
where there are hard physical boundaries such as a coastline. Such di(cid:128) erences will

occur because of di(cid:128) erent digitization, and because of di(cid:128) erent rules regarding
construction of boundaries.

New zones can only be derived via di(cid:128) erencing where data is available for all
areas concerned. If a zone that overlaps the background is found to wholly contain
areas of another geography, then it is possible to construct an inner halo for that
zone, as long as the population of the zone and contained areas are known, but it
is not possible to construct the outer halo, because the population for all areas
overlapping the zone must be known.

Once the two intersection tables have been constructed, the main body of the
program is entered. Two simple series of tests are made. First, each ED is analysed,
in order to see whether it is possible to identify sub-threshold portions of that ED
via di(cid:128) erencing, and then the same test is made for each postal sector in turn. Both
of these passes consider only one component of a geography in turn. It is conceivable
(as shown in Thomas 1997) that di(cid:128) erencing may be possible when aggregations of
areas are used. A single area might not wholly contain areas of an alternative
geography, but a given aggregation of areas might contain one or more areas of an
alternative geography. It is beyond the scope of the current implementation of
DIFFER to test such aggregations but the results of the body of experiments and
common sense suggest that in such scenarios the halo regions revealed are likely to
be physically larger and contain a greater number of people that the areas derived
by the experiments reported in this paper, and that they are therefore less likely to
present a risk.

The tests for an ED can be used as an example. The tests involve a series of
comparisons of the two intersection tables constructed in the second stage of the
DIFFER program. In order to reduce confusion, these tables will be referred to as:

the ed_intersect tableÐ
sectors which intersect with that ED.
the ps_intersect tableÐ
the EDs which intersect with that sector.

this contains an entry for each ED, listing the postal

this contains an entry for each postal sector, listing

Figure 6 shows extracts from these two tables. Figure 6(a) shows part of the
ed_intersect table showing a list of postal sectors which intersect with a few EDs in
the Ardsley ward in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, whilst ® gure 6(b) shows abridged
versions of the entries in the ps_intersect table for the postal sectors referenced in
® gure 6 (a). It can be seen, for example, that the ED with the code 05CCFA01 has
three intersections with three di(cid:128) erent postal sectors, whereas the fourth and ®
fth
EDs in the ward both have intersections with a single postal sector.

All EDs are examined in turn, and for each one, the entry in the ed_intersect
table is considered. This is a list of postal sectors, and for each one of the listed
postal sectors, the relevant entry in the ps_intersect table is studied. If the postal
sector is found to have only one intersecting ED then it must be in one of two states.
Either, the postal sector is completely contained within the ED being examined in
the current iteration, or it is partially within that ED and partially overlapping with
the background. As the background does not have an ED identi® cation number it
will not be included in the list of intersections for that postal sector. It is for this
reason that it is useful to identify these `edge’ sectors when the intersection tables
are constructed.

Figure 6 (b) shows the entries in the ps_intersect table for some of the postal
sectors that intersect with EDs listed in ® gure 6(a). It can be seen that all postal

sectors listed in ® gure 6 (b) have numerous intersections. None of the EDs, therefore,
have wholly contained postal sectors, and therefore none will reveal new areas via
di(cid:128) erencing. When analysed from the opposite direction, it can be seen that postal
sector `S7 15’ has intersections with 27 EDs, two of which ( 05CCFA04 and
05CCFA05 ) have only a single cross-referencing entry in the portion of the ed_inter-
sect table shown. Either these EDs are contained within `S7 15’, or they have one
part in `S7 15’ and one part in the background. Figure 7 illustrates that the former
is the caseÐ
the dot shaded EDs being the two listed in ® gure 6(a) together with
three others which are also wholly contained within the postal sector.

Thus it is possible in this case to further proceed with the di(cid:128) erencing test, by
calculating the numbers of households and individuals contained within the new
area. Figure 8 shows a list of all the EDs which intersect with the postal sector,
followed by the calculations of the two halo regions. The inner halo consists of the
striped parts of ® gure 7 which are within the postal sector (dashed line), while the

outer halo consists of the striped elements outside this line. Clearly, although it is
possible to deduce the counts of households and individuals for the halo regions, all
revealed values are much higher than the 1991 threshold values of 16 households
and 50 persons.

The DIFFER program calculates values for inner and outer haloes, and stores
the results. At the end of the run, DIFFER then prints out a table listing the number
of areas which were able to be di(cid:128) erenced, and then a summary of the population

area contains more than a given number of persons and households then it will
be `safe’.

Areas which overlap with the background are treated as a special case. They can
be ignored, or have haloes constructed regardless of the fact that they overlap with
the background, or have only their inner haloes (which should be consistent)
constructed. In the experiments reported here such areas were ignored.

4. Test results
4.1. T he structure of the results tables

This section introduces the results from the three main sets of di(cid:128) erencing
experiments, and comments on the results. The results are reproduced as tables 1 to
3. In each table there are three panels of statistics.

The ® rst panel shows how many areas could be investigated using the di(cid:128) erencing
test, how many could not be because they did not wholly contain any areas in the
other geography, and how many were rejected because they were close to the edge
of the region and thus had intersecting polygons which overlapped with the
background.

The second panel shows the distribution of person counts in the halo regions
revealed while the third panel shows the distribution of household counts in the
halo regions. The total number of haloes in the second and third panels (i.e. for
persons and households) should be equal to twice the number of areas for which
di(cid:128) erencing was possible, because each successful test reveals information about both
haloes. The class limits used to group the counts are:

1. The standard 1991 ED threshold ( 50 persons, 16 households)
2. Twice the ED threshold ( 100 persons, 32 households)
3. Three times the ED threshold ( 48 in the case of households)
4. Four times the ED threshold ( 200 in the case of persons).

Table 4 presents summary statistics based in tables 1 to 3.

4.2. General remarks about the results

Table 1 shows, in the second and third columns, the results for the comparison
of postal sectors and EDs, using the digital boundaries and the synthetic population.
The second column in table 1 shows that the majority of postal sectors can be
di(cid:128) erenced using this method, but all of this majority produce large haloes which
contain signi® cantly larger than threshold populations. The third column in table 1
reveals that only two EDs can be di(cid:128) erenced. The small frequency for EDs which
can be di(cid:128) erenced is as expected, because the average size of postal sectors is much
greater than the average size of EDs. Thus one is unlikely to ® nd cases of a postal
sector being contained within an ED. Both of the cases found are in city centres,
where the density of unit postcodes (mainly business addresses) is much higher than
in the residential areas outside city centres.
Table 1 shows, in the fourth and ®

fth columns, results for the comparison of
postal sectors and EDs using the relationships between post code ( PC) units and
EDs provided the PC/ED directory ( look up table) and the counts of households
for each PC/ED intersection. As with the previous comparison, most of the postal
sectors can be di(cid:128) erenced, but few EDs can be di(cid:128) erenced. One feature of both
columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) in table 1 that is immediately apparent is that the total numbers
of haloes are inconsistent. Column ( 4) shows that 698 postal sectors can be di(cid:128) er-

Notes
1. The total number of haloes for which statistics are provided in the second and third
panels of the table are twice the number of possible areas identi® ed in the ® rst panel of the table.
2. The number of haloes for which person and household counts are reported (second
and third panels) is fewer than twice the number of areas for which di(cid:128) erencing is possible
because some of the areas overlap with the background (see text § 3.2).

3. ED=enumeration district, the collection are for the 1991 Census in England and Wales.
4. PS=postal sector, the second smallest unit in the hierarchy of post codes (e.g. `LS2 9’

enced, potentially creating 1396 haloes, but both sets of halo frequencies have totals
slightly below this ® gure. The reason for this disparity is the way in which postal
sectors which overlap with the background are handled. As previously discussed,
the outer haloes of zones cannot be constructed where they overlap with the back-
ground. The intersections extracted from the PC/ED ®
le for this experiment were
for all intersections involving the EDs selected, and this makes it di(cid:129) cult to identify
cases where a postal sector overlapped partially with the background, because that
intersection would not be represented.

identify such cases, and ignores the haloes created. The total count of haloes is
therefore slightly lower than the potential sum.

Table 2 reports the results for three sets of regular grids which were generated.
Columns 2 and 3 give the results for a grid with cells with a side of 10 km, columns
4 and 5 give the results for a grid with cells of side 5 km, and columns 6 and 7 give
the results for tables with a side of 1 km. Both of the larger grids ( 10 k, 5 km) use
cells which are considerably bigger than the average ED, and therefore it is not
surprising that the results show that no EDs could be di(cid:128) erenced using these grids
(columns 3 and 5). However, although many of the grid cells, especially for the larger
grids, could be di(cid:128) erenced, this tended to generate large haloes containing popula-
tions of greater than threshold size (columns 2, 4 and 6). The smaller grid, however,
has an average size which is smaller than an ED. Given that the size of EDs varies
considerably, whereas the grid has cells of a ® xed size, this means that in practice
some EDs are larger than the grid cells and some are smaller. Thus both EDs and
grid cells can be di(cid:128) erenced using the 1 km grid, as shown in columns 6 and 7.

Table 3 reports the results for four sets of grids constructed with grid cells of
variable size. The grids were built using minimum thresholds of 256, 128, 64 and 32
households (i.e. multiples of the 1991 household threshold for EDs). The last of these
four grids has a similar average area size to EDs, but with a signi® cantly di(cid:128) erent

distribution, so that there are more cells in the variable grid than there are EDs in
the region. All the variable grids allow some cells to be di(cid:128) erenced, although as the
minimum number of households is reduced, and the average cell size becomes smaller,
so a smaller proportion of the cells can be di(cid:128) erenced. As with the regular grids, the
reduction in cell size makes it more likely that there will be EDs which wholly
contain grid cells, allowing the EDs to be di(cid:128) erenced. The two smaller variable grids
allow some EDs to be di(cid:128) erenced (columns 7 and 9).

4.3. Structure of the summary table

Table 4 shows for each geography compared against EDs, the proportion of
areas which could be di(cid:128) erenced, together with the percentage of those areas that
had below threshold numbers of persons or of households. In the table, columns 4
and 7, labelled `% Areas Di(cid:128) erencing Possible’, show the percentage of areas of the
containing geography which were suitable for di(cid:128) erencing. Thus, in the ® rst row,
which shows the results for the comparison of postal sectors constructed using digital
boundary data with EDs, 66% of the postal sectors could be di(cid:128) erenced by looking
at EDs inside them, whereas only 0´02% of EDs could be di(cid:128) erenced by looking at
postal sectors inside them.

The columns marked `persons’ and `hhlds’ ( 5 and 6; 8 and 9 ) respectively show
the percentage of haloes created by di(cid:128) erencing which contained fewer than 50
persons or 16 households. Thus in the second row, 0´4% of haloes generated for
postal sectors ( by ® tting EDs inside them) contained a sub-threshold number of
people, and 0´4% contained a sub-threshold number of households. In the same way,
although haloes could be generated for 0´1% of EDs none of these haloes contained
sub-threshold counts of persons or households.

4.4. T he comparison of EDs and postal sectors: f urther discussion

The two approaches to di(cid:128) erencing postal geography can be compared. Both
methods allow a high proportion of postal sectors to be di(cid:128) erenced. This is because
the average size of the postal sectors is considerably greater than the average size of
EDs, and thus it is relatively easy to ® nd one or more EDs which ® t inside any
given postal sector. The main constraint when using digital boundary data is that
of the problem of postal sectors overlapping with the background at the region edge.
In fact, only 6´5% of postal sectors had no wholly contained EDs. As explained
previously, the ® gure when the PC/ED directory is used is arti® cially high, because
the nature of the intersection table and the current implementation of DIFFER
makes it impossible to detect these edge postal sectors. In the case of the PC/ED
directory method, these edge postal sectors will generally have been interpreted as
capable of being di(cid:128) erenced and then the error checking routine will have discarded
them. Nevertheless, the disparity between potential haloes and realised haloes in
columns 4 and 5 of table 1 shows that only a small proportion of haloes were
rejected. This look-up table approach allows many more postal sectors to be di(cid:128) er-
enced. The main reason for this is that use of the PC/ED directory produces more
exact relationships between the two sets of areas being compared than use of two
sets of digital boundaries.

It is inevitable that the two sets of boundaries used will not be entirely consistent.
Where a boundary of an ED and a postal sector should logically be the same,
because they follow the same natural feature, there will be small di(cid:128) erences between
the lines as digitised. The e(cid:128) ect that this has on the intersection list is very important,
because one area will be interpreted as overlapping a neighbouring area in the other
geography. Practical experience of working with di(cid:128) erent sets of boundaries show
that it is would be di(cid:129) cult to carry out some automated process of boundary
matching (that is, where boundaries are known or assumed to be the same, adjusting
the digitized representations so that they are identical ) because of the degree of
sensitivity. Two lines which are known to be the same may appear to some tens of
metres apart when comparing di(cid:128) erent digitized sources, but in urban environments
with high housing densities such a degree of di(cid:128) erence may not only be `real’ but
also very signi® cant in terms of the populations addressed.

The errors introduced by the digitising process therefore mean that many EDs
which should be considered wholly contained are not, and thus the look-up table
method will have two advantages. Firstly, some of the areas which cannot be
di(cid:128) erenced when two sets of boundaries are compared may be capable of di(cid:128) erencing,
because they will be found to have wholly contained EDs. Secondly, the use of the
look up table may result in more EDs being de® ned as contained in a given postal
sector, thus allowing a larger population to be subtracted, leading to smaller (in
terms of both size and population) haloes.

The comparison of the two methods indicates that the existence of a look up

table together with two sets of SAS increases disclosure risk, in that more areas will
become at risk from di(cid:128) erencing, and this conclusion must be considered when
planning future look-up tables. However,
it is important to bear in mind two
considerations regarding the method. Firstly, despite the apparent greater risk of
di(cid:128) erencing, the look-up table method still ® nds very few areas which are sub-
threshold. Secondly, the look-up table method only used data which was published
as part of the 1991 UK Census programme. That a small number of sub-threshold
areas could be found by comparing the sets of published data could be read as
indicating what level of risk might be considered `acceptable’, because it has been
accepted implicitly in the past.

It should be noted that the experiment with postal sectors and EDs used only
the number of usual residents and the number of
two counts from the CensusÐ
for which unmodi® ed counts are available. The experiment does not
householdsÐ
harm the integrity of the more detailed SAS, as the counts given in these tables are
subject to the disclosure control technique of random perturbation.

4.5. Comparison of EDs and regular grid geographies: f urther discussion

The regular grid geographies exhibit expected behaviour. As the size of such cells
gets smaller, it becomes easier for a computer algorithm to ® nd a set of cells that
closely approximate relatively large EDs. Table 4, column 7, shows that as the grid
cell size was increased, so fewer EDs could be di(cid:128) erenced. Conversely, as the size
increased, and became larger than the average ED size, there was more opportunity
to di(cid:128) erence the grid cells by ® nding EDs which ® tted inside them (table 4, column 4).
The 1 km grid cells allow many EDs to be di(cid:128) erenced, and many small haloes
12´7% containing a sub-threshold number of persons, indicating an
to be createdÐ
unacceptably high risk if detailed counts for such areas were released. In practice,
in the 1971 Census, grid SAS were suppressed for cells with below threshold numbers
of persons or households and joined with other grid cells. With the larger sized grids,
the number of haloes which contained a sub-threshold population was very low.
This was as expected. In the case of the small grid, di(cid:128) erencing was made possible
by ® nding a set of cells which were contained by an ED, and as mentioned above,
it is obviously easy to ® nd such a set of cells which closely approximate the shape
of the ED. If one can achieve a good approximation of the shape of the containing
area, then the halo regions revealed will be physically small, and thus might be
expected to contain small populations. However, with the larger grids, di(cid:128) erencing
was achieved by ® nding EDs which were contained by a grid square. As the grid
size increases, so more of the cells will be large enough to contain at least one ED,
and so many cells will permit di(cid:128) erencing. However, the EDs are generally irregularly
shaped, and will be unlikely to achieve a close approximation of a square. The result
of this is that the halo regions will tend to be large, and therefore one would expect
them to contain relatively large populations.

4.6. Comparison of EDs and variable grid geographies: f urther discussion

The grid cells of variable size o(cid:128) er very interesting results. The smallest grid,
constructed with a minimum of 32 households, has an average population size for
cells only slightly larger than for an ED, yet has rather more areas in total, due to
a di(cid:128) erent distribution of cell sizes. Few cells can be di(cid:128) erenced and very few of
those can produce haloes with sub-threshold populations. This is because of the

O. Duke-W illiams and P. Rees

nature of the grid, having large grid cells in rural areas prevents the e(cid:128) ective selection
of a set of cells which will closely approximate the shape of the ED.

This set of cells can be contrasted with the 1 km regular grid. Both have a similar
number of cells, and a (roughly) similar average size. However, the variable sized
in that fewer sub-threshold haloes can be
grid would appear to be much `safer’
revealed.

The larger variable grids follow the pattern established by the regular sized grids,
that as the average cell size increases, so a greater number of these cells become
available for di(cid:128) erencing. Again, these cells do not reveal sub-threshold haloes,
because the sets of contained EDs are not well tessellated.

The variable sized grids would therefore seem to o(cid:128) er a very suitable alternative
geography which could be supplied alongside the standard ED geography. A greater
understanding of the uses to which grid based geographies are put is required in
order to assess whether such a grid would prove useful.

4.7. Conclusions f rom the experiments

The results of the experiments carried out to date have an interesting outcome.
They suggest that the dangers posed by di(cid:128) erencing are not as large as have been
suggested in the past. In virtually all of our comparisons, the risks that di(cid:128) erenced
areas with person or household numbers below the con® dentiality threshold were
either absent or extremely small ( less than half of 1%). The only signi® cant exception
is the production of regular grid statistics for meshes of 1 km or less. We would
argue that these experiments show that, with the addition of another protection
device such as the perturbation of cell counts, it is safe to produce small area statistics
for both an ED or OA level geography and a larger geography such as postal sectors.
It is, however di(cid:129) cult to generalize about the characteristics of the pairs of areas
that are safe, and those of pairs of areas which are unsafe. Our experiments have
examples of small areas paired with large areas that are unsafe ( EDs versus 1 km
grid squares) and examples of small areas paired with small areas that are safe ( EDs
versus threshold tested variable sized grid squares). Therefore it is necessary to
process new geography proposals through a thresholding checking system such as
SDCTOOL.

Further experiments are needed, however, to cover the full range of multiple
standard geographies. In particular, we were unable to compare 1981 and 1991
geographies at ED scale because no national boundary set is available for 1981 in
England and Wales, though experiments might well be possible for a Scottish region.
It would also be important to compare 1991 EDs and proposals for 2001 Output
Areas based on unit postcodes (see Rees 1997 and Martin 1997). Both of these cases
involve comparisons of small areas with rather similar sizes and boundary
characteristics.

The experimental system can also be used to assess the safety of releasing small
area statistics for other geographies in comparison with the standard geography. To
test proposals for smaller geographies based on the unit postcode as building brick
would be possible if a unit postcode reference were added to the synthetic population
(e.g. through assigning households to their nearest postcode centroid ). The experi-
mental system can be transferred to a National Statistical O(cid:129) ce computing environ-
ment, with suitable modi® cation of the data contained therein and could be used as
a device to test user requests for ¯ exible geographies in the broadest sense. The

National Statistics ( UK) to e(cid:128) ect this transfer.

5. Recommendations about safe publication strategies

The following recommendations can be made on the basis of the research and
discussions described in this paper. In some cases the recommendations are ® rmly
based on our experimental evidence. In other cases they are inferred from the results
of our experiments and need to be con® rmed by further work. The recommendations
are placed within a wider debate about the nature of census output geography
( Rees 1997, Martin 1997 ). The recommendations are addressed to National Statis-
tical O(cid:129) ces carrying out censuses. All of the recommendations build on the
valuable experience and work of the UK Census O(cid:129) ces over the past three decennial
censuses.

1. Publish small area statistics from the decennial census as a solution to the
general problem of geographical table di(cid:128) erencing. There is a substantial
demand from government, business, national services and the research sector
for geographical tables that can analysed by the user. Delivering safe small
area statistics is a more cost e(cid:128) ective strategy for meeting user needs than a
bespoke tabulation service.

2. Choose a strategy for making geographical tables safe. This strategy should
include minimum thresholds for tables of given detail. Such a protection device
is easily explained to the public and politicians and contributes to con® dence
that output statistics will not pose a risk to the con® dentiality of information
about individuals. It is probably useful to add further protection to the tables
through mild perturbation at the cell count or record level. Such mild perturba-
tion means that it is possible to take small risks in publishing more than one
set of small area statistics (a belts and braces approach).

3. Make the primary geography chosen as generally usef ul as possible. In countries
where detailed postcodes are available output areas should be built from the
smallest postcodes available. The reason is that a large number of other data
bases that need to be linked to census data are themselves postcode referenced.
If an alternative, more detailed address base with attached geocode ( grid
reference) is available, then that should be employed in preference to postcodes.
If a postcode based geography is used, then slight approximation in the
production of small area statistics for administrative areas may result.

4. It is safe to publish exact aggregations for administrativ e areas alongside postal
geography . Our experiments comparing very small areas that ® t exactly into
administrative zones with larger postal zones indicated that the risk of inad-
vertently producing sub-threshold areas was negligible. This strongly suggests
that the reverse situation of having very small areas built from postcodes
together with exact statistics for administrative areas would also pose
negligible risks.

5. It is also safe to produce additional small area statistics for large mesh grid cells
( 5 km or more), but not grid meshes of 1 km or below. However, it is safe to
produce variable grid small area statistics, which allow users to estimate
populations on a regular grid basis if needed.

6. It is probably unsafe to produce a secondary set of small area statistics for
another very small geography that is relatively close to the chosen primary
geography . This applies to the publication of current census statistics for past
or future small areas.

7. However, it is vital to produce the means for users to make estimates of the small
area statistics for geographical areas in past censuses and for the postal and
administrativ e geographies which will always change between censuses. To pro-
vide this capability NSOs should work to a systematic plan for the production
of look up tables that link the primary geography of the current census to past
censuses and to future postal and administrative geographies. Protection
against disclosure is a(cid:128) orded by the approximation of aggregation using look
up tables.

8. T hese look up tables are best developed using a geocoded address base of the
current census. Membership counts (of persons, households or subsets of the
population) can then be easily derived using point-in-polygon routines and
the digital boundaries of the new areas. Most geographical information system
packages supply such routines though sometimes these are slow. The research
reported in this paper has developed a stand alone point-in-polygon routine
which works with a digital boundary coverage much faster to carry out this
task. If a geocoded address base cannot be used, then the postcode system
and postcode boundaries can be used to generate look up tables.

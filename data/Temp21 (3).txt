MOVEMENTS OF THE 
QUEBEC BRIDGE’S SUSPENDED SPAN 
MEASURED BY GNSS TECHNOLOGY

The Quebec Bridge was completed in 1917 and it is still the longest cantilever bridge in the world. Overall, the actual
movements of its suspended span, as detected by GNSS (between 2012 and 2013), are in fair agreement with the original
design calculations: for the train loading effect on the vertical movement (17 cm for one freight train); the transversal wind
load effect on the transversal movement (32 cm for a wind speed of 170 km/h); and the temperature loading effect on the
ver ti cal movement of the suspended span (3.2 cm for a 50°C temperature variation). Further movements have been detected
by GNSS technology, namely: the transversal and longitudinal movements of the suspended bridge span due to train passages
(11 cm  transversally,  at  the  top  of  the  suspended  span,  and  1 cm  longitudinally);  the  transversal  movement  of  the  bridge
caused by solar radiation (differential) conditions on both sides of the bridge (5 cm for high solar radiation values); and the
longitudinal movement of the suspended span of the Quebec Bridge at temperatures lower than 6°C (7 cm to −25°C). 

La construction du pont de Québec a été achevée en 1917 et il est toujours le plus long pont cantilever au monde. Dans
l'ensemble, les mouvements actuels de sa travée suspendue détectés par GNSS (entre 2012 et 2013) correspondent bien avec
les  calculs  d'origine  :  pour  l'effet  de  charge  des  trains  sur  le  mouvement  vertical  (17 cm  pour  un  train  de  fret);  l'effet  de
charge du vent transversal sur le mouvement transversal (32 cm pour une vitesse de vent de 170 km/h); et l'effet de charge
de la tem pérature sur le mouvement vertical de la travée suspendue (3,2 cm pour une variation de température de 50°C).
D'autres mouvements ont été détectés par la technologie GNSS, à savoir : les mouvements transversaux et longitudinaux de
la travée suspendue du pont en raison du passage de trains (11 cm transversalement, au sommet de la travée suspendue et
1 cm  lon gi tudinalement);  le  déplacement  transversal  du  pont  provoqué  par  les  conditions  du  rayonnement  solaire
(dif féren tiel) sur les deux côtés du pont (5 cm pour les valeurs élevées de rayonnement solaire); et le déplacement longitudinal
de la travée suspendue à une température inférieure à 6°C (7 cm à −25°C).

Introduction

The  origin  of  this  project  was  to
bet ter  establish  the  actual  clearance  of
the  Quebec  Bridge,  which  crosses  the
St.  Lawrence  River  near  Quebec  City,
and  to  potentially  increase  the  number
of tall ships that can securely pass under
the  bridge  and  reach  the  Port  of
Montreal. For this purpose, the Montreal
Port  Authority  installed  a  radar  instru-
ment under the structure of the Quebec
Bridge  to  monitor  the  St.  Lawrence
River water level. This project was done
in  collaboration  with  the  Canadian
Coast  Guard  (CCG)  and the  Canadian
Hydrographic  Service  (CHS),  with  the
agreement  of  the  Canadian  National
(CN)  Railway  Company,  the  owner  of

the Quebec Bridge. Furthermore, in order
to take into account the movement of the
installed radar, a GNSS antenna (Global
Navigation  Satellite  Systems  including
the  American  GPS  and  the  Russian
GLONASS  systems)  connected  to  a
GNSS  receiver,  was  installed  on  top  of
the central suspended span of the bridge
34 m above the radar. 

Although  the  original  goal  of  the
experiment was not dedicated to moni-
toring  the  3D  deformation  of  the
Quebec  Bridge,  we  asked  to  have
access  to  the  GNSS  data  collected  on
top  of  the  Quebec  Bridge’s  suspended
span for analysis. This was an opportu-
ni ty to monitor one of the most famous
engineering  structures  in  Canada  built
a century ago. 

This paper contains the analysis of
the  3D  deformation  of  the  Quebec
Bridge’s  suspended  span  as  measured
by  GNSS  technology  as  functions  of
train  and  wind  loads,  along  with  the
effects  of  temperature,  including  solar
radiation.  The  next  sections  present  a
short description and the history of the
Quebec  Bridge  and  the  equipment  and
data used to perform this analysis. 

The Quebec Bridge

The Quebec Bridge (46° 45’ N, 71°
17’ W)  is  the  first  bridge  over  the
St.  Lawrence  River  encountered  by
ships travelling upstream from the Gulf
of St. Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean.

upstream  from  Quebec  City  and  about
250 km  downstream  from  Montreal  in
Quebec, Canada. 

As  indicated  on  the  actual  chart  of
CHS, the clearance of the Quebec Bridge
with  respect  to  the  High  Water,  Large
Tide  (HWLT)  is  46  m.  In  Quebec  City,
the tide can reach up to 5–6 m depending
on the time of the year. In fact, there are
some  ships  that  can  pass  under  the
Quebec  Bridge  only  when  the  tide  is
falling.  This  shows  the  importance  of
establishing the actual (and the predicted)
bridge  clearance  along  with the  tide
level measured by nearby tide gauges. 

The  technical  specifications  of  the
bridge are given in Table 1, as extracted
from  the  original  documentation  given
in  the  Imperial  (British)  units  [DRC
1908a,b].  The  metric  equivalents  are
also  given  in  this  table.  Figure  1  dis-
plays pictures of the Quebec cantilever
bridge taken in summer and winter sea-
sons.  The  GNSS  antenna  location,  on
top of the suspended span, is indicated
by the red arrow.

To  give  a  short  history,  it  is  worth
mentioning  that  the  central  suspended
span was successfully lifted and installed
on September 20, 1917 (the first attempt
failed on September 11, 1916). It is also

interesting  to  note  that  the  ends  of  the
cantilever  arms  dropped  by  19.4  cm
(7 5/8 in) once the suspended span was
lifted. The first transit of a train over the
bridge  occurred  on  October  17,  1917,
and  it  was  officially  inaugurated  on
August 22, 1919. Let us also remember
that the southern part of the first Quebec
Bridge,  under  construction,  collapsed
on August 1907 because of a structural
design problem. 

The  Quebec  Bridge  is  still  the
longest  cantilever  bridge  in  the  world
and  it  was  the  longest  bridge  (of  all
types)  between  1917  and  1929.  It  was
recorded as a Canadian national historic
site  in  1996  by  the  Government  of
Canada  and  it  was  recognised  as  an
international  historic  civil  engineering
landmark  in  1987  by  the  American
Society  of  Civil  Engineers  and  the
Canadian Society for Civil Engineering. 
In 1917, the bridge had two railways
and  two  sidewalks.  A  car  lane  was
added  between  the  two  railways  in
1929. Later on in 1948, one of the rail-
ways (to the downstream side) and one
of the sidewalks (to the upstream side)
were  removed,  and  the  second  railway
was  slightly  shifted  (to  the  upstream
side) in order to widen the car lane.

Currently,  three  traffic  lanes  for
cars are present: two lanes in the north
direction  and  one  lane  in  the  south
direction in the morning, and vice versa
in  the  evening.  The  central  car  lane  is

weekends.  Every  week  day  (but  less
often  during  the  weekend),  around
35 000  cars  (500  cars  per  15  minutes
during  rush  hours),  4  freight  trains
(with about 30 wagons) and 8 passen-
ger trains transit the bridge (there is no
passenger  train  service  between  10
p.m. and 5 a.m.). The maximum train
speed is regulated to 64 km/h and the
maximum  car  speed  is  limited  to
70 km/h.  Since  1991,  the  transit  of
large  trucks  has  been  forbidden.
Figure 2 (left) also depicts the view of
the train track, the three car lanes and
the  sidewalk  as  seen  from  the  GNSS
antenna location.

GNSS Equipment and
the Auxiliary Data

A  chokering  (Antcom)  antenna
(see Figure 2, left) connected to a multi-
frequency  geodetic  Ashtech  (Proflex
500) GNSS (GPS-GLONASS) receiver
was installed on top of the central sus-
pended  span  of  the  bridge  on  the
upstream side (the side of the railway).
The  data  set  was  available  from  the
beginning of July 2012 up to mid-July
2013, with observations recorded at 1 s

intervals.  Altogether,  almost  18  mil lion
observation  epochs  were  recorded  and
processed for a total of 140 GB of GNSS
data  (including  the  GNSS  reference  sta-
tion files) in the ASCII RINEX format.

The  distance  between  the  Quebec
Bridge and the nearest permanent GNSS
reference  station  (QBC2)  was  about
7 km  with  a  height  difference  of  about
70 m.  This  might  be  a  proper  setup  for
the  original  objective  of  the  project,
which was to measure (at an accuracy of
0.1 m) the bridge clearance for safe ship
navigation,  but  this  is  not  optimal  for
bridge  deformation  monitoring  because
of the long distance and large height dif-
ference between these two GNSS anten-
nas.  Even  though  it  would  have  been
preferable to have a closer GNSS refer-
ence  station  to  mitigate  GNSS  errors
(especially the tropospheric error which
mainly  affects  GNSS  height  determina-
tion), one can expect that for a short period
of time (such as a train passage of a few
minutes)  the  tropospheric  modelling
error  will  stay  almost  constant  and  will
not significantly deteriorate the detection
of the vertical displacement of the GNSS
antenna located on the top of the bridge’s
suspended  span.  Let’s  also  recall  that
tropospheric  delay  mismodelling  has
almost no effect on the horizontal GNSS
coordinates [Santerre 1991].

The 

reference 

station  was
equipped with a multi-frequency GNSS
Trimble NetR5 receiver and a geodetic
Trimble  Zephyr  antenna.  The  GPS-
GLONASS  ambiguity  fixed  ionos-
pher ic free (L1 and L2) solutions with a
10°  elevation  mask  angles  were
pro duced  using  the  Trimble  Business
Center (TBC) post-processing software
[Trimble 2012]. 

Due to the large amount of GNSS
data,  the  TBC  software  was  used  for
several  features:  efficient  data  screen-
ing,  reliable  ambiguity-fixing  algo-
rithms,  automated  cycle-slip  detec tion
and  correction  engine,  and  its  user-
friendly interface. The observation files
in  the  RINEX format  were  processed
in  the  kinematic  mode.  Therefore  a
new  set  of  3D  coordinates  was  esti-
mated  at  every  epoch.  Altogether,  it
took 15 days to post-process this vol-
ume  of  GNSS  data  (140 GB)  on  10
personal computers. All the results are
reported in Smadi [2015].

The  instantaneously  estimated
precision (epoch by epoch) of the hor-
izontal components at 95% probability
level was typically 1.5–2.5 cm for the
horizontal  and  vertical  components,
respectively [Smadi 2015]. Let us keep
in  mind  that  the  precision  of  the  dis-
placement (the coordinate variation in

short  time  duration  where  the  GNSS
errors  are  highly  correlated.  From  the
analysis of this large GNSS data set, a
realistic precision of 5 and 8 mm for the
horizontal  and  vertical  displacements,
respectively,  can  be  stated.  Moreover,
the  moving  average  filtering  helps  to
significantly reduce the noise associat ed
with the GNSS observations, as will be
shown in the next sections.

Several  auxiliary  data  sensors
were  available,  such  as  an  ultrasonic
anemometer (Young Model 81000), to
collect wind velocity in N-S, E-W and
U-D directions, averaged every 10 min
along  with  the  air  temperature.  This
anemometer is located on top of a light
pole just south of the north tower on the
upstream side of the Pierre-Laporte sus-
pension bridge, which is located 200 m
upstream  of  the  Quebec  Bridge  (see

Quebec Bridge. The solar radiation val-
ues  were  recorded  by  the  MeteoLaval
station  located  about  4 km  from  the
Quebec Bridge. The traffic loops operat-
ed  by  Quebec  Department  of
Transportation  (MTQ)  were  used  to
provide the total number of cars for the
15 min intervals. The arrival and depar-
ture  times  of  passengers  and  freight
trains were provided by the CN Railway
Company for the two nearby train sta-
tions,  namely  Ste-Foy  and  Charny,
respectively.  These  are  located  1.5 km
north and 4 km south from the center of

the  Quebec  Bridge.  Table  2 shows  the
summary  of  the  auxiliary  sensor  values
during the observation period.

A  Miros  microwave  radar  remote
sensor  for  the  ocean  surface  radar,
model SM-094, was used to measure the
clearance (instantaneous vertical distance
at 1 s intervals) between the bottom of the
suspended span of the Quebec Bridge and
the water level of the St. Lawrence River
(Figure 2, right). According to the manu-
facturer,  the  accuracy  of  an  individual
measurement  is  1 cm.  As  one  will  see
later,  the  measurements  not  only  contain
information about tides, but they are also
affected by waves. During the winter sea-
son, the radar pulses bounce back from ice
blocks that are floating on the river. Thus
the radar data obtained in this season were
not used for the analysis.

The variations in the coordinates of
the antenna are with respect to the aver-
age 3D coordinate values obtained from
a 24 h static solution for the day March 3,
2013. This day was selected because the
average  air  temperature  value  was  close
to zero (0.7°C) and the wind velocity was
as low as 4 km/h in the transversal direc-
tion.  The  results  presented  in  the  next
sections are, in fact, the coordinate varia-
tions  (displacement)  of 
the  GNSS
anten na (located on top center of the sus-
pended  span)  expressed  in  the  bridge
local reference frame (L, T, V), where the
longitudinal (L) component has a positive
value  toward  the  river’s  north  shore
direction,  the  transversal  (T)  component
has  a  positive  value  toward  the  river’s

To  analyse  the  Quebec  Bridge
deformations, let us remember that the
GPS system has been used for decades
for  deformation  monitoring  of  large
engineering  structures  such  as  bridges
[Hyzak  et  al. 1995;  Xu  et  al. 2010].

Figure  3  (top)  shows  typical
effects  of  freight  train  transits  on  the
vertical (V, green lines) and transversal
(T, blue lines) components as detected
by the GNSS receiver every second for
a  period  of  6 min.  Radar  measure-
ments  (vertical  distances  at  every  s)
are  represented  by  dark  lines  and  are
intentionally shift ed by 5 cm to avoid
masking  the  two  other  lines.  In  fact,
the  radar  values  are  the  measurement
residuals  after  the  main  tidal  con-
stituents  have  been  removed  (by  the
CHS).  Remember  that  the  tide  height
can  reach  5–6 m  in  Quebec  City. The
superimposed  lines  are  the  results  of
applying a 10 s window moving aver-

GNSS antenna coordinates.

that 

One can notice that the less noisy
GNSS  antenna  coordinate  variations
are related to the transversal compo-
nents  and  the  vertical  coordinate
vari a tions are noisier. This is because
GNSS  (GPS)  is  less  precise  in  the
ver tical  direction  [Santerre 1991]
and 
the  bridge  movements
induced  by  car  and  train  transits  are
mainly  in  the  vertical  direction.
Transversal  values  were  not  always
centered  at  zero  because  when  the
wind  blows  transversally,  the  sus-
pend ed span moves in the transversal
direction. The effect of the wind load
is discussed later.

The  shape  and  the  size  of  the
detected movements  certainly  depend

on the weight and the length of the train.
The  duration  of  the  transit  probably
depends  also  on  the  speed  of  the  train.
Unfortunately,  no  such  information  was
available from the CN train file provided
to  us.  For  the  freight  train  transits,  the
largest  subsidence  value  reached  17 cm
and  the  maximum  transit  duration  was
3 min.  The  asymmetric  shape  of  the
graphs is attributed to change in the train
speed or different weights of wagons. This
asymmetric shape happens more often for
freight trains going toward the north direc-
tion probably because they have to reduce
their  speed  to  enter  the  curve  travelling
westward  before  approaching  the  near by
Ste-Foy train station. 

The vertical variations of the GNSS
antenna were in fair agreement with the
calculated values [DRC 1908a,b], which
state  that  the  deflection  at  middle  of
channel  (suspended)  span  caused  by  a

pounds  or  27 273 kg),  followed  by
5000  pounds/linear  foot  (7456 kg/m)
on  each  track,  should  be  33.7 cm
(13.25 in). As mentioned before, there
is currently only one railway track and
the bridge was originally designed with
two railway tracks.

The  transversal  displacement  of
the  antenna  can  be  explained  by  a
lever arm (tilt) effect. Remember that
the train track and the GNSS antenna
were  located  on  the  upstream  side  of
the bridge (not in the middle point of
the  transversal  section  of  the  bridge,
which  is  31 m  wide),  and  the  GNSS
antenna  is  about  34 m  above  the  rail-
way.  The  ratio  of  the  peak  values
between the transversal and the vertical
displacement  (T/V)  is  0.66  ±0.08  (for
all  types  of  freight  or  passenger  train).

displacement  was  about  11 cm.  This
means that the train load seems also to
produce  a  tilt  effect  on  the  suspended
span along with a sub si dence effect. The
transversal movement correlates perfectly
with  the  vertical  displacement.  In  this
con figuration, it is even easier to detect
train transit with the transversal GNSS
component  because  it  has  a  greater
pre ci sion than the vertical component.
Figure  3  (bottom)  shows  typical
effect  of  passenger  train  transits. The
passenger  trains,  which  are  typically
smaller and travel at higher speed than
freight  trains,  produce  smaller  peaks.
The maximum measured vertical sub-
sidence value was about 2.5 cm, while
the  min i mum  subsidence  was  as  low
as 1.0 cm. The longest duration of the
load effect of the passenger trains was

about 1 min. For comparison, the weight
by unit of length of a passenger wagon is
less than 2500 kg/m vs about 6000 kg/m
for a tank wagon.

The  vertical  coordinate  variations
of the GNSS antenna caused by the car
load were not visually perceptible even
during traffic rush hours. In fact, the car
load  is  considerably  smaller  than  the
train  load  (for  comparison,  the  weight
by  unit  of  length  of  a  car  is  less  than
400 kg/m ver sus about 6000 kg/m for a
tank  wagon).  To  confirm  the  visual
inspection, FFT analysis was per formed
during  the  night  (0:00–1:15  a.m.,  with
an average of 300 passing cars), during
the morning rush hour (6:45–8:00 a.m.,
with  up  to  6000  passing  cars)  and
dur ing the evening rush hour (4:00–5:15
p.m.  with  up  to  6000  passing  cars).  In
fact,  no  significant  difference  in  FFT

amplitude  or  period  values  between
the  night  period  (with  the  low est
number  of  car  transits)  and  the  two
rush hours was noticed. 

Longitudinal
Displacements

The  train  load  effect  on  the
lon gi tudinal  coordinate  variation  of
the  antenna  (located  at  the  middle  of
the suspended span) was also investi-
gated. Figure 4 presents graphs where
longitudinal  displacement  of 
the
GNSS  antenna  (maximum  value  of
1 cm)  due  to  freight  trains  has  been
noted.  The  longitudinal  coordinate

the  transversal  peak  value  is  positive
(displacement  in  northward  direction)
for the northbound trains and negative
(displacement in southward direction)
for  the  southbound  trains.  This  rela-
tively  small  coordinate  variation
demonstrates  the  great  capability  of
GNSS  results  to  monitor  engineering
infrastructures.  This  behaviour  might
be  explained  by  the  kinetic  energy
transferring  from  the  train  to  the  sus-
pended  span.  In  fact,  the  suspended
span  is  hinged  on  by  the  cantilever
arms  and  the  suspended  span  move-
ment  is  also  attenuated  by  shock
absorbers  (traction  brakes)  installed
between  the  cantilever  arms  and  the
suspended span.

Xia  et  al.  [2000]  reported  train
load effects on a suspension bridge as
measured by GPS receivers. They also
pre sented a suspension bridge dynamic

to 

explain 

this
response  model 
phe nom e non.  However, 
this  model
would have to be adapted for a structure
such as the cantilever Quebec Bridge.

Movement Analysis
Caused by Wind Load

Transversal Displacements

Figure  5  presents  examples  for  six
windy  days,  showing  the  transversal
coordinate variations (blue line in cm) of
the  GNSS  antenna  atop  the  suspended
span at 10 min intervals, filtered using a
10 min  moving  average  and  the  aver-
aged transversal wind speed as recorded
by the anemometer every 10 min (green
line in km/h). In order to distinguish and
study just the effect of the wind loading,
the days with high solar radiation (from
500  up  to  1400  W/m2)  were  discarded
and  the  periods  of  train  transits  were
removed.  The  impact  of  solar  radiation
will  be  dis cussed  in  the  next  sec tion.
Furthermore, to have a minimal number

of  values  for  the  cal culation  of  the
daily  cross  correlation  value  (also
reported  on  the  lower  left  of  each
graph in Figure 5), only the days that
had  at  least  25%  of  common  epochs
between  GNSS  and  wind  data  values
were  retained.  Altogether,  54  days
meet  these  criteria  and  12  days  had
wind speed values larger than 60 km/h
(the  maximum  value  recorded  was
98 km/h). To better distinguish the two
time  series,  two  different  origins  for
the vertical axes have been selected. 

The  cross-correlation  coefficients
range  from  0.80  to  0.97,  as  indicated
in the lower left corner of the graphs.
This  indicates  that  the  bridge  reacts
quite instantaneously to the transversal
load.  The  high  correlation
wind 
between both time series is clearly vis-
ible  from the  graphs,  especially  when
the  wind  speed  is  high.  The  largest
reported winds were 98 km/h from the
west  (day:  13-01-31)  with  a  displace-
ment of 10 cm in the eastward direc tion
and almost 60 km/h from the east (day:
13-01-20) with a displacement of 6 cm
in the westward direction. The largest

trans versal  displacement  of  14 cm
during  that  day.  It  is  worth  mention-
ing  that  the  time  of  wind  zero  cross-
ings  (green  line)  coincides  with  the
transversal dis placement zero cross ings
(blue line).

To  see  the  complete  behavior  of
the  transversal wind  effect  on  the
trans versal coordinate variation, all the
data  sets  have  been  displayed  together
in Figure 6. The total number of values

(sampled every 10 min) was 7161. In this
graph,  the  transversal  displacements
associated with the east transversal wind
(in  green)  have  been  changed  of  sign.
The blue dots are associated with the west
winds.  Altogether,  there  were  10  days
where the west wind blew above 60 km/h
(up to 98 km/h) and two days with maxi-
mum  east  wind  at  60 km/h. The  best  fit
parabola (in magenta) has been estimated
by least-square and their coefficients and
their  precisions  are  reported  in  Table  3.
Using the parabola coefficient, the value
for a 170 km/h wind speed was extrapo-

lated  and  a  value  of  34.6 cm  was
obtained. The red parabo la was interpo-
lated  from  the  1908  pre diction  for  a
transversal  wind  speed  of  170 km/h
(see  below).  The  third  parabola  (in
brown)  was  obtained  from  the  best  fit
to the west wind speed only (for a total
of  2938  measurements). The  R2 value
of  0.79,  associat ed  with  the  parabola
fits, successfully passed the Fisher test.
It can be seen in Figure 6 that the
transversal  effect  of  the  wind  from
the  east  direction  (green  dots)  seems
to be greater than the east wind (blue

speed  measured  by  the  anemometer
located  on  the  Pierre-Laporte  bridge
might  be  attenuated  by  the  Quebec
Bridge itself and the small hill located
to  the  east  of  the  bridge.  In  fact,  the
average  of  the  highest  velocity  east
winds were blowing from a direction
with  an  azimuth  of  65°.  The  wind
from  this  direction  impacts  directly
the  sus pended  span  of  the  bridge
where  the  GNSS  antenna  is  located
and  must  pass  above  the  hill  and
across  the  Quebec  Bridge  structure
before reaching the anemometer. The
average azimuth of the strongest west
wind  was  255°.  From  this  direction,
the  wind  was  directly  measured

(without 
anemometer  and  the  wind  can  reach
the  Quebec  Bridge  suspend ed  span
with almost no obstruction, since the
wind  flow  can  pass  over  the  hollow
space of the suspension cables of the
Pierre-Laporte  bridge.  Direct  meas-
urements of the wind at the top of the
Quebec  Bridge  (especially  the  one
from  the  east  direction)  could  cer-
tain ly  improve  the  R2 value  of  the
best fit parabola reported in Table 3. 

by 

The  original  plan  of  the  Quebec
Bridge  [DRC  1908a,b]  provided  the
following  interpretative  remark:  the
maximum  lateral  deflection  at  middle
of the channel (suspended) span from
30 lb/ft2 of the wind load normal to the
bridge plus the wind load on a passing
train on the channel (suspended) span.
This  value  was  13.5 in  (34.3 cm).
According to Unsworth [2011], a wind
lateral  force  of  30 lb/ft2 is  applying  a
wind  pressure  corresponding  to  the
maximum  wind  speed  for  safe  opera-
tion  of  trains.  This  value  corresponds
to  a  wind  speed  of  about  170 km/h

(equal  to  47 m/s)  using  the  fol lowing
equation  and 
the  appropriate  unit
con ver sion: P = ½ ρ
air V2, where P is the
pressure  in  Pa  or  N/m2,  V  is  the  wind
speed in m/s, and ρ
air is the air den sity at
sea level, approximately 1.255 kg/m3.

For  numerical  comparison,  Table  4
presents  the  values  of  the  predicted  and
the  measured  transversal  displacements
(from  the  best-fit  parabola).  The  last
values were calculated with the best fit
parabola  given  above  and  the  first
val ues  (in  metres)  were  calculated
this  approximate  estimation:
with 
2,  where  the  coefficient  is
1.19 x 105 VT
derived  from  the  ratio  of  the  maximal
predicted  transversal  displacement  and
the  corre sponding  wind  speed  squared
(0.343 m / (170 km/h)2).

Overall, the differences between the
second  best  fit  parabola  (west  winds
only)  and  the  1908  prediction  were
smaller, as seen in Figure 6. This fact is
further  evidence  that  the  speed  of  the
recorded  by 
eastern  wind, 
the
anemometer  on 
the  Pierre-Laporte
sus pension  bridge,  was  attenuated  as
compared  with  the  eastern  wind  that
blew  at  the  location  of  the  Quebec
Bridge’s suspended span.

For comparison, let us note that for
the  nearby  Pierre-Laporte  suspension
bridge (1040 m in length), Santerre and
Lamoureux [1997]  reported  an  8 cm
transversal displacement at the center of
the suspension span provoked by a wind
speed  of  25 km/h  (7 m/s).  Wong [2004]
had  measured  a  lateral  displacement  of
46 cm  for  the  wind  speed  of  26 m/s
(95 km/h)  for  the  Tsing  Ma  bridge  (over
the  1377 m  suspended  span).  Wong also
reported that the wind tunnel test confirms
the  proportionality  with  the  wind  speed
squared. Nakamura [2000] report ed, for a
720 m  main  span  suspension  bridge,  a

transversal displacement of 20 cm for
a  wind  speed  of  up 
to  20 m/s
(72 km/h).  The  relationship  between
the  lateral  displacement  and  the  wind
speed squared was also reported in the
latter study. 

Vertical Displacements 

The  original  design  plan  of  the
[DRC 1908a,b]
Quebec  Bridge 
shows the predicted vertical displace-
ment  of  the  cantilever  arm  and  the
suspended  span  for  the  same  load
condition  as  described  in  the  previ-
ous sub-section. At the middle of the
suspended  span,  the  predicted  value
was  2.2 in  (5.6 cm)  for  a  transversal
wind  speed  of  170 km/h.  That  is  a
positive value (upward direction) for
the bridge windward side and a nega-
tive  value  (downward  direction)  for
the  leeward  side  of  the  bridge.  This
can  be  approximately  modelled  by
the  following  relation:  1.94 x 10-6
2,  where  the  coefficient  comes
VT
from the ratio of the maximal vertical
predicted displacement and the corre-
squared
sponding  wind 
speed 
(0.056 m / (170 km/h)2). 
a
For 
100 km/h and a 50 km/h wind speed,
the  vertical  displacements  would  be
1.9 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively.

The transversal wind speed must
be  strong  enough  to  be  detected  by
the  measured  GNSS  vertical  coordi-
nate  variations,  since  GNSS  is  less
pre cise  in  the  vertical  component
compared  with  the  horizontal  direc-
tion  [Santerre 1991].  In  fact,  for  the
day  with  the  highest  wind  speed
recorded  (100 km/h),  a  vertical  dis-
placement of 2.8 cm was measured by
the
GNSS,  a  value 
pre dict ed one of 1.9 cm.

Caused by
Temperature and
Solar Radiation

Table  5  (last  line)  shows  the
length  and  height  of  the    bridge  steel
variations (in inches) due to a temper-
ature variation of -30°F to 120°F (for a
total variation of 150°F, or 83.3°C) as
reported in DRC [1908a,b]. The value
of  the  steel  thermal  coefficient  was

assumed  to  be  0.000 006 1/°F.  This
cor responds  to  11.0 ppm/°C.  With  this
value,  the  displacements  in  mm  for  a
10°C  temperature  variation  have  been
calculated;  see  Table  5 (line  3).  The
dimensions given in line 2 of Table 5 are
also shown in Figure 1.

Vertical 
Displacements

The  first  effect  of  temperature
inves tigated was the vertical variation of
the GNSS antenna with respect to the air

temperature (Figure 7). Unfortunately,
no steel bridge temperature was avail-
able. In the time series, the train transit
effect, which can be as large as 15 cm
(see first section above), was removed
in  order  to  only  keep  the  effect  of
tem perature  on  the  vertical  coordinate
variations.  In  Figure  7,  the  pale  blue
dots represent the 10-min moving aver-
age vertical coordinate variations of the
GNSS  antenna;  the  dark  blue  dots  are
the  mean  values  for  a  complete  day
associated  with  their  corresponding
daily mean air temperature. In this time

ranged  from  –23.6°C 
to  25.9°C,
49.5°C temperature variation. 

In general and as expected, when
the  temperature  is  above  0°C,  the
ver tical  variation  is  positive  and  vice
versa. A linear regression was estimat-
ed (the purple line in Figure 7) using the
daily  values.  This  provided  a  corre-
sponding 
thermal  coefficient  of
9.3 ±1.5 ppm/°C (instead of the theoret-
ical  value  of  11.0 ppm/°C)  with  a  R2
value  of  0.50  (although  a  small  value,
the Fisher test was passed). The red line
in  Figure  7  represents  the  predicted
val ues calculated with the 11.0 ppm/°C
thermal  coefficient  using  the  total
height of the suspended span (69.5 m).
For  the  49.5°C  total  daily  temperature
variation during the year, the measured
vertical  variation  was  then  3.2 cm
ver sus  3.8 cm  for  the  predicted  value
(for a discrepancy of 6 mm). 

To  explain 

this  discrepancy
(6 mm),  one  might  suspect  remaining

errors  in  the  relative  wet  tropospheric
delay  model,  especially  during  summer
where  the  relative  humidity  (partial
water  vapor  pressure)  is  high  (in  com-
parison with the winter season), and this
effect is not totally cancelled in relative
(differential)  positioning,  especially
because  the  (closest)  GNSS  reference
station  was  located  7 km  away  with  a
height  difference  of  70 m  with  respect
to  the  Quebec  Bridge  GNSS  receiver.
Residual  tropospheric  errors  mainly
affect  the  GNSS  height  determination
[Santerre 1991].  Moreover,  no  steel
temperature  data  were  available,  as
pre viously noted. 

Longitudinal
Displacements

Since the GNSS receiver was located
at the middle of the suspended span, one
might  not  expect  any  variation  in  the
lon gitudinal coordinate. But some depar-
tures  were  noticed,  as  illustrated  in

toward 

Figure  8, representing  two  separate
weeks  during  the  sum mer  season
(bot tom)  and  the  win ter  season  (top).
During  the  summer,  the  longitudinal
variations  remained  very  close  to  0,
regardless  of  the  positive  temperature
value,  but  as  soon  as  the  temperature
dropped  below  0°C  (roughly)  during
winter, the variations became negative
(displacements 
the  south
shore).  This  is  an  indication  that  the
suspended  span  was  blocked  and
pulled by the south cantilever arm once
the (air) temperature was below about
0°C.  The  cross-cor re la t ion  values  at
zero  time  lag,  indicated  in  the  lower
left  corner  of  the  graphs,  were  indeed
very  large  (0.93)  for  the  weeks  with
negative  tem per a ture  and  smaller  for
positive  temperature  (as  low  as  0.36
during the week in summer). 

For  studying  this  phenomenon
fur ther,  a  graph  of  the  longitudinal
coordinate  variation  as  a  function  of
the  air  temperature  is  presented  in

Figure 8: Longitudinal variation and air temperature for one week in winter (top) and one week in summer (bottom).

daily mean values and the smalle dots
represent  the  10-min  moving  average
longitudinal  variation  of  the  GNSS
antenna.  This  figure  shows  that  the
longitudinal  displacement  occurred  at
6°C  instead  of  around  0°C.  Then  the
data time series were divided into two
parts:  below  (green  dots)  and  above
(blue dots) 6°C. The linear regressions
for both parts are also plotted in Figure
9 (solid lines).

By dividing the slope of the linear
regressions  by  the  length  of  the  can-
tilever arm plus half the length of the
suspended  span  (275 m),  a  thermal
dilatation  value  of  0.2 ± 0.2  ppm/°C
was  obtained  with  R2 value  of  only
0.01 when the temperature was above
6°C. In this case, there was no signifi-
cant  correlation  with  temperature  (as
indicated by the Fisher test). However,
when  the  air  temperature  was  below
6°C, the corresponding thermal dilata-
tion  was  8.3 ± 0.3 ppm/°C  with  R2

value of 0.92 (in this case, the Fisher test
was  passed  successfully).  With  respect
to  the  theoretical  thermal  coefficient  of
11.0  ppm/°C  and  for  a  temperature
of  –30°C  (from  6ºC  to  –24ºC),  one
should  obtain  a  transversal  variation
of  –9.0 cm  instead  of  –7.2 cm  (see
Figure 9). It seems some part of the lon-
gitudinal displacement was absorbed by
the  damping  mechanisms 
(shock
absorbers) and the supports between the
suspended span and the anchor arms. It
is  worth  recalling  that  the  tropospheric
error (mentioned in the previous section)
does not affect GNSS horizontal (longi-
tudinal and transversal) components.

Interesting  to  note  that  L’Hébreux
[2001] reported that eight pins used for
linking the suspended span and the can-
tilever  arms  were  replaced  in  1985
because  the  bridge  expansion  did  not
behave  adequately.  According  to  the
Canadian National’s engineers (personal
communication),  the  dampers  (shock
absorbers)  between  the  suspended  span

and  the  cantilever  arms  were  also
replaced  more  than  10  years  ago
(around 2005). From Figure 8 and 9, it
seems that an unusual displacement in
the  longitudinal  direction  of  the  sus-
pended span of the bridge still exists.

Transversal
Displacements 

Particularly during sunny summer
days,  an  important  transversal  varia-
tion in the GNSS antenna coordinates
was noticed. Some examples are given
in  Figure  10.  In  this  figure,  to  avoid
superposition of the different plots, the
range of the solar radiations (right side
scale) was set between 0 and 4 kW/m2
even  when  the  maximum  recorded
value was 1.4 kW/m2, and the temper-
ature  values  (brown  line),  to  be  read
with  the  left  scale,  have  to  be  multi-
plied by 3 to obtain the real air temper-
ature  in  °C.   The  time  is  indicated  in
hours  in  local  time  (LT),  that  is,

the  effect  of  solar  radiation,  only  the
days  with  low  transversal  wind  (less
than  30 km/h)  were  selected,  which
also  affects  transversal  coordinate
variations (see previous section). 

The 

transversal  displacements
could easily reach up to –5 cm before
noon and a bit less (about 3 cm) in the
afternoon during summer sunny days,
in which solar radiation values were as
high  as  1 kW/m2,  as  in  the  examples
presented in Figure 10. The rapid vari-
ation  in  the  solar  radiation  during  the
day  indicates  the  presence  of  clouds.
In  fact,  during  cloudy  days  the  trans-
versal  displacements  were  signifi-
cant ly reduced (and of course at night
there is no solar radiation). During the
winter  season,  the  sun’s  elevation
angle  is  always  low  (maximum  21°
during the winter solstice), and there-
fore  the  transversal  displacement  was
always close to 0. Indeed, the transver-
sal displacement due to solar radiation

is also related to the sun orientation with
respect  to  the  bridge  structure  (which
creates a temperature difference between
both sides of the bridge) and the thermal
inertia of steel.

Let  us  mention  that  solar  radiation
effects  have  been  reported  for  bridge
towers  and  telecommunication  towers.
For  example,  Schenewerk  et  al.  [2006]
have shown a tower lateral variation of
9 cm due to differential temperature for
the Sunshine Skyway bridge (with tow-
ers 132 m in height), located in Tampa
(Florida).  Breuer  et  al.  [2008]  studied
the  daily  and  seasonal  drift  of  the
Stuttgart TV Tower caused by the daily
solar radiation and air temperature vari-
ation.  During  a  sunny  day,  the  surface
of  the  tower  concrete  shaft  that  was
exposed  to  sunlight  was  subjected  to
the  thermal  expansion  provoked  by
non-symmetrical  warming.  The  side
exposed  to  the  sun  would  extend,  and
the  tower  and  its  top  would  incline
away from the sun. 

Summary,
Conclusions and
Recommendations

Table  6 compiles  the  movements
of  the  suspended  span  of  the  Quebec
Bridge measured by GNSS, as reported
in the previous sections, along with the
calculations (larger expected deforma-
tions)  made  by  the  Quebec  Bridge
engineers who designed it more than a
century ago.

The  freight  train  load  causes  the
centre  of  the  suspended  span  to  sub-
side  by  up  to  17 cm.  This  measured
value  is  in  fair  agreement  with  the
value assumed by engineers during the
design  and  the  construction  of  the
Quebec Bridge. The subsidence value
is smaller for passenger trains (ranging
between  1.0  and  2.5  cm).  The  train
transits  also  provoke  a  tilt  to  the  sus-
pended span since the railway is located
on the upstream side of the bridge. The

the  GNSS  receiver,  located  34 m
above the railway, was 11 cm. The lon-
gitudinal displacement (of about 1 cm)
of the suspended span was also detect ed
for  freight  train  transits,  but  not  for
passenger  trains.  Car  loading  effect
was not detected by the GNSS antenna
that  was  located  on  top  of  the
sus pend ed span of the Quebec Bridge. 
It  was  also  shown  that  the  center
of the suspended span reacts instanta-
neous ly  to  transversal  wind  load  and
the transversal displacement is propor-
tional  to  wind  speed  squared.  The
measured  values  can  reach  13 cm  for
wind speed of 100 km/h. The extrapo-
lated value fits very well with the pre-
dicted value made during the stage of
the bridge design. 

The  relationship  between  vertical
displacements  of  the  suspended  span
and the transversal wind speed has not
been  demonstrated.  To  detect  this
effect using the GNSS technique, the
authors recommend the installation of
a reference GNSS station closer to the
bridge and  another GNSS antenna on
the  other  side  of  the  suspended  span
of  the  Quebec  Bridge.  In  this  last
configuration,  for  such  a  short  base-
line  of  31 m  (equal  to  the  bridge
width),  GNSS  will  be  able  to  meas-
ure  the  inclination  of  the  suspended
span even if GNSS height accuracy is
less  than  the  horizontal  accuracy.
Another  possibility  is  to  install  digi-
tal inclinometers (tilt sensors) on the
suspended  span  at  the  top  and  at  the

deck level. Longitudinal wind load does
not  affect  the  suspended  span  of  the
Quebec Bridge. 

The  impact  of  the  temperature
vari a tion on the vertical movement of the
GNSS  antenna  located  at  the  centre  of
the suspended span of the Quebec Bridge
was measured at a slightly smaller value
(3.2 cm  versus  3.8 cm,  a  6-mm  discrep-
ancy)  compared  with  the  predicted  one.
One can suspect the GNSS height deter-
mination  to  be  affected  by  errors  in  the
wet delay modelling during the summer
time because the nearest GNSS reference
station is located 7 km away with a 70 m
height difference. A blockage of the sus-
pended  span  with  the  south  cantilever
arm was measured when the temperature
drops  below  6°C.  The  magnitude  of  this
longitudinal  displacement  reached  7 cm
for  a  temperature  variation  of  31°C.
Transversal  displacement  of  the  GNSS
antenna easily reached up to 5 cm because
of  the  high  solar  radiation  values  (up  to
1 kW/m2) during summer days. This phe-
nomenon can be explained by the differ-
ential temperature values between the two
sides of the Quebec Bridge.

For a complete geodetic deformation
monitoring  of  the  Quebec  Bridge,  the
addition of GNSS receivers on each side
of the suspended span and on top of the
main towers is recommend ed, along with
the installation of inclinometers. In order
to  improve  the  GNSS  determination,
especially in the vertical component, the
authors  suggest  installing  closer  refer-
ence GNSS stations. To study the natural
frequencies  of  the  bridge,  the  authors

suggest  recording  GNSS  data  with  a
higher data rate (some receiver models
can measure at a rate of 100 Hz). Since
GNSS signals are blocked by metallic
structures,  the  authors  also  recom-
mend complementing GNSS measure-
ments  with  other  sensors,  such  as
accelerometers and total station reflec-
tive prisms, installed at the deck level.
Finally,  an  anemometer  should  be
installed  directly  on  the  Quebec
Bridge to measure the real parameters
of  wind  (speed  and  direction)  acting
on the bridge as well as the installation
of steel temperature sensors at strategic
points of the bridge.

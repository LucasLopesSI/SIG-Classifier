Negative spatial autocorrelation refers to a geographic distribution of values, or a map
pattern, in which the neighbors of locations with large values have small values, the
neighbors of locations with intermediate values have intermediate values, and the
neighbors of locations with small values have large values. Little is known about negative
spatial autocorrelation and its consequences in statistical inference in general, and
regression-based inference in particular, with spatial researchers to date concentrating
mostly on understanding the much more frequently encountered case of positive spatial
autocorrelation. What are the spatial contexts within which negative spatial autocorrela-
tion should be readily found? What are its inferential consequences for regression
models? This paper presents selected empirical examples of negative spatial autocorrela-
tion, adding to the slowly growing literature about this phenomenon.

correlation; spatial interaction

Introduction: what is negative spatial autocorrelation?

Spatial autocorrelation – the tendency for nearby values on a map to be dependent – has been a
topic of interest in the geospatial sciences for a number of decades. Its treatment has followed
the usual evolutionary trajectory of measurement [e.g., the Moran coefficient1 (MC) and the
Geary ratio2 (GR)], then hypothesis testing (e.g., see Cliff and Ord 1981), and finally modeling
(e.g., spatial autoregressive and geostatistical semivariogram functions, and spatial filtering).
Positive spatial autocorrelation, or the tendency for similar values to cluster on a map, has
received most of the attention, largely because few empirical examples of negative spatial
autocorrelation, or the tendency for dissimilar values to cluster on a map, have been found.
This situation is typical of time series analyses, too, in which most serial correlation empirically
is found to be positive. Temporal autocorrelation exceptions include agricultural production
(e.g., the cob-web model), credit spread return series, and high frequency financial data. Spatial
autocorrelation exceptions include the regional Phillips curve reported by Anselin (1988), and
a relatively small number of intra-county population densities reported by Griffith et al. (2003).
This situation may well be exemplified by Wu et al.’s (1998) study of 361 agricultural plant
breeding field trials, in which only eight trials (i.e., 2.2%) displayed negative spatial

autocorrelation (the average value of the eight spatial autocorrelation parameters is -0.28).
Marilyn vos Savant, the popular columnist (Ask Marilyn), even introduced the general public
to the notion of negative spatial autocorrelation by claiming that AT&T long distance area
codes in the United States (US) are negatively spatially autocorrelated in order to minimize
local telephone dialing mistakes; unfortunately, a Moran scatter plot reveals that this is not the
case. One impediment to manifestations of simple negative spatial autocorrelation is that it
cannot occur in geographically continuous attribute variables unless they are aggregated, and
as such relates to discrete points or ecological/aggregated geographic data.3 Another is that it is
the only form of spatial autocorrelation that can materialize in auto-Poisson random variables
(Griffith and Haining 2006), limiting the usefulness of this model specification.

Negative spatial autocorrelation refers to a geographic distribution of values, or a map
pattern, in which the neighbors of locations with large values have small values (e.g., quadrant
IV in Figure 1, labeled HL), the neighbors of locations with intermediate values have
intermediate values [e.g., pairs of values near the (0,0) center location in Figure 1], and the
neighbors of locations with small values have large values (e.g., quadrant II in Figure 1, labeled
LH). A Moran scatter plot for this situation, constructed by graphing the pairs of z-scores
(zi, sum of surrounding zis), portrays a scatter of points that aligns along an axis sloping from
the upper left-hand to the lower right-hand quadrants of a graph [e.g., the negative spatial
autocorrelation component in Figure 1(b)]. Negative spatial autocorrelation naturally materi-
alizes with competitive locational processes, negative spatial externalities, the construction of
spatial correlograms, the spectrum (i.e., eigenvalues) of a geographic weights matrix, the
calculation of linear regression residuals, and the computation of LISA (local indicator of
spatial autocorrelation; see Anselin 1995) statistics. Negative spatial correlation in the
computation of LISAs was found empirically studying regional economic convergence
(e.g., Le Gallo and Ertur 2003, Feldkircher 2006) with regard to the European Union and by
Aroca et al. (2005) with regard to Mexican regions. It was observed empirically in the residuals
of spatial lag (SL) models (e.g., Bloningen et al. 2004) in a study of the spatial distribution of
foreign direct investment and by Mizobuchi and Kakamur (2007) when estimating a spatial
production function in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development coun-
tries. Substantive negative spatial autocorrelation is empirically uncovered by Montgomery
and Chazdon (2001) in lowland Costa Rican second-growth forest competition for light, by
Stirboeck (2003) in an index of investment specialization across Europe, and by Irwin and
Geoghegan (2001) in Patuxent watershed land parcel development. Gray and Shadbegian

(2004) detect weak negative spatial autocorrelation in 102 industrial plant emissions of sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen oxides across the medium-sized US cities of St. Louis, Cincinnati, and
Charlotte. Conley et al. (2003) observe it empirically in the spatial distribution of productivity
in Malaysia. Other examples can be found in the analysis of the spatial distribution of tax
bases in the municipalities of New Brunswick (Brett and Tardif 2006), in the allocation of
public goods in Indonesia (Yamauchi et al. 2007), and in the study of predator-prey interaction
dynamics in a bio-economic model (Herrera 2006). Brand and Bhatti (2006) find empirical
evidences of negative spatial correlation in a number of economic variables observed at the
NUTS2 level of Spain (e.g., per capita income, wages and salaries, investment, and employ-
ees) and interpret it as a symptom of microeconomic variable divergence in manufacturing
production and cost structure. Global negative spatial autocorrelation more commonly is
found when location pairs beyond immediate neighbors are used to construct a spatial
correlogram (e.g., for Lyme disease studied by Glavanakov et al. 2001). This situation is
consistent with the wave–hole semivariogram model specification, which resembles a second-
order temporal autoregressive structure having first-order positive and second-order negative
autocorrelation. Meanwhile, the extreme eigenfunction associated with the maximum nega-
tive spatial autocorrelation that is possible when employing a particular geographic weights
matrix is given by the smallest (i.e., most negative) eigenvalue and its corresponding
eigenvector. This property, first reported by de Jong et al. (1984) for the eigenvalues, was
exploited by Griffith (2004) to construct an algorithm that efficiently computes the minimum
eigenvalue of a sparse geographic weights matrix using only a neighbors file (i.e., without
having to construct the full n-by-n matrix).

Recently attempts have been made, especially in economics, to provide a theoretical
explanation for the presence of detected negative spatial dependencies in data. For instance,
Frank and Botolf (2007) speculate that the negative spatial correlation that is empirically found in
the German regional information and computer technology (ICT) distribution can be seen as a
manifestation of Myrdal’s backwash effect (Myrdal 1957), which produces uneven development.
The objective of this paper is to add to the slowly growing literature about negative
spatial autocorrelation by investigating empirical situations in which negative spatial auto-
correlation exists, sometimes being masked by positive spatial autocorrelation. Findings
presented here constitute the first attempt to extend conventional spatial autoregressive
models for a single map surface to capture a mixture of first-order positive and negative
spatial autocorrelation; Cliff and Ord (1975) furnish a similar specification but for two
distinct map surfaces. This work also builds upon and extends findings by Griffith (2006)
about hidden negative spatial autocorrelation. It constitutes a new computational procedure
in terms of both the autoregressive model specification and the spatial filter (SF) mixture
when global spatial autocorrelation measures suggest an absence of geographic dependency.

2. Model specifications
Two model specifications are employed in this study. A simultaneous autoregressive (SAR)
model specification is used to describe selected Gaussian random variables. A SF model
specification is used to describe both Gaussian and Poisson random variables. Of note is that
some comparisons between the SAR and SF specifications already appear in Getis and
Griffith (2002) and Griffith (2005a,b) but only for positive spatial autocorrelation cases.

2.1. The SAR model specification

Many spatial statistical/econometric descriptions of georeferenced data employ a spatial
autoregressive model that casts a response variable, Y, as a function of nearby Y values

420

D.A. Griffith and G. Arbia

[i.e., an autoregressive response (AR) or SL specification] and/or the residuals of Y as a
function of nearby Y residuals [i.e., an SAR or spatial error (SE) specification]. Nearbyness
often is defined in terms of an n-by-n geographic weights matrix, say C (bold denotes vector/
matrix notation), whose cij values are 1 if locations i and j are deemed nearby by a researcher,
and 0 otherwise. Adjusting this matrix by dividing each row entry by its row sum – with the
row sums given by C1, where 1 is an n-by-1 vector of ones – converts this matrix to matrix
W. Appealing features of matrix W include that it is a stochastic matrix, expresses each
observed value yi as a function of the average of location i’s nearby values, and allows a
single spatial autoregressive parameter, (cid:2), to have a maximum value of 1. The resulting SAR
model specification, with no covariates present (i.e., the pure spatial autoregression speci-
fication), takes on the following form:

Y ¼ (cid:3) 1 (cid:2) (cid:2)
ð

Þ1 þ (cid:2)WY þ e

where (cid:3) is the scalar conditional mean of Y, and e is an n-by-1 error vector whose elements
are statistically independent and identically distributed (iid) normally random variates.

n-by-n identity matrix, ¢ denotes the matrix transpose operation, and (cid:4)2 is the error variance.
However, when a mixture of positive and negative spatial autocorrelation is present in
georeferenced data, a more explicit representation of both effects leads to a more accurate
interpretation of empirical results. Consequently, two different spatial autoregressive para-
meters must appear in the spatial covariance matrix specification, which for an SAR model
specification becomes

where the diagonal matrix of autoregressive parameters, rh idiag, contains two parameters: (cid:2)+
for those observation pairs displaying positive spatial dependency, and (cid:2)- for those observa-
tion pairs displaying negative spatial dependency. For example, letting (cid:4)2 = 1 and employing
a 2-by-2 regular square tessellation, the right-hand covariance matrix entry is

If either (cid:2)+ = 0 (and hence I+ = 0 and I- = I) or (cid:2)- = 0 (and hence I- = 0 and I+ = I), then
Equation (3) reduces to Equation (1). This indicator variable’s classification can be made in
accordance with the quadrants of the corresponding Moran scatter plot (see Figure 1). If
positive and negative spatial autocorrelation processes counterbalance each other in a
mixture of this type, the sum of the two spatial autocorrelation parameters – (r+ +r-)
appearing in Equation (3) – tends to be close to 0. Because the Jacobian term is complicated
for this specification (i.e., the analytical eigenvalues of the product of a diagonal and a
weights matrix are unknown), in order to approximate SAR model parameter estimates, a
Jacobian estimation was implemented by utilizing the differenced indicator variables
(I+ - (cid:5)I-), estimating (cid:2)+ and (cid:5) with maximum likelihood techniques, and setting
^(cid:2)(cid:2) ¼ (cid:2)^(cid:5)^(cid:2)þ. A more complex specification can be posited by generalizing these binary
indicator variables to fuzzy ones.

2.2. The SF model specification

One of the difficulties associated with spatial statistics revolves around especially conceptual
complications introduced by the presence of nonzero spatial autocorrelation. Spatial filter-
ing, which offers one way of circumventing or effectively and efficiently handling this
problem, furnishes an approach that incorporates spatial structuring into an intercept term
that accounts for spatial autocorrelation (see Griffith 2003). This spatial structuring is
achieved by constructing a linear combination of a subset of the eigenvectors of a modified
geographic weights matrix, say (I - 11¢/n)C(I - 11¢/n) that appears in the numerator of the
MC (instead, the matrix forming the numerator of the GR could be used), which is a SF; the
subset of eigenvectors can be selected with a stepwise regression procedure. Because
(I – 11¢/n)C(I – 11¢/n) = ELE¢, where E is an n-by-n matrix of eigenvectors and L is an
n-by-n diagonal matrix of the corresponding eigenvalues, the resulting model specification
is given by

Y ¼ (cid:3)1 þ Ekb þ e

(4)

where (cid:3) is the scalar mean of Y, Ek is an n-by-k matrix containing the subset of k << n
eigenvectors selected with a stepwise regression technique, and b is a k-by-1 vector of
regression coefficients.

A number of the eigenvectors that can be extracted from (I - 11¢/n)C(I - 11¢/n) are
affiliated with geographic patterns portraying a negligible degree of spatial autocorrelation.
Consequently, only k of the n eigenvectors are of interest and form a candidate set for a
stepwise regression procedure. One way of constructing this candidate set is to include an
eigenvector in the set only when the vector’s corresponding MC represents a minimum

422

D.A. Griffith and G. Arbia

degree of spatial autocorrelation. One useful threshold here is |MC/MCmax| . 0.25 (where
MCmax is the maximum MC for a given surface partitioning), because then each candidate
eigenvector represents a level of spatial autocorrelation tending to account for at least 5% of
the redundant information in its map pattern. The absolute value restriction results in both
positive and negative spatial autocorrelation eigenvectors forming the candidate set.
Removing this restriction limits the set to those eigenvectors portraying only positive
spatial autocorrelation, whereas removing it and changing the inequality to <-0.25 limits
the set to those eigenvectors portraying only negative spatial autocorrelation. In general,
the candidate eigenvector set determined with an absolute value criterion tends to contain
no more than n/2 vectors. Next, these eigenvectors are further screened with a stepwise
regression procedure that, say, maximizes R2 in a linear regression problem, further
reducing the n original eigenvectors to the k vectors in Equation (4). In the presence of a
mixture of positive and negative spatial autocorrelation, this selection procedure automati-
cally chooses some eigenvectors with positive, and some eigenvectors with negative,
MC values.

The modified geographic weights matrix from which eigenfunctions are extracted for
this study appears in the numerator of the MC spatial autocorrelation test statistic. The
eigenvectors of this matrix exhibit the following property:

when mapped spatially, the first eigenvector, say E1, is the set of real numbers that has the largest
MC value achievable by any set of real numbers for the spatial arrangement defined by the
geographic connectivity matrix C; the second eigenvector is the set of real numbers that has
the largest achievable MC value by any set that is uncorrelated with E1; the third eigenvector is
the third such set of values; and so on through En, the set of real numbers that has the largest
negative MC value achievable by any set that is uncorrelated with the preceding (n - 1)
eigenvectors.

As such, these eigenvectors furnish distinct map pattern descriptions of latent spatial
autocorrelation in georeferenced variables, because they are mutually both orthogonal and
uncorrelated. Their corresponding eigenvalues index the nature and degree of spatial auto-
correlation portrayed by each eigenvector.

The preceding eigenvector properties result in ^(cid:3) ¼ (cid:2)y and ^b ¼ Ek¢Y for Equation (4).
More thorough discussions of spatial filtering that are relevant to this study appear in Griffith
(2000, 2002, 2003) and Tiefelsdorf and Griffith (2007). Expressing Equation (4) in terms of
the preceding 2-by-2 example yields

Of note is that because the 2-by-2 square tessellation renders a repeated eigenvalue (i.e., only
3 of the 4 values are distinct), an additional rotation needs to be used for this example.

3. Negative spatial autocorrelation from geographic competition for land surface

Consider a bounded surface that is partitioned into n areal units. Because the surface is
bounded, if the sizes of these areal units change, then units that increase in size must do so at
the expense of other units. This geographic context suggests that areal expansion of a given
unit results in size reductions of its neighboring units, creating geographic competition for
land surface. Many wars have been fought for this very reason. Furthermore, this type of
spatial competition, which involves an aggregated continuous variable, frequently is cited as
a conceptual example of negative spatial autocorrelation.

One real-world example relevant to geographic information science, which has received
little attention in the literature, concerns digitizing error and polygon areas. Again, if a
digitized line is inaccurate, then adjacent polygons will be gaining/loosing area. Van Oort
(2006, pp. 63–65) derives expressions quantifying this type of negative spatial autocorrela-
tion. This particular situation is complicated by the presence of digitizing error along the
regional boundary in question, which relaxes the total area constraint, as well as the small
amounts of area traded between adjacent polygons, which reduces the magnitude of detected
negative spatial autocorrelation.

3.1. The Puerto Rico surface partitioning

For illustrative purposes, consider the island of Puerto Rico (PR), which has been partitioned
sequentially over time into a finer and finer geographic resolution according to the location
of settlements (i.e., pueblos). Initially the island was a single unit with its settlement focus
being on San Juan. In the mid-1500s the island was partitioned into two areal units, with the
second settlement focus being on San German. By the 1990s the island had been partitioned
into 73 municipalities (i.e., municipios). If the boundaries of these municipalities represent
those locations on the island closest to each settlement (e.g., the core-periphery or urban-
hinterland concept), then the surface would be divided into Thiessen polygons. A map of
these municipalities and their corresponding Thiessen polygons, according to the existing
municipio centroids, and according to the settlement locations themselves, appear in
Figure 2. Moran scatter plots for the ratio of the actual municipio (numerator) and
Thiessen polygon (denominator) areas appear in Figure 3. The spatial autocorrelation
indices for these two scatter plots are as follows (zMC denotes the test statistic z-score for
the MC):

-0.14947
-1.9

1.07526

-0.26521
-3.4

1.19591

These statistics indicate that the detected negative spatial autocorrelation may be considered
to be statistically significant, based upon a randomization perspective. Of note is that
the ratio of the PRESS (i.e., predicted error sum of squares) statistic to the sum of squared
errors from the MC scatter plot trend line is, respectively, 1.05 and 1.06, which are
well within two standard deviations of the average standard prediction error value
(roughly 1.03) for a new observation. In other words, the portrayed trend lines furnish
valid descriptions of their respective Moran scatter plots. Meanwhile, if the administrative
and polygon areas were identical, then the administrative surface partitioning would be

optimal according to a nearest distance criterion. As such, it would be characterized by the
degenerate case of perfect positive spatial autocorrelation (i.e., a constant, namely 0, across
the geographic landscape). Because discrepancies exist between the two surface
partitionings, and the administrative surface can be transformed to the polygon surface
only through cannibalization of neighboring areal units, this example illustrates spatial
competition.

Treating these area ratios as normal random variables, Equation (4) SF descriptions of
these data (see Table 1) identify map patterns that account for roughly half of the variability
(i.e., the relative R2 values) in the area ratios, with the municipio-centroid-based SF having

polygons.

both a positive and a negative component. The negative spatial autocorrelation components
in both SFs account for roughly 40% of the variability in the area ratios. The positive spatial
autocorrelation component accounts for about 13% of the variability in the municipio-
centroid-based SF, counterbalancing some of the negative spatial autocorrelation effects,
and hence partially masking the presence of negative spatial autocorrelation here (the
MC = -0.40 for the negative spatial autocorrelation SF decreases to -0.19 for the
composite SF).
is to reduce the global zMC value, causing the
accompanying inference to become marginal (i.e., significant at the 90% but not at the
95% level).

Its global effect

A corroborating Equation (1) SAR description of the municipio-centroid-based area
ratio also contains both a positive and a negative spatial autocorrelation component, with the
pseudo-R2 increasing by nearly 40% when the SAR model changes from a one- to a two-
parameter specification (Table 1). The counterbalancing effect is small here, given that the
single-parameter estimate of ^(cid:2) = -0.4 is sizeable.

Figure 4 portrays the uncovered negative spatial autocorrelation SFs; the tendency for
high-low values to be neighbors on these maps is apparent by visual inspection. Each of
these constructed SF maps contains weak-to-moderate levels of negative spatial
autocorrelation (Table 1). These magnitudes are not surprising, given that the maximum
level of negative spatial autocorrelation for the island’s municipality surface partitioning is
-0.57 [i.e., the minimum eigenvalue of matrix (I - 11¢/73)C(I - 11¢/73) for this case].
Possible extreme negative spatial autocorrelation rarely is as far from 0 as is its
corresponding possible extreme positive spatial autocorrelation.

Because of the dearth of especially global negative spatial autocorrelation examples
reported in the literature, one of the useful findings here, at least for pedagogic purposes, is
that area ratio examples can be easily constructed that contain negative spatial

autocorrelation, supplementing most existing empirical georeferenced data examples, which
tend to display moderate positive spatial autocorrelation. Another insightful finding is that
when weak spatial autocorrelation is detected, its degree may well be attributable to the
presence of counterbalancing positive and negative spatial autocorrelation components.

3.2. Additional surface partitionings

Three additional irregular tessellations furnish corroborating evidence for the preceding PR
findings, again using ratios between observed areal unit and constructed Thiessen polygon
areas. The first two are based upon the 67 counties of Pennsylvania (PA), US; the third is
based upon the 87 enumeration districts of Glasgow, United Kingdom. Moran scatter plots
for the ratio of the actual areal unit (numerator) and Thiessen polygon (denominator) areas
appear in Figure 5. The spatial autocorrelation indices for these scatter plots are reported in
Table 1. These statistics indicate that the detected negative spatial autocorrelation is
significant for the Pennsylvania county centroids case (zMC = -2.4), but nonsignificant for
the Pennsylvania county seats and Glasgow cases (zMC = -1.6 and zMC = -1.3, respectively),
based upon a randomization perspective. One difference between these two surface
partitionings is a change in scale and resolution (i.e., Pennsylvania covers an area of

roughly 46,058, and Glasgow an area of roughly 142 square miles). Nevertheless, they both
display global negative spatial autocorrelation. Of note is that the ratio of the PRESS statistic
to the sum of squared errors from the MC regression is 1.07, 1.07, and 1.05, which are well
within two standard deviations of the average standard prediction error value (roughly 1.03)
for a new observation. In other words, the portrayed trend lines furnish valid descriptions of
their respective Moran scatter plots.

The decompositions reported in Table 1 reveal that both of these latter cases have a
prominent positive as well as a prominent negative spatial autocorrelation component. In
each case, the negative spatial autocorrelation SF is the dominant component, based upon the
SF model: PA county centroids (like the PR pueblo locations) have only a negative spatial
autocorrelation component; and, for PA county seat locations and Glasgow enumeration
district centroids (like the PR municipio centroids), roughly three-fourths of the variance
accounted for is attributable to the negative spatial autocorrelation SF component.

Corroborating SAR descriptions of the PA-county-seat- and Glasgow-enumeration-
district-centroids-based area ratios also contain both a positive and a negative spatial
autocorrelation component, with the pseudo-R2 values increasing by a factor of nearly 5
when the SAR models change from a one- to a two-parameter specification in both examples
(Table 1). The counterbalancing effect of positive spatial autocorrelation here is enough to
suppress the significance of global tests for negative spatial autocorrelation, as previously
shown for one of the PR examples.

4. Negative spatial autocorrelation from territorial competition within habitats
Although the preceding examples are somewhat contrived, they illustrate two important
contentions. First, negative spatial autocorrelation is associated with the competition for
limited land. And, second, negative spatial autocorrelation may go undetected mostly
because geographic situations in which it exists also contain counterbalancing positive
spatial autocorrelation. In the five specific area ratio cases evaluated, negative spatial
autocorrelation dominated; but in other situations it may simply be masked, with the net
result of a positive–negative mixture being that global tests for spatial autocorrelation imply
its absence. This contention may be exemplified by analyzing counts of Anopheles gambiae
s.l. mosquitoes across five selected urban areas in Kenya, namely Kangichiri, Karima,
Kisumu, Kiuria, and Malindi (these data were furnished by Dr B. Jacobs, University of
Alabama, Birmingham). Because counts are being analyzed, a Poisson SF model
specification is employed here (Griffith 2002). Detected overdispersion (i.e., extra-Poisson
variation) results in its mean being specified as gamma distributed. The model specification
may be written as follows:

LNðmÞ ¼ (cid:7)1 þ Ekb
(cid:4)2
i ¼ (cid:3)ið1 (cid:2) (cid:8)(cid:3)iÞ

(5)

where (cid:3)i is the expected mean count for location i, m is an n-by-1 vector of expected
mosquito counts, LN denotes the natural logarithm (i.e., the generalized linear model link
function), (cid:7) is an intercept term, and (cid:8) is the negative binomial dispersion parameter. This
log-linear equation has no error term; rather, estimation is executed assuming a negative
binomial random variable.

Global tests (all five |zMC|s are less than 1.13) for the presence of spatial autocorrelation
in all five urban areas imply its absence (Table 2). But estimation of Equation (5) reveals that

spatial autocorrelation accounts for sizeable amounts of geographic variation in mosquito
counts, each urban place having both a positive and a negative spatial autocorrelation SF that
are roughly of equal importance: approximately 50% of the variance accounted for (i.e., the
relative pseudo-R2 values) is attributable to each spatial autocorrelation SF component. This
finding is sensible because, on the one hand, common factors dictate which aquatic habitats
are suitable for this complex of mosquitoes, resulting in positive spatial autocorrelation in
the geographic distributions of their counts. On the other hand, competition for territory (as
illustrated in the preceding section) results in negative spatial autocorrelation in their
geographic distributions.
these two components tend to be of equal
importance in the overall spatial autocorrelation mixture, with one slightly dominating
sometimes and the other slightly dominating other times.

Interestingly,

5. Negative spatial autocorrelation from geographic competition for market areas
Ahn and Ter Hofstede (2006) present a spatial autoregressive analysis of cannibalism within
the multilocational Kroger and Safeway grocery stores in Atlanta, Georgia, US. Consider
the distribution of 130 Kroger stores4 and 40 Safeway stores; closest urban area locations
(using Euclidean distance) to each store in a given chain can be identified with a Thiessen
polygon partitioning of the surface (see Figure 6). One variable of interest that may be used

here to measure spatial market area competition is average weekly total volume of sales
(measured in units of 1000 US$, rounded off to the nearest 25, introducing unknown
measurement error effects); these data have been furnished by Trade Dimensions (http://
www.tradedimensions.com).

In both grocery store cases, the geographic distribution of weekly total volume of sales

across the Atlanta metropolitan region displays negative spatial autocorrelation:

Safeway

In both cases,
the detected level of negative spatial autocorrelation is statistically
nonsignificant; of note is that the autoregressive counterparts estimated by Ahn and Ter
Hofstede (2006) are statistically significant. Nevertheless, the geographic distributions of
both store chains display global negative spatial autocorrelation. One of the complicating
factors here is that only four levels of total volume (i.e., $100, $175, $225, and $400, in
1000s) are recorded for Safeway, causing the frequency distribution of its sales volume to
deviate markedly from a bell-shaped curve (no Box–Cox or Manly data transformation5
exists that can improve upon this situation).

Figure 7 portrays the corresponding surface partitionings obtained when Thiessen
polygons are constructed with weights that are proportional to the average weekly total
volume of sales. These maps show little change in the geographic structure of the surface
beyond edge effects.

The decompositions reported in Table 3 reveal that both of these cases have a mixture of
positive and negative spatial autocorrelation components that jointly account for a sizeable
amount of the geographic variation in weekly store sales volume. In each case, the negative
spatial autocorrelation SF is the dominant component, by a factor of about 2. As with the
preceding mosquitoes examples, this finding is sensible. On the one hand, common factors
dictate successful store locations and sales volume across an urban area, resulting in positive
spatial autocorrelation in the geographic distributions of their sales. On the other hand,

competition for market area (again, as illustrated in the discussion of area ratios) results in
negative spatial autocorrelation in within store chain geographic distributions.

Corroborating SAR descriptions also contain both a positive and a negative spatial
autocorrelation component, with the pseudo-R2 values increasing from near-zero to very
sizeable amounts when the SAR models change from a one- to a two-parameter specification
(Table 3). The counterbalancing effect here is enough to almost totally suppress detection of
negative spatial autocorrelation with global tests (i.e., as indicated by the preceding zMC
values, neither of the MC values is significantly different from that for zero spatial
autocorrelation).

6. Conclusions and implications
Negative spatial autocorrelation is encountered in empirical data less frequently than is
positive spatial autocorrelation. The reason for this omission includes, among other things,
the spatial scale of resolution chosen, the typical continuity in space and time of phenomena,
and the difficulties of finding a substantive generator mechanism of negative spatial
autocorrelation on the basis of theoretical models. Nevertheless, a series of circumstances
in empirical situations may lead to a spatial distribution of georeferenced point events or
ecological data that display negative autocorrelation, as is shown here.

In this paper, we present three sets of examples of negatively spatially autocorrelated
phenomena based on the geographic competition for land surface, for territory, and for
market area. Indeed, geographically competitive phenomena provide sound conceptual
examples of such a feature because the manifestation of a certain phenomenon in one area
is at the expense of its manifestation in its neighboring areas. One of the more important
findings gleaned from these analyses is that the existence of negative spatial autocorrelation
may be far more prevalent than is apparent from the current literature, largely because it
frequently occurs together with positive spatial autocorrelation, with a global net effect from
the mixture being insignificant global spatial autocorrelation test statistics. Another is that a
two-parameter SAR model specification, distinctly different from the biparametric one
proposed by, for example, Besag (1974) or Brandsma and Ketellapper (1979), should be
more fully developed for this purpose.

Apart from the case of residual spatial autocorrelation, understanding the presence of
negative spatial autocorrelation may be of interest for a series of other reasons. First, it is
associated with a loss of information connected with aggregation. When data are aggregated
from a finer to a coarser level of spatial resolution, a loss of information occurs that can be
represented by a decrease in the variance. However, loss of information from aggregation in
the presence of positive spatial autocorrelation tends not to be too severe because on average
locally aggregated values are similar (see Arbia 1989). In contrast, aggregation in the
presence of negative spatial autocorrelation can result in a dramatic loss of information,
reflecting a sharp decline in variance. This data feature is particularly relevant for the
mosquito examples presented here, which involve point sampling (i.e., very fine
geographic resolution). The effect of the presence of negative spatial correlation in space-
time series aggregation from finer to coarser regional levels has been analyzed recently by
Arbia et al. (2007).

A second important issue relates to the concept of the ‘effective degrees of freedom’
studied by Griffith (2005b), which is defined as the equivalent number of degrees of freedom
for iid observations. The effective degrees of freedom in the case of positive spatial
correlation between units are smaller than their iid degrees of freedom counterparts
because part of the information content of each spatial unit is duplicate information

International Journal of Geographical Information Science

435

contained in the neighboring units that display a similar value. An important consequence of
this double counting of
in the presence of negative spatial
autocorrelation, one should expect the effective degrees of freedom to be greater than their
iid degrees of freedom counterparts. This is exactly the finding of Richardson (1990).

information is that,

A similar outcome occurs in model-driven spatial sampling designs. For instance,
optimal sampling designs [like those proposed by Arbia and Switzer (1994) and Arbia and
Lafratta (1997, 2002] suggest a way to exploit the property of positive spatial autocorrelation
in order to reduce the number of sample units to be drawn at a certain level of required
precision (or, conversely, to improve precision with the same number of sample units).
However, again, an implication of the presence of negative spatial autocorrelation is that
more units are needed to achieve the same level of efficiency for estimates.

Finally, investigations to date about spatial autocorrelation impacts have not considered
the mixture case. For example, SAR model parameters remain unbiased, but what happens to
efficiency and consistency is unknown. For the single-parameter SAR model, a qualitative
difference in efficiency exists between positive and negative spatial autocorrelation
situations. Does this qualitative difference persist with a mixture of positive and negative
spatial autocorrelation? How does the biparametric SAR mixture specification relate to
LISAs (Anselin 1995) and Getis and Ord (1992) and Ord and Getis (2001) statistic
results? In other words, findings reported here motivate the investigation of a wide range
of spatial statistical problems that have not been considered before. And it is in keeping with
Boots and Okabe (2007), who furnish an overview of the local spatial statistics theme.

Meanwhile, the pioneering nature of the conceptualization and analysis presented in this
paper alludes to many themes meriting future research. For example, geographic
dependencies often are quite complex, and this complexity needs a careful and thorough
study. Geographic dependencies also may vary in their characterizations; contiguity is
treated in this paper, but inter-point distance or spatial economic hierarchical structuring,
for instance, may be more suitable for some phenomena. Meanwhile, differentiating
between negative and positive spatial autocorrelation is achieved in a relatively simple
manner for this paper. Accordingly, sensitivity analyses need to be undertaken to determine
appropriate regime specification, as well as how to detect multiple regimes (beyond the case of
two employed here) when they prevail. Such analyses also need to ascertain differences
between the case of model misspecification and that of true mixtures of positive and
negative spatial autocorrelation.

Therefore, a more complete understanding of negative spatial autocorrelation needs to be
attained and would have profound implications for empirical work. We believe that this
paper contributes to this very end.

distance dij are negatively correlated, then values at dij/2 would be positively correlated. The
wave–hole semivariogram model characterizes the continuous case, beginning with declining
positive spatial autocorrelation, followed by a dampening oscillation between negative and
positive autocorrelation. This description highlights that for the ecological case, if first-order

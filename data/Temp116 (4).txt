(Received 11 December 2007; in final form 21 December 2007 )

The Commission on Spatial Data Standards of the International Cartographic
Association is working to define formal models and technical characteristics of
Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI). To date, this work has been restricted to the
Enterprise and Information Viewpoints from the ISO Reference Model for Open
Distributed Processing standard. The Commission has developed models for
these two viewpoints. These models describe how the different parts of an SDI fit
together in the viewpoints in question. These models should be seen as a
contribution towards the overall model of
the SDI and its technical
characteristics. During the model development process, the roles of the different
Actors in an SDI in the Enterprise and Information Viewpoints have also been
identified in Use Case diagrams of an SDI. All the models have been developed
using the Unified Modeling Language.

Introduction

The growing need to organise geospatial data across different disciplines and
organisations has resulted in the development and implementation of spatial data
infrastructures (SDI) and the theory and concepts behind them. An SDI is an
evolving concept about facilitating and coordinating the exchange and sharing of
spatial data and services between stakeholders from different levels in the spatial
data community. With this in mind, many countries are developing SDIs to manage
and better utilise their spatial data assets by taking a perspective that starts at a local
level and proceeds up through state, national and regional levels to the global
(GSDI) level. This has resulted in the development of different forms of SDI at, and
between, these levels. Increasingly, these countries are finding it necessary to
cooperate with other countries to develop multi-national SDIs (regional and global
SDIs) to assist in decision-making that have important impacts across national
boundaries.

ISO/TC 211, Geographic

Information—Reference model

reference model used by the

In order to get an overview of the issues concerning modelling an SDI, a first
task is to review the different reference models applicable to the SDI. The
architecture
International Organisation for
Standardisation (ISO) Technical Committee (TC) for Geographic Information/
Geomatics,
(ISO
19101:2002); the Open Geospatial Consortium’s (OGC) Reference Model (ORM)
(GIRM)
(OGC 2003); and the Geospatial Interoperability Reference Model
the primary reference
(Federal Geographic Data Committee 2003), are
models reviewed and discussed. The base reference model used by all
is the
Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) (ISO/IEC 10746-
1:1998), which defines a framework comprising five viewpoints: Enterprise,
Information, Computation, Engineering and Technology. The RM-ODP model
allows one to describe complex distributed systems, which provides a framework at
different levels of abstraction (Delgado 2005), where the reference model provides
an overall frame of reference that organises the constituent parts of an SDI into a
coherent whole.

The concept of an SDI is very broad, encompassing all kinds and forms of spatial
information. The concept of a ‘Distributed Geolibrary’, as described by the USA
National Research Council (NRC 1999), is really a special case that can exist under
the overall concept of a Spatial Data Infrastructure. This 1999 report recognised the
expanding technological potential provided by the World Wide Web, an excellent
vehicle when it comes to designing and implementing an SDI.

The core of an SDI is a set of networked, and potentially interlocked, geospatial
databases: digital collections of data that represent features and their characteristics
as they exist in the real or an imaginary world. Such a geospatial database can be
considered a complex form of a virtual map, as defined by Moellering (1980, 1984,
information in the SDI is digital. These
2000, 2007), because the geospatial
databases deal with the deep structure (Nyerges 1980) of the data and information
relationships that exist below the visible surficial level.

Real and virtual map transformations are an expansion of the earlier map
transformation concepts from Tobler (1979). For an overall review of these spatial
concepts and many others from analytical cartography, see Moellering (2000). These

1297

concepts discussed above are consistent with those presented by Groot and
McLaughlin (2000) in their book on the geospatial data infrastructure.

The motivation to undertake this work is to obtain a multi-perspective description
of SDIs, as part of the terms of reference for 2003–2007 for the Spatial Data
Standards Commission of the International Cartographic Association (ICA). These
are enunciated as follows:

To develop a conceptual model of the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) using the
Unified Modeling Language (UML) (ISO/IEC 19501:2005) and associated modelling
concepts, working in the areas of science, technology and standards, at the global,
regional and national levels.

To define the technical characteristics of the SDI and concepts for appropriate data sets
for the SDI. (ICA 2003)

The work began by developing a preliminary high-level model of an SDI, identifying
some of the Actors, Use Cases and Classes, described using UML (Cooper et al.
2003). Subsequently, the ICA Commission on Spatial Data Standards has exploited
the enterprise and
the first
two RM-ODP viewpoints to describe an SDI:
textual or
formal,
information viewpoints. These notations may be natural,
graphical. In the following work, UML has been used as the main notation
language to express the two viewpoints. Future work will examine the computation
viewpoint of the SDI Reference Model, while the engineering and technology
viewpoints are too implementation-specific for development as general models of an
SDI.

2. SDI—nature and components

The need to create multi-participant, decision-supported environments to address
the issues of sustainable development and improving quality of life creates a growing
need to organise spatial data across disciplines and organisations through different
forms of SDI. An SDI is fundamentally a concept about
facilitating and
coordinating the exchange and sharing of spatial data (e.g.: virtual maps) between
stakeholders from different jurisdictional levels in the spatial data community. To
enable this, an SDI encompasses the policies, technologies, standards and human
resources necessary for the effective collection, management, access, delivery and
utilisation of geospatial data for a specific jurisdiction or community (Global Spatial
Data Infrastructure 2004a, 2004b).

There are a number of important factors and issues related to SDI development
from conceptual, technical, socio-technical, political,
institutional and financial
perspectives. Therefore, the challenge of designing, building, implementing, and
maintaining an SDI draws on many different disciplines and requires examination of
such factors and issues.

3. Current status of SDI initiatives

One of the distinctive features of the last decade is the emergence of regional SDI
organisations, as reported by Masser et al. (2003). This is due to the need for a
regional SDI perspective as a consequence of the need for seamless, consistent
spatial data beyond national boundaries to support decision-making. This began
the European Umbrella Organization for Geographic
with the creation of

J. Hjelmager et al.

Information (EUROGI) in 1993 and in 2007, the EU made into law the INSPIRE
Directive (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe), whose objective is to
make more and better geographical information available for community policy-
making and implementation in a wide range of sectors (Directive 2007/2/EC). The
creation of EUROGI has been quickly followed by the establishment of a
Permanent Committee on GIS Infrastructure for Asia and the Pacific (PCGIAP) in
1995. A similar organisation for the Americas followed in 2000, the Permanent
Committee on Spatial Data Infrastructure for the Americas (PC IDEA), with
support from 21 nations. In Africa, moves are currently under way within the
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UN ECA),
through its
Committee on Development Information, Science and Technology (CODIST),
which has a Sub-Committee on Geoinformation (CODI-Geo).

At the global level, there is an ongoing initiative called Global Spatial Data
Infrastructure (GSDI), where regional organisations such as EUROGI and
PCGIAP play an important role. GSDI is currently at an early stage of
development, with the establishment of the GSDI Association in 2002, which
includes the development of a proper organisational model, policy and framework
(Global Spatial Data Infrastructure 2004b). At the national level, those countries
that are able to develop an efficient National SDI will be well placed to contribute to
the development of the Regional and the Global SDI initiatives (Rajabifard et al.
2003).

4. The process of developing the models

An initial strategy is to keep the process of developing models as simple as
possible. The rationale for this decision is that the models are complex and in
order to be able to understand how the models work, one needs to keep the
process simple to maintain the general idea of how different parts of the models
interrelate.

The scientific discussion included the following steps. First, the relevant concepts
from the reference models have been extracted. It is then seen that these concepts
need to be extended with some concepts from the real world. The concepts from the
RM-ODP Reference Models and the related concepts from the real world are then
grouped. The concepts have been grouped into super- and sub-concepts. As far as
possible, the terms and definitions in ISO/IEC 10746 and the standards developed
by ISO/TC 211 have been used.

One can then develop a graphic expression depicting how the concepts fit
together. This graphic expression has been developed in UML use case and class
diagrams for the enterprise viewpoint, and a class diagram for the information
viewpoint.

5. Why use UML for SDI modelling?

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a graphical language developed initially
for specifying, visualising, constructing and documenting the elements of software
systems. It originates from the object modelling languages of three leading object-
oriented methods: Booch, Object Modeling Technique (OMT) and Object-Oriented
Software Engineering (OOSE). It has become the industry standard for modelling
software-intensive systems and is now becoming widely used for modelling systems
in general. UML has become an international standard as ISO/IEC 19501:2005,

1299

Information technology—Open Distributed Processing—Unified Modeling Language
(UML) Version 1.4.2.

ISO/TC 211 has decided to use UML as the common language for describing the
technical content of the ISO 19100 series of standards. The ISO/TC 211 models are
implementation-neutral, meaning that the models are at a conceptual level and
independent of the implementation details of a particular environment. These UML
models have all been brought together into one massive model that enables ISO/TC
211 to ensure that all its standards are harmonised (for more details, see: http://
www.isotc211.org/hmmg/HTML/root.html).

The adoption of the UML provides benefits that include:
N syntactic and technical interoperability;
N a basis for semantic interoperability; and
N multiple interchange formats and multiple service implementations.

For an overview of the UML notation, refer to the UML resource page, which
provides links to Web pages with much introductory material, tutorials, tools and
other resources, at: http://www.uml.org/.

Introduction to the five SDI modelling viewpoints

The architectural reference model provided by the RM-ODP consists of five
different viewpoints (ISO/IEC 10746:1995):

N enterprise viewpoint;
N information viewpoint;
N computation viewpoint;
N engineering viewpoint; and
N technology viewpoint.

The enterprise viewpoint describes the purpose, scope and policies1 for an SDI. The
enterprise viewpoint describes the relationship of an SDI to its environment, its role
and the policies associated. The information viewpoint describes the semantics of
information and information processing incorporated into an SDI. It could define
conceptual schemas (formal descriptions of the model) and methods for defining
application schemas. The computational viewpoint is a functional decomposition of
the SDI into a set of services that interact through interfaces. This viewpoint
captures the details of these services and interface definitions without regard to
distribution. The engineering viewpoint contains the mechanisms and functions
required to support distributed interaction between the services and data within a
system (i.e. the SDI). This viewpoint is concerned primarily with the interaction
between distinct services and data. Its chief concerns are: communication,
computing systems, software processes, and the clustering of computational
functions at physical nodes of a communications network. The technology viewpoint
contains the specific technologies chosen for the implementation of an SDI.

However, it is only the first two viewpoints (i.e. the enterprise and the information
viewpoints) that will be taken into consideration in this discussion, as illustrated in
figure 1.

1 Purpose, scope and common policies are necessary attributes which have to be fulfilled to recognise any network of
interoperable geoweb services as SDI.

7. The enterprise viewpoint of an SDI

The enterprise viewpoint specifies the enterprise goals, which should be reflected
directly or indirectly in all other viewpoint specifications (ISO/IEC 10746:1995).
Hence, it provides a framework for the information viewpoint, which is perhaps of
greater interest. The enterprise viewpoint is presented here using UML use case
diagram (used to show the relationships between actors and processes) to show the
stakeholders, and UML class diagrams (used to show the static structures of a
system) to show how the different parts of an SDI work together.

7.1 The stakeholders in the enterprise viewpoint

First, we define a stakeholder:

An individual or group with an interest in the success of an SDI in delivering its
intended results and maintaining the viability of its products. Stakeholders either affect
the SDI or are affected by it (adapted from Interoperability Clearinghouse 2006).

As mentioned above, the enterprise viewpoint consists of three different elements,
i.e. the purpose, scope and policies for an SDI. However, these are only lead topics,

Downloaded by [Cornell University Library] at 18:51 13 December 2014 An initial formal model for SDIs

1301

and it takes more than the headlines to build an SDI. As can be seen in the use case
diagram (figure 2), each stakeholder within an SDI can be part of different use cases.
For example, here the same stakeholder could determine the scope of an SDI, use
services from an SDI (such as searching for, obtaining, and using data), and build
the infrastructure used by the SDI (whether it be the networks, computers, software
or whatever else). Each of these interactions then comprises a separate use case.

As can be seen in figure 2, interactions with the scope and policies of an SDI can
be separated into the various stakeholders that either define the scope or implement
the scope. The same applies for the policy, thereby resulting in those that define and/
or implement policy. The reason for this division of labour is that the groups
responsible for developing and for maintaining the two parts of the use case have
different interests and points of view from one other, even though on a high level
their general interest should be mutual.

In figure 2, the universal actor has been generalised as a stakeholder. However,
this actor can be sub-divided into six individual actors (provider, producer, policy
maker, user, value added reseller and broker), all having a role to play in the use
cases in figure 2.

These six individual SDI actors can be defined, as shown below. They are also

illustrated in figure 3.

Policy maker:
A stakeholder who sets the policy pursued by an SDI and all its stakeholders.

Figure 3. The stakeholders.

Producer:
A stakeholder who produces SDI data or services.

Provider:
A stakeholder who provides data or services to users throughout SDI.

Broker:
A stakeholder who brings users and providers together and assists in the negotiation of
contracts between them. They are specialised publishers and can maintain metadata
records on behalf of an owner of a product. Their functions include harvesting
metadata from producers and providers, creating catalogues and providing services
based on these catalogues.

Value-added reseller (VAR):
A stakeholder who adds some new feature to an existing product or group of products,
and then makes it available as a new product.

End user:
A stakeholder who uses the SDI for its intended purpose.

Note: it is possible to find a wide range of definitions for these identified actors using
Web search services. The definitions presented here are consistent with the
discussions in the GSDI Cookbook (2004a).

7.2 The UML classes in the enterprise viewpoint

The core components of an SDI can be viewed as policies, connectivity, technology,
processing tools, metadata and products. These components can contain people
(including partnerships) as well as systems. The products contain the data and the
services. Different categories can be formed based on the nature of their interactions
within the SDI
framework. For example, consider policies and the main
technological components: connectivity, technology and processing tools. By their
nature, they are very dynamic due to the rapidity with which technology develops
and the needs change for mediation of rights, restrictions and responsibilities
between people and data. This suggests that an integrated SDI cannot be composed
of spatial data, value-added services and end-users alone, but instead involves other
important issues regarding interoperability, policies and networks. This in turn
reflects the dynamics of the whole SDI concept. Anyone wishing to access data sets
(eg: end users or VARs) must go through the technological components involved.
In order to see how the different parts of the use cases fit together, we have
developed an initial view object model, as shown in figure 4. As can be expected, we
have SDI at the centre of the model. The SDI has policies which determine how it is
established and developed. The SDI consists of products (services or data) and
metadata. To function, the SDI has processing tools and operates in a distributed
environment through connectivity, and the connectivity uses network technology.
The policies, processing tools and network technology need to be set up
appropriately to ensure interoperability.

The class policies in figure 4 consists of only a single object class. However, this
class can be divided into several other classes through inheritance, as shown in
figure 5. The class policies in figure 5 will be treated as an abstract UML class
because this class can never be instantiated (i.e. it will always be implemented as its
subclasses).

Figure 5. The various types of policies in an SDI and their relationships.

The classes business model, constraints, standards and best practices shown in
figure 5 might have some association between each other, because standards might
impose some constraints (e.g. legal constraints or business agreements) on the
policies, and vice versa. The possible associations between these classes are not
included in the figure.

8. The information viewpoint of an SDI

While the enterprise viewpoint has its main focus on the administrative perspective
of an SDI, the information viewpoint deals with the data and the semantics of the
data (ISO 19101:2002). As can be seen in figure 6, the product is at the centre of
everything. The product in this context is defined as services and/or data that
together form the real purpose of the SDI. But, in reality, policy is a starting point of

Figure 6. The information viewpoint of an SDI.

1305

this viewpoint. Policy determines product specification. Product specification then
defines product, which is described by metadata. Both product and metadata are
registered by catalogues (a catalogue can also be registered by another (higher level)
catalogue). Product can be of two kinds: service and data. Data are sources of
information, too. New information is derived from data using existing knowledge.
More generally, data are sources of information and information is a source of
knowledge. Information and knowledge provide the main reasons for specifying,
building and running SDIs, so one should always take this relation into account.

If one focuses on some of the classes in figure 6, e.g. product specification,
metadata, policies and product, and then further subdivides these classes into sub-
elements (which we shall call activities), and then connects these elements with the
stakeholders, as in figure 3, then it is possible to define the stakeholders’ roles in

connection with the classes and their sub-elements. The stakeholder can have one of
two different roles (active or passive) in relationship to a class or can have no
relation to it at all. The active stakeholder initiates or executes the class (for
example), while the passive stakeholder is the beneficiary of the class.

The UML classes column in table 1 contains the UML classes shown in figure. 6.
The second column, activity, represents a subdivision of the first column, UML
classes; this subdivision defines the actions connected to the UML classes. The last
six columns in table 1 represent the stakeholders identified as the actors in figure 3
and defined in section 7: policy maker, producer, provider, broker, VAR and end
user.

Table 1 describes which stakeholders are engaged in each given activity. An actor
can only be active, passive or not applicable, for any given activity. The purpose of
this choice is to have a clear overview of the relationships between actors and the
activities. However, some of the actors might be both active and passive for a given
activity. In such a case, the active role has been retained as the passive role is
implied.

For example,

the activity ‘Provide metadata’ requires that

the provider,
broker and the VAR play an active role, while the end user has a passive role.
Some of the actions require further description, e.g. ‘Harvest metadata’, ‘Search
for catalogues’ and ‘Search through catalogue’. This is described as follows:
‘Harvest metadata’ can be seen as an automated process to gather, extract,
index and search metadata on the Internet. ‘Search for catalogues’
is to look
somewhere (in general on the Internet) carefully to find the relevant catalogue.
‘Search through catalogue’ is to look in a catalogue in order to find the relevant
product.

A more detailed examination of table 1 reveals the following findings:
N The end user appears to have passive roles for most of the activities. This
reflects that he/she is the main beneficiary of those activities within an SDI.
N There are a lot of similarities between the producer, provider, broker and the
N The activity of capture/create data is specific to the producer and the VAR.
N The activity of ‘Harvest metadata’ is specific to the broker.

VAR.

9. Conclusion and future directions

This work is a result of the activities undertaken by the ICA Commission on Spatial
Data Standards, according to its Terms of Reference for the period 2003–2007. The
Commission adopted the use of Open Distributed Processing Reference Model
(RM-ODP) as a general framework for modelling SDIs and the Unified Modeling
Language (UML) for modelling the specifics of SDIs.

The synergy of RM-ODP combined with UML results in a comprehensive set of
models used to describe a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) in terms of its scope,
activities and actors. This work continued through two RM-ODP viewpoints, the
enterprise and information viewpoints. In the enterprise viewpoint, six SDI
stakeholders were defined with a use case model (policy maker, producer,
provider, broker, VAR and end user) and a UML class model of the SDI was
developed. In the information viewpoint, UML class models of the SDI were
developed, showing what is needed for SDIs to deliver products (both data and
services).

A table of the six actors and 27 defined activities in an SDI has been developed. It
indicates whether each actor is active, passive or not involved in each of these
activities. Interpreting this table resulted in several findings, including: the end user
appears to have passive roles for most of the activities and there are many
similarities between the producer, provider, broker and the VAR. Another thing
that is clear is that five of the six actors primarily are active whereas the last (the end
user) is passive.

This all provides more insight into the internal processes of an SDI and how they
are inter-related, from the RM-ODP enterprise and information viewpoints. That is,
a formal SDI model is important for general understanding of SDI principles, its
structure, the main players (i.e. stakeholders) and their roles in the SDI. The
proposed model
legislation,
national/international initiative/implementation. However, it should fully subscribe
with them. One of our next goals is to compare our model with some initiatives/
standards, such as the European INSPIRE (Directive 2007) and the international
GSDI, to test whether we kept this requirement.

is fully independent of any concrete technology,

Our final comment concerns the relation between SDI and service oriented
architecture (SOA) and data oriented architecture (DOA). As a general principle, an
SDI is based on SOA, which aims to achieve loose coupling between system
components (Capevo 2007), i.e. between SDI elements. From another definition, an
SOA ‘is essentially a collection of services. These services communicate with one
another. The communication can involve either simple data passing or it can involve
two or more services coordinating some activity’ (CISCO 2007). This definition fits
an SDI quite well. In contrast, DOA focuses on tightly coupled systems creating one
large super-system (Schwaderer 2007). This is not the case of an SDI.

9.1 Future work

The ICA Commission on Spatial Data Standards is extending the models presented in
this paper by the addition of the computation viewpoint, which comprises the services
in an SDI, consistent with the concepts identified in the enterprise and information
viewpoints. Future work is also necessary to validate the model in specific user
communities and at different levels of SDI (local, national, regional and global).

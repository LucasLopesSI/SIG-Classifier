Exploring Tactile Maps with One or Two Fingers

Gunnar Jansson and Linda Monaci

Department of Psychology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.

Real 3D objects are typically explored with high ef®ciency by several ®ngers. The largest increase in ef®ciency is
obtained between the use of one and two ®ngers. The aim of the present experiment was to investigate if the ef®ciency
of identifying a country on a 2D tactile map can be increased by the use of two ®ngers exploration along opposite
sides of the map compared with following along the contour. The result was that there was no signi®cant difference
between one-®nger and two-®nger exploration, but there were signi®cant improvements over sessions. The difference
between exploration of 2D and 3D objects is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Haptics is a very ef(cid:142)cient sense when used in a natural
way. Haptics can identify real objects at close to perfect
accuracy after a short exploration time (Klatzky, Lederman
& Metzger, 1985) and uses an elaborate set of exploratory
procedures (Lederman & Klatzky, 1987). In contrast, read-
ing of tactile maps and pictures is generally a slow and often-
inaccurate activity that is performed with stereotypical
procedures. There is a great need for improving the
ef(cid:142)ciency of haptic reading of 2D pictures,
including
maps. The aim of the present study was to investigate a
potential improvement.

When real objects are explored in natural contexts
usually several (cid:142)ngers are involved. This means that more
information is made available, both cutaneous information
from a larger skin area and kinaesthetic information from
the movement of the joints and muscles. Concerning reading
2D tactile patterns, the results of adding such information
are mixed. Foulke (1971) found some evidence that an
increase in the ‘perceptual window’ by providing readers
with several Braille cells making them available for different
(cid:142)ngers simultaneously, improved reading. However, Lappin
& Foulke (1973) discovered that reading Braille with two
(cid:142)ngers did not produce better results. In scanning of out-
line 2D shapes of
familiar objects, Loomis, Klatzky &
Lederman (1991) also found little improvement by using
two (cid:142)ngers on the same hand and suggested ‘the effective
tactual (cid:142)eld of view for this task is approximately equal
to one (cid:142)nger pad’. Working with patterns presented on
matrices of vibrotactile point stimuli, Craig (1985) found
better results when stimuli were presented to two (cid:142)ngers
on different hands than when the two (cid:142)ngers were on the
same hand. Dividing the stimulation on two (cid:142)ngers on
the same hand gave poorer performance than presented to

one (cid:142)nger. Ballesteros, Millar & Reales (1998) found an
advantage for scanning symmetrical 2D (cid:142)gures with two
index (cid:142)ngers in parallel compared with one-(cid:142)nger scanning.
In spite of the advantage demonstrated for several cases of
two-(cid:142)nger use, contour following is often spontaneously
performed with only one (cid:142)nger (Symmons & Richardson,
2000).

PROBLEM

Jansson & Monaci (in press) demonstrated the importance
of number of (cid:142)ngers for identi(cid:142)cation of real objects.
Performance improved dramatically according to the number
of (cid:142)ngers involved in exploration, the largest improvement
appearing between one (cid:142)nger and two (cid:142)ngers. During
exploratory activity important kinds of information probably
come from both the joints and the muscles about the
position and direction of the (cid:142)ngers (Gibson, 1966,
pp. 109–14). A related idea suggests the importance of
the function of
‘Perceptual Filling-In’ of empty spaces
throughout haptic form perception (Jansson, 2001).

The main exploratory procedures for judging shape are
enclosure and contour following (Lederman & Klatzky,
1987). With the use of one (cid:142)nger only the latter pro-
cedure is possible. For enclosure at least two (cid:142)ngers are
needed. A version of enclosure applied to 2D tactile maps
can be called ‘embracing’. It involves two (cid:142)ngers following
opposite sides of the outlines of, for example, a country.
It is thus related to contour tracing, but with two (cid:142)ngers
operating in a special way. The procedure continuously
provides information about the shape from two positions of
the contour, as well as about the distance between two
parts of the shape.

The aim of the present study was to investigate if the
identi(cid:142)cation of geographical objects, such as the outline
of a country is more ef(cid:142)cient with two (cid:142)ngers embracing
the country during exploration than one (cid:142)nger following
the outline.

METHOD

Tactile Maps
Outline maps of European countries from the ‘Nordic
Atlas for the Blind’, were reproduced on A4 swellpaper at
approximately the same size (maximum extension about
195 mm). In order to concentrate the information on
aspects of shape alone, countries were represented only by
their outline without surrounding information, such as sea
or borders of other countries. Not all countries are easily
identi(cid:142)able in this simpli(cid:142)ed form, not even visually. In
order to (cid:142)nd out to what extent identi(cid:142)cation is possible,
a pilot experiment was performed where participants were
set a task to identify the countries visually. The following
12 countries were identi(cid:142)able visually by most participants
and were therefore selected for the haptic experiment:
Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Italy,
the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and
Switzerland. Two examples of these maps are given in
Figure 1.

Participants
Ten sighted students of psychology (three men and
seven women) with a mean age of 25 years (SD = 5 years)
participated as part of a course requirement.

Instructions
The participants were told (1) that their task was to
identify the name of the European countries presented
on the tactile maps one by one, (2) that the countries
were represented only by international boundaries without

surrounding context, (3) that all countries were shown
approximately at the same size, but retained their correct
shape, and (4) that they were orientated with north at the
top of the page.

Procedure
There were three sessions on separate days. Each session
consisted of three parts:

(a) visual identi(cid:142)cation,
(b) tactile identi(cid:142)cation using one (cid:142)nger,
(c) tactile identi(cid:142)cation using two (cid:142)ngers ‘embracing’ the
country (one thumb, the other either index or long
(cid:142)nger according to the participants choice).

For half of the participants the order between b and c was
reversed. In each of the three parts the countries were
presented in random orders.

Where errors occurred in visual

identi(cid:142)cation, partici-
pants were corrected, and the session continued until the
participant correctly named the set of 12 countries twice.
Such demands were made to rule out the possibility of
errors in haptic exploration occurring as a result of lack
of knowledge of a country’s form.

During the haptic parts the participants were blind-
folded. Before starting the exploration of each map, they
were instructed to use their palm for up and down move-
ments over the map to get a general overview; other
movements were not permitted.

Three minutes was the maximum time allowed for haptic
exploration of each map. No time limit was set for visual
identi(cid:142)cation.

RESULTS

ANOVAs on the two dependent variables, proportion
correct and exploration time, respectively, showed no signi-
(cid:142)cant differences between the one (cid:142)nger and embracing
conditions (F1,9= 0.14, p > 0.05, for proportion correct,
and F1,9= 1.67, p > 0.05, for exploration time). However,
there were signi(cid:142)cant improvements as sessions progressed
for both variables (F2,18= 36.95, p < 0.001, for proportion
correct, and F2,18= 6.38, p < .01 for exploration time). See
Figure 2.

Scheffe´ post hoc tests showed a signi(cid:142)cant difference
between the (cid:142)rst and third sessions for proportion correct
(p < 0.01) and signi(cid:142)cant differences between all three
sessions for exploration time (p < 0.01).

DISCUSSION

The Results for 2D Maps and 3D Objects Compared
The results of experiments with 2D maps and 3D objects
are quite different. Increasing the number of (cid:142)ngers from
one to two lead to a great improvement on performance
when exploration concerned 3D objects, but had no signi-
(cid:142)cant effect on the ef(cid:142)ciency of reading 2D maps. Several
factors may contribute to the difference:

great need of (cid:142)nding ways of making the exploration more
ef(cid:142)cient, including the use of more than one (cid:142)nger. The
present study showed that using the thumb and index
or middle (cid:142)nger did not improve performance over using
only the index (cid:142)nger. However, there are other multi-
(cid:142)nger options. One interesting such option is the use
of two index (cid:142)ngers. As noted above, Ballesteros et al.
(1998) found advantages for perceiving symmetry with this
method. An ongoing experiment of the authors examines
the potential differences between two-(cid:142)nger combinations
for identi(cid:142)cation of 3D objects. A similar experiment with
tactile maps is planned. Complex multi-(cid:142)nger options have
been studied demonstrating the importance of movement
patterns (Berla`, 1982) and these possibilities also deserve
further investigation.

(2) The available stimulus properties are different. In the
3D case the objects differed in many dimensions while
the 2D countries differed only in form.

(3) Even if embracing of 2D shapes and enclosure of
3D objects are similar in some respects, for instance,
the information from the direction of the (cid:142)ngers, they
are also different in important ways, such as the force
feedback from pressing the raised contours being
much smaller than that from pressing a real object.
(4) People have more haptic experience of real 3D objects
than of depictions, which may mean more ef(cid:142)cient
exploration in the former case (Klatzky and Lederman,
1987). In both the one-(cid:142)nger and the two-(cid:142)nger
conditions performance improved with practice that
demonstrates a relative low ef(cid:142)ciency to start with.

Other Multi-Finger Options

spontaneously preferred exploratory procedure for reading
2D pictures (Symmons & Richardson, 2000), there is a

Abstract

25

Soil Moisture Content (SMC) is a crucial component in various environmental studies. Although 

26 many  models  have  been  so  far  proposed  for  SMC  estimation,  developing  new  models  for 

27

accurate  estimation  of  SMC  is  still  an  interesting  subject.  This  study  aimed  to  develop  new 

28 models for SMC estimation using the water absorption bands in the spectral signatures of three 

different soil types: loam, silty loam, and sandy loam. Based on the three absorption bands (i.e., 

1400, 1900, and 2200 nm) and regression analyses, six approaches were first considered. These 

scenarios  were  generally  based  on  the  reflectance  value  and  its  logarithm,  as  well  as  the 

difference  between  the  wet  and  dry  reflectance  values  for  the  absorption  bands.  Finally,  24 

33 models  were  developed  for  SMC  estimation  from  the  three  different  soil  types  as  well  as  the 

entire soil samples. The most accurate SMC, as indicated by the lowest Root Mean Square Error 

(RMSE) and the highest correlation coefficient (r), was obtained from the model developed using 

the  logarithm  of  the  average  values  reflectance  in  the  three  water  absorption  bands  for  sandy 

loam (RMSE = 0.31 gr/kg, r = 0.99). Overall, using the spectrometry data derived in the lab, the 

results  of  the  proposed  models  were  promising  and  demonstrate  great  potential  for  SMC 

estimation using spectral data collected by satellites in the future studies.

Soil  Moisture  Content  (SMC)  is  a  key  variable  in  hydrology  and  climatology  processes.  SMC 

plays a pivotal role in many applications, such as agriculture and irrigation planning (Amani, et 

al.  2017a),  soil  erosion  studies  (Morgan  2009),  evapotranspiration  retrieval  (Carlson  2007), 

dryness  estimation  and  drought  monitoring  (Amani  et  al.  2017b),  and  forest  management 

(Binkley and Fisher 2012). Accurate investigation of SMC and investigating its spatial-temporal 

dynamics  are  necessary  for  continuous  soil  reservation,  crop  production,  and  water  resources 

52 management (Amani et al. 2016; Mobasheri and Amani 2016). 

The physical, chemical, and mineral characteristics of soil can be effectively investigated using 

its  spectral  information.  The  potential  of  different  parts  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum  to 

retrieve  SMC  is  of  great  interest  and  has  been  investigated  in  various  studies.  For  example, 

Lobell and Asner (2002) reported that SMC affected the spectral response of soil in Visible/Near 

Infrared  (VNIR:  400-1100  nm)  and  Shortwave  Infrared  (SWIR:  1100-2500  nm).  They  also 

demonstrated that the corresponding effects were more significant in the SWIR bands compared 

to the VNIR region. Whiting et al. (2004) also fitted a Gaussian model to the reflectance profiles 

obtained  from  thousands  of  soil  samples  and,  concluded  that  the  Gaussian  area  was  the  best 

indicator of gravimetric SMC. Moreover, Demmate et al. (2006) concluded that the absorption 

bands with a center of approximately 1400 nm and 1900 nm depicting a smaller and narrower 

concavity  by  reducing  SMC.  However,  for  the  band  with  a  center  of  2200  nm,  the  amount  of 

absorption increased when SMC reduced. Additionally, Zhu et al. (2010) evaluated the accuracy 

of SMC retrieval by measuring soil reflectance in different spectral bands. Their results showed 

that by increasing the SMC at a single wavelength, the reflectance of three different soil samples 

decreased  non-linearly.  They  also  demonstrated  that  the  correlation  values  were  different

throughout  the  full  spectra.  Furthermore,  Yanmin  et  al.  (2010)  applied  hyperspectral  remote 

sensing data, containing hundreds of spectral bands, to obtain various types of information about 

soil  characteristics.  They  found  out  that  generally  the  400-470  nm,  1950-2050  nm,  and  2100-

2200 nm regions were sensitive to SMC, among which the band with the center of 2156 nm was 

72 most significantly correlated with SMC (r = 0.89). In summary, as discussed in several studies 

(e.g.  Lobell  and  Asner  2002;  Zhu  et  al.  2010;  Mobasheri  and  Bidkhan  2013),  there  are  three 

absorption bands around 1400 nm, 1900 nm, and 2200 nm in the soil spectral signature. These 

three bands are within the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) range (1100-2500 nm) indicating that the 

SWIR  bands  are  more  useful  for  SMC  estimation  compared  to  the  other  parts  of  the 

electromagnetic  spectrum.  Consequently,  utilizing  these  three  bands  is  essential  for  developing 

accurate SMC models. 

Another  approach  to  predict  SMC  is  utilizing  remote  sensing  methods.  These  techniques  are 

relatively cost-efficient and suitable for SMC estimation and change detection over a large area 

(Yanmin et al. 2010; Amani et al. 2016). For instance, optical satellites collect information using 

different  spectral  bands  varying  from  visible  to  thermal  parts  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum. 

83 Many studies discussed the potential of spectral data collected by satellites for SMC prediction. 

For instance, Amani et al (2016) developed two new soil moisture indices based on the scatter-

plot of the red and NIR bands using Landsat-8 images. They reported that the proposed indices 

can  effectively  deal  with  the  vegetation  interface  in  SMC  estimation.  Mobasheri  and  Amani 

(2016) also used a combination of red, NIR and, thermal bands of Landsat-8 to derive SMC in 

barren,  sparse  and  dense  vegetation  land  covers.  Finally,  Ghahremanloo  et  al.  (2019)  applied 

soil temperature data collected in the field as well as estimated from satellite imagery to predict 

SMC.  They  argued  that  it  is  important  to  use  soil  temperature  at  different  depths  to  determine

As  discussed  above,  developing  novel  and  highly  accurate  models  for  SMC  estimation  using 

spectral  data  is  of  great  interest  for  various  researchers.  To  address  this  issue,  this  study 

investigated  the  potential  of  different  spectral  bands  within  400-2500  nm  for  the  estimation  of 

95 moisture  contents  from  three  soil  types.  Finally,  several  models  were  developed  for  SMC 

96

estimation using the three water absorption bands.

Study area

The Toroq agricultural research station located in Khorasan province, Iran, was selected as the 

study area (Figure 1). This 240 ha area is located approximately 7 km from Mashhad City (the 

capital  of  Khorasan),  and  its  average  altitude  is  approximately  1000  m  above  sea  level.  Three 

soil  types  of  loam,  silty  loam,  and  sandy  loam  can  be  found  in  the  study  area  where  different 

types of vegetation and crops, such as cereals, beans, peas, corn, alfalfa, sugar beet, potatoes, and 

canola seeds are also planted. 

106

Soil samples collection and preparation

Three  types  of  soil  from  the  depth  of  0-30  cm  were  collected  from  the  study  area.  Then,  their 

characteristics, including particle size distribution and amount of organic carbon and lime in the 

soil samples were measured. Moreover, the texture of the samples was determined based on the 

percentage of sand, clay, and silt, as well as using the United States Department of Agriculture

(USDA)  Soil  Textural  Triangle  (Soil  Survey  Staff  1951).  Subsequently,  the  samples  were 

divided  into  three  groups  of  loam,  silty  loam,  and  sandy  loam.  The  physical  and  chemical 

characteristics of three soil types, which were investigated in this study, are provided in Table 1.

[Table 1]

To prepare the soil samples for each soil type, the following steps were performed:

(1) Each field soil sample was completely dried. 

(2) Once dried, the samples were crushed and sifted using a 2 mm sieve. 

(3) Twenty-two homogenized subsamples weighing 0.5 kg each were divided into individual 

nylon bags and the air was vacuumed before the bags were completely sealed. Thus, there 

were 22 subsamples from each soil type (i.e., 66 samples in total).

(4) One 0.5 kg subsample was kept dry as a control benchmark. 

(5) To prepare the first moist sample of certain gravimetric SMC, 3 ml of distilled water was 

added to the first dry soil pack using a pipette and the bag was thoroughly shaken so that 

the moisture was evenly distributed throughout the subsample. This was continued for the 

rest of 20 subsamples. However, it was noticed that a fraction of water evaporates at the 

time of spectrometry. Therefore, to prevent any uncertainties due to this, all samples were 

weighed at the last moment. 

(6) Each subsample was weighted using a digital scale. 

(7) The gravimetric moisture contents of soil samples were first determined using the oven-

drying method. The moisture content by weight (

) was calculated using Equation (1), 

𝜃𝑤𝑡

in  which  m  and 

𝑚0

  are  the  soil  weight  with  moisture  (kg)  and  soil  weight  without 

moisture (kg), respectively.

The gravimetric moisture contents were then transformed to the volumetric water content

where 

𝜌𝑤

  and 

𝜌𝑏

  are  the  density  of  water  (1.0  gr/cm3)  and  density  of  bulk  soil, 

respectively. The density of bulk soil was determined by a 5 ml volume of lightly packed 

soil.

138

Lab spectrometry

A terrestrial ASD FieldSpec-3 spectroradiometer with a spectral resolution of 1 nm in the range 

of 350 to 2500 nm was used to measure the spectral reflectance of the soil subsamples. Spectral 

141 measurement was performed in a darkroom using a 100-watt halogen lamp with a zenith angle of 

142

40°  and  a  slant  distance  of  55  cm  from  the  centre  of  each  sample  as  an  illumination  source. 

143 Measurement was conducted using a pistol with a 25° field of view sensor and the spectra were 

144 measured  vertically  from  a  height  of  41  cm  such  that  each  subsample  was  covered  by  a  circle 

with  a  diameter  of  18  cm.  Additionally,  an  initial  measurement  was  recorded  from  a  white 

standard  surface  (spectralon)  under  the  same  parameters  to  calibrate  the  illumination 

circumstances in the lab. 

Prior to measurement, each subsample was spread over a flat, black-colored aluminium tray with 

a diameter of 30 cm to prevent spectral disturbance. The subsamples were then placed under the 

sensor.  For  each  subsample,  two  spectral  measurements  were  observed  and  averaged  such  that

there  was  only  one  spectral  response  for  each  sample.  Finally,  a  database  was  created  which 

included 132 series of spectral reflectance from the bands in the range of 400 to 2500 nm. 

153 Modelling

The modelling was performed using three absorption bands (i.e., 1400 nm, 1900 nm, and 2200 

nm)  and  multivariate  linear  regression  analysis  with  the  least  square  method.  For  this,  six 

different  approaches  were  considered,  as  discussed  in  the  following  subsections.  Various 

157 mathematical transformation, such as logarithm, averaging, and difference of reflectance values 

were  considered.  These  transformations  are  suggested  for  SMC  assessments  in  several  studies 

(e.g., Lobell and Asner 2002; Whiting et al. 2004; Yanmin et al. 2010). It is also worth noting 

that  although  hundreds  of  models  were  developed  for  each  approach,  only  the  most  accurate 

ones were presented in this study.

First approach: The models were based on the reflectance values of the three absorption bands 

for individual subsamples, as well as all combined samples for each soil type. The L-R, SAN-R, 

SIL-R, and ALL-R were the models obtained using the reflectance values for loam, sandy loam, 

silty loam, and all soil types, respectively (R refers to the reflectance). 

Second approach: The models were based on the logarithm of the reflectance values in the three 

absorption bands for each soil type. The L-logR, SAN-logR, SIL-logR, and ALL-logR were the 

168 models obtained using the logarithm of the reflectance values for loam, sandy loam, silty loam, 

169

and all soil types, respectively.

Third approach: The models were based on the difference between the wet and dry reflectance 

values in the three absorption bands. The L-DifR, SAN-DifR, SIL-DifR, and ALL-DifR were the

172 models obtained using the difference between the wet and dry reflectance values for loam, sandy 

loam, silty loam, and all soil types, respectively.

Fourth  approach:  The  modelling  was  based  on  the  average  reflectance  values  within  a  range 

around the three absorption bands. The L-AveR, SAN-AveR, SIL-AveR, and ALL-AveR were 

the models obtained using the average reflectance values for loam, sandy loam, silty loam, and 

all soil types, respectively.

Fifth approach: The modelling was based on the logarithm of the average reflectance values of 

all  subsamples  within  a  soil  type  within  a  range  around  the  three  absorption  bands.  The  L-

logAveR, SAN-logAveR, SIL- logAveR, and ALL-logAveR were the models obtained using the 

logarithm of the average reflectance values for loam, sandy loam, silty loam, and all soil types, 

182

respectively.

Sixth  approach:  In  this  case,  instead  of  using  only  one  mathematical  transformation,  a 

combination  of  different  mathematical  transformations  of  reflectance  values  (e.g.,  difference, 

division,  and  logarithm)  in  401,  402,  900,  902,  1600,  1601,  2100,  and  2101  nm  bands  were 

considered. These bands were selected from different spectrum regions where extreme influence 

by SMC was detected. However, deviating several nanometers from these bands did not change 

the  results.  The  L-CombR,  SAN-CombR,  SIL-CombR,  and  ALL-CombR  were  the  models 

obtained  using  the  combination  of  the  reflectance  values  in  these  bands  for  loam,  sandy  loam, 

silty loam, and all soil types, respectively.

It  is  worth  noting  that  approximately  70%  of  the  prepared  field  samples  (46  samples)  were 

applied  to  calculate  the  coefficients  of  each  model  using  the  least  square  method  and  the 

remaining  30%  (18  samples)  were  employed  to  evaluate  the  accuracy  of  the  proposed  models.

The  accuracy  assessments  were  also  conducted  using  the  Root  Mean  Square  Error  (RMSE), 

Relative RMSE (RRMSE), and r parameter.

196

Results and discussion

197

Figure 2 demonstrates the spectral signatures of loam, silty loam, and sandy loam with differing 

198 moisture contents. As is clear, there was a clear correlation in which the reflectance values of the 

entire spectrum range decreased with increasing SMC. The absorption bands at 1400 nm, 1900 

nm, and 2200 nm were also observed, the second of which was the most significant. Moreover, 

the concavity feature in the absorption bands tended to decrease with decreasing SMC.

[Figure 2]

The results of the SMC estimation models developed based on the six approaches, described in 

subsection 2.4 are provided in Table 2. Additionally, the scatter-plots of the field and estimated 

SMC data using the most accurate models for each soil type are demonstrated in Figure 3. Based 

on the analyses, the following results were obtained. Importantly, the r values were evaluated at 

the 0.001 significance level (α) to ensure the accuracies are statistically meaningful.

(1) Of  the  proposed  models,  the  highest  and  lowest  SMC  estimation  accuracies  were 

obtained  from  the  logarithm  of  the  average  reflectance  values  in  the  three  absorption 

bands  for  sandy  loam  (SAN-logAveR)  and  the  average  reflectance  values  in  the  three 

absorption bands for all samples (All-AveR), respectively. As the most accurate model, 

the  r,  RMSE,  and  RRMSE  of  the  SAN-logAveR  model  were  0.99,  0.31,  and  6%, 

respectively (Figure 3 (c)).

(2) Comparing soil types, the proposed models generally produced the highest accuracies for 

sandy loam. For example, the r, RMSE, and the percentage of the RRMSE of the model 

developed using the logarithm of the reflectance values in the three absorption bands for 

the  sandy  loam  (SAN-logR)  were  0.99,  0.45,  and  8%,  respectively.  This  was  also  the 

second  most  accurate  model  compared  to  all  others.  In  addition,  the  lowest  accuracies 

were  generally  obtained  when  all  samples  were  considered  in  one  model.  For  instance, 

the  r,  RMSE,  and  the  percentage  of  the  RRMSE  of  the  model  developed  using  the 

average  reflectance  values  in  the  three  absorption bands  for  all  samples  (i.e.  All-AveR) 

were 0.93, 1.64, and 28%, respectively. In fact, when the models were based on only one 

soil  type,  the  correlation  was  significantly  high.  However,  when  the  models  were 

performed  independent  of  the  soil  type  and  all  data  are  used,  the  accuracies  of  the 

corresponding  models  were  slightly  reduced.  This  was  expected  because  samples  of  a 

specific soil type contain similar characteristics (e.g., texture, color, mineral composition, 

and  organic  matter),  while  the  combination  of  different  soil  types  mix  various 

characteristics, which reduces the accuracy of the proposed models.  

(3) Comparing  the  regression  equations  used  in  developing  the  models,  those  developed 

using  the  logarithmic  form  generally  had  the  highest  accuracies.  For  instance,  the  SIL-

logAveR  produced  a  correlation  coefficient,  RMSE,  and  percentage  of  the  RRMSE  of 

0.96, 0.59, and 10%, respectively (Figure 3 (b)). This demonstrated that it is important to 

use mathematical transformation of soil reflectance in lieu of reflectance itself to obtain a 

high  accuracy  in  SMC  estimation.  The  results  of  this  study  demonstrated  that  the 

logarithm transformation is promising for obtaining an accurate SMC model. Our results 

are  comparable  to  those  reported  in  several  studies,  such  as  Yanmin  et  al.  (2010)  who

argued that the logarithm of the first derivative reflectance values was the most optimal 

mathematical transformation for SMC estimation. Moreover, it is generally accepted that 

the  response  of  soil  reflectance  to  SMC  is  non-linear  (Whiting  et  al.  2004)  and, 

consequently, the non-linear models presented in Table 2 had the highest accuracy in this 

study.

[Table 2]

[Figure 3] 

All the proposed models in this study were developed based on spectrometry analysis conducted 

in a lab and demonstrated high potential for SMC estimation. It should be noted that these are 

statistical  models,  the  coefficients  of  which  are  calculated  based  on  several  field  samples. 

Therefore,  they  are  not  generally  applicable  in  different  study  areas  with  various  soil 

characteristics and should be readjusted to provide the highest accuracy in SMC prediction.

Importantly, these models will be applied to satellite imagery in future studies to investigate their 

potential  when  the  limitations  of  satellite  data,  such  as  atmospheric  effects,  topography,  and 

vegetation,  are  present.  For  example,  vegetation  present  in  satellite  images  may  limit  the 

accuracy of SMC estimation. This is more important in growing seasons where the vegetation is 

usually elevated and covers the soil beneath it. Therefore, a potential avenue of future research is 

to revise the proposed models such that the vegetation interface is considered in SMC estimation, 

because this fact poses a limitation in accurately SMC determination using satellite data.

retrieval  using  the  water  absorption  bands  in  the  soil  spectral  signature.  Modelling  was 

performed  using  the  three  absorption  bands,  multivariate  linear  regression  analyses,  and  least 

square method. Most of the proposed models accurately predicted SMC. The models developed 

using the information of one soil type (i.e. either loam, silty loam, or sandy loam) had the highest 

accuracy  compared  to  those  that  combined  the  three  soil  types.  Moreover,  various  regression 

equations  were  considered  in  developing  the  models  and  it  was  concluded  that  the  logarithmic 

form  provided  the  highest  accuracy  for  SMC  estimation.  In  conclusion,  considering  the  high 

accuracies of the proposed soil moisture models, they offer a high potential for applications to 

the  spectral  data  collected  by  satellites.  The  next  step  of  this  research  in  Khavaran  Remote 

Sensing  Laboratory  (KRSLab.khi.ac.ir)  is  the  extension  of  these  models  to  the  satellite 

application in the very near future.

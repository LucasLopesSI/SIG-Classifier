Abstract In this paper, two simple GIS-based methodologies have been used to assess the
landslide susceptibility in a basin located in Southern Italy. The methodologies at issue, based
on the spatial distribution of landslides and/or of causal factors, are bivariate statistics-based
and expert-based, respectively. The spatial distribution of both the landslides and the causal
factors has been investigated by integrating pre-existing and original data, which have been
processed using ArcView GIS 3.2 software. The obtained results, consisting of landslide
susceptibility maps have been compared and discussed. The bivariate statistics-based method
has provided the most satisfying results. On the contrary, the expert-based method has provided
a classification of the study area in terms of landslide susceptibility which does not completely
fit with the surveyed spatial distribution of the landslides.

1 Introduction

Landslide susceptibility is the possibility that a landslide will occur in a particular area on
the basis of the local environmental conditions [2]. Most of the approaches currently used
in assessing and mapping landslide susceptibility are based on an accurate evaluation of the
spatial distribution of both the “causal factors”, i.e. geoenvironmental factors determining
all the pre-conditions for failure, and/or of the landslides. This involves the handling, the
interpretation and the graphical representation of a large amount of territorial data. Thus,
GIS represent a powerful tool in landslide susceptibility assessment. To assess landslide
susceptibility, in most cases numerical weighting values are assigned to each class of the
considered causal factors. In assigning weighting values, different approaches can be used.
A first approach is the so-called qualitative or expert-evaluation approach [15]. In this

approach, the expert selects and maps the factors that affect slope stability and, based on
personal experience, assigns to each one a weighted value that is proportionate to its
expected relative contribution in generating failure [2]. Examples of this methodology are
those reported by Amadesi et al. [4], Stevenson [19], Amadesi and Vianello [3], Anbalagan
[5], Abu-zeid et al. [1], Visintainer and Turrini [25], Anbalagan and Singh [6] and Gupta
and Anbalagan [12]. A second approach is of quantitative type and can be based either on
bivariate or multivariate statistical analysis. In bivariate statistical analysis, each causal
factor map is combined with the landslide distribution map and weighting values based on
landslide densities are calculated for each causal factor class [20]. Good examples of this
methodology are those reported by Yin and Yan [28], Pachauri and Pant [17], van Westen
[23, 24], Rautela and Lakhera [18], Uromeihy and Mahdavifar [22], Süzen and Doyuran
[20, 21] and Yalcin [27]. On the other hand, in multivariate statistical analysis, the weights
of causal factors controlling landslide occurrence indicate the relative contribution of each
of these factors to the degree of hazard within a defined land unit [20]. One of the main
advantages of all the above mentioned approaches is the easy updating of the landslide
susceptibility assessment procedure. Furthermore, both the qualitative and the bivariate
statistical approaches are also relatively easy to apply for land-use planning. On the
contrary, the multivariate statistical approach, even if formally more rigorous [2], requires a
deeper knowledge of mathematics, statistics and softwares. Süzen and Doyuran [20] have
found that the two statistical methods (bivariate and multivariate) produce susceptibility
maps which converge approximately in 80% of a given study area. The final result of all the
above described approaches consists in Landslide Susceptibility Maps, obtained by means
of overlay processes in GIS environment which allow to sum the weighting values of
the classes occurring in each point of the investigated area. From the obtained values,
the landslide susceptibility in each point can be inferred by means of a comparison
with the values reported on pre-existing landslide susceptibility classes (e.g., [3, 20]).
In this paper, a landslide susceptibility assessment has been performed by using different
GIS-based methods. Namely, an expert-based and a bivariate statistics-based approach have
been used. The obtained results have been compared and discussed.

The study has been carried out on a 273 km2 wide area located in the Molise region
(Southern Italy), between 41°37′39″N and 41°47′48″N latitude and between 14°36′13″E
and 14°51′01″E longitude, and falling within the Biferno River basin (Fig. 1). The altitude
ranges from 134 m a.s.l. to 965 m a.s.l.

2 Materials and methods

Most part of this study has been performed using the software ESRI ArcView GIS 3.2. In
the first step of the study, both elevation points and contour lines reported on 1:25,000 scale
maps have been digitized, in order to produce a 30 m per pixel Digital Elevation Model,
from which both an aspect map (Fig. 2) and a slope angle map (Fig. 3) have been
automatically derived. The slope angle classes are those suggested by Amadesi and
Vianello [3], expressed in degrees. A lithological map has then been compiled (Fig. 4). On
this map, the data reported on the Geological Map of Italy at 1:100,000 scale [8, 9] and
refined during the field survey have been synthesized and graphically reported. The
outcropping lithotypes have been grouped into “lithological complexes”, which have been
named taking into account both the occurring lithotypes and their relative abundance within
each lithological complex. A land-use map (Fig. 5) has also been produced by integrating
pre-existing data provided by ISPRA (www.apat.gov.it) with original data obtained by

integration of aerial photographs analysis, 1:25,000-scale topographic maps analysis
and field survey has allowed to detect and map the landslides occurring in the study
area. For each landslide,
the scars have been distinguished from the bodies using
classical techniques of geomorphological analysis of the relief. The areas subject to
diffuse landsliding have also been detected and mapped. These latter are areas char-
acterized by a large number of relatively small landslides, in most cases not repre-
sentable to the scale, generally of shallow earth-slide type and often entrenched each
other. In some cases, these areas coincide with large detachment surfaces of older
landslides. The original data have been integrated with those reported in the IFFI
database of

According to Süzen and Doyuran [21], in this study it has been considered that the
best undisturbed geoenvironmental conditions (i.e., conditions before landslide occurs)
would have been extracted from the vicinity of the landslide scar polygons. This has been
achieved by adding a buffer zone on the outside of each landslide scar. Because the
landslides have been mapped on a 1:25,000 scale-map, the width of the buffer has been
set at 30 m. The buffers have then been reported on a Landslide Scars Buffers Map (not
shown), to which we will refer to as LSBM.

The first method used to assess the landslide susceptibility in the study area is based
on a simple statistical bivariate analysis. The LSBM has been combined with each
thematic map. This has allowed to calculate the density of the landslide scars buffers
for both each class of the considered causal factors (lithology, land-use, slope angle and

[23], has been used to calculate the weighting value for each class:

NpixXi=number of pixels that contains a LSB in the class i; NpixNi=number of pixels
within the class i; ΣNpixXi=total number of pixels that contains a LSB in the whole
study area; ΣNpixNi= total number of pixels of the whole study area map. Among
the different
formulas reported in literature and aimed to assess the landslide
susceptibility using bivariate statistics, the one proposed by van Westen [23] is still
the most widely used one (e.g.,

formulas (e.g., [20, 21]) do not differ substantially from the one proposed by the

the weighting values have been
assigned to each class according to Amadesi and Vianello [3]. In this method,
the
lowest weighting values are assigned to those classes determining the highest
instability. We have slightly modified the method originally proposed by the Authors
by considering, as causal factor, the slope aspect instead of the bedding attitude of the
strata. This choice has been due to the fact that, in the study area, very few and,
the strata are
often, strongly contrasting data concerning the bedding attitude of

landslide susceptibility. As regards the use of slope aspect in this study, many Authors
have demonstrated that it is a very important landslide controlling factor (e.g., [7, 26,
27]), as aspect related parameters, such as exposure to sunlight and drying winds, control
the concentration of the soil moisture which, in turn, may control the occurrence of
landslides. Thus, slope aspect is very often used in preparing landslide susceptibility
maps (e.g., [7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 21, 27]). The weighting values assigned according to
the expert-based method at issue are reported in Table 1.

For both the above described methods, the weighting values have been summed for each
point of the study area by means of overlay processes. The obtained ranges of values have
been subdivided into four intervals, corresponding to the four susceptibility classes
suggested by van Westen [23]. This latter step has allowed us to produce, as final results,
two Landslide Susceptibility Maps of the study area (Figs. 7 and 8).

(LSB), highlighted by the highest weighting value (Wi), occurs in areas where the deposits
of the clayey–marly–arenaceous complex crop out (Wi: 1.097), on which the land-use is
pasture (Wi: 0.293), displaying a slope angle >27° (Wi: 0.778) and facing from south to
west (Wi: 0.036). On the contrary, LSB density is particularly low where the deposits of the
landslide complex crop out (Wi: −1.628), on which urban fabric occur (Wi: −0.554),
displaying a slope gradient ranging from 0° to 6° (Wi: −0.841) and facing from east to south
(Wi: −0.068).

The landslide susceptibility map and the relative pie-chart

illustrating the spatial
distribution of the landslide susceptibility classes (Fig. 7) highlight that, using this
method, the landslide susceptibility is moderate-low in the 33% of the study area, low or
very low in the 26%, moderate-high in the 25% and high or very high in the 16%. The
landsurfaces characterized by the highest susceptibility are scattered in the study area,
even if they are mainly concentrated in the south-western sector of the basin, while in the
north-eastern side moderately low susceptible areas generally predominate.

A combination between the landslide inventory map (Fig. 6) and the landslide
susceptibility map produced using the bivariate statistics-based method (Fig. 7) has allowed
to highlight that the percentage of surface of each susceptibility class really consisting of
landslide scars, i.e. areas where landslides have really triggered, increases with the degree
of calculated susceptibility, as expected (Fig. 9a).

The application of the expert-based method ([3], modified) has produced the Landslide
Susceptibility Map reported in Fig. 8. The north-western side of the basin displays a higher
degree of susceptibility than the south-eastern side. The graph of Fig. 8 highlights that,
using this method, 54% of the study area displays a moderate-high susceptibility, 24% a
moderate-low susceptibility, 19% a high or very high susceptibility and only 3% a low or
very low susceptibility.

The combination of

the landslide inventory map (Fig. 6) with the landslide
susceptibility map produced using the expert-based method (Fig. 8) has highlighted that
the percentage of landsurfaces really consisting of landslide scars is the same for both
the areas classified as moderately low susceptible and lowly or very lowly susceptible
(9.3%; Fig. 9b). However, an increasing trend of the percentage at issue with the calculated
degree of susceptibility has been observed for the moderate-low, moderate-high and high or
very high landslide susceptibility classes.

4 Discussion

Geoinformatica (2009) 13:253–265

The preparation of a landslide inventory map is the key starting point of the bivariate
statistics-based method. Thus, a very careful mapping of landslides is a key-factor in using
this method. This statement is also true for all the methodologies based on the spatial
distribution of landslides (e.g., multivariate statistics-based methodologies). In fact, all sorts
of problems in landslide inventory maps will automatically be projected to the final
susceptibility map [7]. Factors such as the quality and scale of both aerial photos and
the degree of experience of the person and the geoenvironmental
topographic maps,
complexity of the study area affect
the reliability and the completeness of landslide
inventory maps [7]. The same considerations can also be made for all the thematic maps,
which are fundamental for most part of the landslide assessment methods.

An advantage which is common in both the methods used in this study is that they allow
an easy updating of both data and landslide susceptibility assessment procedures by using
GIS. Another advantage is that they are absolutely easy to apply for land-use planning and
policies. Aleotti and Chowdhury [2] emphasize the importance of a simple, direct and
easily understood language in landslide susceptibility maps, with the aim to make easier
their practical use. Other methods, such as multivariate statistical analysis and use of neural
networks, are very probably more rigorous than those used in this study, especially because
they take into account
interrelationships between the causal factors of
landsliding. However, they require unquestionably a deeper knowledge of mathematics,
statistics and softwares which, unfortunately, is not common. Furthermore, worthy to note
is the fact that the bivariate statistics-based method can be considered as fully objective as it
is based on a “real”, field-surveyed datum, i.e. the spatial distribution of landslides, which
makes it fairly reliable. On the contrary, the expert-based method used in this study does
not require such a “real” datum, but this latter can be usefully used to verify the accuracy of
the method at issue by means of a combination, in GIS environment, between the Landslide
Susceptibility Maps and the field-surveyed landslide inventory map.

the mutual

Among the methods used in this study, the bivariate statistics-based one has provided
good results, as suggested by the fact
the percentage of the landsurfaces really
that
consisting of landslide scars increases with the calculated susceptibility, as expected
(Fig. 9a). Furthermore, such percentage is very low (5,0%) in areas classified as lowly or
very lowly susceptible, which is a coherent datum.

In the existing literature, most part of the papers dealing with landslide susceptibility
assessment using bivariate statistics often calculates the weighting values on the basis of the
landslide density, i.e. taking into account the number of pixels containing a landslide scar or
a landslide body (e.g. [23, 24, 27]). This could be a possible shortcoming of this approach.
In fact, some parts of the landslide body could be characterized by geonvironmental factors
classes not prone to failure. For instance, very low slope angles generally occurs at
landslide toes. This could increase the landslide density, and thus the weighting value, also
in the geoenvironmental factors classes at issue (e.g., classes of very low slope angles),
inducing an overestimation of the landslide susceptibility. Furthermore, considering the
pixels containing a landslide in calculating the weighting values means to take into account
the combinations of geoenvironmental factors classes occurring on the landslide surface,
which could be very different from those really responsible for the triggering of the
landslide (e.g., slope angle and aspect). Thus, a possible improvement of this method
probably consists in calculating the weighting values taking into account
the spatial
distribution of the areas characterized by the best undisturbed geoenvironmental conditions,
i.e. conditions before landslide occurs [21]. In most cases, such conditions occur in the

Geoinformatica (2009) 13:253–265

263

immediate vicinity of each landslide scar and can be easily extracted, in GIS environment,
by adding a buffer zone on the outside of the polygons containing a landslide scar.

As regards the expert-based method used in this study, the main shortcoming very
probably lies in the high subjectivity of this method in assigning the weighting values. On
the other hand, this method does not require the production of a landslide inventory map.
Thus,
the expert-based method is suitable in preliminarily assessing the landslide
susceptibility over large areas in a relatively short time and at low expense, especially if
pre-existing data are available.

The verification of the landslide susceptibility map produced in this study using the
expert-based method (Fig. 9a) has highlighted that the method at issue is fairly reliable in
discriminating the areas characterized by a high or very high susceptibility from those
moderately susceptible. On the contrary, it seems to fail in discriminating the areas falling
in the low or very low susceptibility class from those characterized by a moderate-low
susceptibility.

The comparison of the landslide susceptibility maps obtained using, respectively, the
bivariate statistics-based method (Fig. 7) and the expert-based method (Fig. 8) points out
that these methods converge only in terms of total area of the landsurfaces characterized
by a high-very high landslide susceptibility; however, the location of these landsurfaces
differ greatly on the two maps. Very different results have also been obtained for both
the total area and the location of most part of the landsurfaces falling into the other
susceptibility classes. Generally speaking,
landslide susceptibility in the
study area results higher using the expert-based method than using the bivariate
statistics-based method.

the overall

5 Conclusions

This study has allowed both to assess the landslide susceptibility in an area located in
Southern Italy using different methods and to compare the obtained results. The used
methods are based on “real”, field-surveyed data, i.e. the spatial distribution of both the
landslides and/or the causal factors, and their application and updating are easy. The
verification procedure, performed by comparing the produced landslide susceptibility maps
with the field-surveyed spatial distribution of the landslide phenomena, highlighted that
most suitable method is probably the bivariate statistics-based one. The second method, of
expert-based type, even if easier and faster to apply than the previous one, has provided a
classification of the study area in terms of landslide susceptibility which does not
completely fit with the surveyed spatial distribution of the landslides. However, even if the
degree of uncertainty is variable, the produced maps represent a first but fundamental step
in land-use planning and in set-up safety measures.

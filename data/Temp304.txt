ABSTRACT
Detailed real-time road data are an important prerequisite for
navigation and intelligent transportation systems. As accident-
prone areas, road intersections play a critical role in route gui-
dance and traﬃc management. Ubiquitous trajectory data have
led to a recent surge in road map reconstruction. However, it is
still challenging to automatically generate detailed structural mod-
els for road intersections, especially from low-frequency trajectory
data. We propose a novel three-step approach to extract the
structural and semantic information of road intersections from
low-frequency trajectories. The spatial coverage of road intersec-
tions is ﬁrst detected based on hotspot analysis and triangulation-
based point clustering. Next, an improved hierarchical trajectory
clustering algorithm is designed to adaptively extract the turning
modes and traﬃc rules of road intersections. Finally, structural
models are generated via K-segment ﬁtting and common subse-
quence merging. Experimental results demonstrate that the pro-
posed method can eﬃciently handle low-frequency, unstable
trajectory data and accurately extract the structural and semantic
features of road intersections. Therefore, the proposed method
provides a promising solution for enriching and updating routable
road data.

1. Introduction

Detailed real-time road data constitute an important prerequisite for navigation, location-
based services, and other smart traﬃc applications. However, conventional road map produc-
tion requires expensive ﬁeld surveys and labour-intensive post processing. Oﬃcial road maps
suﬀer from a long update cycle that can last several months or even years (Kuntzsch et al.
2016). Recently, with the popularisation of GPS-embedded probe vehicles, a large amount of
trajectory data has been collected to record vehicle locations and moving paths. These
increasingly massive trajectory datasets are gradually deﬁning the geometric structures of
urban street networks. Additionally, semantic information (e.g. traﬃc ﬂow, speed limits, and
turning restrictions) can be inferred from these trajectory data. Therefore, increasing focus has

been placed on extracting road-related information from spatio-temporal trajectory data to
complement commercial road datasets (Bruntrup et al. 2005, Jenelius and Koutsopoulos 2013).
A road intersection is deﬁned as the convergence of three or more road branches (Quartieri
et al. 2010) and can be abstracted as a simple node or various complicated structures. A high
percentage of traﬃc accidents occur at complex and diverse road intersection areas (Ibanez-
Guzman et al. 2010), making road intersections a major bottleneck for traﬃc ﬂow and safety.
Therefore, it has become critical to construct detailed structural models of road intersections
and discover the allowable turning modes within them. To the best of our knowledge, most
existing studies are devoted to extracting a road skeleton graph from massive GPS traces and
relatively few attempts have been made to utilise high-frequency trajectory data to detect
road intersections and their associated traﬃc rules (Ahmed et al. 2015, Xie et al. 2017).
However, approximately 60% of taxi trajectory data are collected at low-frequency to save
on energy and communication costs (Zheng et al. 2012). Low-frequency trajectory data have
stability issues as a result of sparse sampling rates and ﬂuctuating positional precision, which
leads to sparse tracking points that may not accurately reﬂect the geometric characteristics of
real traﬃc modes within road intersections (Figure 1). Therefore, it is challenging to utilise
readily available low-frequency trajectory data (20–100 s sampling periods) to generate
detailed structural models of urban road intersections. Here we propose a novel three-step
approach to generate urban road intersection models from low-frequency GPS trajectory data.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews related works on
extracting road information from trajectory data. Section 3 presents the proposed three-step
method for generating urban road intersection models. A set of experimental analyses are
presented in Section 4. Conclusions and future research directions are discussed at the end of
this paper.

studies mainly focused on road skeleton map construction and multiple feasible meth-
ods have been proposed, including rasterisation-based methods, incremental generation
methods, clustering-based methods, and hybrid methods (Cao and Krumm 2009, Shi
et al. 2009, Biagioni and Eriksson 2012, Karagiorgou et al. 2013). Ahmed and Wenk (2012)
presented an incremental generation method based on partial graph matching.
Kuntzsch et al. (2016) and Wang et al. (2015) adopted a divide-and-conquer strategy
for reconstructing road segments and road intersections separately from raw GPS
trajectories. Recently, Tang et al. (2017) employed Delaunay triangulation in an incre-
mental road reﬁnement model.
In general, existing approaches make use of spatial
aggregation of massive vehicle trajectories and practical road segments.

Additionally, some researchers have attempted to generate highly detailed road
structures based on high-accuracy trajectory data (Rogers 2000, Schroedl et al. 2004).
For example, the probability density distributions of trajectories were explored to extract
lane-level road information (e.g. lane numbers, lane centrelines, and turn rules) based on
estimation, Bayesian classiﬁers, or Gaussian mixture models
kernel density
(Uduwaragoda et al. 2013, Tang et al. 2015, 2016). Yang et al. (2017) proposed a fuzzy
logic map matching method for lane-level road change detection. Additionally, some
studies have attempted to acquire road attributes (e.g. directionality, width, and lane
number) and other traﬃc-related information (e.g. speed limit, traﬃc ﬂow, travel time)
from vehicle trajectories (Davies et al. 2006, Zhang et al. 2010, Li et al. 2012, Jenelius and
Koutsopoulos 2013, Winden et al. 2016). John et al. (2017) implemented automatic
derivation of road incline values utilising GPS traces. Ubiquitous spatio-temporal trajec-
tory data is extremely helpful for obtaining informative road models.

In contrast, less attention has been paid to extracting road intersections from trajectory
data. Some studies have analysed the travelling direction changes of track points at road
intersections (Fathi and Krumm 2010, Karagiorgou and Pfoser 2012). For example, similarity
based on the longest common subsequence (LCSS) and dissimilarity based on a ‘turn’ density
grid were utilised to detect rough locations and boundaries of road intersections (Wang et al.
2017, Xie et al. 2017). The traﬃc elements within intersections (e.g. traﬃc lights, turning
direction, time, and path) have been extracted based on hierarchical clustering, force-attrac-
tion-based models, and deep learning technologies (Wang et al. 2017, Munoz-Organero et al.
2018). The road intersections extracted from coarse-gained trajectories were mostly simple
crossroads (Wu et al. 2013, Li et al. 2017) and only rough road intersection models have been
generated from high-quality trajectory data. Few studies have focused on generating detailed
road intersection models from low-frequency trajectory data.

Because of the sparse sampling rate and ﬂuctuating positional precision of low-frequency
trajectories, it is diﬃcult to directly derive detailed road intersection models utilising only
point/trajectory clustering or shape ﬁtting methods. Therefore, we adopt a divide-and-con-
quer strategy to propose a novel three-step method to generate urban road intersection
models utilising low-frequency trajectory data. The proposed method attempts to appropri-
ately utilise the spatial aggregation characteristics of track points/lines to extract rough spatial
coverages, internal turning modes, and precise structural representations of road intersections.
The main contributions of the proposed method are as follows: (1) the longest common sub-
track (LCST) and a distance-direction function are combined to measure total trajectory
similarity and mitigate the eﬀects of a sparse sampling rate, (2) the Davies-Bouldin (DB)
index is introduced to adaptively extract the allowable turning modes within road

intersections, and (3) structural models of urban road intersections are delineated via
K-segment principle curve ﬁtting to improve robustness for handling coarse-gained trajec-
tories with ﬂuctuating positional precision.

3. Generating road intersection models from low-frequency trajectory data

Steady-moving trajectories at intersections often show similar spatial and semantic
intersection traﬃc. Based on this correlation, we propose a
characteristics to actual
novel three-step approach to model road intersections as a network graph with turning
constraints. The three steps are spatial coverage detection, turning mode identiﬁcation,
and structural model generation.

3.1. Detecting spatial coverages of road intersections based on hotspot analysis
and point clustering

Based on the ‘connect’ property, trajectories at road intersections and non-intersection
roadways can be diﬀerentiated according to their turning direction changes. However,
determining a speciﬁc turning angle threshold is not feasible (Wang et al. 2015). In the
proposed method, data preprocessing is ﬁrst performed to eliminate trajectories with
extreme quality issues. Next, a local G* statistic (Ord and Getis 1995) is calculated to
detect candidate points for road intersections. Finally, the spatial coverage of each road
intersection is determined via adaptive point clustering.

As depicted in Figure 2(a,b), as a result of instable positioning or sparse sampling,
low-density and abnormal-distance trajectories are too sparse to correctly describe the
geometries of roads. These trajectories are ﬁltered out by a kernel density threshold
thresh and distance threshold maxdis, respectively. Additionally, as shown in Figure 2(c),
some abnormal-turning trajectories contain more than Nc successive track points with
larger turning angles (e.g. > 45°), meaning they are unlikely to reﬂect steady driving
behaviours in public road regions. Those abnormal-turning trajectories are excluded to
avoid erroneous extraction results.

Following data preprocessing, a local G* statistic is introduced to identify spatial
aggregations of large turning angles (Wang et al. 2015). A G* statistic describes the
local correlations of spatial variables within a particular spatial range (Ord and Getis

1995). Consider a single track point Pi = (idi, xi, yi, ti, hi, vi), where idi is the vehicle’s
licence plate number, (xi, yi) are the spatial coordinates, ti records the tracked time, hi
denotes the heading direction, and vi is the vehicle’s driving speed. The turning angle of
Pi in the trajectory T = {Pi | i = 1. . .m} is deﬁned as ai = |hi+1-hi|. The local G* statistic of the
turning angle at Pi is calculated as follows:

where N is the neighbouring point number of Pi, wij denotes the distance-based weight
between two neighbouring points Pj and Pi, and aj is the turning angle of Pj. The spatial
neighbouring range is typically set to 125 m based on average intersection size.

In statistics, a hotspot with a high G* value represents a concentration of high
variable values, whereas a cold spot with a low G* value represents a concentration of
low variable values. Therefore, intersections can be expressed as hotspot areas with high
G* values for turning direction. Under the assumption of a random distribution, 1.68,
1.95, and 2.58 (for signiﬁcance levels of 1%, 0.5%, and 0.01%, respectively) are three
widely used z-score thresholds for G*-based hotspot analysis. The paper considers the
unstable qualities of low-frequency trajectory data and utilises a stricter signiﬁcance
level threshold of 0.01%. Based on two thresholds of ± 2.58, track points are classiﬁed as
hotspots, cold spots, and others. Hotspots are then selected as the candidate points for
road intersections (shown in Figure 3(a)).

Hotspot detection analysis clearly discriminates intersection points and non-intersection
points. Next, the adaptive spatial clustering algorithm based on Delaunay triangulation
(ASCDT) by Deng et al. (2011) is utilised to partition the hotspots into diﬀerent road intersec-
tions. Despite diﬀerent street levels and various trajectory densities, the ASCDT considers
spatial heterogeneous densities and achieves good performance for identifying robust clusters
of diﬀerent shapes. The ASCDT method consists of the following four essential steps:

Step 1: Construct Delaunay triangulation (DT) for all hotspots.
Step 2: Calculate the global threshold GlobalLong of each point Pi according to
Equation (2) and delete any directly connected edges of Pi with lengths longer than
GlobalLong.

where mean(DT) represents the mean edge length in the DT, variation(DT) represents the
standard deviation of edge lengths in the DT, mean1(Pi) represents the mean edge
length directly connected to Pi, and α is a shrink factor set to 1.0 by default.

Step 3: Construct k sub-graphs G1. . .Gi. . . of DT after deleting global long edges.
Step 4: Calculate the local threshold LocalLong of each point Pj in each sub-graph Gi
according to Equation (3) and delete any local long edges with lengths longer than
LocalLong.

Step 5: Obtain hotspot clusters from the retained sub-graphs after deleting local long

edges.

The hotspot clusters with more than minpts hotspots are selected as candidate clusters for
road intersections. Each cluster corresponds to an intersection and the smallest circumscribed
circle of hotspots represents the spatial coverage of that road intersection. As shown in
Figure 3(b), hotspots in the same colour represent a candidate cluster linked to one intersec-
tion, grey hotspots denote outlier clusters with less than or equal to minpts hotspots, and red
circles represent the spatial coverages of diﬀerent intersections.

3.2 Identifying turning modes within road intersections via hierarchical
trajectory clustering

After detecting the spatial coverage of each road intersection, the next step is to identify the
turning modes within each intersection. Drivers must comply with turning restrictions at
speciﬁc intersection points when they pass through a road intersection. Therefore, trajectories
within road intersections provide valuable clues for inferring the internal turning modes at
intersections. Initially, track lines within the spatial coverage of an intersection are deﬁned as
the associated trajectory segments for that intersection. Next, the similarities between asso-
ciated trajectory segments are calculated to form a dissimilarity matrix for an intersection.
Finally, hierarchical trajectory clustering based on the DB index is performed to extract the
internal turning modes for each road intersection.

3.2.1. Similarity measurement between two associated trajectory segments
Considering the fact that coarse sample trajectories show large geometric inconsistency,
LCST similarity and the distance-direction function are integrated to measure the total
similarity between associated trajectory segments. The LCST between two associated
trajectory segments T1 and T2 is deﬁned as the longest sub-track in which T1 and T2 are
close to each other. As a result of sampling diversity, the track points of T1 and T2 do not
correspond to each other directly (shown in Figure 4(a)). Therefore, we must resample
them as T1 = {p1. . .pi. . .pm} and T2 = {q1. . .qj. . .qn}, which meet the condition |pipi+1| = |qjqj
+1| = dl. Then, the common sub-tracks lcst1 of T1 matching with T2 are deﬁned as follows:

(cid:9)

lcst1 ¼ si 2 T1j"pj 2 si; dist ðpj; T2Þ <r

(cid:10)

;

where si is one sub-track of T1, pj is one track point in si, and dist(pj, T2) denotes the
shortest distance between pj and T2. r is a predeﬁned distance threshold.

Similarly, the common sub-tracks of T2 matching with T1 are deﬁned as lcst2. As illustrated in
Figure 4(b), lcst1 contains two sub-tracks {pi. . .pj} and {pi’. . .pj’}, and lcst2 contains two sub-tracks
{qs. . .qt} and {ps’. . .qt’}. The LCST similarity between T1 and T2 is computed as follows:

where |Ti| is the length of Ti and |lcsti| is the length of lcsti, calculated as |lcsti| = ∑|sj|, sj ∈
lcsti.

LCST similarity measures the shape features of two associated trajectory segments,
but travelling direction is another important factor for distinguishing diﬀerent turning
modes at intersections. We developed a distance-direction function to measure the
heading direction similarity between two associated trajectory segments. For one tra-
jectory segment T1 = {P1. . .Pm}, the distance-direction function F1(x) is described as a
piecewise linear function in Equation (6).

direction of Pi, and Δxi (Δhi) denotes the diﬀerence between xi+1 and xi (hi+1 and hi).

For example, T1 = {P1. . .Pi. . .Pm} and T2 = {P1. . .Pj. . .Pn} in Figure 5(a) are two associated
trajectory segments in one intersection and their distance-direction functions F1(x) and

The overall similarity between two associated trajectory segments is computed as sim(T1,

intersection, the dissimilarity matrix is formed as D = (dij)N×N, dij = 1–sim(Ti, Tj).

3.2.2. Hierarchical trajectory clustering of internal turning modes
To mine the internal turning modes at an intersection, the DB index is introduced into
the hierarchical clustering algorithm proposed by Müllner (2013), which is comprised of
the following key steps:

Step 1: Initialise each trajectory segment as one cluster and calculate the dissimila-

rities between each pair of clusters utilising Equation (9);

Step 2: Merge the two most similar clusters (i.e. pair with the minimum dissimilarity)

into a single cluster.

Equation (9).

Step 3: Recalculate the dissimilarities between new clusters and old clusters utilising

Step 4: Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until all clusters are merged into a single cluster.

For all associated trajectory segments at one intersection, a hierarchical tree is
constructed utilising the above hierarchical clustering process. The next critical issue is
to select the optimal number of turning mode clusters. Davies and Bouldin (1979)
proposed a feasible evaluation metric called the DB index. According to Equation (10),
the smaller the intra-cluster dispersion and larger the inter-cluster separation, the
smaller the DB index is. Therefore, the smallest DB index represents the best clustering
result, which eﬃciently balances the compactness of individual clusters and the isolation
degree between various clusters.

where K is the total number of clusters, vi (vj) denotes the centroid of cluster Ci (Cj), and

Therefore, we calculate the DB index with diﬀerent cluster numbers n1~ n2 and select
the value with the smallest DB index as the ﬁnal cluster number. For all associated
trajectory segments at each intersection, the above DB-based hierarchical clustering is
performed to ﬁnd the optimal clusters of internal turning modes at that intersection.

(i.e. |θ2-θ1|≈ 180°), then T is considered as a ‘U-turn’ turning mode (Figure 6(a)).

3.2.3. Turning restriction rules inference for diﬀerent turning modes
The turning restriction rules at intersections can guarantee a safe, harmonious, orderly,
and convenient traﬃc environment. In this paper, four turning rules (i.e. right turn, left
turn, going straight, and U-turn) are summarised to describe the turning restriction rules
within road intersections. Suppose one turning mode at one intersection contains one
associated trajectory segment T = {P1. . .Pm} (m > 2), where P1 and Pm are the starting and
ending points. Then, the schemes for turning rule inference are formulated as follows:
U-turn: if the heading direction diﬀerence between P1 and Pm is approximately 180°
(cid:12)(cid:12)! (1 < i < m) are negative, meaning all middle
points are to the right of P1Pm, then T is considered as a ‘Left-Turn’ turning mode
(Figure 6(b)).
(cid:12)(cid:12)! (1 < i < m) are positive, meaning all middle
points are to the left of P1Pm, then T is considered as a ‘Right-Turn’ turning mode
(Figure 6(c)).
(cid:12)(cid:12)! (1 < i < m) are approximately zero,
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)! (cid:6) p1pi
meaning all middle points are approximately on the line of P1Pm, then T is considered
as a ‘Going-Straight’ turning mode (Figure 6(d)).

Going-Straight: if all z-values of p1pm

Right-Turn: if all z-values of p1pm

All trajectory segments in one turning mode cluster are judged individually according
to the above schemes. The ﬁnal turning restriction rule for each turning mode cluster is
then identiﬁed as the one with the largest percentage. In practice, one intersection may

contain several turning mode clusters, which are analysed individually to determine the
turning restriction rules at that intersection.

3.3. Generating structural models for road intersections via K-segment
principle curve ﬁtting

Similarly, based on the turning mode clusters, the turning paths can be delineated to
generate a structural model of an entire road intersection. Wang et al. (2017) utilised a
force attraction model to merge trajectory curves into a central path. The authors stated
that as a result of positional ﬂuctuations and sampling sparsity, low-frequency trajec-
tories may not accurately reﬂect real turning paths. Moreover, the common sub-
sequences between diﬀerent turning paths were not logically merged to construct a
structural intersection model. We attempt to ﬁt the turning paths of diﬀerent turning
modes based on discrete track points and merge common sub-sequences between
diﬀerent turning paths to generate a structural intersection model.

3.3.1. Fitting turning paths for diﬀerent turning modes
As shown in Figure 7(a,b), discrete track points seem to create a better delineation of
road skeletons than track lines. Therefore, instead of utilising the trajectory merging
method proposed by Wang et al. (2017), we utilised discrete track points to extract the
turning paths at intersections. The K-segment principle curve ﬁtting method proposed
by Verbeek et al. (2002) provides a feasible solution to delineate the skeletons of discrete
track points for correctly ﬁtting complex road intersections (Figure 7(c)).

Let P = {p1. . .pm} be the track points in one turning mode cluster and f = {si|
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)!, i = 1. . .k} be the ﬁtted K-segment principle curve. The framework for

3.3.2. Merging common sequences of diﬀerent turning paths
Because there may be multiple ﬁtted turning paths for one intersection, it is necessary to
merge common sub-sequences of multiple turning paths to construct a structural road
intersection model. This merging process can be divided into two typical schemes:

3.3.2.1. Merging ‘straight’ common sub-sequences. There are various straight com-
mon sub-sequences between ‘going straight’ and ‘non-straight’ turning paths. We delete
common sub-sequences of non-straight paths and extend other sub-sequences that are
not common to connect to going straight turning paths. As shown in Figure 8(a), the
common sub-sequences of the non-straight path L1 are deleted and other sub-
sequences that are not common are extended to connect to the going straight paths
L2 and L3.

3.3.2.2. Merging ‘curved’ common sub-sequences. There are various curved common
sub-sequences between non-straight turning paths. A centre line is calculated to replace
curved common sub-sequences moving in the same direction and the entrances and
exits are extended to connect to the centre line. For example, three annular paths L1, L2,
and L3 (Figure 8(b)) are merged into the centre line (Figure 8(c)). The entrance and exit
nodes are also identiﬁed for vehicle route guidance.

4. Experimental analyses

In this section we present an evaluation of the new method, using an implementation
written for MATLAB. The aforementioned street network construction algorithm pro-
posed by Ahmed and Wenk (2012) is used to compare with our method. The Chicago
Campus bus dataset (approximately 3.8 km × 2.4 km) and a taxi trajectory dataset (about
12.0 km × 7.0 km) from Wuhan, China were selected to verify the proposed method

(Figure 9). The Chicago dataset has a sample rate of 3.61 s and contains 889 traces and
118,364 track points. The Wuhan dataset has a median sample interval of 60 s and a
positional precision of 5–20 m with approximately 600,000 track points and 5061 traces.
One can see from the experimental parameter settings (Table 1) that most para-
meters are identical for both experimental datasets, despite the diﬀerent sampling rates
and street levels. However, there are some diﬀerences. For the Chicago dataset, thres, Nc,
maxdis, and dl are not required because the sampling rate is suﬃciently high. For the
Wuhan dataset, thres was empirically set to 5% of the maximum kernel density and Nc
was set to ﬁve points. In consideration of the median sampling rate (approximately 60 s)
and maximum speed limit (80 km/h), maxdis was set to 80 km/h × 60 s ≈ 1.3 km. The
minimum point number for one hotspot cluster minpts was uniformly set to ﬁve. The
resampling length dl and distance threshold r for LCST similarity calculation were both
empirically set to 25 m based on the average road width. Finally, the cluster number

4.1. Experimental results

4.1.1. Detection of road intersections
The spatial coverages of road intersections in Chicago and Wuhan are presented in
Figures 10 and 11, respectively. The smallest circumscribed circle for each hotspot
cluster expresses the spatial coverage of each road intersection. The coverages are
labelled as correctly detected, incorrectly detected, correctly excluded, and not detected
by manual
inspection with reference road data. Greater than 95% of the detected
hotspots were true intersection points, indicating that the G*-based hotspot analysis
can correctly distinguish a variety of
roadways.
Furthermore, although there are various road intersections with diﬀerent sizes and
distances, most intersections were distinctly identiﬁed as individual hotspot clusters,
demonstrating the robustness of ASCDT clustering for detecting road intersections.
Additionally, two vertically separated roadways were also correctly diﬀerentiated from
road intersections because no large-turning hotspots were detected (Figure 11(d)).

road intersections from other

However, the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of trajectory data may lead to some road
intersections not being detected by our method. For example, intersections A and B in
Figure 10 were not correctly identiﬁed because the observed trajectories travelled nearly
straight and no hotspots were detected. Additionally, the proposed method considers
the fact that a limited number of trajectories is insuﬃcient for inferring the presence of

road intersections and omitted the intersections in the dashed ellipse in Figure 10. This
issue can be solved by obtaining a longer time series of trace data.

Finally, a few false intersections were identiﬁed by our method where moving
trajectories showed similar patterns to true road intersections. When vehicles pass
large turning changes
through a fuel station or winding roadways (Figure 11(c,e)),
may be observed, leading to many track points being detected as hotspots.

4.1.2. Structural models of road intersections
The generated structural models of road intersections in Chicago and Wuhan (Figures 12
and 13) reveal that the internal turning modes within intersections (including entrances,
exits, and connections) are adaptively identiﬁed, prompting the reconstruction of a
routable road map. Additionally, good shape and position consistency can be observed
between the extracted intersections and background satellite images, demonstrating
that K-segment ﬁtting can accurately delineate the geometries of various road intersec-
tions. To summarise, the proposed method is able to correctly and robustly extract the
geometric shapes and topological structures of various road intersections.

Table 2 lists the inferred traﬃc rules of intersection C and D from Figure 13. The
turning mode at overpass C was semantically formalised as ‘left turn: from west to north’
and that at roundabout D was semantically formalised as ‘from a to d’. The turning angle
Δθ denotes the average heading direction diﬀerence between the entrance and exit
points. It can be observed that the inferred traﬃc rules for left turn, right turn, going
straight, and U-turn closely match the ground truth of traﬃc restrictions. These rules can
provide auxiliary information for route guidance at accident-prone road intersections.

4.2. Results evaluation and parameter analysis

4.2.1. Results evaluation
Three indicators, namely precision, recall, and F-value, were computed utilising
Equation (13) to quantitatively evaluate our method and the aforementioned method
proposed by Ahmed and Wenk (2012). As shown in Table 3, the proposed method
achieved a signiﬁcantly higher precision value and F-value than the method by
Ahmed and Wenk (2012), which demonstrates superior performance for detecting
road intersections. The recall value of our method was higher than that of the
method by Ahmed and Wenk (2012) for the Chicago dataset, but lower than that
of the method by Ahmed and Wenk (2012) for the Wuhan dataset. This is because
there is a dominant percentage of low-density or single-direction moving trajectories
in the Wuhan dataset.

Turning modes are essential elements of a structural intersection model. Therefore,
for each intersection, the accuracy of the turning modes was calculated as the ratio of
the number of turning modes correctly recognised by our method over the number of
turning modes manually interpreted from satellite images (Table 4). For nearly 50% of
the intersections in Wuhan, over 80% of their turning modes were correctly recognised

adaptively mining internal turning modes. However,
for
approximately 50% of the intersections, less than 20% of the turning modes were
correctly extracted. This may be a result of the ﬁxed-route characteristics of the
Chicago campus bus dataset.

in the Chicago dataset,

Figure 14 illustrates several road intersection models generated by the proposed
method and the method by Ahmed and Wenk (2012), as well as the corresponding
benchmark data (http://mapconstruction.org) or OSM data. One can see that the
geometric deviations between our generated intersection models and reference road
data are clearly smaller than those for the model by Ahmed and Wenk (2012).
Additionally, the topological connectivity relationships and turning paths within
intersections were eﬃciently constructed by our method, but partially missed by
the method by Ahmed and Wenk (2012).

4.2.2. Parameter analysis
Hotspot clustering is a key step for detecting road intersections. Based on the G*
threshold for a speciﬁed signiﬁcance level, many hotspots are selected as candidate
points for intersections. The comparative results of hotspot detection for diﬀerent

signiﬁcance levels are presented in Figure 15(a-c). Based on the unstable qualities of
trajectory data, a G* threshold of 2.58 under a stricter signiﬁcance level 0.01 is able to
correctly exclude many outlier track points and provide relatively reliable hotspot
detection results.

However, a ﬁxed G* threshold is not feasible to ensure that detected hotspots are
true intersection points. Therefore, the ASCDT algorithm was implemented to extract
individual intersections and their spatial coverages. By deleting global and local long
edges, outlier clusters with diﬀerent densities, shapes, and sizes are eﬃciently deleted
and the retained clusters provide a good representation of intersections (Figure 15(d-f)).
Although LCSS similarity (Vlachos et al. 2002) is based on two ordered point sequences,
it is not reasonable to measure low-frequency trajectories with diﬀerent directions.
Therefore, we integrated LCST similarity and the distance-direction function into a com-
bined trajectory similarity measurement. The combined similarity of two traces in opposite
directions is appropriately calculated as zero (Figure 15(a)), but the traditional LCSS
similarity measurement is still 0.25. Similarly, for two traces with a few common sequences
(Figure 16(b)), LCSS similarity reaches a value as large as 0.75, but our combined similarity
provides a more rational value of 0.42. This indicates the combined similarity provides a
more comprehensive measurement of low-frequency trajectories.

Another critical parameter is the optimal cluster number for hierarchical trajectory cluster-
ing. The optimal cluster number cannot be predeﬁned because it is related to the internal
turning modes at road intersections. However, the DB index is deﬁned as the ratio of intra-
cluster dispersion to inter-cluster separation. This means that the optimal clustering result is
theoretically achieved when the DB index is minimised. For intersection E in Figure 13, the
calculated DB indices with diﬀerent cluster numbers [n1, n2] = [2, 40] are presented in Figure 17.
The DB index reaches its minimum value of 0.2721 when the cluster number K is 12. The

obtained turning mode clusters with cluster numbers of 5, 12, and 13 are presented in
Figure 18(a,c,e), respectively. The trajectory segments involved in diﬀerent clusters are pre-
sented in Figure 18(b,d,f). It is clear that when the cluster number K is 12 with a minimum DB
index, the six obtained clusters are well matched to the turning modes at intersection E.
However, when K is 5, cluster1 of ‘North to West’ and cluster4 of ‘West to South’ in Figure 18(d)
are merged into cluster5 in Figure 18(a). When K is 13, cluster2 of ‘North to South’ in Figure 18
(d) is divided into cluster1 and cluster2 in Figure 18(f). This demonstrates that the proposed DB-
based hierarchical trajectory can adaptively and correctly extract internal turning modes within
road intersections, providing a feasible solution for detailed road intersection map
construction.

5. Conclusions

The availability of increasingly massive trajectory data has introduced new opportunities
and challenges to road map production. In this paper, we presented a novel three-step
approach to generate detailed road intersection information from ubiquitous low-fre-
quency trajectory data. The proposed method mines the spatial aggregation patterns of
track points/lines to detect rough regions for road intersections, extracts internal turning

modes within intersections, and generates structural graph representations for indivi-
dual intersections. The main contributions of the proposed method are as follows:

● The combination of LCST and a distance-direction function provide an excellent

solution for measuring the similarity between low-quality trajectories.

● DB-based hierarchical trajectory clustering makes it feasible to adaptively infer

internal turning modes within road intersections;

● K-segment principle curve ﬁtting guarantees highly detailed models of routable

road intersections.

In summary, the proposed method represents a considerable advancement for gen-
erating or enriching highly detailed road maps. Future research will focus on improving
the robustness of our method to handle large spatio-temporal heterogeneous trajectory
data and perform automatic generation and continuous enrichment of highly detailed
road networks.

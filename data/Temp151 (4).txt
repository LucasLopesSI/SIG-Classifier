Abstract. Quantitative surface analysis through quadratic modelling of Digital
Elevation Models (DEMs) is a promising tool for automatically describing the
physical environment in ecological studies of terrestrial landscapes. Fundamental
topographic variables such as slope, aspect, plan and proﬁle curvature can be
simply calculated from the parameters of a conic equation ﬁtted to a DEM
window through the least-squares method. The scale of the analysis, deﬁned by
the size of the DEM window used to ﬁt the conic equation, affects both the
estimated value of the topographic variables and the propagation of elevation
errors to derived topographic variables. The least-squares method is amenable
to the analytical treatment of the propagation of elevation errors to the derived
topographical variables. A general analytical model of error propagation is
presented that accounts
spatial
autocorrelation in elevation errors. The method is based on the Taylor
approximation of the least-square ﬁtting equation and allows for the presence of
stationary autocorrelation in the elevation errors. In numerical simulations with
DEMs from British Columbia, Canada, it is shown that increasing the size of
evaluation windows effectively reduces the propagation of elevation errors to
the derived topographic variables. However, this was obtained at the expense
of topographic detail. A methodology is proposed to evaluate quantitatively
the loss of topographic detail through a x2-test of the corrected residuals in the
immediate neighbourhood of

combination with the analytical model of error propagation, can be used to

Introduction
Quantitative surface analysis (Moore et al. 1991, Pike 2000) is a very promising
tool for scientists and managers interested in landscape ecology and predictive
the
vegetation modelling. The objective of quantitative surface analysis
description of a range of topographic variables (such as slope, aspect, planar
and proﬁle curvature) for a digital surface through a variety of algorithms (Evans
1980, Haralick 1983, Zevenbergen and Thorne 1987, Li and De Dapper 1996).
Topographic variables relate directly to hydrological ﬂows, solar radiation, soil
development, productivity and vegetation, and can be used to predict vegetation
cover, both in conjunction with remote sensing data (Florinsky 1998a), and
independently of it (Florinsky and Kuryakova 1996, Ostendorf and Reynolds
1998). The inclusion of quantitative surface analysis algorithms in commonly used
desktop geographical information science (GIS) packages has vastly increased their
availability to landscape ecology investigators. For instance, ESRI’s ArcView GIS
includes routines for the calculation of surface curvature based on the algorithm of
Zevenbergen and Thorne (1987), Idrisi32 incorporates a topographic analysis
module based on the algorithms of Pellegrini
(1995), while Wood’s (1996)
algorithms are available in the freely distributed LandSerf software package.

However, the ability to perform surface analysis should not be confused with
the ability to calculate reliable, unbiased topographic variables. Both data quality
and scale are critical issues that must be addressed when using surface analysis
algorithms of any type. Scale is critical to any application of quantitative surface
analysis: topographic variables like slope and aspect are continuously varying over
the real landscape, and what is actually measured, even in the ﬁeld, is the average
slope or average aspect over a certain area. The size of this area determines the
scale of our measurement, and should be chosen based on what we expect to be
the relevant scale of, for example, the ecological processes inﬂuenced by the
topographic variables (Florinsky and Kuryakova 2000).

When calculating topographic variables from a Digital Elevation Model
(DEM), the choice of scale is constrained by the DEM resolution, as well as by the
elevation errors present in any DEM. As with all GIS data, DEMs are affected by
errors of different kinds and origin (Aspinall and Pearson 1996). In the case of
DEMs, the size and spatial structure of elevation errors are particularly inﬂuenced
by the speciﬁc DEM structure, by its original accuracy speciﬁcations and by the
DEM production process (Brunsen and Olsen 1978, Kok and Rangayyan 1987,
Hassan 1988, Carrara et al. 1997, Guth 1999). Elevation errors propagate through
any quantitative surface analysis, affecting the accuracy of the derived variables
(Heuvelink 1998a, Lee et al. 1992, Bolstad and Stowe 1994), depending on the
algorithms used (Florinsky 1998b, Skidmore 1989, Garbrecht and Martz 1994), on
the spatial distribution of elevation errors (Heuvelink 1998a, Fisher 1991, 1998, Lee
et al. 1992, Bolstad and Stowe 1994, Hunter and Goodchild 1997, Liu and Jezek
1999), and on the spatial resolution of the DEM (Gao 1998, Garbrecht and Martz
1994, Florinsky 2002). Lastly, the propagation of elevation errors can be controlled
by the choice of the scale of analysis, either by ﬁltering of the surface in the
frequency domain (Pellegrini 1995) or by using larger evaluation windows (Wood
1996).

The choice of surface analysis algorithms and analysis scale are often the only
elements under the control of natural resource scientists and managers, who

generally work with agency-produced DEMs. It
to
understand the impact of manipulating these elements on the ﬁnal outcome.
Different choices of algorithm and scale of analysis can be compared through
Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis (Heuvelink 1998a). Monte Carlo
simulation is based on the perturbation of the DEM with an appropriate error
model, which can assume various degrees of complexity (Hunter and Goodchild
1997, Fisher 1998, Heuvelink 1998a, Wechsler 1999, Ehlschlaeger 2002), and
impose a high computational burden, especially for analyses performed over large
landscapes and at a wide range of scales.

An alternative to Monte Carlo simulation is the use of an analytical model of
error propagation (Heuvelink 1998a). Analytical models of error propagation are
based on the Taylor expansion approach: the algorithm is expanded about its mean
to a Taylor series and the statistical moments are directly calculated. As Heuvelink
(1998b) notes: ‘There is no perfect, easy method to analyse the propagation of
errors in spatial modelling with GIS. Nonetheless, it can be done and the available
methods [Taylor series and Monte Carlo simulation] are in a sense complementary’.
The present approach, described below, complements and supplements
the
approach taken in most DEM error analyses (e.g. Monte Carlo simulation
modelling) by focusing attention on the exact form of the algorithms being used,
and on the sensitivities of those algorithms to implementation speciﬁcs. For further
discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods of error
propagation, see Heuvelink (1998a, pp. 36–45).

The following sections present a general analytical model of error propagation
topographic variables computed using the method of
for four fundamental
quadratic approximation of the topographic surface (Evans 1980, Wood 1996,
1998), an approach that is particularly robust to the presence of elevation errors
(Florinsky 1998b). The present paper then explores the effect of DEM errors on the
accuracy of topographic variables as well as the interaction between DEM accuracy
and the scale of analysis, expressed by the size of the quadratic approximation
window. It also suggests a methodology to summarize the generalization introduced
when using larger window sizes in the analysis.

2. Quadratic approximation of topographic surfaces

Slope, aspect, proﬁle and plan curvature are basic topographic variables that
can be deﬁned for any continuous and double-differentiable surface (Evans 1980).
To estimate them from a DEM, it is necessary to convert the gridded elevations of
the DEM into a continuous and double-differentiable surface. While several
methods have been proposed and used by GIS researchers and analysts, the
quadratic approximation approach (Evans 1980) provides the most precise estimate
of topographic variables in the presence of elevation errors (Florinsky 1998b). The
present authors recognize that Evans’s approach might not be the most suitable
approach in all
in some water resources
applications, the steepest downward ﬂow path (Fairﬁeld and Leymarie 1991) might
be a more meaningful ‘slope’ than the slope estimated using Evans’s method (for a
comparison of the algorithms used to compute the slope, see Jones 1998).

instances, however. For example,

This method approximates the terrain surface using a conic equation of the

where z is the elevation, and x and y are the coordinates of the point in the
reference plane.

At coordinates x~0, y~0, the slope G, aspect A, proﬁle curvature kr and plan
curvature kl can all be calculated from the parameters of the conic equation (Wood
1996):

where the curvature terms are multiplied by 100 to express them as per cent
gradient per unit length.

Using equation (1), it is relatively simple to estimate the parameter of the conic
equation from a regularly spaced grid. In Evans’s (1980) original application, the
terrain surface parameters were estimated at every node of the DEM grid using a
363 window, or nine-elevation measurements. With nine-elevation measurements,
equation (1) can be solved using a least-squares method with two degrees of
freedom. Wood (1996) generalized Evans’s approach to a square window whose
side can be any odd integer. Wood’s approach has the advantage of enabling the
analysis of terrain surface at multiple scales, using the conic equation to generalize
the terrain surface. This generalization has the function of ﬁltering out high-
frequency noise, and supersedes the use of a moving average ﬁlter or a ﬁlter in the
frequency domain.

Another advantage of the quadratic modelling approach is the possibility of
using a weighting matrix to reduce the inﬂuence of the points at the margins of the
ﬁtted surface (Wood 1996). A Gauss-like weighting function of the form is
proposed:

(cid:2) (cid:3)
D2

{

,

wi~e

where Di is the Euclidean distance (in grid cells) of element i from the centre of the
window, h is the maximum distance along one side of the evaluation window and r
is a decay parameter. This weighting function has a different decay shape than
Wood’s (1996) function. It is scaled on the window size, so that the weight
distribution in terms of relative window position is constant, and the window size
and r are the only factors deﬁning the scale of observation.

Once a weight matrix has been built, the parameters of the quadratic function

which is accomplished by inverting the ﬁrst matrix (Wood 1996). Expressing
equation (4) in its general matrix format and solving for the parameter vector p, one

obtains:

{1X0Z,

where X is the matrix of the independent variables (weighted coordinates), Z is the
vector of dependent variables (elevations) and p is the vector of the parameters {a,
b, c, d, e, f}. The regular nature of the DEM grid requires only one inversion of the
matrix for any combination of window size and weight matrix. This
is
in the application of quadratic surface
computationally very advantageous
modelling over large DEMs. By centring an evaluation window on each node of
the DEM, solving the system described by equation (5) and plugging the result into
equation (2), the topographic variables can be calculated for all those DEM nodes
where portions of the evaluation window do not fall outside the DEM edge.

3. Propagation of DEM errors to the topographic variables

Using the quadratic approximation method described above, one can now study
how elevation errors propagate to the calculation of topographic variables. The
propagation of DEM errors to topographic variables has generally been dealt with
using error modelling and stochastic simulations (e.g. Fisher 1997, Hunter and
Goodchild 1997, Heuvelink 1998a, Ehlschlaeger 2002). In the speciﬁc case of Evans’s
(1980) approach, Florinsky (1998b) produced formulas to calculate the Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) of topographic variables using a ﬁrst-order Taylor approxima-
tion. While the formulas of Florinsky (1998b) are limited to the case of a 363
evaluation window, in the absence of any weighting function and with elevation errors
with no autocorrelation, it is possible to use the Taylor expansion approach to evaluate
the propagation of elevation errors through the quadratic approximation method in
the case of any evaluation window size, weighting function and stationary error
autocorrelation.

Assuming spatial

independence of the errors, the general formula for the

variance of a parameter p of the conic is (Florinsky 1998b, Heuvelink 1998a):

size and weights structure on the variance of the parameters of the conic equation.
Note that despite apparent similarities, there is an important conceptual difference
between equation (8), the calculation of the variance of p and the calculation of the
variance of the regression parameters in multiple regression: the assumption of
multiple regression is that the scatter of Z around the least-square surface is due to an
error term e that is estimated from the observations Z (Dillon and Goldstein 1984).
Equation (8) instead considers the case of a perturbation of Z by a speciﬁed error
model that is independent of the actual scatter of Z around the regression surface.

Equations (6–8) assume the absence of spatial correlation in elevation errors.
This
is an extremely unlikely occurrence (Fisher 1998, Heuvelink 1998a).
Considering the case of Taylor expansion with spatial autocorrelation between
random variables, equation (8) can be altered to include the correlation of the
elevation error:

where r(zi, zj) is the correlation of elevation error for the positions i and j. Note
that while isotropy is not assumed by equation (9), stationarity is: the assumption is
that r(zi, zj) is independent from the actual location of zi and zj, and dependent only
on their relative position in the local window.

If the weighting function is symmetrical and the autocorrelation of the elevation
error is isotropic, the following relations hold for the variance of the quadratic
parameters calculated from a symmetric DEM grid (allowing for rounding errors in

If one assumes the elevation error to be stationary, the variances of the conic
parameters depend only on the evaluation window size and on the weighting
function, and are the same for the entire DEM. However, the variances of the
topographic variables at any point are a function of the variances of the conic
parameters as well as of the value of the conic parameters at the evaluation point,
and thus assume different values throughout the DEM.

Inspecting equations (11–14), one ﬁnds that the variances of slope and aspect
can be expressed as simple functions of the slope G. Substituting equation (2) in
equation (11) and (12), respectively, one obtains:

VAR Gð Þ~

1

(cid:2)

1z tan Gð Þ2

(cid:3)2 s2

d

VAR Að Þ~

1

tan Gð Þ2 s2
d ,

hence for G~0, the variance of G has a maximum of VAR(d ), while the variance of
A is not deﬁned but it tends to positive inﬁnity for the limit of G tending to 0z.

4. Choice of appropriate scales for the analysis

With quadratic approximation,

it is possible to calculate the topographic
variables at different scales using a range of window sizes, as well as a range of
r values, to determine the relative weight of the centre and the periphery of the
evaluation window. The minimum possible scale is dictated by the resolution of the
DEM grid, while the maximum possible scale is limited by the extent of the DEM.
Clearly, not all these scales will produce meaningful results because of limitations of
the elevation data as well as limitations of the analysis method:

(1) Very small windows are most inﬂuenced by errors in the DEM elevations,
especially if the error has very low spatial autocorrelation (Fisher 1998,
Heuvelink 1998a, Liu and Jezek 1999).

(2) If the DEM grid used in the analysis is produced through interpolation from
sparser elevation points or contour lines, at very small scales the grid surface
shape is more likely to represent the shape of the speciﬁc interpolator used
than the ‘real’
to the effect of
topographic surface, and is subject
interpolation artefacts (Florinsky 2002).

(3) As the evaluation window gets larger, it is less likely that the quadratic
equation will be a good descriptor of the topographic surface in the
neighbourhood of the evaluation point, especially for low r.

The issues raised in points 1 and 2 suggest the use of larger evaluation windows,
although under the constraints of excessive generalization raised in point 3. The

next section proposes a methodology for the selection of a meaningful range of
evaluation window sizes, which was applied to a large DEM derived from TRIM
data. The approach can be generalized, with appropriate modiﬁcations, to other
DEM products.

4.1. Case study DEM

The DEM used for this example was produced from TRIM digital data, a
product of the Base Mapping and Geomatic Services Branch of the Province of
British Columbia, Canada (Base Mapping and Geomatic Services Branch 1999).
The TRIM product contains digital elevation data that are designed to produce
triangulated irregular networks (TINs). TRIM elevation data are organized into
two vector ﬁles: a ﬁle of elevation (mass) points, hereafter referred to as the TRIM
point ﬁle, and a ﬁle of break lines (Geographic Data BC 1992). Elevation points,
typically collected using a semi-automated proﬁling technique, are distributed on a
semiregular grid, spaced between 75 and 100 m apart, and are collected in sequence
along proﬁles generally oriented north–south (Geographic Data BC 1992). This
collection method is subject to the production of artefacts that can be mitigated
using an appropriate ﬁlter (Albani and Klinkenberg 2003).

Sixty-three contiguous 1:20 000 TRIM digital map sheets were made available
for quantitative surface analysis by the Fort St John Forest District, British
Columbia Ministry of Forests, during a landscape ecology investigation in the area
of the Halfway and Peace River watersheds in north-eastern British Columbia
(Albani 2001).

4.2. Inﬂuence of DEM errors on topographic variables at various scales

The numerical results for equations (9–16) depend on the spatial structure of the
elevation error. Generally, one would want
to derive the spatial correlation
structure of the elevation error from an adequate sample of elevations of higher
accuracy than the DEM (Fisher 1998), but such a sample, as is often the case, was
not available, so a decision was made based on a reasonable assumption for the
structure of the elevation error.

The ﬁrst choice was to account for the speciﬁc structure of TRIM, considering
that even spatially uncorrelated error in the TRIM elevation points will result in
spatially correlated error in a gridded DEM interpolated from these points. Monte
Carlo simulation was chosen to estimate a spatial correlation structure for the
elevation errors in interpolated DEMs, in the case of no spatial correlation of errors
on the TRIM points.

Six non-contiguous squares with 1200-m sides were randomly selected from the
study area (ﬁgure 1). From each square, using the ArcView ‘TIN to Grid’ function,
a 30-m resolution ‘original’ DEM was generated using the TRIM elevations,
previously ﬁltered to remove striping artefacts (Albani and Klinkenberg 2003). For
every square, six alternative realizations of the DEM were also produced, adding to
the elevation of each TRIM point a random term with zero mean and standard
deviation of 3 m. This error size corresponds to the maximum elevation RMSE
tolerance in the speciﬁcations of the TRIM product (Geographic Data BC 1992).
Each ‘original’ DEM was then subtracted from its six corresponding alternative
realizations, creating 36 simulated elevation error maps. These maps were used to
compute an empirical correlogram of the elevation error, and a smoothing spline

model was ﬁtted to the average correlation at each distance. The spacing of the
TRIM points and the ArcView interpolation algorithm result in the elevation errors
of the interpolated grid having a correlation range of 5 grid units (i.e. 150 m).

For additional numerical simulation, an autocorrelation function was used of

the form:

To investigate elevation error autocorrelation effects,

it was decided to
concentrate on the variance and RMSE of the parameter d in equation (1). The
variance of d directly controls the variance of slope and aspect (equations 11 and
12), and is a very good predictor of

parameters. In exploratory simulations,

the overall variance of

parameters a–e are generally positively correlated, and the variances of d and e are
much larger (often by a 103–104 factor) than the variances of a–c.

The results of calculating the RMSE of d for various combinations of
autocorrelation structure and window sizes are shown in ﬁgure 2. Note how the
maximum RMSE of the parameters d and e of the quadratic model in a 363
window occurs for a range~4 grid cells in equation (17). This contradicts the
assumption that an error with no spatial autocorrelation is a worst-case scenario
for the calculation of slope and aspect RMSE on a 363 evaluation window
(Hunter and Goodchild 1997, Heuvelink 1998a). In the case of the empirical
correlation, most of the drop in the RMSE of d is obtained with a window size of
7–9 pixels, after which the curve ﬂattens out, giving increasingly smaller returns.

A reasonable choice is then to explore the error propagation to the topographic
variables for a window size of 7 pixels and to verify if this is acceptable. Using the
empirical correlation structure from the simulated error on the TRIM points, the
maximum RMSE for gradient G is 1.75‡ or 3%. The RMSE of aspect A for a G of
3‡ (about 5% slope) is 35‡, dropping to 10‡ for slopes of 10‡ (17.6% slope). These
error levels seem acceptable for ecological classiﬁcations where generally slope
classes of 5% interval or more are used, and where the number of aspect classes is
often limited to four or less.

As discussed above, the RMSE of the terrain curvatures will vary from pixel to

and for different ranges in equation (17) (the no correlation case corresponds to a
range of 0). The assumption of no correlation in elevation errors is not a worst-case
scenario when topographic variables are derived using Evans’s method.

pixel. It was calculated for a regular sample of the study area, obtained by sampling
every seventh pixel row wise and column wise. This sample size provides the
maximum coverage of the study area without redundancy in the information, since
every sample point is independent from every other sample point.

The summary results are reported in table 1 (n~46 452). The curvature RMSEs
are expressed in % m21, where 0.05 indicates a curvature that will produce an
increase of gradient of 0.05% for each 1 m travelled from the estimate point. The
mean RMSEs are substantially low and would cause the misclassiﬁcation of slopes
only if very small tolerances were set in discriminating between concave and convex
slopes.

Summarizing, the results from this analysis indicate that the DEM elevation
errors have only a minimal inﬂuence on the conic parameters as well as on the
topographic variables for evaluation window sizes of 767 or greater.

4.3. Interpolation effects: the case of TRIM

The DEM grid used in the analysis is produced through interpolation of the
TRIM data, and at very high resolution the grid surface shape is more likely to
represent the shape of the speciﬁc interpolator used than the ‘real’ terrain surface
(Florinsky 2002). To assess the importance of this interpolation effect at various
scales, a series of synthetic surfaces of 2006200 pixels and nominal pixel resolution
of 30 m were created, each with a different fractal dimension. They were then
sampled by using the TRIM sampling scheme, and the surfaces from the sampled
points were recreated.

Five surfaces were created using the fractal surface generator of LandSerf 1.7,
respectively, with fractal dimensions of 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7 and 2.9. The use of fractal
surfaces as null hypotheses is well established (e.g. Goodchild and Klinkenberg
1993, Robert and Roy 1993, Pearson and Gardner 1997), although geostatistical
models have recently been proposed as a better alternative for the production of
spatially autocorrelated random ﬁelds (Kyriakidis et al. 1999, Canters et al. 2002,
Ehlschlaeger 2002). Each surface was then sampled using a ‘simulated TRIM
scheme’ obtained by extracting a 600066000 m square section of the study area
TRIM mass points, overlaying it on the fractal surface and calculating an elevation
from each synthetic surface by interpolation of the closest four grid nodes. This
produced ‘simulated TRIM’ point ﬁles, a set of (x, y, z) coordinates, from each
fractal surface. Using the 3D Analyst module of ArcView 3.2, a TIN from each
‘simulated TRIM’ elevation points ﬁle was produced, and the ‘TIN to Grid’
function was used to interpolate back to each 2006200 pixel surface, creating ﬁve
simulated TRIM DEMs.

The vector of quadratic model parameters were then calculated for the original
surface and the simulated TRIM DEM using different evaluating window sizes, and

the difference between the two vectors was calculated. Figure 3 shows how the
choice of window size affects the standard deviation of the difference between the
quadratic parameter of the original surface and those of the simulated TRIM for
different fractal dimensions of the original surface (the number in the bar on top of
each panel) in the case of the d parameter. The shape of the relation is the same for
the other parameters, although the values are different.

The value of this exercise lies in the insight it gives with respect to the
interactions between the scale of the TRIM sampling scheme, the complexity of the
topography (expressed by the fractal dimension), and the choice of window size for
the estimation of the conic parameters. The shape of the curves in ﬁgure 3 is more
important than the absolute values found, which cannot be compared with those
described above, because these values are a function of the relief of the fractal
surface, and do not necessarily correspond to the range of relief found in the study
area.

As is to be expected, the higher the fractal dimension of the original surface, the
larger is the difference between the original and the sampled surface. The parameter
values converge for large window sizes, where the evaluation windows span several
original TRIM points. The more interesting result is how it takes window sizes of
up to 767 or 969 for the second derivative of the curves to change sign, even for
mid-values of the fractal dimension, suggesting that window sizes of 767 or larger
should be employed to minimize the inﬂuence of the interpolation function on the
terrain variables.

4.4. Excessive generalization: a method for its assessment

So far we have seen how using increasingly larger windows reduces the inﬂuence
of measurement and interpolation errors on the ability of quadratic modelling to
describe the shape of
improved
performance comes with a cost, since it involves a higher generalization of the

the underlying topographic surface. This

terrain surface. Moreover, the least-squares method minimizes the weighted sum of
the squares of the residuals on the entire window, and, as the window gets larger, it
is less likely that the quadratic equation will be a good descriptor of the terrain
surface in the neighbourhood of the point where the terrain variables are estimated.
It is therefore important to assess the amount of generalization occurring at
different window sizes. A method is proposed here that assesses generalization
through a measure of the residuals of the quadratic model in a neighbourhood of
the evaluation points.

Because we are interested in the surface shape and not in the elevation per se,
the use of a modiﬁed residual term is proposed, which is obtained by subtracting
the residual at the centre of the evaluation window from the neighbourhood
residuals. This corresponds to a translation of the interpolated surface along the
z-axis, so that it has a residual of zero at the evaluation point. The variance of the
modiﬁed residuals is then a better index of how the interpolated surface is different
from the data surface in shape, since it is not affected by a local translation of the
surface.

For every DEM cell, it is possible to compare the residual variance with the
variance of the elevation error, as stated in the TRIM speciﬁcations, using a one-
sided x2-test. The test result indicates the probability of a random error creating a
sample variance of the residuals equal to or larger than the one observed; that is,
the probability that a random error would create a larger change in the surface
shape than the one introduced by the interpolation procedure.

The trellis box-plot in ﬁgure 4 shows the distribution of the x2-test results for a
random sample of 600 DEM cells, obtained by systematically sampling 100 cells
from each of the six 120061200 m square subareas described above. Note how the

relation between the distribution of the test results and the window size reﬂects the
general topography of the study area, with few areas (mostly the deeply incised
river trenches) where even a small window size produces a substantial divergence
from the original surface, and several areas (the extensive ﬂat or gently rolling
areas) where even vary large window sizes create little deviation from the original
surface. The results presented in ﬁgure 4 indicate that there might not be a single
‘best’ scale to evaluate terrain variables over the entire study area: different portions
of the study area will allow a higher degree of generalization than others before the
local shape is signiﬁcantly modiﬁed, as was also observed by Wood (1996).

5. Discussion and conclusions

Assessing and mitigating the propagation of elevation errors to topographic
variables is critical to any landscape investigation that relies on derived topographic
variables. This paper presents a general analytical method to estimate the
propagation of elevation errors to the principal derived topographic variables
(slope, aspect and surface curvatures) as calculated with the quadratic approxima-
tion method with variable evaluation window size of Wood (1996). It expands the
work of Florinsky (1998b) to incorporate evaluation windows of sizes larger than
363, and considers spatially correlated elevation error. The expanded methodology
has several advantages, as it enables one to explore directly the impact of larger
window sizes not only on the value of derived variables, as originally done by
Wood, but also on the uncertainty associated to the estimate of these topographic
variables at each scale. This is of considerable interest for applications in landscape
ecology and predictive vegetation modelling: ecological processes and organisms
generally act as ﬁlters on their environment, experiencing it over a limited range of
spatial scales (Allen and Starr 1982, Kolasa and Rollo 1991), and it is at those
scales that topographic variables show meaningful correlation with ecological
processes (Florinsky and Kuryakova 2000).

As the quadratic approximation method involves a linear transformation of the
elevations, it is well suited to the estimation of error propagation through Taylor
expansion, which is more precise in the case of linear algorithms (Bevington 1969).
The numerical simulation showed that the propagation of elevation errors to
topographic variables is strongly inﬂuenced by the size of the evaluation window:
evaluation windows larger than 363 dramatically reduced the inﬂuence of
elevation errors on the estimation of local shape parameters. The same simulations
showed that in the case of the quadratic approximation method, the maximum
perturbation of the derived topographic variables is not caused by fully random
error, but by spatially autocorrelated error at a scale comparable with that of the
window size. These results are due to the generalizing nature of the quadratic
approximation method: by forcing the topographic surface to a quadratic
polynomial at the scale of the evaluation window, the quadratic approximation
acts as a low-pass ﬁlter, and thus stabilizes the surface-to-noise ration at frequencies
much higher than that of the ﬁtting kernel. For the same reason, larger evaluation
windows also greatly reduced the impact of interpolation errors on the derived
topographic variables in a simulated TRIM DEM. It is likely that the use of larger
evaluation windows would also reduce the inﬂuence of interpolation artefacts, as
discussed by Florinsky (2002). Florinsky also shows how the mapping of surface
curvatures can be seriously inﬂuenced by the DEM grid positioning and

orientation. While we did not perform numerical simulation, we believe that the use
of a window larger than 363 and a distance-based weighting function similar to the
one proposed would effectively mitigate the effects of grid displacement, since the
evaluation of the conic parameters would be less inﬂuenced by the corner elements
of the evaluation window and thus by the speciﬁc orientation of the DEM grid.
In the present case study, window sizes of 767 (2106210 m) or larger resulted
in a substantial reduction in the effect of elevation and interpolation errors on
topographic variables. The variance of d of the conic equation was reduced by more
than 50% for window sizes of 767 in the case of empirical autocorrelation. For
most sampled pixels in the study area, even larger windows (up to 31631 cells)
could be used without excessive generalization of the topography, as long as a
weighting matrix is used to reduce the impact of the window edges. These results
are speciﬁc to the DEM product and the study area, but the methodology employed
is general and could be applied to any DEM product where an associated error
structure is known or can be estimated.

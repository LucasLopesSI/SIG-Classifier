Environmenral  modelling  usually  requires  sparially  disrribured  inputs  for  model 
operation. We  propose  that such inputs are  b a r  obtained  from field  measured  dara. 
Geographic  informarion  sysrems  (CIS) provide  a  logical  framework  ro  distribute 
measured  inputs sparially,  ro  manipulare ensuing data  fields during analysis, and  ro 
di\play the resulrs. This paper describes  a study conducted o n  a  123 km’  carchmenr 
i n   Pennsylvania.  T h e   purpose  was  to  evaluarc  how  sparial  variability  of 
macroporosiry  affects  disrriburion  of  ocher  infiltration-related  paramercrs.  We 
measured  sorpriviry,  conductiviry  and  macroporairy  ar  specific  points  within  a 
their  sparid  disrriburions  by  kriging.  T h e  
carchmenr,  and 
mrmuemenrs were made with ring and disk infilrromcrers, sampling locarions were 
gro-referenced wirh  a global positioning sysrem (GPS), and data were analysed  using 
geosrarisrical  techniques  in  a  GIS  contexr.  .Field  values  (hard  data)  were 
supplemenred by sofi dau derived from cumularive distriburion funcrions (cdfs) and 
dvailable  soil  maps.  Resulrs  showed  that,  when  sparial  variability  associated  with 
macroporosiry was  removed,  infiltrarion paramcrers became less  variable.  Observed 
correlarion  among  measured  par;unerers  suggested  a  form  of  potenrial  rransfer

carchrnenr  scale if macroporosiry a i d  sparial  variabiliry  of infilrrarion pararnerers  are 
adequately defined, and we suggest  approaches which  a n  be used  in  a  CIS conrexr

Introduction 

Infiltration  is  a  hydrologic  process  describing  a 
manner of warer  entry  inro rhe soil profile.  Ir arises 
from  parririoning  of  incoming  precipitation  at  the 
soil  surface  berween  runoff and  recharge.  Ar  a farm 
or  catchmenr  scale  rhe  parririoning  occurs  borh 
sparially  and  temporally  due  ro  differences  in  soil 
properties,  anrecedenr  moisrure  conrent,  landscape 
characrerisrics,  and  precipirarion.  T h e   infilrration 
process is parricularly  well suired ro analysis in a GIS 
conrexr, since individual infilrration variables can be 
regarded as area inregrals and represenred  as separate 
overlays.  While  rhe  area  integral  concept  applies 
rasrer  grid,  or  polygon 
equally  well 
represenrarion  of sparial data, we will use rhe former 
because  of  its  convenience  in  subsequent  sparial 
analysis.  Modelling  of  infilrrarion  at  a  catchmenr 
scale  usually  requires  separate  overlays  of  spatially 
disrribured  inpurs  for  model  operarion.  To  prepare 

to  a 

such  overlays  we  evaluated  cumulative  infiltrarion 
(I;)  ar  a  number  of  strategically  located  poinrs 
(j  = 
I...n)  wirhin  a  carchmenr,  assigned  rhe 
measuremenr  to  a  grid  or  block  area,  and  then 
inrerpolated  by  kriging  among  blocks.  The  field 
procedure  was  ro  measure  warer  inrake  ar  the  soil 
surface againsr time, and subsequenrly fit the data ro 
an  equarion.  We  needed  a  measured  value  for  the 
initial  sorprion  of  warer  at  the  soil  surface,  and  a 
value  represenring  the  average  rare  at  which  warer 
infilrrares  inro  rhe  profile.  Under  rhese  condirions 
Philip (1957) proposed a two-paramerer  equarion as 
a  suitable  field  approximarion  of  field  infilrrarion 
(I,). Ac  a carchmenr  scale we  may wrire  I, in  a  GIS

Since  field  profiles are seldom  homogeneous 
and  water  content varies  with  depth  and  over  the 
area,  we  utilized  a  grid  data 
format  and 
geostatistical  analysis to interpolate input parameter 
distributions  from  measured  values.  To  monitor 
existing  soil  moisture  conditions,  we  measured 
surface  bulk  densiry  and  water  content  with  a

infiltration  run,  a n d   with

probe just after the run. During the study period we 
also  monitored  precipitation and soil water content 
at  0.6  m  depth  on  a  bi-weekly  basis  (Rogowski 
1996b). Because  there was  little change among bi- 
weekly  readings,  we  averaged  the  measured  values 
seasonally.  We  used  measured  water  content  (6,) 
and  bulk  density  (BD;)  at  the  soil  surface  to

that  as 

Recently, Youngs  ( I  995) pointed out that our 
current  perception  of  infiltration  process  relies 
primarily  o n   Darcy's 
law  and  the  solutions  of 
Richard's  equation of flow in  unsaturated soil.  If the 
assumptions  of  Richard's  equation  do  not  hold, 
other factors may come into play, which  modify the 
classical treatment, and require a different approach. 
These  other  factors  may  include  the  natural  soil 
variabiliry,  differences  in  the  distribution  of  profile 
water,  uneven  plant  water  demand,  differences  in 

96 

precipitation, and spatial patterns of  macroporosiry 
(Clothier  and  White  1981). Macropores  consist of 
cracks  and  fissures  in  a  soil  matrix,  void  spaces 
berween  coarse fragments, old root holes and worm 
holes. They may also be ordinary pores a n d  channels 
which  are  larger  than  those  produced  by  a  simple 
packing of a soil (Wagenet and Germann  1989). 

T h e  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate 
how  macropores  affect  catchment  distribution  of 
infiltration.  W e  propose to accomplish  this  by  first 
then  comparing  catchment 
evaluating  a n d  
(Si,  Ai,  Kf,,  K,) 
infiltration  parameters 
and 
macroporosiry  (Mi) distributions.  In  chis  paper,  the 
emphasis  will  be  o n   the  evaluation  of  input 
parameters.  Whereas  models  of  infiltration  under 
homogeneous  conditions  are  well  documented  in 
the literature (Youngs  1995), spatial  dependence of 
infiltration  variables  and  models  addressing 
heterogeneous  catchment  Conditions  are  not.  T h e  
approach  described  here  envisages  acquisition  of 
necessary  geo-referenced 
infiltration  data  in  the 
field,  and  assumes  that  connected distributions  of 
macropores  are  a  primary  modifying 
factor 
contributing to spatial  differences in  infiltration. 

We classify as macropores any pores  larger  than 
0.75  m m  in  diameter. These are the pores  that will 
drain  at  4 0  m m   negative  head.  To  establish  the 
extent  of  heterogeneity  we  measure  cumulative 
infiltration  under  flooded  a n d   negative  head 
conditions  at  a  number  of  locations  when  surface 
soil  moisture  is  uniformly  low.  To  define  spatial 
structure,  a n d  
to  evaluate  connectivity  and 
persistence  of  macroporosity  and 
infiltration

methods  (Englund and  Sparks  199 1 ; Deutsch and 
Journel  1992). T h e  study is  cast  in  a  geographical 
information  system  context  utilizing  data  grids 
constructed  by  block  kriging  (Isaaks  and  Srivastava 
1989).

The  geology  of  the  area  shows  an  inter-bedded,

which  divide  the  catchment  into  approximately 
equal  zones  of  north-north-west and  south-south-

Field sampling 
We sampled over 200 locarions in  the carchment for 
infiltration  variables  and  macroporosity.  Figure  1 b 
shows  the  location  of sampling sites  and delineares 
sub-carchmenr  areas. T h e  measuremenu were  made 
ar three locations on each of rhe  15 base sites, ar nine 
locarions  at  each  of  rhe  four  underlined  base  sites, 
and  at  27  locarions  o n   each  of  the  fivefarm  sites 
(Figure  l c ) .   Five  locarions  contained  negative 
outliers  and  were  discarded,  leaving  a  toral  of  202 
sampling  locations.  We  idenrified  all  sampling 
locarions  in  Universal  Transverse  Mercaror  (UTM)

T h e  sampling scheme was as follows: to define 
a  short-range  variability,  we  placed  rhe  infiltration 
rings  in  clusters  of  three  ar  the  vertices  of  an 
imaginary  equilateral triangle  1 m  on the side.  We

divide.  Most of the other sites straddled a low ridge 
down the centre of the catchment. Forty-two of the 
202 samples  were  in  corn, the  remainder  (160)  in 
grass. 

Flood- and negativehead  infiltration 
We  measured  infiltration  in  0.3 m  diameter  metal 
rings  driven  0.1  m  into  the  soil.  We  clipped  the 
vegetation  short and placed a thin layer of fine sand 
on the soil  surface  to cover  the stubble and smooch 
out  any  unevenness.  We  used 
the  Guelph 
permeameter  (GP)  as  a  water  application  device 
(Reynolds  and Elrick  1987). We added water to the 
ring until  the G P  would nor bubble when opened to 
a 40 mm  height, Letting  the water  level  in  the ring 
drop,  we  started  the  stopwatch at  the  first  bubble 
and recorded  times for every 0.1 m  drop in  the G P  
reservoir. At each site we made a 30-minute run (or 
less if a steady infiltration  rate was  reached  sooner), 
with  as  many  re-starts  as  needed.  Immediately 
following the last flood  infiltration run, we removed 
the  G P  and  inserted  a  0.25  m  disk  infilrrometer 
adjusted  to  a  -40  m m   negative  head  (White  et  al 
1992).  W e   recorded  the  rate  of  descent  every 
minute, until steady flow prevailed. 

From  flood-infiltration  data,  we  prepared 
plots of cumulative infiltration (I,) vs. square root of

('I' =  - 4   cm)  approximates  a  distribution  of

T h e   term  structural  analysis  refers  to  a  detailed 
inspection  and  numerical  modelling  of  spatial 
dependence  and  continuity  of  field  data  (Olea 
1991). These tasks  are  commonly performed using 
standard  batch  statistics,  histograms,  probabiliry 
distributions,  scatterplots  a n d   a  semivariogram 
analysis.  We  analysed  the  data  at  the  farm  and 
catchment  scales,  using  SAS  (SAS  Institute  Inc. 
1987), GEO-EAS  (Englund  and Sparks  1931) and 
GSLIB  (Deutsch  and  Journel  1992) s o h a r e ,   the 
standard  30  m  USGS  digital  elevation  model 
(DEM), and GIS IDRISI'  (Eastman  1992). 

Observed  distributions  were  evaluated  in  the 
context  of  local  geology,  land  use,  topography and 
soils, and their spatial structure was examined using 
a semivariogram.  Semivariogram  analysis  builds  on 
all available information  and o n  the other statistics. 
A semivariogram y(h), may be thought of as  112 the 
measure  of  error  incurred  by  assigning  a  value  of 
z(x  +  h)  to  the value  z(x)  where h is  a  hg distance

A  semivariogram  y(h)  is  described  by  an 
three 
algorithm  specifying 
parameters:  the nugget, sill, and range. A y(h) is said 
to be transitive when it has a finite sill which is equal 
to  an  a  priori  variance.  Transitive ~ ( h )  models  fall 
into  one  of 
three  categories:  spherical, 
exponential,  or  gaussian  (Isaaks  and  Srivastava 
1989). A  nugget  (CJ, 
also  known  as the  nugget 
variance,  is  an  apparent  discontinuity  at  the  origin, 
caused by  the spatial variability among data pairs at 
a scale smaller  than  the sampling  interval. The ~ ( h )  
will  increase,  as  the  separation  distance  between 
samples  increases,  until  it  reaches  a  limiting  value 
(sill)  at  some  point  called  the  range  (Isaaks  and 
Srivastava  1989).  The  range  is  the  maximum 
distance  between  pairs  over  which  the  attribute 
values are correlated  (Olea  1991). The models used 
here are spherical and of the  form: 

y(h)=Co+C, [ l ~ ( h / p ) - O ~ ( h / p ) ~ ] ,  whenOSh<p 

y(h) = Co + C, when f i h  

where Co is the nugget, C ,  is  the sill, p is  the range, 
and h is  the lag distance between pairs. 

Hard and soh data 
The 202 sampling locations,  grouped  into about 60 
clusters,  were  not  uniformly  distributed,  because 
they were chosen  to  reflect local  conditions  such as 
land  use,  topography,  or  farming  unit. To  improve 
kriging  performance,  we  chose  1 12  additional 
locations  on  a  regular  3  x  3  km spacing  in  the 
catchment,  and  an  additional  63  locations  on  a 
regular  150 x  150 m  spacing  on  farm  no.  24. We 
chose  the  spacing  size  following  the  structural 
analysis  so  that  most  soft  data  would  fall  within  a 
variogram  range.  We  assigned  to  them  S(j), A(j), 
Kf,(j) and  K,,(j)  values based  on  the soil  type  (from 
the  soil  survey  map)  and  measured  values  of 
infiltration parameters. We called the assigned values 
sofr  data (Journel  1986), in contrast co  the bard data 
measured  in  the field. 

The selection procedure  detailed  in  Rogowski 
( 1 3 9 6 ~ )  was as follows. We identified soil map  unics

Kriging interpolation 

We  used  kriging  (Is& 
and  Srivastava  1989)  for 
spatial  interpolation  between  observed  parameter 
values.  Kriging  relies  on  a  collection  of  generalized 
linear regression techniques to minimize the variance 
of estimation.  It also uses a prior model of covariance 
(as deduced  from  a  semivariogram), and  thus  takes 
into account  the stochastic dependence among data 
values (Olea 1991). We used  kriging in two ways: ( 1 )  
to estimate values for all cells of the GIS grid, and ( 2 )  
to  compare  distributions  of  parameter  values  with 
each other. Recall  that at each location we sampled a 
cluster  of  three  values.  To  see  how  these  values 
compared,  we  can  subtract  them  from  one another 
and  then  krige  the  differences.  It  may  be  more 
informative to prepare separate GIS overlays for each 
set by kriging and then subtracting the overlays. Since 
kriging is a linear procedure, we expected little or no 
difference between  the distributions of differences. 

To model cumulative infiltration - Equation  1, 
or macroporosiry - Equation 7, we first need to know 
the  spatial  distribution  of  Si,  Aj,  Kf,,  and  K,,. 
Mathematical  operations  could  then  be  carried  out 
on  GIS  overlays  on  a  cell-by-cell  basis  using  an 
appropriate  GIS  module.  In  this  way  we  could 
monitor  the  effects  of local  small-scale variations  in 
the  context  of a  farm  or catchment  as a whole.  For 
analysis  purposes  we  used  a  300  m  grid  on  the 
catchment  and 30 m grids on  the farms. Our choice 
was  dictated  by  the  constraints  of  the  s o h a r e .  
Optimally a grid corresponding  to the measurement 
support (Olea  1991) - in  our case, a cluster of points 
- is  recommended.  Declustering  techniques  are 
available whenever more than  one measurement  falls 
in a cell (Deutsch and Journel  1992).

of  the  pararnerer  values  in  the  maps  into  quarriles 
(Q); rhus  each caregory corresponds  ro  a quarrile  of 
rhe disrriburion. The precipirarion  is  the cumularive 
precipirarion  and  rhe  water  conrenr  is  a  porrion  of 
rhe  average  warer  conrent  in  rhe  moisture-control 
secrion  (MCS) assigned  ro  the 0.15  m  deep surface 
layer.  Borh  are  based  on kriged values  measured  bi- 
weekly  ar  rhe  base  sites  and  adjusted  to  Mer  Sire 
record  (Figure  1 b).  Neirher  precipirarion  nor  water 
conrenr  appeared  ro  vary  much.  The  precipirarion 
ranged  between  312  and  334  mrn  and  was 
sornewhar  higher  (>334 mm)  in  rhe  south-sourh- 
wesr  parr  of  rhe  watershed.  Analysis  of  rainfall 
characreristics  showed  [hem  ro  be  similar  ro  other 
years  (Gburek er  al  1977). More  than  half  of  rhe 
evenrs  wirhin  a  six-hour  period  wirh  rain  lasred 
benveen  2 0   rninures  and  1  hour,  and  rhe  observed 
races varied  between  1 10 and 260 mrn/hr. Soil warer 
content  stayed  between  81.2  and  87.6  mrn  in  the 
MCS,  suggesting  the  anrecedenr  O,(j)  at  rhe  soil 
surface (0-0.15  m) should be between  30.5 and 32.8 
mrn,  a  value  close  to  rhe  inirial  values  at  rhe  field 
sampling sires in Table  1. 

There  was  no  apparenr  corrclarion  at  a 
carchment scale between  infilrrarion, soil warer, and 
observed  precipirarion  amounts. All  char can  be said 
is  that  sorprivity  S,  declined  as  warer  conrenr 

increased.  Throughour  the  srudy  period  available 
(Pavb)  and  surface  storage  capacity  (P,) 
porosity 
remained reasonably  constant ar all locarions  (except 
farm  no.  5). Thus  data  in  Figure  3  and  Table  1 
support  assumprions  of  relarively  uniform  inirial 
conditions  at  mosr  rneasuremenr  locations  during 
rhe srudy period. 

Infiltration parameters 

Infilrrarion  parameters  were  first  analysed  using 
srandard sraristics.  In Table  1  we  lisr  the  251:h (Q) 
and 75rh (Q)  quartile values for typical  variables in 
rhe carchmenr as a whole (W), individual  farm sires 
(no.  5,  no.  12,  no.  20,  no.  24,  and  no.  2 5 ) ,  and 
selected  base  sires  (BS).  In  Figure  4  we  illustrate, 
using box plots, rhe corresponding values of jusr one 
variable  Kf, for principal  catchmenr soils. Alrhough 
each  box  plot  represenrs  a  separate  soil  mapping 
unir, rhe legend is rhat of a Great Group (Soil Survey 
Sraff  1975: 86-7).  Thus D stands for Dystrochrepts, 
H  refers  ro  Hapludults, and  F  denores  Fragiudults. 
There  is  a  fundamental  difference  benveen  dara 
summaries  illuscrated  in  Table  1 and  Figure  4. All 
n-values  for  each  farm  or  carchmenr  mapping unir 
listed  in Table  1 are geo-referenced and will  be  used 
to  inrerpolare  by  kriging  a  disrriburion  of  a  given 
variable  over  a  farm  or  carchrnenr.  ELecause 
geosrarisrical

distributions,  which  are  subjecr  to  the assumprion 
of  stationarity  (Journel  1989),  need  not  be 
parametric, but the size of measurement support and 
the  exrenr  of  data  clzistering  are  two  importanr 
considerations.  In  contrast,  when  a  distribution  is 
associared with a soil  mapping unit as  in  Figure 4, it  
applies  ro  a  soil  polygon  as a  whole,  irrespective  of 
its size or shape, and contains  no viable  mechanism 
to define variability  over an area (Rogowski  1996a). 
Moreover,  a  soil  polygon  boundary  has  an 
undetermined  amounr  of  uncertainty  associated 
wich  ir  and  the  polygon  may  contain  non-rnapable 
inclusions smaller in  extent  than  the scale at which 
the map was  made.

between  200  and  1000 mm. Ar  field  sacurarion  we 
are  looking  ar  an  infilrrarion  flux  (KrJ  of  between 
3,500 and  10,500 m m  (Equation 3), and it appears 
that  most  of  the flux  over  1000 ro  2500  mm  (K,) 
could  be  due  to  macroporosiry  MI  (Equations  6 
and 7). T h u s  infilrrarion  flux across the soil surface 
could vary  by  rhree  orders of magnirude  depending 
on the responsible mechanism. 

In  a  similar  manner  we  also  compared  inrer- 
quarrile values for corn- and grass-covered locations, 
and  for  differenr  elements  of  landscape  position 
(ridge,  slope,  and  valley).  These,  along  wirh 
corresponding  values  for  the  catchment,  farm  sires

The  magnirude  of rhe  ratio  describes  the spread  of

variabiliry.  For  associated  variables  (nor  lisred)  a 
spread  was  always  <2,  and  highest  (1.6)  for

parameters  listed in Table 3 describe variability. We 
recall  that  nugget  variance  Co indicates  apparent 
spatial variability among data pairs at a scale smaller 
than  the  sampling  interval,  range  p  is  a separation 
distance over which  data  pairs are correlated, and a 
finite  sill  corresponds  to  a  priori  variance  at  a 
distances  larger  than  p.  Semivariograms are  fitted 
interactively and  represent  a  considered judgement 
regarding the validity of field data, structure of  the 
distribution,  possible influence of outliers, extent of 
anisotropy, and lag spacing (see Wolf and Rogowski 
1991;  and  Isaaks  and  Srivastava  1989:  146ff  for 
details).  In  Figure  5  the  dashed  line  and  points 
represent experimental  y(h)  values, while  the  solid 
line  is  a  fitted  spherical  model.  At  the  catchment 

scale, the total number  of pairs was - 16,000 for the 

hard  data,  with  most  points supported  in  excess of 
200 pairs. For the hard plus soft data, because of the 
s o h a r e  (GEO-EAS) limitations  the  total  number 
of  pairs  could  not  be  determined,  but  the  average 
number  of pairs supporting each  data  point  was  in 
excess of 900 pairs. As demonstrated by  less scatter, 
there was a substantial  improvement  in  fit when we 
added  112 sof, data  on  a  3  x  3  km spacing  to  the 
202 bard data values. 

The y(h) parameter  values for Kfs(j) in Table 3 
show  chat  although  sill  values  were  less,  the  new 
model  with  so$  data  had  to  be  fitted  with  a  larger 
nugget variance, and a shorter range. The new model 
could  have  been  applied  to  the  original  data; 

Table 3. Nugget  (C,), sill'  (C'), and range (p), of 
the spherical semivariograms y(h) for sorptiviry (Sj), 
A-value  (A,), field saturated hydraulic conductivity 
(Kf,), and negative head infiltration (K,,). 

Catchment  infiltration I:  Distribution  of variables 

however,  because  of  data  scatter 
there  was 
considerable uncertainty  about the proper choice of 
semivariogram  parameters.  While  inclusion  of 
additional  soh  data  may  appear  to  have  decreased 
the  sampling  error  and  improved  the  ability  to 
detect  small  scale  within  the  cell  variation,  larger 
nugget  and  shorter  range  may  instead  signal  an 
increase  in  local  uncertainty,  and  some  loss  of 
continuity.  These  outcomes  are  related  to  the 
manner  in  which  soft  data  were  chosen  from  the 
cdf.  A possible improvement would  be  to assume a 
probability  field  distribution  and  select  soft  data 
accordingly (Srivastava 1992). 

In contrast,  the sill and nugget  parameters  for 
the KJj)  semivariogram with and without soft data 
stayed about the same while the range of continuity 
increased from  1.0 to  2.5  km. Comparison  of  the 
y(h) scales in Figure 5 suggests that the variability of 
y (h) for y(j) is  40 to  50  times  less  than  that  for 
hs(j). Therefore  it would  be  safe to  conclude  that 
matrix  flow  is  likely to  be  less  variable than  a  near 
saturated  flow  which  involves  macropores.  This 
suggests 
contribution  of 
macroporosity  to  Kf,  is  much  larger  than  that  of 
microporosity  (K,,). Therefore, as the highly variable 
flow  rate  induced  by  macroporosity  declines, 
catchment 
to 
micropores  tend  to  converge  and  become  less 
variable.

In general, the nugget (C,) and sill ( C , )  values

to those observed for the catchment as a whole,  but 
with  a  shorter  range.  Based  on  the  results  of  the

variability  at  a  local  scale  on  farm  no.  25  (high

KfS(j) and  K,(j)  would be expected  on farm  no.  24

uncertainty  (higher  nugget),  bur  overall  sill  values 
and associated variability  decline accompanied  by a 
slight  shortening in  the  range.  T h e  decrease  in  sill 
may  be  due in  this  case  to  an  increased  number of 
pairs  now  supporting  each  poinr  (more  than  200

It  appears that  cumulative  infiltration  can  be 

modelled  for  a  carchmenr  based  on the  infiltration 
variables  measured  at  numerous  point  locations. 
Adequare  spatial  coverage  is  necessary  for  best 
results.  Such coverage  can  be provided  by including 
an  additional  grid  of  estimated  soft  values  to 
supplement  sampled  hard  values.  T h e   use  of

Comparisons of  differences 
We  recall  that original measurements of infiltration 
were  performed  in  clusters of three samples. One of 
the three samples (set  1) was selected  at random  for 
comparison with a predicted value derived from the 
remaining  two  (set  2).  We  selected two  parameters 
Kf,(j)  and  K,(j) 
for  a  detailed  comparison  of 
differences  between  the two sets, and also to test  the 
merits  of  alternative  methodologies.  T h e   spatial 
distributions  of  differences  were  obtained  in  GIS 
either by  subtracting  kriged  overlays  of  set  1 from 
kriged  overlays of set 2  (difkrig,), or by subtracting 
individual  values  at each  location  and  then  kriging 
(krig.dif).  T h e   differences  were 
the  differences 
expected  to be in general  less than the inter-quartile 
ranges  listed  for Kf, and K,  in Table 1, and less than 
II  priori  variance  estimates  in  Figure  5,  because 
kriging 
is  a  smoothing  procedure.  We  were 
interested  primarily  in  a  relative  distribution  of 
these  differences  over  the  catchment  and  also 
whether  or  not  the  analyric  procedure  itself  may 
have  influenced  the outcome. 

Kriging was  based  o n  the hard  and sofr data. 
Figure  6 shows the  spatial  distribution  of  expected 
differences  which  are grouped  for convenience  into 
quartiles  ranging  from  light  (<Ql) to  dark (>Q3). 
T h e   differences 
in  conductivity  among  samples 
taken  1 m apart appear to be between  100 and 4100 
mm/d for  Kcs(j), and between  0 and 600 mm/d for 
K,,(j).  Results  in  Figure  6  suggest  that  largest 
differences  (light  areas)  at  a  scale  of  1  m  may  be 
expected  in  the  central  portion  of  the  catchment 
and  smallest  in  the  extreme  eastern  section  (dark 
areas).  At  first  glance,  spatial  distributions  of 
differences  appear  quite similar  irrespective  of  how 
they  were  determined.  However,  a  numerical 
comparison of the number of cells  in  each category 
(Table 4 )  points out some anomalies. Loss of cells in 
one  category  is  compensated  by  a  gain  in  the 

Cofclment infiltration 1:  Distribution o f  variables 

adjacent category.  For Kf,(j) categories 1 and 3 were 
primary  contributors  to  category  2 ,  and  for  K,,(j) 
category  3  was  a  primary  contributor  to  category 
2 and 4. W h a t  this  may mean  is  that  for  Kf,(j)  the 
largest  change  category  may  decline  if  we  first 
subtract the values measured nearby and then  krige. 
Similarly, for K,,(j) 
the smallest change category may 
increase  if  we  first  subtract  the  values  and  then 
krige.  This  implies  that  averaging  or  declwtering 
(Deursch  and  Journel  1992)  of  samples  taken 
nearby may have a beneficial  effect o n  the variability 
of  calculated  distributions,  at  least  for  the  two 
infiltration  variables discussed  here.  Some loss and 
gain of cells could be due to a rounding error during 
kriging.  However,  the  observed  differences  in  the 
number of cells are fairly substantial, particularly for 
K,,(j),  and  may  well 
the  procedural 
differences . 

reflect 

We  also  compared  the  above  data  secs 
(diffkrig. and krig.dzf) for hard data only and when 
soft data were  included. T h e  results  are illustrated in 
Figure 7. While the inclusion of additional sofr data 
substantially  improved  the  correlation  (see  inserts) 
between  dzfkrig.  and  krig.dzf  for  Kf,(j)  and  even 
more  so  for  K,,(j),  average  values  and  standard 
deviations  of  differences  actually  increased  (see 
inserts).  This  implies  that  random  addition  of 
uncorrelated  soft  data  increases  local  uncertainty, 
which  may  not  always  be  warranted  (Srivastava 
1992). 

Summary and conclusions

macropores  affect  distribution  of  infiltration  on  a 
123  k m 2   agricultural  catchment 
in  central 
Pennsylvania.  This  was  accomplished  initially  by

conducciviry  Kf,(j),  and  negative  head  infiltration 
K,(j)  which  is  direcrly  related  to  macroporosity. 
Reported  results  are  based  on  field-measured  data, 
and application  of geostatistical techniques in a GIS 
context.  Preliminary  analysis  suggested  that  field- 
observed  variability  may  be  due either  to  inherent 
variability  at a particular  locale, or to sampling site 
land  use  and  soil 
location  within  a  mixed 
configuration. Ar a catchment scale there was only a 

limited, or no response among measured parameters 
S;,  A,,  Kf,(j) and Y ( j )  to the observed distributions 
of  water  content  and  precipitation,  and 
to 
computed  distributions  of  available  porosiry  and 
surface storage capacity. Results suggest  that  it  may 
be possible to estimate Kf,(j) from rapid sorptivity Si 
measurements,  and  KJj)  distributions  from  Kf,(j) 
distributions. 

Comparing  relative  catchment  responses  to 
infiltration  in  our study area we  suggest  that  if  the 
amount due to  the S;  term  in  Equation  1 is  1 mrn, 
that due to  the A; term  may  be  as high  as 10 mm, 
while  flux  at  field  saturation  (Equation  3) would 
exceed  100 mrn,  although  it  appears  that  most  of 
the  flux over  25  mm  may  be  due (Equation 6 )  to 
the 
macroporosity  effects.  This  suggests 

that 

108 

contribution of macroporosity to K k  is  much larger 
chan  that  of  microporosiry  (K,,).  Thus  when  the 
highly  variable 
induced  by 
infiltration 
macroporosity  declines,  catchment  infiltration 
parameters  due to micropores tend  to converge and 
become less variable. 

rate 

Cumulative infiltration  can  be  modelled  for a 
catchment  taking  macroporosity  into  account, 
when  it  is  based on  the  infiltration  variables Si,  A;, 
Kf, and  Ku, However,  adequate spatial  coverage is 
necessary for best results. Adequate coverage can be 
provided  by  including  an  additional  grid  of  sofc 
values  to  supplement sampled  hard  data.  There  is 
some question as to the most appropriate method  to 
combine  soft  and  hard  values.  Distributions  of 
differences based on nearby ( l m )  sampling locations 
suggest  there  exist  large  areas  within  a  catchment 
where Kf,  and K, parameters are highly variable. In 
such  cases  random  addition  of  uncorrelated  soft 
data appears to increase local variability.

Abstract
Introducing Clifford algebra as the mathematical foundation, a uniﬁed spatio-
temporal data model and hierarchical spatio-temporal index are constructed by
linking basic data objects, like pointclouds and Spatio-Temporal Hyper Cubes of
different dimensions, within the multivector structure of Clifford algebra. The trans-
formation from geographic space into homogeneous and conformal space means
that geometric, metric and many other kinds of operators of Clifford algebra can be
implemented and we then design the shortest path, high-dimensional Voronoi and
uniﬁed spatial-temporal process analyses with spacetime algebra. Tests with real
world data suggest these traditional GIS analysis algorithms can be extended and
constructed under Clifford Algebra framework, which can accommodate multiple
dimensions. The prototype software system CAUSTA (Clifford Algebra based
Uniﬁed Spatial-Temporal Analysis) provides a useful tool for investigating and
modeling the distribution characteristics and dynamic process of complex geo-
graphical phenomena under the uniﬁed spatio-temporal structure.

1 Introduction

Various proposals have been implemented to incorporate the temporal element into
traditional GIS (e.g. Le 2005, Pultar et al. 2009). The snapshot models (Langran 1992,
Peuquet 2001), which are usually ﬁeld-based, have some advantages in terms of visu-
alization but lack object-based query or analysis ability. The event-based spatial-
temporal data model (ESTDM) (Peuquet and Duan 1995) is more concerned with
temporal evolution along the time axis by storing geographic phenomena as events that
occur through time. Yuan (1999) integrated spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamic
geographic data in a novel three-domain model. Methods inherited from other ﬁelds,
like Moving Object Databases (Güting and Schneider 2005, Wolfson et al. 1998) or
object-oriented approaches (Raper and Livingstone 1995, Worboys 1994) also have
been heavily discussed. However, the above mechanisms are not general enough, and
can only be implemented for speciﬁc situations or object types. Most GIS are still
ineffective for working with spatio-temporal data, and for the expression and analysis
of spatio-temporal phenomena (Hornsby and Egenhofer 2000, McMaster and Usery
2004).

“Support data models for a complete range of geographic phenomena” and
“support a wide range of types of geographic simulation” have already been identiﬁed as
two of the 10 “grand challenges” for GIS (Longley et al. 2005). GIS data models should
be developed for modeling complex geographic phenomena, whereas current GIS
systems show limitations in representing real geographic phenomena, especially for those
continuous phenomena that simultaneously move, change shape, and change internal
structure (Yuan 2009). Since modeling phenomena against spatio-temporal frameworks
owes much to scientists abstracting the physics of space and time, object changes in
uniﬁed space-time may offer another opportunity to improve dynamic GIS. Goodchild
(2008) also suggested that combining space and time together can be seen as a new
potential for temporal GIS, though practical advice on how to combining space and time
together in real world situations is still lacking.

In GIS, there are a limited number of theories or methods for higher dimensional
analysis, which are required for extending classical spatio-temporal analysis into uniﬁed
space-time. To inherit and transplant existing spatio-temporal analysis methods under
the uniﬁed space-time framework is another large challenge. The progress already made
in mathematics or physics can be seen as a validated reference, which may not only
contribute mathematical foundations but also practical problem solving methods. From
this point of view, Clifford algebra, which brings scalar and vector algebra into a uniﬁed
framework and is widely used in theoretical physics, brings us powerful tools to express
dynamic changes of high dimensions.

In this article, we discuss a prototype GIS software system, CAUSTA (Clifford
Algebra based Uniﬁed Spatial-Temporal Analysis), which aims to evaluate the efﬁcacy of
introducing Clifford algebra into spatio-temporal analysis. We propose a uniﬁed spatio-
temporal data model integrating the temporal and spatial parts as a whole, which links
the basic simplex of different dimensions with the basic elements of Clifford algebra of
different grads, to make full use of the computation power of Clifford algebra. A
hierarchical spatio-temporal index is constructed by referencing the view of the hyper-
bolic complex plane. Then geometric and metric operators and three commonly used GIS
algorithms are developed which are uniﬁed at different dimensions and can solve numer-
ous geometric problems more simply, or with improved performance.

2 Clifford Algebra and Its Operators

2.1 Basic Structure of Clifford Algebra

As a type of associative algebra, Clifford algebra was ﬁrst introduced by William K
Clifford (Clifford 1878). It can be thought of as the possible generalization of Grassmann
algebra, Hamilton’s quaternions, and complex numbers. A more generalized concept,
Clifford product, instead of cross product, is used in Clifford algebra, which not only
gives the imaginary unit in complex numbers added clarity (e.g. Gull et al. 1993) but also
provides a more natural approach to geometric interpretations (e.g. Dorst et al. 2007).
By using Clifford product, the number of operations used for geometric calculations can
be reduced, and further advantages accrue because the computations within hybrid
dimensions are free of coordinates (e.g. Pavšicˇ 2005, Hestenes 2002). Due to its advan-
tages, Clifford algebra has important applications in a variety of ﬁelds including geom-
etry, engineering and computer vision (e.g. Li 2008, Perwass 2009). Hestenes (2003a, b)
once proposed that ‘Clifford algebra can simplify, extend, and integrate the mathematical
methods of classical, relativistic, and quantum physics while elucidating geometric struc-
ture of the theory, and have the potential of becoming a uniﬁed language for mathematics
and physics’.

In Clifford algebra, the Clifford product obtained by multiplying two vector objects,

a and b, can be written as:

= ⋅ + ∧
ab a b a b

(1)

where a · b is the inner product of a and b, and a ∧ b is the outer product (or so called
exterior product) as deﬁned in the work of Grassmann (1844). The inner product is a
scalar quantity that is nearly equivalent to the vector dot product; however, the outer
product is related to, but not the same as, the vector cross product a ¥ b that is only
deﬁned in three dimensions. Both the inner and the outer product are geometrically
related, so if a · b = 0 for two nonzero vectors, they are orthogonal, while if a ∧ b = 0 for
two nonzero vectors, they are parallel. This is different from vector algebra, where the
deﬁnition of the geometric relationship does not depend on the choice of axes for the
space.

The inner product a · b and outer product a ∧ b can also be expressed by Clifford

product ab:

Equation (2) suggests that the Clifford product is neither symmetric nor asymmetric.
A typical complete form of Clifford algebra Cl( p,q,r) can be generated as follows:

algebra space. We can simplify the above deﬁnition as each ei
which is very similar to the i2 = -1 form in complex numbers. As we all know, the
imaginary unit (i), extends real analysis into two dimensional complex analysis, which
can greatly simplify expression and computation complexity. A combination of different
bases with different signs that deﬁne the space can also extend the computation power of
Clifford algebra to higher dimensions.

2.2 Euclidean Space, Homogeneous Space, and Conformal Space

In Clifford algebra, there are three commonly used spaces: Euclidean space, homoge-
neous space, and conformal space. Real world geographical data abstracted by three
orthogonal bases (x,y,z) can construct a typical 3D Euclidean space. If we replace the
bases (x,y,z) with (e1, e2, e3), we can deﬁne eight basic structures in different dimensions,
called “blades”, with the dimensionality of “blades” called “grades”. Table 1 shows an
example of how to classify basic blades of 3D Euclidean spaces.

A multivector is a new mathematical structure comprising a linear combination of
elements of different grades, such as scalars, vectors, bivectors, or trivectors. For
example, a 3D multivector can contain one extra vector term, two extra bivector terms,
and one extra trivector term:

=
M a

+

a e e
23 2 3

+

a e e
31 3 1

+

a e e e
123 1 2 3

(4)

where ai is the coefﬁcient of the blade term, the ‘+’ signs in Equation (4) are not
numerically plus but link each part together like in the complex number. The result of a
Clifford product of two different multivectors in 3D can be expanded upon in Table 2,
from which we can see the Clifford algebra is closed. Clifford algebra for higher
dimensions can be calculated in a similar way. Both blades and multivectors provide
suitable and powerful structures for high dimensional data expression and computation,
which can provide us a convenient tool to construct the uniﬁed spatio-temporal data
model.

Euclidean space can be transformed into homogeneous space by applying the trans-

formation operator P and P-1 as follows:

Operator p transforms a vector in En into a homogeneous vector PEn, which makes the
origin of Euclidean space become en + 1 in a projective space. By applying this transfor-
mation to homogeneous vectors that have a non-zero homogeneous component, the origin
of Euclidean space as represented in a projective space, is no longer a special point. These
homogeneous vectors, ej, would map to inﬁnity, and are accordingly called points at
inﬁnity, given the direction of the embedded Euclidean space. Operator P-1 inverses the P
and extracts the Euclidean space embedded in the homogeneous space (Dorst et al. 2007).
The embedded component of a Euclidean vector x ∈ Rn in the conformal space Rn+1,1

is given by [e0, e•]. The operator C : Rn → Kn+1 ⊂ Rn+1,1, is deﬁned by:

where e0 is the origin and corresponds to the last base vector in the homogeneous vector
algebra. It represents the origin of the subspace and therefore removes the singularity of
the represented Euclidean space. e• encodes the metrics of an Euclidean space (projective
represented space) (Perwass 2009). For a geometrical conformal geometric round point,
this factor represents the distance from that point to the origin. Since this is an element
of a projective space, the overall scale does not inﬂuence the representation of geometry
in the corresponding Euclidean space. The vector may therefore be scaled without
changing its representation in Euclidean space. A convenient scaling is a multiplication

by

(

12x +

), which cannot be zero (Dorst et al. 2007).

2.3 Spacetime Algebra

Spacetime algebra (STA), a special form of Clifford algebra Cl3,1, was ﬁrst introduced by
Hestenes (1966). Since then, it has been generalized and developed into a comprehensive

L Yuan et al.

geometric calculus (GC) (Hestenes and Sobczyk 1984) with a wide range of computa-
tional capabilities, and widely used in applications in electrodynamics, quantum mechan-
ics, and gravitation studies (Hestenes 2003a). We can express Physics in a much easier
way by using Hestenes’ spacetime algebra, which automatically incorporates the geo-
metric structure of spacetime (Gull et al. 1993).

In spacetime algebra, any inertial observer at the position of g0 in four dimensional
uniﬁed spacetime can explore the whole spacetime because g0 determines a unique
mapping of spacetime into the even sub-algebra of STA by using the Clifford product.
The inner part of the Clifford product assigns a unique time (t) to every event (x), which
is also the equation for a one parameter family of space-like hyper planes with normal g0.
The outer part of the Clifford product assigns to each event x a unique position vector
x in the g0 system. Although the g0 - split of spacetime in certain spatio-temporal
phenomena is relative to the observer, the modulus, s(wi), of any vectors wi = xie1 + yie2
+ zie3 + tie4 is the Lorentz invariant (i.e. “independent of a chosen spacetime split”), which
can be deﬁned as:

The spacetime sphere (Li and Yang 2003) can be deﬁned as the following:

{

) ≤

d

(8)

(9)

Equation (9) deﬁnes all light-like vectors starting from w0. When w0 = 0, R3,1(0,0) =
{w ∈ R3,1 | s(w) = 0} and is equal to the light cone of Minkowski spacetime R3,1, while
if d → •, R3,1 = R3,1(0, •) and is the Minkowski spacetime R3,1 itself.

So the real world 3D objects can be modeled in a uniﬁed spacetime framework,
which means the time is not an attribute of the objects, but a supported dimension which
affects the metric, characteristic, and dynamic evolution of speciﬁc phenomenon. Differ-
ent kinds of objects can be modeled, integrated and compared in the uniﬁed spacetime
which take the dimension of time into account. The Lozrenz transformation keeps the
metric evolution unchangeable, which makes comparing the different phenomena more
accessible. The spacetime sphere makes the expression of four dimensional spacetime
systematic and complete (Li and Yang 2003).

2.4 Geometric and Metric Operations and Operators

The power of Clifford algebra can be expanded by constructing various operations and
operators. The uniﬁed expression of different geometric objects and unlimited power of
dimensional expansion enlarge the uniﬁcation and simplicity of Clifford algebra. Here
we deﬁne ﬁve major types of operations and operators (Table 3) for uniﬁed spatio-
temporal analysis. In Clifford algebra, basic geometric objects and transformations can
be simply constructed by fundamental operations like outer and inner products. It is
also very simple to reveal geometric and spatial relationships with relationship opera-
tors, which are independent of the type of geometric objects and dimensions. We also
deﬁne movement expression operators for modeling dynamic changes of geographical
phenomena.

Figure 1 System architecture

3 System Design

3.1 System Architecture

To effectively construct data structures and improve calculation performance, we selected
C++ as our design language. We utilized object-oriented and generic programming by
using classes and templates. CAUSTA has a three-tiered architecture composed of data
and work ﬂow management, data computation engines, and visualization and user
interaction layers (Figure 1). First, we constructed a minimal Application Programming
Interface (API) layer to deﬁne the basic data structures and functions, which can be easily
accessed and used as public tools between different layers. Next, we proposed four
abstracted data types (vector, raster, point cloud, and spatio-temporal cube data) as the
foundation for data objects in our system. Traditional vector and raster data are
imported and abstracted by data I/O modules like GDAL/OGR implementations (com-
pliant with OGC standards) and other data types commonly used in geographical
analysis (e.g. NetCDF). These imported data are then grouped as snapshots for explo-
ration and/or visualization, or transformed into pointcloud or Spatial-Temporal Hyper
Cube (STHC) data and transferred to the Clifford space for spatio-temporal analysis.

We have integrated two kinds of computation engines in CAUSTA. The Clifford
algebra engines, which primarily focus on the computation tasks in Clifford space, are
mainly constructed by operator and algorithm libraries. The operator library organizes
the basic and hybrid Clifford operators (proposed in Table 3) for solving the geometric
or metric relationships. The algorithm library stores algorithms for solving complex

geographical analysis tasks, such as network analysis, Voronoi diagram analysis, or
dynamic spatio-temporal data analysis. Other parts of the computational layer are
composed of classic geographical analysis methods. The similar interface of these two
parts makes the modiﬁcation and extension of existing methods with Clifford algebra
much easier and also helps to organize the data ﬂow for customized data analysis tasks.
Results from both of the computational engines are synchronized and converted to
traditional geographical space. The analysis process and results can be visualized with
different views in the visualization module.

3.2 Spatio-Temporal Data Model

The real world can be depicted in a GIS by using models to deﬁne phenomena and
perform analysis. Although many GIS data models (especially 2D GIS data models) have
been proposed to incorporate temporal information into spatial databases, the temporal
information is usually thought of as only one of the attributes, and is either associated
with the individual layers or linked to individual spatial objects. Their general frame-
works use a set of geometry-based spatial objects to represent reality and do little to
support spatio-temporal modeling.

Traditional spatio-temporal data models, such as the snapshot model (Armstrong
1988) or the spacetime composite model (Langran and Chrisman 1988), separate the
spatial and temporal parts, which increases the complexity of modeling and expressing
real world data and splits and blurs the spatio-temporal semantics. Other models, like the
event-based (Peuquet and Duan 1995) or the object-oriented data models (Wachowicz
and Healey 1994), also suffer dimensionality problems and compatibility with existing
spatial and temporal data. Recently developed data models extend some of the above-
mentioned aspects, but still meet a lot of difﬁculties in seamlessly integrating spatial and
temporal data (e.g. Cheng et al. 2007, Liu et al. 2008, McIntosh and Yuan 2005).

Here, we attempt to unify the spatial and temporal data by associating the temporal
information with the spatial information. The uniﬁed spatio-temporal data model can be
universally described as (x,y,z,t) (Figure 2) and this spatio-temporal data can then be
analyzed under a uniﬁed spatio-temporal framework. We can reorganize the spatio-
temporal data by the combination of different dimensions, from two dimensions (x-t, y-t,
z-t, etc.), three dimensions (x-y-t, x-z-t) to four dimensions (x-y-z-t). In order to analyze
the characteristics, relationships and relative processes with Clifford algebra, we need to
transform the geographical spacetime into Clifford spacetime. At last, based on the
multi-dimensionality of the blades, we can construct corresponding data classes for the
description of data objects with different dimensions.

The pointcloud and STHC data classes, and the associated data structures designed
for modeling spatio-temporal data under the Clifford algebra framework, are shown in
Figure 3. The pointcloud, similar to the spacetime points proposed by Pultar et al.
(2009), is a multidimensional data structure with various attributes. In our system, we
used a rational database that stores each dimension of the pointcloud as a virtual ﬁeld of
a virtual table, such that each point is stored as one record of the virtual table. By
selecting a subset of different dimensions of the point as the coordinate axis, we cannot
only visualize the pointcloud through different dimensional perspectives, but also trans-
fer them into Clifford space coordinates. Both vector and raster data can be simply
expressed by the pointcloud data. The dimensions can be extended into higher dimen-
sions and customized according to the analysis tasks. For the dynamic phenomenon, we

L Yuan et al.

Figure 2 The implementation of unﬁled spatial-temporal data model

can instantly add or remove points in the pointcloud data structure. Basic statistics of
different dimensions are also provided.

The STHC data structures are designed for describing the evolution process with
time. In the uniﬁed spacetime, we can observe or model objects from different dimen-
sions, as seen in Figure 4. A tensor data structure was introduced to store the STHC data,
which provided a simple way of extracting data from different dimensions. Another
advantage of using a tensor data structure is that the STHC data can be easily expressed
in different dimensions by using the tensor or kronecker product. Both of these products
are very efﬁcient in expressing the outer and inner products of Clifford algebra for
discrete data.

Figure 3 The pointcloud and STHC data implementations

According to the classiﬁcation of the Clifford algebra operators, we have deﬁned
the corresponding GIS multi-dimensional object operators: dimensional, geometric,
metric, spatial, and movement operators. These operators are fully implemented in
our data model, and directly improve the object’s expression and analysis cap-
abilities. Furthermore, we rewrote the commonly used GIS analysis methods (network
analysis, Voronoi diagram analysis) based on Clifford algebra operators. More impor-
tantly, we also develop geographical analysis methods focused on the description
of geographical characteristics, spatial and temporal relationships, and geographical
processes.

3.3 Spatio-Temporal Data Index

Geographic data retrieval, ﬁltering, and querying are some of the basic operations in GIS.
While simple spatio-temporal queries only search stored data records, complex spatio-
temporal queries need a representation to handle the distributions of objects and events
in space and time and thereby discover higher-level information buried in the GIS data
records (Yuan 1999). Most GIS data models can support simple spatio-temporal queries,

70

L Yuan et al.

Figure 4 The STHC data split based on different dimensions

but show limitations in supporting complex queries. The degree to which spatio-
temporal queries are supported depends on their embedded representations.

Variants of R-trees, such as RT-trees (Xu et al. 1990), 3D R-trees (Theodoridis et al.
1996), MVR-trees (Tao and Papadias 2001), and HR-trees (Nascimento and Silva 1998)
have been introduced for spatio-temporal data storage and indexing, and discussed and
compared under different situations (e.g. Kalay and Kalipsiz 2009). In some kinds of
R-trees, time only plays a secondary role compared to the spatial information, which
makes temporal queries very inefﬁcient (e.g. RT-trees). Some of them have many redun-
dancies (e.g. 3D R-trees) that limit their usability. Other kinds of spatio-temporal indexes
are only proposed in speciﬁc areas, such as for the analysis of moveable objects and
sensor networks (e.g. Chen and Meng 2009, Wu et al. 2009). The generalization of these
indexes has not yet been carefully studied.

We abstracted 4-D spatio-temporal data as the STHC, where the t-axis is time, and
x, y, and z-axes are present-day geographic coordinates (e.g. latitude, longitude and
elevation). As the digital equivalent, the STHC can be subdivided into many parts from
different perspectives, the set of boxels, or the set of columns, rows, and slices. The boxel
is the basic element of the STHC. Each boxel can be described as one of the spatio-
temporal objects, and can hold any type of geographical information. For example, a
boxel can hold the attributes of the geographical object, or “index,” that point to values
or attributes in a more complex table or database (Scotese and Rees 2004). Since we have
already organized STHC types of data objects into a tensor form and stored them in
multivectors, which combine different grads in Clifford space, we can simply use the
operations and operators to analyze data cubes from different dimensions. For example,

71

Figure 5 The layer separated data index with two complex planes

we can expand and reduce the grad of a 3D spatio-temporal cube by inner products that
can be implemented and simpliﬁed by left contraction of the original STHC.

The hyperbolic complex plane, which is widely used in relativistic physics, can be
expressed in Clifford algebra (Hucks 1993, Wu et al. 2005). By introducing the hyper-
bolic complex plane, we can describe the uniﬁed spatio-temporal space by using two of
the complex planes in Clifford algebra (Figure 5). Correspondingly, we introduce two R*
trees to retrieve the information from the uniﬁed STHC. The ﬁrst 2D-R* tree is used to
retrieve the dominant reference dimension information, i.e. the combination of spatial

and/or temporal dimensions, then another R* tree (1D or 2D) may be used to select the
results subject to all query parameters. The advantages of this stratiﬁed indexing and
retrieval strategy are: (1) it corresponds to the description of Clifford algebra; (2) the 2D
R* tree is easier to implement and has lower computation complexity compared to either
a 3D or 4D data index; (3) it can also be applied to data without four dimensions (e.g.
with only three dimensions, x-y-t) because it provides the combined indexing and
retrieval of the spatio-temporal data. Using satellite altimeter data as an example, we
hierarchically retrieve the data according to the combination of dimensions (we ﬁrst
retrieve the longitude-latitude combinations and then retrieve the time). The data are in
100 ¥ 100 cells and four time snapshots, and the index time cost is less than 20 ms.

4 System Implementation

4.1 Geographical Network Analysis

Network analysis remains one of the most signiﬁcant and persistent research and appli-
cation areas in GIS. Many network analyses are among the most difﬁcult issues to solve
in terms of their combinatorial complexity (Curtin 2007). Some early research on graph
theory have proved that Clifford algebra can express the dynamic evolution of a direc-
tional and unidirectional ﬁnite graph, and can greatly reduce the computational com-
plexity (e.g. Schott and Staples 2010). The geometric characteristics (direction, distance,
topology and adjacent relationships) can be easily modeled by coding the nodes and
routes with Clifford elements. We propose a shortest path algorithm that can automati-
cally construct the shortest path from raw geographic networks without complex pre-
processing. This algorithm is described in Table 4.

The simpliﬁed design and implementation of the shortest path algorithm are shown
in Figure 6. First, we designed three classes to store the point, line, and attribute data of
existing and output nodes and paths. The Clifford Operation Class is implemented to
provide the space transformation, Clifford product, intersection, and grads calculation
utilities. Data process includes reading data, calculating intersections and the distance
between different nodes, and outputting the ﬁnal adjacency list of the networks. We also
construct a separate class for shortest path calculations, to search the shortest path, and
to communicate with the system GUI for user interaction and visualization of the results.
The ﬁnal algorithms were tested and compared to the classical Dijkstra algorithm using
random networks of different nodes and paths (Tables 5–7). The numbers of nodes
varied from 1,000 to 10,000, and each network was repeated 10 times with random start
and end nodes. The results suggest our algorithm is comparable in terms of both results
and computational performance to the classical Dijkstra algorithm (Table 5). However,
avoiding the use of the adjacent matrix simpliﬁes the design and extension of the
algorithm, so that our algorithm has much less memory usage, and can be extended for
large scale network analysis. We tested our algorithm with networks of 50,000 and
100,000 nodes to check the performance and memory use and even with this large
numbers of nodes, our algorithm still uses only a very small amount of memory (Table 6).
The dimensional and object independent equations for the distance and segment
intersection calculations simplify the extension of the algorithm into higher dimensions,
including hybrid dimensions. The main time costs came from the computation of outer
and inner products, which can be further optimized by the use of XOR (bit operation)
and by parallel computing. The real world data of the China highway system are also

geographical data and calculation results.
Space transformation: Euclidean space is embedded as a particular hyper-plane P
(En) in a projective space (homogeneous space) by applying the transformation
operator P and P-1.

3. Distances calculation: In a homogeneous space, the distance of objects with

different shapes or with different dimensions can be calculated by the following

4.2 High Dimensional Delaunay Triangulation and Voronoi Diagram Analysis

Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram analysis can be applied in mesh generation
and surface construction (Cazals and Giesen 2006), dynamic data update (Lee and
Gahegan 2002), outlier identiﬁcation (Qu 2008), and many other data organization and
analysis tasks (e.g. Samet 2006). Most of them are typically applied in a 2-dimensonal
analysis framework. For high dimensional data, performance efﬁciency, ﬂexibility, and

extendibility of data structures are more complex. We can extend the traditional lifting
algorithms by using the conformal transformation in Clifford algebra. In this algorithm
(Table 8), points in dimension d are lifted to dimension d + 1 through a lifting-paraboloid
function. In that dimension, the problem can be simpliﬁed to the creation of a convex
hull or an intersection problem. In the frame of a conformal model, the lifting algorithms
can be interpreted intuitively.

Since the calculation and output of the Delaunay triangulation and the Voronoi
diagram need various kinds of commonly used 2D data structures, they may have
capability issues when they are extended to higher dimensions. Here we construct
templates of basis multivector classes in k dimensional conformal space for the geometric
objects like points, point pairs, lines, rays, hyperplane triangles, and tetrahedrons are

then constructed using Clifford algebra. In this way, we can store different kinds of
geometric objects into the data object, and calculate their spatial relationships. A trace
class is implemented as an observer, which can be used to control the grade change and
solve potential conﬂicts during the operation of the algorithm. The whole workﬂow is
abstracted by a standalone class which controls the execution of the algorithm.

Compared to the algorithms commonly used in GIS analysis, the Voronoi diagram
generated by Clifford algebra has no restriction on boundary edges, which will reduce the
error propagation and give a better representation of the geometric characteristics. We
applied the algorithm to analyze the spatial structure of Jiangsu province in China to get
the 2D Delaunay triangles and associated Voronoi diagram (Figure 8). The population
and GDP of 13 cities in Jiangsu province are assigned as the third dimension for the 3D
Voronoi analysis (Figure 9). The non-uniform spatial distribution of the population,
GDP, and their differences are signiﬁcant; the city population in the northern region is
higher than that of the southern region, while the city GDP in the northern region is
lower than that of the southern region.

viewed as a form of STHC. Exploratory data analysis techniques (e.g. Empirical
Orthogonal Functions, Canonical Correlation Analysis) are used for analyzing this kind
of spatio-temporal data. However, these methods are usually based on the view that
temporal and spatial data are independent and can be separated artiﬁcially, which

usually breaks the real semantics of certain geographical phenomenon (Kim and Wu
1999).

Spacetime algebra provides a useful tool for expression, analysis, and modeling of
the dynamic evolution of spatio-temporal objects. The inherited observer-dependent
spacetime split makes it possible to explore the whole process from any location in the
uniﬁed spacetime. Its coordination-free characteristic gives it the chance to model
dynamic changes of geographical phenomenon in the uniﬁed spacetime. A Lorenz
transformation, which does not change the metric relationships and is independent of
observers, can give a full view of the true evolution of the phenomena in actual space-
time. As rotors and boosts, the spatial and temporal split of the Lorenz transformation
can project the change in both time-like planes and spatial-like planes (Doran and
Lasenby 2003). We implement uniﬁed spacetime exploratory data analysis with the

Lorenz transformation. It can be applied to investigate the characteristics of STHC data
by parametrically controlled simulations. The detailed workﬂow is listed in Table 9.

The detailed design and pseudo-code of each class are listed in Figure 10. STHC data
objects are ﬁrst constructed by data inherited from the pointcloud data objects used to
store the original data. Two methods of calculation are provided, spatial and temporal
projection. The Lorenz transformation is deﬁned by the STA_Rotor class and the
STA_Boost class, which calculate the spatial and temporal rotation, respectively. Both the
rotor and the boost are inherited from the STA_MV class which, in turn, is inherited from
the basic multivector class. The STA_Observer class is designed to deﬁne the character-
istics of the observer which are linked to the STA_STCube and STA_Lorenz classes,
which control the whole calculation.

We analyzed the evolution of the El Niño phenomenon with the merged T/P
and Jason-1 gridded satellite altimetry data (the altimeter products were produced by
Ssalto/Duacs and distributed by AVISO, with support
from CNES; see http://
www.aviso.oceanobs.com/duacs/ for additional details). The temporal dimension ranged
from March, 1997 to September, 1998; the latitude and longitude dimensions ranged
from 15.5°N to 15.5°S and 150.5°E and 100.5°W, respectively. There were 18 time data
stamps, 32 latitude data stamps and 142 longitude data stamps. The characteristics of the
dynamic change of the El Niño phenomenon was investigated by rotating the STHC in
the 4D space and reconstructing the projected temporal and spatial planes, with rotor
angle and boost angle changing from 0.1 to 1.5 with a step of 0.1. The rotated process,

the temporal and spatial projections, and the statistical parameters are shown in Fig-

Figure 11a shows the temporal evolution of the spatial-temporal process and the
mean and standard deviation values as they change with the time and simulation
parameters. The curved spacetime of the entire change suggests that time and space are
dependent. Signiﬁcant nonlinear relationships were revealed from the statistical param-
eters when the different parameters were changed. The detailed projections of spatial and
temporal planes at certain time stamps and the entire spatial-temporal process changes
with different parameters are shown in Figures 11b and c. The changes in statistics
relative to the simulation parameters are shown in Figure 11d, and the different spatial-
temporal characteristics at the different ENSO stages can be easily identiﬁed.

5 Conclusions

In this article, we introduced Clifford algebra into geographical spatio-temporal analysis.
Both the theoretic and practical details of how to use Clifford algebra in spatio-temporal
analysis are discussed. We proposed a uniﬁed data model that can represent four-
dimensional spatio-temporal data as data objects in the uniﬁed spacetime. Two types of
data structures (pointcloud and STHC) are designed to store spatio-temporal data, which
can be easily transformed into Clifford algebra space. With the power of various kinds

of Clifford operations and operators, we constructed three kinds of spatio-temporal
algorithms: the shortest path algorithm, the high dimensional Delaunay triangulation
and the associated Voronoi diagram, and STHC data analysis with spacetime algebra.
These algorithms are tested with different kinds of geographical data.

The shortest path algorithm tested on both random network and real world highway
data suggests that our algorithm will be more efﬁcient in both time and space perfor-
mance than the classical Dijkstra algorithm, especially for large-scale network analysis.
The high dimensional Delaunay triangulation and associated Voronoi diagram provide
meaningful and effective structures that can express, calculate, and store data structures
in different dimensions of a different geometric type under Clifford algebra, and also
provide an easier and more direct way to construct algorithms for arbitrary higher
dimensions. Spacetime algebra was proposed to model the dynamic change of complex
geographical phenomena using STHC data. The metric invariant characteristic of the
Lorenz transformation makes it suitable to explore both the temporal and spatial
characteristics in uniﬁed spacetime. All of the above suggest Clifford algebra can be seen
as a new, powerful tool for geographical spatio-temporal analysis, especially for higher
dimensional spatio-temporal data.

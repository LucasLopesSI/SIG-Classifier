Detailed and harmonized information on spatial forest distribution is an essential input
for forest-related environmental assessments, in particular, for biomass and growing
stock modeling. In the last years, several mapping approaches have been developed in
order to provide such information for Europe in a harmonized way. Each of these maps
exhibits particular properties and varies in accuracy. Yet, they are often used in parallel
for different modeling purposes. A detailed spatial comparison seemed necessary in
order to provide information on the advantages and limitations of each of these forest
cover maps in order to facilitate their selection for modeling purposes.
This article confronts the high-resolution forest cover map recently developed by the
Joint Research Centre for the year 2000 (FMAP2000) with previously existing maps
for the same time period: the CORINE Land Cover 2000 (CLC2000) and the Calibrated
European Forest Map 1996 (CEFM1996). The spatial comparison of these three maps
was carried out based on forest proportion maps of 1 km derived from the original
maps. To characterize differences according to biogeographic regions, two criteria were
used: detail of thematic content within each map and local spatial agreement.
Concerning thematic content, CLC2000 displayed a surfeit of non-forested areas at the
cost of low forest proportions, while FMAP2000 showed a more balanced distribution
likely to preserve more detail in forest spatial pattern. Good spatial agreement was
found for CLC2000 and FMAP2000 within about 70% of the study area, while only
50% agreement was found when compared with CEFM1996. The largest spatial differ-
ences between all maps were found in the Alpine and Mediterranean regions. Reasons
for these might be different input data and classiﬁcation techniques and, in particular,
the calibration of CEFM1996 to reported national statistics.

Introduction

European ecosystem assessments and environmental modeling in the framework of climate
change require as important input data detailed and up-to-date information on the spatial
distribution of forests. Furthermore, European countries and the European Union (EU) are
asked to report on forest resources for several international agreements such as the Kyoto

Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC
2002) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD 2007). In Europe, forest area
and landscape-level spatial pattern of forests are important indicators for sustainable for-
est management and need to be reported for the Ministerial Conference on the Protection
of Forests in Europe (MCPFE 2007). Accurate and harmonized delineation of forests is
essential for compatible reporting of forest resources within the above-mentioned policy
commitments, in particular, on pan-European scale and for international comparisons.

For large-area forest assessments, remote sensing is an adequate tool for providing
reproducible and reliable information on forest cover at different scales (Hansen et al.
2008, Koch and Dees 2008). Resulting maps deliver spatially explicit representations of
forest distribution in a cost-efﬁcient and objective way over a large spatial extent. At the
European scale, several harmonized pan-European land/forest cover data sets were created
using different approaches. The overall objective of this study is to compare pan-European
forest/land cover data sets to highlight potential advantages and limitations in their use on
pan-European scale. The data sets to be compared should be freely available and should
represent land cover of a similar point of time. For this study we chose target year 2000,
since several pan-European data sets are freely available for that time period:

In 1985, the Co-ordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) programme
was established by the European Commission with the main objective to provide consistent
and compatible digital land cover data across Europe. The resulting land cover/land use
maps, namely CORINE land cover (CLC) for year 1990 and for year 2000 (CLC2000),
were derived using Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery (Bossard et al. 2000).

In 1999/2000 a project linked to the Forest Information from Remote Sensing Project
of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) undertook to combine information of remote sensing
and forest inventory statistics to improve the information about forests in Europe (Päivinen
et al. 2001). A forest probability map was computed using image mosaics of Advanced
Very High Resolution Rediometer (AVHRR) data acquired from the National Oceanie and
Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) satellite with a spatial resolution of 1 km. In a follow-
up study, the AVHRR-estimated forest proportions were calibrated to correspond to the
ofﬁcial forest statistics at regional and national level (Schuck et al. 2003) which resulted in
the Calibrated European Forest Map (CEFM) representing forest proportion of year 1996
(CEFM1996).

Both pan-European maps were limited by their spatial details. While CEFM1996 was
based on 1 km pixel resolution, the cartographic standard of CORINE was set to a min-
imum mapping unit (MMU) of 25 ha (Perdigão and Annoni 1997, Bossard et al. 2000).
Although CORINE was derived using high-resolution Landsat data, all land cover patches
smaller than the MMU were lost in a merge with the surrounding dominant land cover
(Gallego 2004). As in Europe the average size of forest stands is smaller than 2 ha
(Tuominen and Pekkarinen 2005, Van Coillie et al. 2007), those will be missed, either
due to the MMU of CORINE or the 1 km resolution imagery of AVHRR. Preserving small
patches is essential, for example, for forest spatial pattern analysis and calls for an MMU
better than 1 ha and a spatial resolution better than 100 m, since the pixel size should be 2–5
times ﬁner than the size of the feature mapped (O’Neill et al. 1996). Besides for spatial pat-
tern analysis, high-resolution maps provide ﬁner-grained input for regional climate models
fostering a better understanding of climate change (Latifovic and Olthof 2004, Nelson and
Robertson 2007).

In order to keep the harmonized approach but deliver the required higher spatial res-
olution, the JRC started in 2006 the development of the pan-European forest cover map
(FMAP2000) (Pekkarinen et al. 2009).

International Journal of Geographical Information Science

At this point users have the choice between three pan-European forest cover maps
(FMAP2000, CLC2000, CEFM1996), of which CLC2000 and CEFM1996 have already
been used for biomass and forest growth modeling (Gonzalez-Alonso et al. 2006, Gallaun
et al. 2009, Päivinen et al. 2009). FMAP2000 has not yet been applied for modeling, but
may be an interesting input data set due to the higher spatial resolution.

Because the land cover input in any environmental model has a large effect on the
results, the selection requires an awareness of the advantages and limitations of different
options.

Main criteria of the selection should be the properties and the accuracy of the maps.
Shao and Wu (2008) and Congalton (2004) rightly pointed out that without knowing the
magnitude of errors of the maps, wrong conclusions could be drawn from modeling results,
this in particular if applied at regional level (McCallum et al. 2006). However, the accuracy
assessment for the pan-European products was often performed only on the data set as a
whole and, if at all, reported traditionally as single percent, correctly classiﬁed metric (EEA
2006, Pekkarinen et al. 2009). Information on local errors or their spatial variability is not
available.

To assist the selection of land cover maps, their accuracy assessments need to be com-
parable in terms of reference data or design, or they need to be standardized (Riemann
et al. 2010). In case a compatible accuracy assessment is not available, a direct comparison
between the products can at least guide the user to identify the map that might cover the
user’s speciﬁc requirements (Foody 2004). A spatial comparison may evidence best where
the forest distribution, which is of main importance for modeling purposes, differs between
those maps (Pontius 2000).

The purpose of the present study is to analyze and compare the FMAP2000, CLC2000,
and CEFM1996 concerning their spatial agreement in forest cover and to highlight
potential advantages and limitations in their use at the European level.

Several studies have attempted to assess the spatial agreement of forest and land cover
maps, in particular of global land cover (Fritz and See 2005, Giri et al. 2005, Foody
2006, McCallum et al. 2006, Nelson and Robertson 2007, Fritz and See 2008). The
main focus hereby was the harmonization of the semantic differences in the legend def-
initions. Based on these harmonized categorical maps statistical measures were derived
from contingency matrices. Other studies compared global categorical 1 km maps with
higher resolution maps. Here, the gap between different resolutions was tackled in differ-
ent ways: while Waser and Schwarz (2006) simply aggregated the higher resolution map to
the same low-resolution using a majority rule. Latifovic and Olthof (2004) tried to account
for mixed pixels of the coarse spatial resolution data using a sub-pixel approach. Nelson
and Robertson (2007) approached the comparison of different resolutions by providing
summary statistics of cross-tab calculations between the two maps.

In this study, the forest cover map with the lowest resolution (1 km), that is, CEFM1996,
is provided as a continuous variable of forest proportion. Blackard et al. (2008) and
Päivinen et al. (2009) stated that this sub-pixel information at coarser spatial resolution
is preferred for modeling, since systematic underestimation in sparsely forested areas
and overestimation in dense forest regions are reduced. We kept this quality of informa-
tion and decided to use forest proportion with 1 km resolution as our comparison unit.
Continuous maps of forest attributes other than forest proportion such as biomass and
leaf area index are becoming a common input for modeling and there is an urgent need
for methods to effectively determine their strengths and weaknesses (Wardlow and Egbert
2003, Congalton 2004). While conventional spatial comparisons are generally based on cat-
egorical data, Riemann et al. (2010) proposed recently a protocol for exhaustive accuracy
assessment of data sets against continuous variables with reference data sets. In this study

1868

L.M. Seebach et al.

we propose an adapted assessment scheme for the spatial inter-comparison of continuous
maps with the same attribute, that is, forest proportion. This process is done in two steps:

(1) comparison of the distribution of forest proportion at a 1 km resolution provided

by the maps at the European level and by biogeographic regions and

(2) assessment of the local differences in the forest proportion among the data sets
in order to identify trends in differences in various regions and to evaluate the
potential sources that could contribute to these differences.

Data sources
The data sets tested in this study are listed in Table 1 and are described in more detail
below.

CORINE Land Cover 2000 (CLC2000)
The CORINE programme derived consistent and compatible digital land cover/land use
maps across Europe for the years 1990 and 2000 (CLC2000). They were produced mostly
by visual interpretation of Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery on a country basis, applying
an MMU of 25 ha (Perdigão and Annoni 1997). The underlying CORINE nomenclature
includes not only land cover items but also land use elements. The hierarchical nomencla-
ture distinguishes ﬁve major land cover classes and in total 44 land cover classes (Bossard
et al. 2000). The thematic accuracy of the CLC2000 was assessed with an independent
point data set, namely the LUCAS (European Land Use/Cover Area Frame Statistical
Survey) ﬁeld survey points for year 2001, which was provided by the Statistical Ofﬁce of
the European Communities (Eurostat) for 15 European Union (EU15) countries (Eurostat
2005). The overall percentage of total agreement (PTA) was found to be 74.8%, while for
the forest classes the PTA ranged from 75.5% to 83.3% (EEA 2006).

Calibrated European Forest Map (CEFM1996)

The CEFM1996 was developed in two stages. First, a forest probability map was computed
using image mosaics of NOAA-AVHRR data with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The images
were acquired between 1996 and 1998. The image mosaics were further stratiﬁed into
three biogeographic regions: Atlantic, Mediterranean, and temperate and boreal. Within
these strata an unsupervised clustering was computed. Based on these spectral clusters, the
forest area probability/proportion of each AVHRR pixel was estimated using CLC1990 as
training data (Häme et al. 2001).

The AVHRR-estimated forest proportions were calibrated in a second step to corre-
spond to the ofﬁcial forest statistics for a regional and national level by a pixel-to-pixel
ratio scaling (Päivinen et al. 2001, Schuck et al. 2003). The CEFM1996 was not validated
by a pixel-level accuracy assessment but was qualitatively evaluated (Schuck et al. 2002).

JRC high-resolution forest cover map 2000 (FMAP2000)

The methodology of the FMAP2000 was based on an automated processing chain that per-
formed a scene-by-scene analysis of Landsat ETM+ images. It consisted of several phases,
including as preprocessing steps cloud masking, image segmentation, and clustering. The
central part of the methodology comprised the adaptive spectral representativity analysis in
which CLC2000 was reﬁned in order to be appropriate as training. This training data were
then used in a supervised classiﬁcation and ﬁnally, single classiﬁed scenes were composed
to an output mosaic (Pekkarinen et al. 2009).

The ﬁnal forest cover map was validated with the LUCAS2001 ﬁeld survey data avail-
able for EU15. This validation resulted in an overall accuracy exceeding 90% and the user
accuracy for forests reached 85% (Pekkarinen et al. 2009).

Methods

Preparation of data sets
In order to enable spatial assessment of the forest/land cover maps, the data sets needed
to be spatially harmonized. First, a common coordinate reference system, the European
Terrestial Reference System 1989 and Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (ETRS89/ETRS-
LAEA, EPSG:30351) projection, was chosen (Annoni et al. 2003). Only the CEFM1996
needed to be re-projected (see Table 1) for which a bilinear resampling was used. A ﬁrst
comparison conﬁrmed a systematic spatial mismatch between CEFM1996 and CLC2000
and FMAP2000, similar to that reported by Päivinen et al. (2009). In order to reduce the
impact of such a displacement, we shifted the original map by 500 m up and 500 m right
before re-projection. This offset produced the best overall correlation between all three
maps. Since CLC2000 is provided as a seamless vector layer, all 44 original class labels
were ﬁrst recoded to integer numbers and then rasterized to 25 m pixel size, in order to
keep as much spatial detail as possible.

For thematic comparability, CLC2000 was transformed into a forest cover map by com-
bining the forest classes ‘broad-leaved,’ ‘coniferous,’ and ‘mixed’ forest into ‘forest’ while
remaining classes were labeled as ‘non-forest.’ Forest is deﬁned by CLC as ‘areas occupied
by forest or woodlands with a vegetation pattern composed of native or exotic coniferous
and/or deciduous trees and which can be used for the production of timber and other for-
est products. The forest trees are under normal climate conditions higher than 5 m with
a canopy closure of at least 30%’ (Bossard et al. 2000). The CEFM1996 remained as is
for the forest area assessment, since the forest proportion stated for 1 pixel is reported to

1870

L.M. Seebach et al.

be equivalent to its area in hectares, for example, 10 equals 10 ha (Schuck et al. 2003).
CEFM1996 and FMAP2000 are both based on CLC data and, therefore, are subject to
similar forest deﬁnition.

Then, all data sets were set to a common spatial resolution, that is, comparison unit.
Since the coarsest spatial resolution of the data sets is 1 km (CEFM1996), FMAP2000
and the reclassiﬁed CLC2000 (forest/non-forest) were aggregated to the same resolution
by calculating the forest proportion within each pixel of the coarser data set similar to
Latifovic and Olthof (2004). The aggregated FMAP2000 and CLC2000 will be referred to
as FMAPP2000 and CLCP2000.

Furthermore, since FMAP2000, CLC2000, and CEFM1996 cover different areas in
Europe, a common mask was created where all three proportion maps have valid data,
further referred to as area of interest (AOI) (see Figure 1). In respect to their coverage,
CLC2000 and FMAP2000 are comparable. The CEFM1996 extends much further to the
east and therefore only 53% of the original extent coincided with the AOI.

Assessment protocol of the forest proportion maps

The comparison of the forest proportion maps was done in three steps for the whole of
Europe and by biogeographic regions (Eurostat 2003):

(cid:129) the occurrences of forest proportions of each map;
(cid:129) the occurrences of per pixel differences between the maps; and
(cid:129) the co-occurrence of forest proportions between the maps.

During the ﬁrst step, we analyzed the thematic information content of each map within
the comparison area. Thereby, we calculated the histogram of the forest proportions for the
CEFM1996, FMAPP2000, and CLCP2000 and compared them to each other similar to that
proposed by Riemann et al. (2010). Comparison of occurrence histograms gives valuable
information on the differences in forest proportion distributions (e.g., missing range of
values, abundance of non-forested pixels and very high forested pixels). These differences
might have been caused by the classiﬁcation approach applied.

In this study we compare continuous maps, so the spatial agreement is not deﬁned
by coincidence of classes but is examined by means of the differences in their values.
Therefore, we calculated in a second step the pixel-by-pixel difference between the maps
and computed the histogram of these differences. For Europe, we further classiﬁed the
differences into ‘good agreement’ (–10% to 10% difference), ‘medium agreement’ (−10%
to −25% and 10–25% difference), ‘low agreement’ (–25% to −50% and 20–50%) and
‘disagreement’ (more than ±50% difference). This was done in order to highlight areas
of agreement and variation. Differences up to 10% were considered marginal given the
variety of methods and uncertainty of the classiﬁcations. For the biogeographic regions,
the full distribution of the differences between the maps was examined for anomalies.

As a measure for overall agreement, we used the agreement coefﬁcient (AC) proposed
by Ji and Gallo (2006) for its ability to allow agreement estimations among data sets that
both may contain error. This symmetric measure is described in detail in Ji and Gallo
(2006), but brieﬂy AC is deﬁned as

where SSD is the sum of the square difference between the maps X and Y

AC = 1 − SSD
SPOD

SSD =

(Xi − Yi)2

and the SPOD is the sum of potential differences

SPOD =

(|X − Y | + |Xi − X |)(|X − Y | + |Yi − Y |)

n(cid:2)

i=1

where x and y are the mean values of the maps X and Y . The AC ranges from 0 to 1, with
AC = 1 indicating perfect agreement between the maps.

The degree and amount of disagreement found between the maps as well as the AC
gave no information about the ranges of forest proportion where the differences tend to
occur. Differences may occur in all forest proportion ranges but might be of different

importance. For this reason, we created a two-dimensional and color-coded density plot
of all co-occurrences of the forest proportion maps, by overlaying two maps and totting
up, on a pixel basis, the forest proportion combinations between them. This density plot
is a graphical visualization of a contingency table with the 1:1 line (identity line) repre-
senting all coincident forest proportion pixel values in both maps. Ji and Gallo (2006) and
Riemann et al. (2010) proposed to use a geometric mean functional relationship (GMFR)
regression line to describe the relationship between maps in the different proportion ranges.
This GMFR regression line attempts to give information on the systematic and unsystem-
atic errors based on a linear assumption, but does not quantitatively indicate the variation
of differences along the identity line. Therefore, we assumed, as Ji and Gallo (2006) did,
equal uncertainty as a ﬁrst approximation of both maps and performed a Gauss-ﬁt orthog-
onal to the 1:1 line of the density plot. From this we derived standard deviation and bias
(see, e.g. in Figure 2). This exercise was done on pan-European level and by biogeographic
regions.

proportion classes. For CLCP2000 the high occurrence of non-forested pixels (0% propor-
tion class) of almost 40% of the AOI is remarkable, while CEFM1996 and FMAPP2000
show considerable smaller amounts of non-forested pixels. For the latter maps, the distri-
bution is rather shifted to the ﬁrst two forest proportion classes representing low forest
proportion, while CLCP2000 showed a large drop in these classes. The distribution of the
moderate to high forested pixels (20–80%) revealed little differences between the forest
proportions and remained stable. Only for very dense forest (90–100%), the CEFM1996
deviated having very low occurrence, whereas FMAPP2000 and CLCP2000 had in 5% of
the AOI very high forest proportion.

Considering the forest proportion distributions by biogeographic regions, a general pat-
tern is visible for whole Europe (Figure 4). The distribution within the Alpine and boreal
biogeographic regions shows for all maps a rather skewed distribution toward the high for-
est proportion classes. Also noticeable is the relatively low presence of very high forested
pixels of CEFM1996 in the boreal region. While the Alpine and boreal regions show
a rather homogeneous distribution pattern, the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pannonian
regions reveal a strong exponential gain in the low forested classes. This phenomenon is
less pronounced in the continental region.

The maps’ distributions generally reﬂect the ﬁndings on the European level, with
CLCP2000 having substantially higher occurrences in the 0% class (non-forest) than
FMAPP2000 and CEFM1996, and CEFM1996 lower occurrences in high forest propor-
tion classes. However, in the Mediterranean and continental regions of the CEFM1996 the
non-forested class almost does not occur (2%) while FMAPP2000 and CLCP2000 have
much higher frequency (25% and 56%). Also in the Pannonian region the distribution of

Figure 4. Distribution of forest proportion classes of FMAPP2000, CLCP2000, CEFM1996 by
biogeographic regions.

CEFM1996 differs, showing a strong peak (80%) in the low forested area and almost no
frequency in the non-forested (1%) or very high forested class (2%).

Spatial assessment
The pixel-based differences between the maps are illustrated in Figure 5. The best spatial
agreement was found for CLCP2000 and FMAPP2000 with about 70% good agreement
and 20% medium agreement; however, there was a clear tendency for higher forest propor-
tions in FMAPP2000. Between FMAPP2000 and CEFM1996 good agreement dropped to
50% of the AOI, while medium agreement reached 30% equally distributed for over- and
underestimation. For CLCP2000 and CEFM1996 the good agreement fell further to 43%,
with again a medium agreement of 30% and prevailing underestimation. The ACs comple-
mented these results. The AC between FMAPP2000 and CLCP2000 was highest with 0.96;
0.92 between FMAPP2000 and CEFM1996; and lowest with 0.91 between CLCP2000 and
CEFM1996.

The analysis of the differences revealed a variety of distributions depending on the
biogeographic regions (Figure 6). The best agreement between the maps was found in
the Atlantic region, while in the Alpine and boreal regions the overall dissimilarities
became larger, in particular in the comparisons with CEFM1996. For the other regions
the general pattern was a clear tendency of CEFM1996 toward higher forest proportions.
On comparing FMAPP2000 and CLCP2000, FMAPP2000 usually showed higher forest
proportions.

With the exception of the Alpine region, there was generally a low agreement of the
non-forest (0% forest) class in CEFM1996 when compared with the two other maps.

Difference percentage classes

Figure 5. Distribution of the difference between the forest proportion maps illustrated by percentage
classes.

This was particularly pronounced in the Mediterranean and Pannonian regions, where
FMAPP2000 and CLCP2000 agreed in more than 25% of the respective regions.

Co-occurrences between the maps are illustrated in the color-coded density plots for
the whole of Europe and by biogeographic regions (Figures 7 and 8). The density plots are
interpreted as colored contingency tables of 100 classes representing the proportion range
(0–100% forest cover). Here, high co-occurrence counts are indicated by yellow/red colors
and with blue showing low co-occurrence.

Considering the whole of Europe, we found, for CLCP2000 and FMAPP2000, an over-
all good agreement of pixels for the full range of forest proportions with almost equal
scattering along the 1:1 line. Only at low forest proportion values the overestimation of
FMAPP2000 widened the scattering toward higher values along the lower x-axis. Likewise
the underestimation of higher values stretched along the higher x-axis.

Far less aligned were the co-occurrences between CLCP2000 and CEFM1996. Here,
they clustered for high and low forest proportion values (yellow areas), whereas for values
between 40% and 60%, the correlation was almost lost. Very high forest proportions (close
to 100%) were not shown by CEFM1996 (blue bar upper x-axis in Figure 7b and c). Within
the above-mentioned co-occurrence clusters the spread appeared still quite large, indicating
a lower correlation between their forest proportion values. Comparing CEFM1996 with
FMAPP2000, the distribution of co-occurrences gave a similar picture. Yet, the overall
correlation seemed to be slightly higher.

The co-occurrence density plots of the biogeographic regions (Figure 8) mirrored the
typical distribution of forest proportion within these regions, as highlighted in Figure 4.

Figure 7. Co-occurrence density plots between the 1 km forest percentage maps (FMAPP2000,
CLCPP2000, CEFM1996) with yellow/red colors indicating high counts of pixels with
co-occurrence of forest percentages and blue/green colors indicating low counts. The black line
illustrates the location of perfect agreement.

Dense, homogenous forests dominate the Alpine and boreal regions, while in the Atlantic,
Mediterranean, and Pannonian areas, low and sparse forests cause a prevalence of low
forest proportions.

Looking at all the comparisons, the scattering indicated the lowest correlation in the
Alpine and Mediterranean and the highest in the continental regions. The high forest
proportions within the Alpine and boreal regions were considerably smeared out in the
comparison of CLCP2000 and CEFM1996. A similar effect was observed for the low for-
est cover proportions, in the Mediterranean region. In all cases, congruence was almost
lost, leading to an underestimation of CEFM1996 in the case of dense forest cover and
overestimation in the case of sparse forest cover. This held true also for the comparison
CEFM1996 and FMAP2000; however, most effects appeared to be less pronounced.

The density plots (Figure 7) deliver a qualitative overview of the agreement of the
thematic content between the proportion maps. Figure 9 gives a quantitative insight based
on the density plots for Europe. Shown here are the bias and the standard deviations of the
co-occurrence distribution orthogonal to the principal diagonal. A negative bias represents
an overestimation of forest by the proportion map on the x-axis of the density plot with
respect to the other one on the y-axis. Between FMAPP2000 and CLCP2000, as seen in
the density plot, there is a slight negative bias which crosses over to a positive one at
about 70% forest cover value. The standard deviations hereby are less than 8% and similar
throughout the whole range of the forest proportion values. This changes if CLCP2000 and
CEFM1996 are compared. Here, the standard deviations are in a range of 7–25%, and the
bias is mostly negative with a maximum of 21% at around 85% forest proportion, where it
even exceeds the standard deviation.

Discussion and conclusion
Forest proportion maps are important input for the estimation of forest resources and have
been recently used for biomass and growing stock modeling in Europe. Yet, strengths and
limitations of available forest proportion maps in particular with respect to their spatial
agreement have not been investigated.

This study performed a comparative assessment of three pan-European forest pro-
portion maps of 1 km resolution focusing on the spatial agreement between each other.
This comparison highlights their similarities and obvious areas of disagreements. For this,

we applied an assessment protocol, in which we ﬁrst evaluated their individual thematic
content and then assessed their spatial agreement for Europe and by biogeographic regions.
The thematic content and the local variability provided by CLCP2000 are inherently
limited by its methodological approach. It is derived from visual interpretation of high-
resolution imagery but with an MMU of 25 ha. Smaller forest patches are merged with
neighboring dominant classes. The loss of small forest patches causes in its aggregated
form (CLCP2000) an underrepresentation of low forest proportions and an accumulation
of non-forested pixels (40% of the AOI). A corresponding effect could be expected also
for very dense forested areas, but this is not visible in these data.

In contrast to CLCP2000, CEFM1996 lacks occurrences in the extreme forest propor-
tion classes. The reason may be related to the methodology or input data applied. While
CLC2000 and FMAP2000 are based on high-resolution data (Landsat ETM+) which were
then aggregated to 1 km, CEFM1996 is directly derived from 1 km AVHRR satellite data.
Several studies observed that AVHRR data omit small land cover features, especially in
highly fragmented landscapes (Sivanpillai et al. 2008). In order to lessen the underestima-
tion of sparsely forested areas and overestimation of dense forest, Päivinen et al. (2009)
proposed to favor a continuous rather than discrete mapping methodology as in the case
of CEFM1996. However, for CEFM1996 the underrepresentation of non-forested pixel in
the Mediterranean and Pannonian regions and of dense forested pixel in most of the other
biogeographic regions is very pronounced and may be rather explained by the subsequent
calibration to the ofﬁcial forest statistics.

The high-resolution input data of 25 m for the original FMAP2000 made it possi-
ble to capture small land cover patches compared with CLC2000 as already illustrated
by Pekkarinen et al. (2009). These were then aggregated into the coarse forest proportion
pixels of FMAPP2000 resulting in many pixels with low forest proportion. The remain-
ing distribution tends to follow closely that of CLCP2000. Still, FMAP2000 and also the
aggregated form FMAPP2000 have a higher ability to discriminate subtle changes of forest
proportions.

The spatial assessment of these forest proportion maps revealed insights of where these
maps correspond to each other. Certainly, the thematic content of the different maps has
an impact on the spatial agreement. Therefore, deviation between 5% and 10% may occur
due to the diverse methodological approaches behind the maps. For example, the higher
forest cover of FMAPP2000 in comparison to CLCP2000 and CEFM1996 is explained by
the greater ability of Landsat to capture small forest patches as discussed before. However,
differences of more than 25% must originate beyond this reason, in particular when an
equal error was assumed for both maps.

Larger differences were found between FMAPP2000 and CEFM1996 or CLCP2000
in urban areas containing wooded parks or gardens. While FMAPP2000 delineated these
as forest proportions in cities, CEFM1996 and CLCP2000 showed nearly no forest cover.
Figure 10a gives an example of the differing results of the maps within an urban area
(Berlin). Roads, buildings, and parks produce a complicated pattern of pixel signatures
on 30 m resolution, while on 1 km resolution the mixture of these signatures produces a
‘unique’ urban signal. This signal diminished the probability to classify wooded areas or
gardens as forest. Hence, the CEFM1996 based on AVHRR data seems better suited to rule
out forest cover detection in urban or residential areas. This effect has also been observed
by Raptis et al. (2003) and Sivanpillai et al. (2008). In the visual interpretation CLCP2000
labels tree cover in urban areas such as parks and gardens as land use class ‘Green urban
areas,’ which was not considered as forest in the aggregation.

distribution might be distorted in these regions. This is pronounced if large forests are
divided by administrative boundaries, whose forest statistics differ, as also observed by
Päivinen et al. (2009).

Patterns of high deviations of pixel values between CEFM1996 and the other maps may
be explained to some extent by mis-registration issues or time shifts between the data sets.
Even after the systematic shift of half a pixel before the comparison a mis-registration is
still detectable (see Figure 10c), which is manifest in the Scandinavian area along bound-
aries of dense forests. This could have contributed to the overall high spatial disagreement
in the boreal region between CEFM1996 and the other two maps. The low spatial agree-
ment between CLCP2000 and FMAPP2000 in the boreal region is rather caused by the
MMU of CLC2000. Clear-cuts in the boreal regions are often smaller than 25 ha and are
mapped in CLC2000 as forest, while in the FMAP2000 they are classiﬁed as non-forest.

The causes of the lower spatial agreement between all proportion maps in the Alpine
region might be manifold. First, the region is prone to persistent cloud cover, which
affects mainly the automated classiﬁcation approaches of FMAP2000 and CEFM1996.
Topographic shading introduces further misclassiﬁcation particularly in high altitudes
where forest cover is unlikely. The effect of the topography might be most prominent
for the FMAPP2000. Similar to the case of the urban area, the high spatial resolution of
Landsat might depict cast shadows which might have been confused by the classiﬁcation
with coniferous forests, while on a 1 km pixel of the AVHRR the signal is mixed with
bright non-vegetated areas, resulting in less confusion.

The detailed forest spatial pattern in FMAP2000 is translated into a subtle gradation of
the FMAPP2000. This is interesting for studies in which fragmented forests are relevant.
However, this advantage of FMAPP2000 is accompanied by a higher sensitivity to classify
forest in areas that would be disregarded by certain users, for example, in urban areas or
shades. This is less the case in CEFM1996 due to the lower resolution of the AVHRR.
However, the calibration process of CEFM1996, which attempted to match forest cover
classiﬁcation to forest use statistics, manipulated range and distribution of the forest pro-
portion. This resulted in large spatial disagreements to CLCP2000 and FMAPP2000. In
addition, due to the missing information on the spatial accuracy of CEFM1996, indication
for its use for spatial applications cannot be easily given. CLCP2000 proved to have its
strengths if land use is of major interest, but is less precise in delineation of small forest
features.

Aside from the results from the comparison of the forest maps, the method applied
proved to be appropriate for detecting local spatial differences between the maps with
continuous variables. The proposed method offers the possibility to determine similarities
and dissimilarities between continuous maps, for example, biomass maps, forest density
maps, or soil sealing layers, even if the original resolutions are different.

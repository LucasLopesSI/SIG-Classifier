The primary goal of this study is to empirically analyse the influence of colour distance and font size on map readability.
We utilized eye-tracking to complement the classical usability metrics; thus, we studied performance metrics such as
effectiveness (i.e. success, accuracy), efficiency (i.e. time to answer, task completion time), and selected eye tracking
metrics fixation frequency, fixation duration and scanpath speed as well as conducting an area-of-interest (AOI)
analysis to understand the performance and strategy issues that may be influenced by colour distance and font size during
map reading. The user experiment was carried out in a controlled laboratory where participants were asked to conduct a
visual search task and mark the correct answer with a mouse click on a static map on a computer screen. Collected data
was analysed through descriptive and inferential statistics. Task completion times for the five tested colour distances show
that as the colour distances grow larger, the relative differences in task completion times become statistically significant;
empirically confirming our intuition that larger colour distances are better for map readability. The comparison of the
scanpath speeds for the tested font sizes suggests that the medium font size leads to a more efficient search.

INTRODUCTION

Cartographers have long been interested in evaluating the
usability of visual representations (e.g. effectiveness, efﬁ-
ciency and user satisfaction) to be able to distinguish a
‘good map’ from a ‘bad map’. A common overarching goal
in cartographic user research appears to be obtaining rules
to ensure quality, and use these rules to create a ‘good map’
(note that we will use the word map to express the entire
spectrum of geographic visualisations
this
paper).

throughout

The quality of a map depends on various factors – e.g.
design choices should be supported by empirical evidence
where possible, the map must be a good ﬁt for its intended
purpose and ideally, it must be tailored for its audience.
Besides these, another important factor determining the map
quality is the background of the said audience, i.e. the map
user. When people of different backgrounds and different skill
levels use maps, it is likely (and to some degree, demonstrated)
that each group will perform best with a different map, and
subjectively rate also different maps as the ‘best map’ (Olson,
typically
1979). To address such subjective differences,
usability (or in a wider sense, user-experience) tests are
conducted with human subjects, and most commonly

efﬁciency (speed), effectiveness (accuracy) and satisfaction are
measured (ISO, 1998). Performance metrics (efﬁciency and
effectiveness) can inﬂuence the satisfaction, that is, the users
are likely to prefer the map that facilitates faster/more accurate
results, especially given that the preference questions are asked
after the tasks are executed (Schnu¨rer et al., 2014). This is,
however, not always the case – sometimes users prefer a
particular design, but do not perform well with it (Hegarty
et al., 2009).

Besides the user-centric (‘bottom-up’) thinking, there are
theoretical (‘top-down’) approaches in determining the
quality of a map. Among these top-down quality criteria, a
central and self-evident one is a map’s readability. But what
are the factors that limit the readability of a map? Harrie
and Stigmar (2009) report two kinds of map readability
limitations: The ﬁrst is connected with complexity of the
map (i.e. quantity and distribution of the information
included on the map display), while the second is concerned
with the visualisation choices and design of cartographic
symbols. Some design principles are well established for
cartography (e.g. Slocum et al., 1999; Dent et al., 2009)
based on conventions that were applied in map-making for
centuries (Garlandini and Fabrikant, 2009). In one of the
most established and well-recognized cartographic theories,

texture, orientation and shape. Bertin’s

Bertin (1983) classiﬁes the basic elements of a visualisation
design into seven visual variables; size, colour value, colour
hue,
(1983)
systematisation of the visual variables was later extended
by MacEachren (2004), who proposed including dynamic
variables relevant to digital products: display time, duration,
order, rate of change,
frequency and synchronisation.
Modifying visual variables will change the meaning of the
map symbol, therefore, visual variables are regularly and
purposefully modiﬁed in visualisations to convey the desired
meaning.

Another important and commonly applied top-down
design consideration is
to maintain ‘sufﬁcient’ visual
distance between map symbols to keep them readable and
thus, their meaning distinguishable (e.g. Bjorke, 1996).
While the visual distance is often conceptualized as the
spatial distance between graphic objects, it is also relevant in
determining other kinds of quantitative and qualitative
distances between visual variables – e.g. on a choropleth
map, a slightly different shade of the same colour represents
a different value and we need to distinguish the two shades
to be able to process the visual information. Determining a
sufﬁcient visual distance between the values of the same
variable (so that we can tell them apart) has been an
important subject in cartography and is relevant today as
the visualisation hardware and software keeps changing and
we have newer methods to obtain more information from
user studies.

In this paper, we present a study on the readability of map
labels as we modify the visual distance between two
fundamental visual variables (size and colour value), using
eye tracking in addition to the traditional usability metrics
similar to others in recent literature (e.g. C¸ o¨ltekin et al.,
2009). These two visual variables are critical to readability
of map labels, and recent studies show that size and colour
are among the strongest visual variables (e.g. Chesneau,
2007; Gartner and Hiller 2008; Garlandini and Fabrikant,
2009). Therefore, we contribute indirectly to the research
on visual variables and directly to visualisation design
research by empirically investigating the effect of varying
levels of colour distance and font size on the users’ ability
to read the labels. More speciﬁcally, we conduct a user
experiment in which users need to identify place names as
we vary the size of the labels, and the colour of the
background (label colour
the
distance between label’s colour and the background
changes). We study the eye movement data to observe
users’ visual strategies and how they divide their attention
in task-relevant and irrelevant areas of the display.

RELATED WORK

Map labels
There are dozens of research papers in literature on label
placement and ﬁnding algorithmic solutions for placing
labels on a map. Many of these studies are concerned with
the spatial position of the labels in which the goal is to avoid
occlusion or overlaps with other map objects (e.g. Wagner
and Wolf, 1995; Doddi et al., 1997; van Dijk, 2001;

Polishchuk and Vihavainen, 2010; Ooms et al., 2012). One
of the goals in our study (i.e. to ﬁnd what kind of colour
distance is appropriate between a label’s colour and the
background colour) is relevant to label placement problem,
as the automatic label placement approaches should be
concerned about the colour conﬁguration of the algor-
ithmically proposed position of the label.

One of the earliest experimental studies on readability of
map labels in relation to colour is by Robinson (1952). He
studied selected set of labels with varying colours on varying
background colours. According to this study, the best
combination is black letters on a white background, while
the worst are black on purple, red on green or orange on
white background (Robinson, 1952). His study sets the
basis for the questions we study here at a conceptual level,
however, the paper lacks precise speciﬁcation of stimuli
settings, i.e. investigated colours are not reported numeri-
cally in any colour space coordinates; and thus, we are
unable to repeat the experiment, or re-use the colour
combinations. Robinson’s (1952) study does not include a
font-size variation for labels. In relation to label size, an
early study appears to be by Bartz (1970) in which she
reports a study on visual search efﬁciency for map labels in
various conditions. Bartz (1970) experimented with maps
containing labels under what she called ‘ﬁxed conditions’
(constant
font size and type) and ‘mixed conditions’
(various font sizes and types on a map sheet). In her study,
no differences were observed for the readability of serif and
serif-sans
fonts, nor did varying font size produce a
signiﬁcant effect on the search time.

According to Deeb et al. (2011, 2012) determining the
most legible typographic variable depends on two factors,
map aesthesis and map efﬁciency. They reported a study
which focused on identifying preferred visual variables for
map labels taking the inﬂuence of expertise level of map
users (i.e. cartography education and practice) into account.
They found that preferences of the examined groups vary
unsystematically, thus, based on this study, determination
of most legible typographic variable appears to remain
inconclusive. Deeb et al.’s approach (2011, 2012) has some
methodological similarities to our work; however, the study
asks a different question and does not include colour
variations.

Colour distance
Colour perception is a subjective process (Gegenfurtner and
Sharpe, 2001), however, to enable reproduction, it has
been measured and quantiﬁed into reference systems –
termed as colour spaces. Colour spaces are divided into two
groups in relation to human colour perception: perceptually
non-uniform and uniform (CIE, 2012). The typical colour
systems
integrated in cartography and GIS software
packages (such as RGB, HSV, HSB and HSL1) use
perceptual terminology to label dimensions (such as hue,
value, lightness, brightness, saturation), but they are not
necessarily perceptually uniform (Brewer et al., 2003). In
order to ensure conformity between the measured colour
distances and human perception, it is necessary to work
with perceptually uniform colour spaces (Slocum et al.,
1999). Currently, most commonly used perceptually uni-
form colour spaces appear to be the CIE 1976 (L*, a*, b*)

204

The Cartographic Journal

– CIELAB and the CIE 1976 (L*u*v*) – CIELUV (Landa
and Fairchild, 2005). These two models were developed to
describe (ideally) all colours perceived by human eye (Dent
et al., 2009).

Colour, as a dominant visual variable, operates in a
preponderant way in readability problems (Stigmar, 2010).
Therefore,
it is evident that colour distance should be
sufﬁciently large to allow identiﬁcation of symbols, pre-
ferably with maximum ease. To address this concern,
International Commission on Illumination (CIE) has
introduced DE as their colour distance metric. The most
commonly used calculations of colour distance are based on
determining the linear distance in the CIELAB colour
space, such as the CIE76 (DE*ab) and the CIEDE2000
(DE00), where the latter is a reﬁnement of the former
(Werman, 2012). According to Carter and Huertas (2009),
CIEDE2000 is more reliable than CIELAB when applied to
very small colour differences (as intended) as well as very
large colour differences (as later demonstrated). For this
study, it is important that the formulation works well for
larger colour distances, thus we chose to work with the
CIEDE2000. The speciﬁcations of
the formulas are
published, for example by Sharma et al. (2004).

There is a substantial amount of research with the goal to
optimize colours for map users with various colour vision
deﬁciencies (e.g. Culp, 2012; Jenny and Kelso, 2007; Olson
and Brewer, 1997). Majority of existing studies are focused
on investigating the efﬁciency of sequential colour schemes
(Kimerling, 1985; Gilmartin and Shelton, 1989; Chesneau,
2007; Buard and Ruas, 2009), qualitative data visualisation
(Vondra´kova´ et al., 012; Kro¨ger et al., 2013) or investigat-
ing colour scales for special mapping purposes - for example
noise maps (Schiewe and Weninger, 2013). Related to our
work, Steinru¨cken and Plu¨mer (2013) have introduced an
approach for optimizing colour conﬁguration for on-
demand maps based on the idea of keeping the minimum
colour distance as high as possible. Arguably, the most
signiﬁcant contribution in the visualisation domain regarding
colours is the ColorBrewer2 tool developed by Harrower and
Brewer (2003). This online software provides speciﬁcations
of colour scales of different shades and numbers of categories
taking their distinguishability on liquid-crystal displays
(LCD) or printed materials into account and suggests
optimized colour scales for people with colour vision
impairments. The tool was designed based on colour theory
and empirical studies with colour vision impaired map users
(Olson and Brewer, 1997).

In summary,

from the perspective of the two visual
variables we study, font size and colour use appear to have
been studied to some degree. However, how the font size
interacts with colour distance, i.e. the numerical difference
that determines how far two colours or shades are apart
from each other appears to have never been studied in the
context of map readability.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

The aim of the presented study is to detect the inﬂuence of
colour distance between map labels and the background, the
font size, and the combinations of changing size and colour on

the readability of the labels. The general hypothesis of the
study is that increasing colour distance between map labels
and background and increasing font size will have a positive
impact on the readability,
i.e. map users will have less
trouble while searching for and reading the labels. To test
this hypothesis, we studied two independent variables:
colour distance and font size.

We used eye-tracking to determine the efﬁciency and
strategy of stimulus reading (Salvucci and Goldberg, 2000).
Raw eye-tracking data are typically classiﬁed based on spatial
and temporal thresholds into ﬁxations and saccades. It is
assumed that humans can perceive a particular object during
a ﬁxation (i.e. only when looking at this point a certain
amount of time), while during fast saccadic movements they
do not actually register what they see (Holmqvist et al.,
2011). Eye-tracking metrics can be derived based on
ﬁxations and saccades (e.g. number, duration and dispersion
of ﬁxations, length and direction of the recorded trajectories
of the view).

Our dependent variables,

therefore, were accuracy,
speed, and a selected set of eye movement metrics, namely
ﬁxation frequency, ﬁxation duration and scanpath speed, to
interpret users’ strategies, as well as an area of interest
(AOI) analysis.

Materials
Experimental stimuli were signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed maps
presented as static images of the size 192061080 pixels
(see Figure 1 for an illustration). The simpliﬁcation of the
thematic and graphical content was necessary for experi-

Maine, New Jersey and Wyoming). The shapes of the states
as well as number of labels (administrative units) on stimuli
varied (Arizona 15, Nevada 17, Maine 18, New Jersey 21
and Wyoming 24). However, the within-subject design3 of
the experiment ensures
this variation does not
that
inﬂuence the results for the independent variable font size
(all participants work with all conditions). For
the
independent variable colour distance, participants worked
with a subset for each condition, but the variation here was
subtle enough that we did not expect any effect on the
results after the pilot study (this was later conﬁrmed in a
dedicated analysis as well).

A total of 15 maps were prepared (Figure 1). Each
stimulus is characterized by the concrete value of colour
distance between labels and the background colour. Five
levels of colour distance (which are of equal distance in
RGB space and correspond to CIEDE2000 formula
DE00530, 50, 70, 85 and 100) and three levels of font
size (8, 11 and 14 pt) were examined.

Selected font sizes express precisely what was shown to
the participants and were selected because they are
commonly used in regular displays as well as traditional
atlases (Robinson, 1952). Regarding the colour choice, we
decided to begin with studying primary colours and among
them, green; as the human vision is most sensitive to green
spectrum (Dent et al., 2009). The labels were in all cases in
pure black (RGB (0,0,0)), because this is the most common
choice for labels and sans-serif font type (Arial), because this

search for place names on maps well (Slocum et al., 1999).
Based the previous research (as reported in the Section
Colour Distance), we applied the perceptually uniform CIE
1976 L*a*b* colour space in this study. The distance
between two colours was computed with the CIEDE2000
method. L*a*b* values were related to CIE standard
illuminant D65. Experimental stimuli were shown in a
digital environment and therefore only colours from CIE
1976 L*a*b* gamut, that can be converted into real values
of RGB colour space, were used. The computation of
colour distance and transformation between CIE 1976
L*a*b* and RGB colour space were done with use of the

web calculator designed by Lindbloom (2012). A tentative
view of all examined colour distances is shown in Figure 2.
Related numerical colour speciﬁcation (RGB and L*a*b*
codes) of the background and colour distance levels to the
black labels (calculated by three different methods) can be
seen in Table 1.

Procedure
Experiment was carried out under controlled laboratory
conditions at the Department of Geoinformatics, Palacky´
University, Olomouc, which is equipped with a low-frequency

frequency of 120 Hz. Stimuli were presented on 230 LG
Flatron monitor IPS231P. Experiment was prepared using
SMI Experiment Center2 (SensoMotoric
Instruments,
2013a).

In a within-subject manner, participants were asked to
ﬁnd an administrative unit by its name and mark it with a
mouse click within a given time limit. Stimuli were prepared
so that we could avoid the effect of previous geographical
knowledge of the areas, i.e., we asked participants if they
were familiar with the studied areas and admitted only those
who were not. We randomized the order of the stimuli to
distribute the learning effect, which is a common practice in
experimental studies (e.g. see Holmqvist et al., 2011).

As can be seen in Figure 3, the experiment was composed
of 15 randomized trials. Each trial contained a text stimulus
with the task description, aﬁxation cross
and a map. We
presented the task description for 30 seconds, the ﬁxation
cross for 0.5 seconds and the map stimulus for 30 seconds.
Time limits were introduced as a measure to control the
experiment’s length and have been obtained based on pilot
studies. We optimized the time limits so that participants have
enough time to solve the task without feeling time pressure. If
a participant did not provide a response within this time
frame, we considered them unsuccessful at that task.

Participants
53 volunteers took part in the experiment and they were
offered no compensation. Gaze data from a total of 50
participants were used, i.e. data from three participants with
tracking ratio less than 90% and calibration accuracy higher
than 1u were removed. Participants were asked to state their
age, sex, whether they had colour vision deﬁciencies, and
their levels of expertise in cartography. The participant age
ranged between 20–25 years. All of them were students of
Palacky´ University, Olomouc. Thirty out of 50 participants
(,60%) took at least one cartography course (‘experts’); 20
out of 50 participants (,40%) have no previous cartography
experience (‘novices’). Twenty-eight of them were males
(18 experts and 10 novices) and 22 were females (12
experts and 10 novices). None of participants reported any
colour vision deﬁciency.

ANALYSIS METHODS

Collected data were analysed with regards to usability
metrics effectiveness (accuracy of the answers), efﬁciency
(time participants took to ﬁnd the correct answers), and the
eye-tracking metrics ﬁxation frequency, average ﬁxation
duration and scanpath speed. First, overall performance
differences between stimuli based on colour distances and
font sizes were evaluated (regardless of gender or expertise).
Following this, group differences between females/males
and experts/novices were examined.

Fixation detection was performed through the SMI
BeGaze software (SensoMotoric Instruments, 2013b) using
ID-T (dispersion threshold algorithm). Dispersion thresh-
old was set to 50 pixels and a minimum length of 80 ms-
based pilot experiments4. Basic eye-tracking metrics has
been calculated in the open source software OGAMA
(Voßku¨hler, 2013) and statistical analysis of the measured
data has been performed using the R software (R Core
Team, 2013). According to Goldberg and Kotval (1999),
more overall ﬁxations and longer scanpaths (the length of
gaze trajectory over the stimulus) could indicate a less
efﬁcient search process. Longer ﬁxation duration could
mean difﬁculty in extracting information, or the object is
more engaging/relevant for the task in some way (Eastman,
1985; Poole and Ball, 2005). Time to answer (response
time/task completion time) reﬂects the performance and
success during information search. Absolute values of eye-
tracking metrics (ﬁxation count and scanpath length)
positively correlates with the time to answer, thus we
examined proportional ﬁxation frequency (count per
second) and scanpath speed (pixels per second), because
these metrics are independent of time.

We conducted statistical analysis on the measured
dependent variables. Prior to inferential statistics, we tested
the data for normality with Shapiro-Wilk test (Shapiro and
Wilk, 1965). Results showed that on the signiﬁcance level
a50.05 none of measurements were normally distributed:
ﬁxation frequency W50.96, p56.94610212; average ﬁxation
duration W50.93, p,2.2610216; scanpath speed W50.99,
p50.03; time to answer W50.82, p,2.2610216. Because
none of the data are normally distributed, data does not meet

The Cartographic Journal

Using the post-hoc Kruskal–Wallis we observed that the
participants had signiﬁcantly lower scanpath speeds (less
pixels viewed per second) while searching for the answer on
stimuli with font size 11 pt (Mdn5371.3 px/s, Figure 4).
No signiﬁcant differences were observed between stimuli
with font sizes 8 pt (Mdn5417.3 px/s) and 14 pt
(Mdn5425.9 px/s). While our overall ﬁndings suggested
that the tested font sizes perform somewhat similarly in
terms of visual search performance and conﬁrm the results
of Bartz (1970), at this point, we found that the font size
11 facilitated a more decisive search compared to the
others. A lower scanpath speed means participants can ﬁnd
the information they look for without having to examine as
much information as in other conditions.

In the next step, we analysed the main effects for the colour
distance (regardless the font size and user groups) using
Kruskal–Wallis test. A signiﬁcant result was observed for the
to answer (H517.05, DF54,
performance metric time
P50.00, Table 2). Post-hoc Kruskal–Wallis tests reveal that the
observed difference refers to stimuli with the lowest colour
distance (DE00530, Mdn54.5 seconds) and two highest
(DE00585 with Mdn53.5 seconds and
colour distances
DE005100 with Mdn53.6 seconds). No other signiﬁcant
differences were observed in the middle steps (Figure 5).

To further explore the inﬂuence of colour distance, we
analysed its interactions with the different
font sizes.
Kruskal–Wallis test was performed separately for groups of
stimuli with the same font size. Signiﬁcant results were
observed in all three cases (8 pt, 11 pt and 14 pt) for time to
answer metric (Table 2). In the case of the medium and
largest font size the scanpath speed metric appears to be
signiﬁcant as well. Post-hoc Kruskal–Wallis tests revealed
further differences among various combinations of stimuli
with different font sizes and colour distances (Figure 6).

At this point, to study the attention that users paid to the
task-relevant areas versus task-irrelevant areas on the display
for our tested conditions, we performed an analysis of gaze
data in speciﬁed AOIs. To counter the possible registration
issues with the eye tracking, we constructed regions around
each label to include all gaze points that are closer to that
label than to any other, similarly to the idea of Voronoi
diagrams.

Based on the AOI analysis, we observe a vast difference
between dwell times on the task-relevant AOIs (where the
correct answer is) and irrelevant AOIs (other labels on
stimuli). In general participants need to spend only a short
time to identify that a label
the correct one
(M5134.1 ms), while to ﬁnd and mark the correct AOI
they spend considerably more time (M51286.2 ms).

the parametric assumption, and therefore, only non-para-
metric statistical tests were used in the analysis.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

All participants were able to ﬁnd the correct answer within
the given time limit of 30 seconds; thus, the accuracy of
answers was not evaluated further.

Font size and colour distance
Font size examination was conducted as an overall statistical
analysis between the tested font sizes, regardless of the
colour distance and user backgrounds. For this purpose, the
visual search efﬁciency (time to answer) and visual search
strategies (eye-tracking metrics) for the three groups of
stimuli with three types of font size were compared by
applying the Kruskal–Wallis test (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952).
Only the scanpath speed metric (H5 17.56, p50.00) yields
statistically signiﬁcant results. No statistically signiﬁcant
results were observed for other metrics (Table 2).

Measuring the Influence of Colour Distance and Font Size

Figure 5. Box plots showing time to answer values observed for
stimuli with different colour distances. Exact median values are
given inside boxplots. A general trend can be observed that the lar-
ger the colour distance the less time people use to identify the
labels

Analysing the ﬁrst ﬁxations on the ‘correct AOI’; our
observations conﬁrmed that when there is a larger colour
distance between the label and the background, people
need less time to ﬁnd the correct answer. This decreasing
trend is illustrated in Figure 7. Kruskal–Wallist test proved
signiﬁcant differences (H525.84, DF54, p50.00) between
DE00530 and DE00585, DE00530 and DE005100 and also
DE00570 and DE005100. This corresponds squarely with
our previous ﬁnding about time to answer and further
validates our ﬁndings about the colour distance.

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

In this manuscript, our main contribution is an empirical
user study to analyse the inﬂuence of colour distance
(between the colour of the map labels and their back-
ground) and font size on map readability.

All participants were successful in locating the searched
items in all conditions within the time limits (i.e. accuracy
was 100%). This level of accuracy suggests that conditions
we provided are essentially usable – our smallest DE is much
than the so-called ‘just noticeable difference’
higher
(Linhares et al., 2008), and the smallest font size we used
(8 pt)
is used in certain map scales. However, we
investigated ﬁner differences based on other metrics.
Analysing the time to answer for the ﬁve colour distances
empirically validates what is common sense; the relative
differences in time to answer become statistically signiﬁcant
as the colour distances grow larger (30–85 and 30–100).
More precisely, observed median value of time to answer on
the stimuli with DE00530 was Mdn54.5 seconds. Median
time on DE00585 was Mdn53.5 seconds and on DE005100
was Mdn53.6 seconds. These results were further validated

Figure 6. Charts show median values of observed metrics sepa-
rated for groups of stimuli with different label size (8, 11 or 14 pt)
and colour distance between labels and background (DE00530, 50,
70, 85 or 100)

in the following AOI analysis. These ﬁndings mean that even
if a search task is successfully completed, a map user will lose
time with a combination of a dark background with a dark (in
this case black) label. In certain map use cases, this can be
critically important (e.g. emergency and rescue, driving) in
time pressure situations or simply frustrating.

the effect of spatial distance, and eventually surrounding
colours. The combined results from this experiment and
follow-up experiments should allow us to establish thresholds
that can be used as guidelines in map design and help us all
decide which colour distances can be applied in maps with no
perceptual concerns for discernibility. Additionally, we intend
to explore group differences for visual search strategies,
possibly contributing how we can guide the users to create
personalized maps for themselves or designers to create maps
that work better for the target groups. In the long-term, we
also aspire to contribute to developing educational strategies
that work for all groups.

Figure 7. Boxplot shows time to ﬁrst recorded ﬁxation over the
AOI covering the correct answer observed for ﬁve groups of stimuli
with different colour distance

The comparison of the font size based on time metrics
suggests that the medium font size (11 pt) is the most
efﬁcient. This result is mainly based on the eye movement
metric scanpath speed showing us the number of pixels
covered per second as the participants move their eyes on the
display. In this case, arguably, we interpret that covering less
pixels per second indicates some level of certainty. Having a
better result for a medium size conforms to the previous
knowledge – it has been demonstrated that too little or too
much information can inﬂuence decision performance (e.g.
C¸ o¨ltekin and Rechenbacher, 2011). Furthermore, we studied
to see if we could observe an interaction between font size and
colour distance, and our current results suggest that the
performance of people based on size and colour do not
strongly interact. Nonetheless, these initial results about font
sizes warrant further tests to obtain a rule for font sizes
especially in relation to colour distance.

To summarize our results; the tested colour distances
essentially should not impair basic success for readability of
map labels, but it will slow people down, i.e., larger colour
distances yield consistently better results in terms of ‘time
to answer’. This paper documents empirically (based on a
user study and in a quantiﬁed manner) that a DE00 of 70
(difference between DE00530 and DE005100) will change
the speed of label identiﬁcation consistently. Among the
three font sizes, we tested the middle size (font size 11)
allows a better experience in visual
search with this
combination of colours according to our interpretation of
the scanpath speed metric.

These results, insights and observations allow us to build
new hypotheses and the next steps involve in further
experiments to test the effective limits of colour distance
until we understand thresholds for colour discrimination, and
visual behaviour during the colour discrimination process in
cartographic tasks. Future experiments will take more factors
into account that inﬂuence the colour perception including

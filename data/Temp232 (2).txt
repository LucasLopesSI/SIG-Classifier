ABSTRACT
This paper reviews formal approaches to representing spatial
knowledge about qualitative direction. Unlike geometric direction
information, qualitative information does not employ numerical
values but relies on comparison. The qualitative approach is often
regarded as suitable for capturing commonsense concepts and
thus is relevant to human-centered interfaces for spatial informa-
tion systems. To establish a context for the work on qualitative
direction, we preset a brief history of the development of qualita-
tive temporal and spatial representations from diﬀerent scientiﬁc
perspectives. We identify main focal areas of these representations
of spatial direction and propose a taxonomy. In the light of more
than three decades of fruitful research, we obtain a map of formal
interrelationships between diﬀerent
representations that reveal
research strands in the ﬁeld.

1. A very brief history of qualitative temporal and spatial representations

In 1983, James Allen published the paper Maintaining knowledge about temporal inter-
vals (Allen 1983) in the Communications of the ACM. The paper presented an elegant
approach to describe and relate concrete events by intervals rather than by more
abstract points in time. Temporal relations between events then can be described by
a small set of jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint relations that form the basis for a
qualitative temporal calculus. Previously, the French philosopher and logician Jean
Nicod (1923) and the Australian philosopher and computer pioneer Charles Hamblin
(1972) had proposed interval-based approaches to representing time.

Allen’s paper stimulated researchers in various scientiﬁc communities to develop
similar approaches for the spatial domain: qualitative spatial relations between spatially
extended objects that would permit reasoning about them in a natural way.

1.1. Diﬀerent scientiﬁc communities

In the 1980s, at least ﬁve diﬀerent research communities were working independently
on the representation of spatial knowledge. Participating disciplines were artiﬁcial
intelligence, cognitive science, databases, geography, geographic information science,
linguistics, philosophy, theoretical computer science and visual languages.

1.1.1. Computational linguistics and artiﬁcial intelligence in Germany
In 1986, IBM Germany started the LILOG project (LInguistic and LOGic methods and tools)
as a large-scale cooperation with German universities (Herzog and Rollinger 1991). The
University of Hamburg investigated spatial knowledge from a linguistic and reasoning
perspective (Habel 1987). At the same time, the Technical University of Munich (PAKI
project), the University of Saarland (VITRA project – Retz-Schmidt 1988) and the
University of Koblenz (KOPW project) pursued research in spatial knowledge representa-
tion, reasoning and wayﬁnding. In 1988, a series of workshops on spatial reasoning was
started in German-speaking countries (Munich 1988 – Freksa and Habel 1990; Koblenz
1990 – Hoeppner 1990; Berlin 1993 – Hernández 1993).

1.1.2. Philosophy, linguistics and computer science in France/Europe
In the late 1980s, the University of Toulouse initiated an international workshop series
on Semantics of Time, Space, and Movement. In the early 1990s, these workshops were
held at Chˆateau de Bonas (Aurnague and Borillo 1993, Amsili et al. 1995) and were
attended by philosophers, linguists, logicians, theoretical computer scientists and cog-
nitive scientists; they brought together research groups from France, Germany, Spain,
the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Ireland. The European
Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence began to hold workshops on spatial concepts and
spatial and temporal
reasoning in Vienna (Pribbenow and Schlieder 1992) and
Amsterdam (Rodríguez 1994).

1.1.3. Geography and geographic information science in USA
The National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA) was established in
1988 as a National Science Foundation center for research in geographic information
and its related technologies (NCGIA 1999). The center is based at three sites in the
United States: at the University of California at Santa Barbara, at the University at Buﬀalo
and at the University of Maine at Orono. Activities consisted of various research initia-
tives and included intensive research in spatial databases (Egenhofer et al. 1989),
qualitative representation and reasoning about topological knowledge (Egenhofer and
Franzosa 1991), and cardinal directions (Frank 1991). The research initiatives organized
numerous ‘specialist meetings’
in which an increasing number of researchers from
external research communities participated since the early 1990s. Representation of
space and time was a recurrent topic in these meetings (Egenhofer and Golledge 1998).

1.1.4. Visual languages and data bases USA/Sweden
In the database community, research has been pursued since the mid-1980s to enable
storing and retrieving visual information through visual queries (Chang and Jungert
1996). Some of this work was extended toward applications in sea navigation.

1.1.5. Artiﬁcial intelligence in Great Britain/USA
At the University of Warwick, a topological calculus based on the work of the British
mathematician Whitehead (1929) was developed in the late 1980s to reason about
regions and their relationships. The Region Connection Calculus (RCC) (Randell et al.
1992), initially applied to model biological processes (Cui et al. 1992), has developed to
become one of the most versatile qualitative representations.

Success in developing a repertoire of universal spatial representations was early
questioned by the observations of Forbus et al. (1991) who formulated the poverty
conjecture which postulates the non-existence of a general symbolic representation of
space. Since then, a plethora of speciﬁc approaches has been developed and new means
of performing spatial reasoning have been explored.

1.2. Bringing the communities together

When these research communities gradually became aware of each other in the early
1990s, the activities eventually reached a critical mass where scientiﬁc exchange
between the communities started to become fruitful on a larger scale. In 1990, a highly
interdisciplinary 2-week NATO Advanced Study Institute on Cognitive and linguistic
aspects of geographic space to be held in Las Navas (Spain) was widely announced.
About 60 researchers from a considerable variety of disciplines including cartography,
from
cognitive science,
around the world, came together for extensive exchanges.

linguistics, psychology, geography and computer science,

“The 1990 NATO ASI was designated as the closing event for Research Initiative 2
Languages of Spatial Relations of the US National Center for Geographic Information and
Analysis (NCGIA). Seen in retrospect, the closing designation is somewhat ironic, because
the meeting at Las Navas was really the opening of an important research theme in the
emerging ﬁelds of Spatial Information Theory and Geographic Information Science.“;
(Frank et al. 2013)

The meeting brought together research communities that were hitherto not aware of
each other and it was the starting point for a truly interdisciplinary research exchange
which continued in Pisa and San Miniato in 1992. In 1993, the Conference on Spatial
Information Theory (COSIT) series started in Marciana Marina (Elba, Italy).

In 1993, the topic of spatial reasoning became a special topic in additional
research networks: a workshop on Qualitative and causal reasoning in connection
with the AISB ’93 conference in Birmingham; a workshop on qualitative spatial
reasoning in connection with the IMACS QUARDET ’93 (Qualitative Reasoning and
Decision Technologies) conference in Barcelona; a pre-conference workshop on spa-
tial reasoning in connection with the IEEE VL ’93 (Visual Languages) conference in
Bergen (Norway) and a workshop on spatial and temporal reasoning at the IJCAI ’93
conference in Chambery (France).

A remarkable feature of the overall activity in the ﬁeld of spatial representation and
reasoning is the degree of integration that previously separate directions of research are
beginning to achieve through interaction. An examination of the contents of the
manifestations of the research at that time shows that most papers may be loosely
assigned to one of the following ﬁelds:

● General purpose formalisms, logics of space
● Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
● Spatial Databases
● Psychological Space
● Linguistic aspects
● Applications

C. FREKSA ET AL.

For instance, the Vienna and Bonas workshops (Aurnague et al. 1993, Pribbenow and
Schlieder 1992), together with the Pisa conference, represent a total of about 64 papers
with the following repartition: space logics: 25; geography: 12; databases: 3; psychology:
5; linguistics: 12 and applications: 7.

However, this classiﬁcation does not reﬂect some of the interesting facts which

characterize the activity as a whole:

● emergence of general purpose formalisms and foundations for spatial reasoning,
● strong connections with cognitive considerations and/or motivations,
● emergence of hybrid communities (e.g. GIS and spatial reasoning in AI),
● explicit connections of spatial reasoning with temporal reasoning and
● linking linguistic aspects with other aspects of spatial reasoning.

1.3. Approaches to spatial representation and reasoning

Initially, several research groups had been aiming for a single spatial reasoning calculus
that would cover all aspects of space (‘like the Allen calculus, but 3D’). Accordingly, early
approaches extended the 1D Allen calculus to 3D by aggregating the projections of 3D
entities to the three constituting base dimensions (Guesgen 1989), later known as the
block algebra (Balbiani et al. 1998). But soon it became clear that important distinctions
of spatial conﬁgurations get lost when conﬁning spatial information to projections. For
example, projections conceal information about connectedness of 3D objects, as the
projections may overlap when the objects themselves are disconnected.

Subsequent approaches aimed at accounting for individual aspects of space in order
to eﬃciently reason about these aspects and to subsequently integrate these aspects
into a single calculus (Röhrig 1998). But soon it became obvious that calculi that attempt
to deal with all aspects of space become too cumbersome, intransparent and compu-
tationally expensive. As a result of this insight, a multitude of calculi for speciﬁc aspects
of space was developed for topological relations, orientation relations and distance
relations. Figure 1 depicts a classiﬁcation of the aspects investigated as the research
ﬁeld presented itself at the beginning of this research. As can be seen in Figure 2, most
direction calculi were developed later. This survey aims to identify principle approaches
taken to model directional knowledge.

2. Models of directional knowledge

Any knowledge representation makes a commitment on how to see the world, which
aspects to highlight and which to disregard (Davis et al. 1993). Taking a top-down view
on selecting aspects to capture in a representation of direction information, we identify
three principle classes:

(1) factual relation approaches which are concerned with elementary statements
about spatial conﬁgurations, in particular deﬁning interesting spatial relations;
(2) compositional approaches which focus on how pieces of directional knowledge

can be assembled to construct expressive statements and

(3) structural approaches which focus on algebraic or algorithmic properties of

manipulating spatial knowledge.

Most often, these fundamental aspects are independent of one another. One can
combine a relational approach which deﬁnes a set of application-relevant concepts
with a compositional approach to deﬁne a representation language suitable for the
task at hand. Framing a representation in context of a structural approach allows
useful computational properties or laws to be derived. However, combining princi-
ple approaches is not solely a task of making a useful selection, but complex
interdependencies exist that need to be evaluated. A naive combination can for
example lead to unexpected and adverse computational properties or lead to
unsound reasoning methods. The space of directional representations spanned by
the three dimensions described above hence needs to be explored carefully. To
portray this space of representation, we discuss prototypical approaches along these
dimensions.

2.1. Factual relation approaches

This class of approaches focuses on deﬁning a set of useful spatial templates for making
statements. Since directional knowledge is naturally relative – ‘A is located north of B’,
e.g. – these approaches deﬁne a set of useful relations. Technically speaking, a weak
partition scheme (Renz and Mitra 2004) is deﬁned: the set of possible relative locations
of two objects is classiﬁed by assigning exactly one class to any constellation possible.
Deﬁnition 2.1 Abstract partition scheme (Dylla et al. 2017): Let R be a set of none-
mpty relations on some spatial domain D with the same arity n. If relations in R are
i.e. ri \ rj(cid:1)(cid:1) ! i ¼ j for any
jointly exhaustive,

i.e. Dn ¼ [r2R r, and pairwise disjoint,

6

ri; rj 2 R, then, the pair ðD; RÞ is called a weak partition scheme of arity n. Relations in R
are also called base relations.

For example, the partition scheme deﬁned by the cardinal direction calculus (CDC)
(Frank 1991, Ligozat 1998) distinguishes directions north, west, south and east by
deﬁning one relation per quadrant. Relational approaches comprise the largest class of
approaches. They may further be subdivided, e.g. by their spatial domain (e.g. relations
of points versus relations of regions) or the frames of reference employed to deﬁne
direction relations.

2.2. Compositional approaches

Compositional approaches are mainly concerned with how elementary facts can be
composed to construct complex or detailed descriptions. One approach is to
consider ‘cross products’ of partition schemes in order to combine two or more
representations in one (Wölﬂ and Westphal 2009). One of the ﬁrst combinations is
presented by Hernández (1994, Chapter 5) who combines directional and topolo-
gical information. After computational properties of directional and topological
representations had been investigated, a computationally eﬃcient variant of
Hernández’ approach was formulated by Cohn et al. (2014). Several calculi dis-
cussed further below can be decomposed into distinct components, too.

The most popular form of reasoning with spatial relations is to consider a qualitative
constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) – see Renz and Nebel (2007) – which allows
expressing complex spatial relationships. Under speciﬁc circumstances, a qualitative
CSP instance can even express a more ﬁne-grained spatial relation than contained in
the CSP instance (Renz and Ligozat 2005). Qualitative CSPs represent spatial knowledge
by conjunctively adjoining a set of relational statements (called constraints) that involve
variables ranging over the spatial domain. Individual constraints are usually unions of
relations from a partition scheme.

.Deﬁnition 2.2 Qualitative CSP: Let ðD; RÞ be an abstract partition scheme with arity
n, and let X be a set of variables ranging over D. The set RC ¼ fri;1 [ . . . [ ri;ik j ri;j 2 R; k (cid:2)
Rj jg is called the set of all composite relations of ðD; RÞ. A qualitative CSP is deﬁned by a
set of constraints riðX1; . . . ; XnÞ; ri 2 RC; i ¼ 1; . . . ; k. The problem is to decide whether
there exists a valuation of the variables that satisﬁes all constraints in the sense that
riðX1; . . . ; XnÞ is satisﬁed by a valuation ψ : X ! D, if ðψðX1Þ; . . . ; ψðXnÞÞ 2 ri holds.

Qualitative CSPs deﬁne a speciﬁc constraint language, i.e. a formal language for con-
structing constraint formulas based on a set of basic relation concepts. In general, these
languages may be more expressive than conjunctions of unions of base relations as
considered in qualitative CSPs. While this approach has been studied intensively for the
temporal domain (see e.g. Bodirsky and Kára 2010), spatial constraint languages remain
under-explored. These languages can be regarded as special cases of a spatial logic: they
correspond to a fragment of existentially quantiﬁed ﬁrst-order (constraint) formulas.
Spatial logics, as characterized by Aiello et al. (2007), are all logics that are interpreted
over some spatial structure. The compositional perspective oﬀered by logics is interesting
since it allows for high expressivity even in case of simple base concepts. This can reveal
similarities or equivalences between otherwise diﬀerent sets of elementary relations

(Wolter and Lee 2016), allowing distinct representations to be integrated. Moreover, the
compositional approach oﬀers a methodology for constructing a set of basic relations
from a small set of primitive concepts (see e.g. the deﬁnition of directional relations in
Eschenbach and Kulik 1997). A particularly illustrative example of this approach can be
found in the ﬁeld of topological representations: The RCC theory is a ﬁrst-order logic
theory build around the notion of ‘connection’ (Randell et al. 1992). It is then studied how
the compositional operations of constructing ﬁrst-order formulae using a connection
primitive can be used to distinguish several topological constellations. In one typical
model, this leads to the well-known set of RCC-8 relations which are closely related to
nine-intersection relations (Egenhofer 1991). Nine-intersection relation is a prototypical
representative of a relational approach: they deﬁne a way of determines relative spatial
location by answering 9 binary yes/no-questions about the regions’ relative extent.

2.3. Structural approaches

Structural approaches focus on operations performed with statements which represent
spatial information; they either aim to capture an underlying algebraic structure or opera-
tional, computational features. On the algebraic side, the most typical example in the
context of directional information is that of spatial calculi (Renz and Mitra 2004, Dylla
et al. 2017) which exhibits variants of a relational algebra in the sense of Tarski. Equipping
a set of relations based on a weak partition scheme with operations gives rise to an algebraic
construct that provides useful laws for computing with spatial relations (Frank 1992, Dylla
et al. 2017, Section 4.2). Operations correspond to manipulations of the statements; for
example, the converse operation ^ , characterized by the equivalence r^ðA; BÞ , rðB; AÞ,
allows changes of perspective to be performed: if A is north of B, then B is south of A – ‘north
of’ is the converse of ‘south of’ and vice versa. Algebraic constructs such as qualitative calculi
teach us about the interdependencies of manipulating spatial information which is useful in
any application that involves some form of reasoning. Notably, there are other algebraic
constructs relevant to directional information. Knuth (1992) proposes oriented matroids as a
combinatorial structure to directional spatial information – several qualitative calculi reﬁne
this structure (Wolter and Lee 2010).

On the operational side, inference patterns for manipulating spatial information have
been deﬁned. For example, a rule for combining two ternary relation statements
r1ðA; B; CÞ ^ r2ðB; C; DÞ that may be gathered while traversing a path A; B; C and observing
other objects has been proposed. By application of that rule, the relation r?ðA; B; DÞ can be
derived from the above observations (Freksa 1992). Aiello et al. (2007) propose to employ
morphological operators for modifying spatial objects occurring in a representation.
Focusing on spatial datatypes, Frank and Kuhn (1995) specify abstract datatypes which
also incorporate operations for manipulating spatial knowledge as signatures of functions,
including computations with imprecise values (Navratil et al. 2008).

3. Survey of qualitative directional representations

Based on survey literature (Chen et al. 2015, Dylla et al. 2017) on (qualitative) spatial
representations, we identiﬁed qualitative spatial representations explicitly addres-
sing direction information. In this presentation, we focus on the partition scheme

8

oﬀered by the representations,
i.e. the ﬁnest distinctions the formalism is able to
express. In this survey, we classify directional representations according to the three
intrinsic and relative (Levinson 1996), further reﬁned by
reference frames absolute,
Tenbrink and Kuhn (2011). These frames indicate how directional knowledge is
constructed by relations, whether it relates to an externally provided absolute
reference like cardinal directions, whether objects present directions on their own
(intrinsic) or whether reference directions are constructed in a relative manner by
explicitly constructing reference, often involving ternary relations to relate to a
separate entity. Instead of the relative frame of reference, some works in computa-
tional
linguistics use the notion of a deictic frame of reference, which indicates
reference to the context of the speaker (Retz-Schmidt 1988).1 There is no one-to-
one correspondence between deictic and relative frame of reference (Palmer 2003).
Since our aim is to discriminate approaches to representing direction independent
of natural language use, we only refer to absolute, intrinsic and relative frames of
reference. For each of them, we list representations that employ this frame, present
the partition scheme graphically and give examples of what kind of statements the
representation can capture.

3.1. Absolute frame of reference

This family of approaches (depicted in Figure 3) describes the location of an entity with
respect to a joint frame of reference, typically given through cardinal directions. Despite
an often intended application to geographic information, all approaches conceive the
underlying domain to be a Euclidean plane, not a spherical one.

(a) The CDC (Frank 1991, Ligozat 1998) distinguishes nine base relations that allow
compass-rose relations to be expressed, e.g. ‘A is north-west of B’. In addition to
direction relations, one relation expresses super-position (equality, i.e. no direc-
tion) of points.

(b) The star calculus (STAR) (Renz and Mitra 2004) presents a reﬁnement of CDC. It
deﬁnes a family of relations that subdivide the full circle of the compass rose into
an arbitrarily ﬁne set of relations, potentially in an irregular way.

(c) Similar to STAR, but using a regular subdivision of the full circle, EPRA (Moratz and
Wallgrün 2012) deﬁnes a parametric set of direction relations. Additionally, EPRA

employs a distance concept based on a granular-dependent set of distance
classes. The relation depicted can be described as ‘B is far to the north-east of A’.
(d) The block-algebra (BA) (Guesgen 1989, Balbiani et al. 1998) generalizes Allen’s
interval algebra to n-dimensional space, thus deﬁning 13n relations. The relations
are deﬁned by ﬁrst projecting spatial regions to axes of the joint coordinate
system and then relating the projections, which are intervals, according to
Allen’s interval relations. This allows direction information to be captured. A
statement like ‘A and B overlap in their X and Y projection’ would be represented
as pair ðoverlaps; overlapsÞ. However, from that relation, it does not follow that
the regions themselves overlap (see depiction).

(e) Restricted to rectangles in the 2D case, the rectangle cardinal direction calculus
(RCD) (Navarrete et al. 2013) also employs a partition scheme based on the X and
Y projections of the reference object’s bounding box like BA. RCD is a coarsening
of BA, each of its relations is composed of one or more BA relations. Naming of
relations fundamentally diﬀers from BA, though. Inherited from BA, any reference
object determines nine sectors which demarcate the projections of the bounding
box, e.g. the set of locations with X and Y co-ordinates smaller than the minimum
values of the bounding box. In contrast to unique names deﬁned by Allen which
are employed by BA, RCD associates each of the nine sectors with a cardinal
direction (NW for ‘north west’ designates the conﬁguration mentioned above
where X and Y co-ordinates are smaller than the minimum values of the bound-
ing box). Then, the relation between a rectangular region and the reference
In the
region is described by collecting all sectors that the region overlaps.
example depicted, the conﬁguration would be described as N:NW:W:EQ (north,
northwest, west and equal) instead of ðoverlaps; overlapsÞ in the BA case. Unlike
BA, overlap of regions follows as RCD only considers rectangular regions.

(f) Like RCD, but addressing arbitrarily shaped regions, cardinal direction relations
(CDR) (Skiadopoulos and Koubarakis 2004, 2005) are relations obtained by listing
all sectors that a region overlaps. In case of considering non-connected regions,
this leads to a total of 29 ¼ 512 base relations; in case of connected regions, only
289 of those are possible. The depiction shows B located in relation N:NE:E of A.
An alternative formulation of CDR is presented in Cohn et al. (2014) which
explicates the relation to calculi BA and RCC-8.

3.2.

Intrinsic frame of reference

In an intrinsic frame of reference, individual objects deﬁne directions – typically a front
‘in front of a
direction, from which other directions can be derived. For example,
computer screen’ is commonly understood as the set of regions from which the screen
content can be seen. Representations model intrinsic frames by considering entities that
comprise a direction, typically as points in the Euclidean plane additionally equipped
with a direction ½0; 2πÞ, leading to a spatial domain such as R2 (cid:3) ½0; 2πÞ. We describe
representations depicted in Figure 4.

In the oriented point reasoning algebra OPRA (Moratz 2006, Dylla and Lee 2010,

deﬁne directions by regular subdivisions of the full circle. In the OPRA4 variant
shown in Figure 4(a), dividing lines are instantiated, leading to eight sectors and
eight linear directions. The linear ‘zero direction’ is aligned with the intrinsic front
direction of oriented point A. A speciﬁc feature of OPRA is that relations are
combinations of the location of B with respect to A and, vice versa, the location of
A with respect to location and orientation of B.

(b) Similar to OPRA, StarVars (SV) (Lee et al. 2013) deﬁnes relations between intrinsically
oriented points in the Euclidean plane. In contrast to OPRA, only directed relations
are deﬁned (B as seen from A) which can, using the compositional approach of
qualitative constraint languages, be combined with the converse relations (A as seen
from B), if desired. Technically, SV employs the cardinal-direction partition scheme of
Star but rotated by an object-speciﬁc variable amount to obtain likewise expressivity
but better computational characteristics than OPRA.

(c) EOPRA (Moratz and Wallgrün 2012) reﬁnes OPRA by introducing distance sub-
divisions of the individual direction sectors. Distance classes are derived from the
distance between the oriented points that are related, i.e. EOPRA also employs a
concept of intrinsic distance classes. Similar to the granular subdivisions of
directions, the set of distance classes is subject to a granularity parameter.
(d) Similar to OPRA and STAR, Hernández (1994) deﬁnes a set of combined directional
and topological relations DIRTP. Although the directional relations deﬁned are called
projective relations since they are meant to represent how the projection of space
appears to an in-scene observer, the representation focuses on one egocentric
observer and could thus be regarded as absolute-frame-of-reference representation,
too. Eight topological relations (similar to RCC-8) distinguish locations of regions
which are then reﬁned by how points representing the region (e.g. by choosing
center of gravity) are located with respect to directions in a sector-model.

(e) Representing the relative position and orientation of line segments, dipole rela-
tions (DRA) (Moratz et al. 2000, 2011) distinguish locations of start and end points
of a line segment with respect to another line segment, mainly by distinguishing

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

left and right hand side of a line segment. This leads to 24 relations if point
positions are restricted to not being collinear, and to 72 relations otherwise. If
parallelism of line segments is to be identiﬁed, 80 base relations are required.
(f) The directed interval algebra (DIA) (Renz 2001) is an application of Allen’s interval
relation to an intrinsic frame of reference in 1D space. Deﬁning 26 base relations
(twice the set of Allen relations), the algebra distinguishes modes of overlap with
respect to the orientation of a reference interval. For example, the depiction
shows B overlapping A in opposite directions from behind.

(g) In cyclic ordering (CYC) (Isli and Cohn 2000), not orientation relative to points but
orientations relative to other orientations are represented, i.e. the direction of a
vector is described with respect to direction of other vectors. The binary variant
(CYCb) deﬁnes four relations. A ternary version using a relative frame of reference
is addressed later.

(h) The panorama of the position or point (PPP) (Schlieder 1991, 1993, 1995) is a
qualitative representation from the perspective as seen from a speciﬁc oriented
point. That is, all points (A, B, ...) are listed in order as seen in a clockwise panorama
from point S. In addition, each opposing point (a, b, ...) is listed in the correct order,
too.

3.3. Relative frame of reference

In a relative frame of reference, an explicitly mentioned object is used as a relatum to
construct the frame of reference (Levinson 1996, Tenbrink and Kuhn 2011). Modeling a
relative frame of reference thus naturally leads to ternary relations, but some approaches
circumvent the need of ternary relations. Avoiding ternary relations can be motivated by the
poor structural understanding of ternary calculi as compared to binary ones (see Dylla et al.
2017). Reasoning techniques for binary relation systems are also easier to implement and
easier to integrate with other forms of reasoning (e.g. ontological). There are two principle
approaches to mapping ternary relation systems to binary ones. First, by enriching the
spatial domain to include reference direction, the need for a relatum is avoided. For example,
the OPRA relations discussed above are involved with a domain of points equipped with
orientation. With OPRA, all direction relations expressible in the ternary point-based repre-
sentation ternary point conﬁguration calculus (TPCC) can also be expressed. The drawback of
this approach is however that an explicit relatum is not represented which makes it diﬃcult
to reason about the relatum as an individual entity. Second, ternary relations can be
expressed as composition of several statements involving binary direction relations.
Wolter and Lee (2016) have identiﬁed several mappings between spatial calculi embedded
in a propositional logic, revealing the same expressivity for several relative direction calculi if
embedded in a propositional logic. The use of complex compound statements to represent a
single relative direction may be regarded as a disadvantage, too.

While many representatives of this category concern spatial domain of points, there
are also some representations addressing extended entities in 2D or 3D space.
Representations belonging to this class depicted in Figure 5 are

with respect to the line connecting one point (origin) with another point (rela-
tum). Distinguishing left side, right side, ﬁve sections on the line and two
degenerate cases, LR deﬁnes nine base relations. Degenerate cases represent
cases in which the reference points (A, B) coincide.

(b) The single cross calculus (1-cross) (Freksa 1992) further reﬁnes the LR relations by
subdividing the left and right side by distinguishing locations in front from
behind a line that is perpendicular to the reference direction that meets the
relatum, forming a cross. Including cases of points located on the dividing lines
and degenerate cases, 1-cross deﬁnes eight base relations.
In case of the double cross calculus (2-cross) (Freksa and Zimmermann 1992, Freksa
1992, Zimmermann and Freksa 1996), 1-cross is reﬁned by introducing a second
‘cross’ at the origin, further introducing left back and right back regions. Including
cases of points located on the dividing lines and degenerate cases, 2-cross deﬁnes
15 base relations.

(c)

(d) The TPCC (Moratz and Ragni 2008) employs a sector model similar to models
capturing absolute (EPRA) or intrinsic frames of reference (EOPRA) but employs a
relatum to establish reference direction and reference distance. The representa-
tion allows statements such as ‘C is located to the far rear back of A when facing
B’ to be represented.

(e) Ternary projective relations (TPR, TPR3D, TPR (cid:4)) (Clementini and Billen 2006, Clementini
et al. 2010, 2013) is a region-based approach to representing direction information
between regions in a relative frame of reference. TPR3D relations generalize planar
projective relations left/right to 3D space by also distinguishing above/below with
respect to a reference direction (Billen and Clementini 2006). Clementini (2008)
identiﬁes 42 jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint projective relations on the
sphere (TPR (cid:4)) aimed at representation of geographic knowledge. TPR can be
regarded as a generalization of 2-cross to extended objects. The set of relations
enables us to capture statements like C is on the left side of the connection A to B.
(f) Visibility relations (VR, VR3D) (Tarquini et al. 2007, Fogliaroni and Clementini 2015)
are similar to TPR, yet they are primarily concerned with concepts of visibility and
occlusion in a 2D world. These relations are equivalent to relative directional
relations in context of compositional approaches that enable propositional com-
bination (logic and/or) of individual facts (Wolter and Lee 2016); therefore, they
are included in this category. Visibility relations allow directional statements like

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

13

‘as seen from C, B occludes A from the left’ to be captured. Fogliaroni and
Clementini (2015) show how these relations can be generalized to 3D space
(VR3D) by adapting 3D projective relations of PR3D.

(g) In cyclic ordering (CYC) (Isli and Cohn 2000), not relative orientation to points but
relative orientations are represented, i.e. the direction of a vector is described
with reference to other vectors. The ternary version (CYCt) focusing on a left/right
discrimination yields 24 ternary base relations.

3.4. Combined frames of reference

A combined frame of reference is a combination of at least two types of reference
frames. We found three representatives of this category depicted in Figure 6. In order to
combine frames of reference, either a transition method has to be provided or there has
to be an explicit assumption of how the frames relate.

(a) cCOA (Isli et al. 2003) is a combination of CDC and a coarser version of 2-cross, i.e.
only left, straight, right, front, neutral and back are considered as well as two
degenerated states. Thus,
it is a combination of an absolute and a relative
reference frame. It allows to express statements such as ‘viewed from A, C is to
the left of B’ as well as ‘B is to the north of A’. This is possible, as a method to
transition between both representation models is provided.

(b) The 3D orientation model (OM-3D) (Pacheco 2001) is a 3D extension of the 2-cross. It
assumes an absolute reference plane (ﬂoor) and uses two points to create two
parallel planes and one vertical plane as relative references. Thus, it relates an
absolute and a relative frame of reference by explicitly aligning the relative to the
absolute one. The representation allows expression of statements such as ‘C is
located up-front-right of A when facing B’. In total, 75 relational symbols are deﬁned.
(c) The algebra of bipartite arrangements (ABA) (Gottfried 2004) is similar to DRA but is
concerned with projections that indicate how an observer would perceive the
orientation and location of the line segments. The algebra distinguishes 125 base
relations. By considering projections to axes jointly with orientations of the line
segments, ABA presents a combination of absolute and intrinsic frames of reference.

4. Map of qualitative directional representations

In this section, we compare and relate existing qualitative representations of direction
information to identify white spots on the so generated map. These empty areas present
opportunities and challenges for developing further representations. We speciﬁcally
investigated three features: frames of reference, aspects addressed and dimensionality.
First we looked at the frames of reference applied in qualitative representations of
direction information. Figure 7 depicts all previously introduced representations accord-
ing to frame of reference. Investigating the calculi from a historical perspective (Figure 2)
shows that the development regarding orientation representation went from absolute
frames of reference (BA, 1989) to relative (CDC, 1991) and intrinsic frames of reference
(PPP, 1991). Regarding combinations of frames of reference, ﬁrst came a combination of
absolute and relative frames of reference (OM-3D, 2001) followed by a combination of
absolute and intrinsic (ABA, 2004). Up to the writing of this paper, we are not aware of a
combination of intrinsic and relative frames of reference in this context. The same is true
for combinations of all three frames of reference. A noteworthy special case is CYC. It has
a binary version (CYCb) that uses an intrinsic frame of reference and a ternary version
(CYCt) that uses a relative frame of reference.

information based on multiple frames of reference.

Next, we looked at additional aspects represented. In Table 1, all introduced repre-
sentations are listed that include some other aspect next to directional information or
directional
It is interesting that
orientation knowledge about region locations was ﬁrst not separated from topology
(BA, 1989) or even intentionally integrated with direction relations (DIRTP, 1994) and
only later speciﬁc direction-only qualitative representations emerged (e.g. CDC, 1991).
The ﬁrst other combination is PPP (direction information and ordering, 1991). Further
combinations of direction information with other aspects were only addressed much
later (visibility and orientation, VR, 2007 and distance, TPCC, 2008).

Looking at the numbers, there are 13 representations dealing purely with orientation
aspects, 4 dealing with orientation and topology, 1 with orientation and visibility and 3
with aspects of orientation and distance. We did not encounter combinations of more
than two aspects.

Finally, we looked at the dimensionality of the entities and spatial environment
represented (Table 2). The most obvious result is that almost all representations apply
a 2D representation of the spatial environment (domain). Only a couple of representa-
tions do not abstract the spatial environment to 2D (DIA uses a 1D space, OM-3D uses a
3D space, BA is designed for n-dimensional space and there exist extensions of TPR and
VR [TPR3D (Billen and Clementini 2006) and VR3D (Fogliaroni and Clementini 2015)] that
use 3D space). Regarding the representation of the entities, most prominent are point
lines and regions are used for representing entities, but it is
representations. Also,
interesting that we found only two extensions of representations (TPR3D and VR3D)
that are designed to use 3D objects for representing entities.
In addition, BA is an
interesting special candidate as it is designed to (in theory) represent both n-dimen-
sional entities and space.

5. Conclusions

In this work, we presented a brief history of qualitative temporal and spatial reasoning
and an overview of qualitative representations of direction information. Qualitative
representations are connected to various research areas in and around artiﬁcial

intelligence, such as commonsense reasoning, computational
linguistics and spatial
cognition. As a consequence, qualitative representations of direction information play
a role for connecting symbolic techniques to real-world applications and also provide a
window to cognition.

5.1. Combining frames of reference

We provide an overview of existing combinations of frames of references applied in
representations. Additional combinations of frames of reference could provide further
insights into the relations of the underlying spatial structures and how they are inter-
preted and understood by humans.

5.2.

Including and combining additional spatial aspects

Combining multiple additional aspects in a single representation would trigger investi-
gations on interrelationships between distinct aspects of spatial knowledge. This again
could lead to a better understanding of how humans shift between representing
diﬀerent aspects of spatial structures and space within cognitive processes.

5.3. Translation between representations

As humans are able to change perspective on a problem by looking at diﬀerent levels of
abstraction and employing diﬀerent concepts. Means to ﬂexibly adapt representations
would be helpful for autonomous systems too. The beneﬁts of loosely coupling several
representations have already been advocated (see Hern´andez 1993), yet we are still
lacking translation methods capable to respect how domain knowledge is abstracted
diﬀerently by distinct approaches.

1. Clementini (2013) employs a diﬀerent interpretation of deictic, calling any relative frame of

reference (egoentric and allocentric ones) deictic.

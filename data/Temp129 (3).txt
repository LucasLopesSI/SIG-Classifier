Abstract
New developments in global positioning systems (GPS) and related satellite tracking
technologies have facilitated the collection of highly accurate data on moving
objects, far surpassing the ability to analyze them. Within geographic information
‘movement pattern analysis’ (MPA) has developed as a subﬁeld that
science,
addresses concepts and theories used to explore the spatio-temporal structure in
data, although the methodological and analytical framework associated with MPA
is new and still evolving. Interactions between individuals can be considered a
second order property of movement and have been far less studied. The nature
of interactions between individuals in a population is a fundamental aspect of a
species’ behavioral ecology and information on the frequency and duration of these
interactions is vital to understanding mating and territorial behavior, resource use,
and infectious disease epidemiology. The focus of this work was to explore how
spatially explicit simulated data can be used to analyse dynamic interactions between
individuals. Five different techniques that have been used to quantify dynamic
interactions based on GPS data of pairs of individuals were utilised, and all were
compared in the context of spatially explicit simulated data intended to represent
biologically realistic null models for individual movement, and subsequently paired
interactions.

1 Introduction

New developments in global positioning systems (GPS) and related satellite tracking
technologies have facilitated the collection of highly accurate data on moving objects.
However, the ability to collect these data at increasingly ﬁne spatial and temporal
resolutions has surpassed the ability to analyze them (Young and Shivik 2006). Within
geographic information science, ‘movement pattern analysis’ has developed as a subﬁeld
that addresses concepts and theories used to explore the spatio-temporal structure in data
in order to perform meaningful analysis. Research in movement pattern analysis (MPA)
extends previous work on time geography that focused primarily on representation and
semantics; therefore, the methodological and analytical framework associated with MPA
is new and still evolving.

Most MPA applications address the movement of automobiles (e.g. trafﬁc, ﬂeet
management), people (e.g. pedestrians, queues), or animals. Although there are obvious
and fundamental differences among these three application types, there are also many
important commonalities associated with the analysis of any movement data irrespective
of the type of object. For example, random walk models have been used to model the
nature of warfare (Smith and Stam 2003), physiological changes associated with aging
(Woodbury and Manton 1977), and stock price behavior (Fama 1995). In animal
movement studies, a random walk model is used as a null model to describe basic search
behavior to which real movement parameters can be compared and has been used to
study movement of animals as diverse as bottlenose dolphins (Bailey and Thompson
2006), caribou (Bergman et al. 2000), geckos (Gruber and Henle 2004), caterpillars
(Wallin 1991), cows (Laube and Purves 2011), and butterﬂies (Root and Kareiva 1984).
Differences between real movement parameters and random walk parameters can be
used to suggest different types of behaviors or ‘states’ and to infer how an organism and
its environment interact to inﬂuence the movement process. Analysis of animal movement
provides a spatio-temporal link between the individual and the population and is con-
sidered to be a foundation for all questions in animal ecology. Morales et al. (2010) note
that a fundamental component of population models that include trophic interactions
is the functional response, which describes the intake rate of a consumer as a function
of prey density. The functional response is necessary to understanding the dynamics of
interacting populations, and is dependent upon “encounter rates” or interactions between
individuals. Information on the frequency and duration of interactions is also vital to
understanding mating and territorial behavior, resource use, and infectious disease epi-
demiology, but has been far less studied within the context of movement pattern analysis.

2 Modelling Animal Movement

As noted above, the technology available to collect movement data is far more advanced
than the ability to analyze them. Most wildlife movement data are collected using GPS
collars that note location and time at increasingly ﬁne intervals. These spatio-temporal
data are then summarized using (aspatial) statistics such as mean neighbor distance (mean
distance apart for two speciﬁc individuals), mean daily distance travelled, and mean rate
of travel. Typically the most spatial “product” of these data involves the calculation of a
home range, although high quality movement data have been used recently to illustrate
limitations associated with these simplistic and homogeneous representations of activity

spaces (Cagnacci et al. 2010). Additionally, “smart collars” that combine GPS with
accelerometers in order to measure metabolic rates associated with behaviors such as
eating and sleeping are now available and will allow collection of unprecedented types of
location and behavior data (Johnson 2011).

The ability to identify behavior types or changes in behavior types based on move-
ment data was recently addressed in a special issue of Philosophical Transaction of the
Royal Society B: Biological Sciences (see Cagnacci et al. (2010) for additional details).
Fryxell et al. (2008) calculated movement parameters across subsets of all locations in
order to determine whether statistically different characteristics are suggestive of different
behaviors or processes (e.g. searching and foraging) or related to resource differences
(e.g. rich/poor, familiar/unfamiliar).

A correlated random walk (CRW) is a theoretical model based on two movement
parameters: distribution of step lengths, and distribution or concentration of turn angles
(Byers 2001). Although each move is based on a random draw from each of the two
distributions, the moves are considered correlated since the move angles are not distrib-
uted uniformly around a circle, as is the case for a pure random walk (RW) model, and
therefore can induce a directional bias (Börger et al. 2008).

Modelling movement as a CRW provides a ﬁrm foundation from which to explore
habitat use and behavioral ecology of animals and can be used to develop more complex
models. CRW models can be used as a ‘null model’ to reveal how behaviors and other
factors can inﬂuence individual movements (Codling et al. 2008). Signiﬁcant differences
between simulated (CRW) movement paths and an individual’s real movement path
suggests either preference for or avoidance of a speciﬁc region (Bergman et al. 2000),
which can then be explored further. The importance of spatial and temporal scale in
calculating and interpreting these parameters is just beginning to be addressed in both
an ecological context (Hebblewhite and Haydon 2010) and a GIScience context (Laube
and Purves 2011). Less developed is a framework for using a null model as a benchmark
in order to characterize interactions between individuals more objectively as indicative of
either ‘attraction’ or ‘avoidance.’

2.1 Modeling Animal Interactions

Interactions between individuals can be considered a second order property of movement
and have been far less studied within MPA and movement ecology. The nature of
interactions between individuals in a population is a fundamental aspect of a species’
behavioral ecology. Information on the frequency and duration of these interactions
is vital to understanding mating and territorial behavior, resource use, and infectious
disease epidemiology. However, the number of times an individual animal comes into
contact with another is an extremely difﬁcult parameter to estimate, and previous studies
have focused on highly observable species living within protected areas or urban areas
(e.g. foxes in Bristol, UK: White and Harris 1994). For relatively rare or secretive species,
or those occupying less accessible habitats, complete and accurate information regarding
rates of contact is generally scarce.

2.1.1 Quantifying static interactions

Measuring interaction between individuals has traditionally involved some type of quan-
titative comparison of the spatial overlap of their respective home ranges, the estimation

of which is not without controversy. Kernel estimation is widely considered to be the
most appropriate general purpose method for estimating home ranges based on location
data (Millspaugh et al. 2004), but there have been many studies that illustrate the highly
variable and subjective nature of home range estimation (see Harris et al. 1990). Once a
home range has been estimated for each individual, the overlap zone can be quantiﬁed
with a measure of similarity that uses a combination of the area of each of the individu-
al’s home ranges and the area of the intersection between home ranges. Measures of
home range overlap have been used as an ‘index of territoriality’ (Dekker et al. 2001) and
as a proxy for contact probabilities in the context of disease transmission (Schauber
et al. 2007). Increasingly sophisticated measures of joint space use have been proposed,
such as the volume of intersection index (VI), which evaluates the spatial overlap of the
location and space of each individual’s utilization distribution (e.g. kernel estimation)
(Millspaugh et al. 2004).

While these methods are derived using the spatio-temporal GPS data, the inter-
actions they describe are purely spatial or ‘static’ in that they do not account for the
possibility of temporal avoidance or attraction between individuals (Doncaster 1990).
‘Dynamic interaction’ (Doncaster 1990) between two individuals is deﬁned as occurring
within a spatial and temporal threshold and can provide information on possible attrac-
tion and avoidance of individuals that are in the same area at the same time. Dynamic
interaction rates are far more useful for understanding how two individuals interact in
the context of disease transmission and behavioral ecology, but they are more problem-
atic to quantify.

2.1.2 Quantifying dynamic interactions

In order to quantify dynamic interactions, appropriate spatial and temporal thresholds
deﬁning when two individuals are ‘aware’ of each other must be determined. These
thresholds can be based on observation or knowledge of species’ behavior, or can be
empirically derived, such as by using the mean maximum daily distance between two
individuals as the spatial threshold (Gorman et al. 2009). Table 1 summarizes the nota-
tion used here to describe the different datasets (real and simulated), pair types
(t-matched, s-t-matched, unmatched), individuals (a and b), and spatial components
(HRA, HRB, OZ) used in the following methods to quantify dynamic interactions.
Table 2 describes the ﬁve methods used here to quantify dynamic interactions. Measuring
dynamic interaction rates involves ﬁrst extracting pairs of ‘simultaneous’ locations from
each individual’s spatio-temporal movement data. Simultaneous locations are observa-
tions of a pair of individuals (dyad) that occurred at the same time (or within a temporal
threshold, t-matches, Table 1).

Coefﬁcient of sociality

A relatively simple method to quantify dynamic interactions involves comparing the
mean distance between t-matched pairs to the mean distance of unmatched pairs (see
Table 1) using a variant of Jacobs’ Index (Jacobs 1974), where the value ranges from -1
indicating extreme avoidance, to +1, indicating extreme attraction. In a study on the
spatial organization of a lynx population in Northwest Territories, Canada, Poole (1995)
found that a version of the index (she called it the coefﬁcient of sociality, Sc, Table 2)
indicated that intrasexual distances were similar for both t-matched and unmatched

pairs, while the t-matched distance was smaller for some of the intersexual pairs,
indicating attraction. Eriksen et al. (2008) used the same method (using what they
termed the coefﬁcient of interaction) to study interaction between wolves and moose in
southern Scandinavia and found that there was attraction between two pairs of wolves-
moose, and neutral interaction between the other three pairs.

Minta’s Coefﬁcients of Interaction

Minta (1992) deﬁned three coefﬁcients (Table 2) to partition interaction into two main
spatial effects for each of two individuals (a and b, see Table 1) and a combined temporal
effect. The spatial effects ( LA A⋅ , LB B⋅ ) describe interaction as a function of how much
each individual was located in the overlap zone (OZ, Table 1) relative to how much each
was located in the remainder of its home range and the temporal effect describes
simultaneous joint use of OZ relative to each individual’s solitary use of OZ (LIXN). Using
these three coefﬁcients in concert in separate studies focusing on locations of badgers,
deer and cattle, he could interpret the nature of the interactions as, e.g. temporal
avoidance, mutual attraction, spatial avoidance, and a attracted to b. This method has
also been used to investigate territoriality in grizzly bears in Montana (Mace and Waller
1997) and the effects of pair types (e.g. female-female, male-female) on coyote interaction
in Indiana (Atwood and Weeks 2003).

Doncaster Test

The next set of methods uses s-t-matches (Table 1), or simultaneous locations that also
occurred within a spatial or distance threshold. Doncaster (1990) suggested one of the
ﬁrst nonparametric metrics to quantify dynamic interactions using location data on foxes
in Oxford, UK (Table 2). His method compared the number of pairs that occurred within
both a spatial and temporal threshold (s-t-matches) to the ‘expected’ number of matches,

Simulated Data to Analyze Interactions

based on the assumption the two individuals were moving independently of each other
(neutral interaction). He used the unmatched location data (Table 1) to obtain an
expected value and a contingency table and X2 test to compare the frequencies of pairs
that were within the distance threshold to the expected number of pairs based on the
unmatched data. Using this method, Gorman et al. (2009) found that there was positive
interaction between frogs in Florida. Another application of this method found that
male-male interactions between raccoons in Mississippi were positive while female-
female interactions were often negative (Chamberlain and Leopold 2002). Woodroffe
(2011) used this method to study interaction between packs of wild dogs in Kenya and
found that they avoided each other, even when overlap between neighbouring home
ranges increased.

Half-weight Association Index

A half-weight association index (HAI; Table 2) compares the number of s-t-matches
to the number of simultaneous locations (t-matches) during which only one of the
individuals was located in the OZ, and has been used to analyse interactions between
antelope in Kenya and Namibia (Brotherton et al. 1997) and coyotes in Indiana (Atwood
and Weeks 2003). The index ranges in value from 0 (avoidance) to 1 (attraction).

Neutral Interaction Benchmarks

When dynamic interaction rates have been calculated, they are often compared in the
context of some summarized individual (age, sex, group/clan membership) or range
characteristics (resource availability, season). Most of the methods described above use
an index or coefﬁcient (ranging from 0 to 1, or -1 to +1) to describe both the magnitude
and type (attraction, avoidance) of interaction, ostensibly incorporating a concept of
neutral interaction or independent movement between dyads as a benchmark to which
observed values are compared. The basic unit of study for a dynamic interaction is a
pair of simultaneous locations, so it is more difﬁcult to conceptualize a ‘null model’ for
interactions analogous to random walk models used to study movement of a single
individual. Unmatched coordinates have been used to calculate an expected value for
mean distance in Poole’s coefﬁcient of socialization (Poole 1995), to calculate an
expected value of locations within a distance threshold in Doncaster’s method (1990),
and to calculate expected solitary and joint use of HRs for Minta’s coefﬁcients (Minta
1992). Without realistic expected ‘null’ values none of these interaction metrics facilitates
a more meaningful understanding of the nature of these interactions – e.g. whether the
encounters occur more or less frequently than they would occur if the individuals were
moving randomly across their range.

Morales et al. (2010, p. 2295) suggest that “(a) useful null model for encounter rates
is one where individuals move randomly and independently of each other.” One null
model that has been widely used by biologists involves predicting encounter rates based
on an extension of the “ideal gas model” developed in physics 150 years ago (Hutchinson
and Waser 2007). The model is based on the assumption that independently moving
animals behave similarly to gas molecules and therefore their “collision rates” or inter-
actions can be estimated as a function of parameters such as population density, velocity,
and the distance at which an encounter is considered to occur. This null model has been
used to study interactions between primates (Waser 1982) and arthropods (De Vita et al.

1982) as well as to explore the relationship between mate choice and predator risk
(Crowley et al. 1991). Hutchinson and Waser (2007) note that one of the main limita-
tions of using the ideal gas model as a null hypothesis involves the biologically unrealistic
assumption that animals move in the same way as gas molecules. A more appropriate
null model used to analyse interactions should be based on spatially explicit and realistic
movement trajectories, rather than theoretical parameters such as those used with the
ideal gas law, or artiﬁcial movement trajectories consisting of ‘shufﬂed’ observed location
coordinates such as those used in the dynamic interaction methods described above.

Coefﬁcient of Difference

In an extension of Doncaster’s method, White and Harris (1994) address the limitation
associated with using the spatially and possibly behaviorally unrealistic movement
trajectories from unmatched pairs as a null expectation. Their method uses correlated
random walks based on movement parameters derived from the actual individuals’
trajectories (foxes in Bristol, UK) and compares the observed number of s-t-matches to
those based on pairs of simulated (CRW) trajectories. Their method has also been used
to study sociality and disease transmission in badgers (Böhm et al. 2008).

This study explores the use of spatially explicit simulated movement trajectories as
expected values or null model benchmarks for the dynamic interaction methods
described above. The simulated movement/location data are used either as the expected
value in the calculation of dynamic interaction metrics or the metrics are calculated for
both the real data and the simulated data as a means of comparison (see last column in
Table 2). The case study examined here involved GPS locations for 10 brown hyenas
in Northern Botswana. While studies that use random walks to quantify space use have
a relatively long history of use in invertebrate studies (Root and Kareiva 1984), they have
only recently been applied to larger mammals (Codling et al. 2008) and even less
frequently to carnivores (Young and Shivik 2006).

3 Data and Methods

3.1 Hyena Data

The ﬁeld data were collected by G. Maude in the Makgadikgadi Pans region of northern
Botswana (Figure 1) between June 2004 to December 2007 under the auspices of the
Makgadikgadi Brown Hyaena Project. Five dyads (ten individuals) were selected, includ-
ing two female-female and three male-female pairs, and three different time periods to use
for this exploratory study (Table 3). Peak season was deﬁned as when the zebra and
wildebeest migration began in the study area and lean season was when the migration
moved out of the study area (Maude 2005). A kernel-based method was used to estimate
home ranges for each individual in each season based on the GPS data (G. Maude, unpub.
data). Home range overlap was calculated using the following method (Poole 1995):

100 2∗ (
OZ
+
HRA HRB

)

(

(1)

where OZ is the area of the intersection between two home ranges, and HRA and HRB
are the total area of each individual’s home range.

3.2 Movement Models

The date and time of each observation were combined to form a new ﬁeld (e.g.
’20.07.2005_18’ was an observation from 20 July, 2005 at 6 p.m.). Attribute tables from
both individuals in a dyad were joined, based on this ﬁeld, for each of the ﬁve dyad-season
combinations and these simultaneous paired locations were used in the interaction
methods described below. The distance at which the brown hyenas used in this study are
considered to be ‘aware’ of each other is 500 m (G. Maude, pers. comm.) so 500 m was the
distance threshold and one hour was the temporal threshold. Locations for successive time
periods during which one of the animals moved less than 500 m were removed. The

resulting number of simultaneous pairs is given in Table 3, along with the proportion of
matches that occurred within the 500 m and 1 hour thresholds.

3.2.1 Simulated data

For each individual-season combination, movement parameters were extracted from the
real data (step length mean and standard deviation; modal turn angle, rho (concentra-
tion) and used with the number of steps to generate 10 correlated random walks. For
each dyad, CRW locations from the same run were compared (e.g. run 1 for individual
a was combined with run 1 for individual b) to make 10 total CRW dyads for each of
the ﬁve dyad-season combinations. Observations were randomly deleted so that the
number of locations matched the real data and the mean proportion of pairs that
occurred within 500 m was calculated (Table 3). All analyses were done using the
Geospatial Modeling Environment (http://www.spatialecology.com/gme/index.htm) and
ArcGIS version 9.3.

3.3 Coefﬁcient of Sociality (Sc)

The Sc describes dynamic interaction using the mean distances between simultaneous
locations compared to the mean distances between unmatched pairs. Observed distance
(Do) is calculated as:

where n is the number of pairs of (simultaneous) locations, and (xaj, yaj) are the
coordinates of animal a at time j. The mean expected distance (DE) under the assumption
of no interaction was calculated as the mean distance between all unmatched pairs:

where j and k are times. The coefﬁcient of sociality (Poole 1995) was then deﬁned as:

with resulting values ranging from -1, indicating extreme avoidance, to +1, extreme

the expected value, Sc was also calculated using the mean distance between simulated
s-t-matches (mean of ten simulation pairs) as the expected value.

3.4 Minta’s Coefﬁcients of Interaction ( LA A⋅
Minta’s coefﬁcients of interaction (Minta 1992) compare solitary use by each individual
of OZ relative to its use of the remainder of its HR, and joint use of OZ relative to use
of the remainder of the HR. The ﬁrst step in this method consists of classifying the
simultaneous locations of a pair of individuals (a and b) into four categories depending

present simultaneously (Figure 2a illustrates each of these cases using real and simulated
data for dyad F2b-M2b_L05); (2) both individuals are absent (Figure 2b); (3) only
individual a is present (Figure 2c); and (4) only individual b is present (Figure 2d).

The second step in Minta’s method is to compare the binomial (presence–absence of
both individuals) observed distribution of locations with an expected random distribu-
tion. Minta (1992) outlines two methods for deriving expected random values, the ﬁrst
of which involves using the proportion of HR overlap relative to HRA and HRB. The
second method is used when HRA and HRB cannot be estimated and involves calculating
frequencies using all observed locations for each individual, irrespective of whether they
were simultaneous or not. In addition to these two methods, simulated data were used as
expected values to calculate the three coefﬁcients (see Figure 2).

and LB B⋅

Interaction coefﬁcients are calculated separately for each individual a and b relat-
and LB B⋅ , respectively). As the
ing observed to expected use and non-use of OZ (LA A⋅
approach 0, the individuals are each considered to be using
coefﬁcients LA A⋅
OZ randomly; a coefﬁcient > 0 suggests the individual is using OZ greater than expected
and a coefﬁcient < 0 suggests the individual is using OZ less than expected. These
coefﬁcients can also be classiﬁed as symmetrical (same response by the pair), asymmetri-
cal (opposite response by the pair), or singular response (only one individual showed a
response) (Samson and Huot 2001, Mace and Waller 1997).

The temporal interaction coefﬁcient, LIXN, is based on simultaneous joint and indi-
vidual use of OZ and indicates random simultaneous use when the value is 0; simulta-
neous use is more than solitary use when LIXN > 0; and simultaneous use is less than
solitary use when LIXN < 0.

3.5 Modiﬁed Doncaster Test (Don)

The number of s-t-matches in the real data was compared with two different expected
values using a 2x2 contingency table. Following Doncaster’s (1990) methodology, each
location for individual A was paired with all locations for individual B (resulting in n2
pairs), and the frequency that these pairs occurred within 500 m of each other was used
as the expected value. Following White and Harris’ (1994) methodology, the simulated
simultaneous locations of each individual were compared, to assess how many times a
pair was within 500 m, and this frequency was used as the expected value. X2 tests were
used to compare the frequency of the real s-t-matches to unmatched and to simulated
s-t-matches.

3.6 Half-weight Association (HAI)

The half-weight association index (Atwood and Weeks 2003) was calculated here using
the 500 m distance threshold as:

HAI

(5)

where m is the number of s-t-matches and x and y are the number of times each of the
individuals was located in OZ without the other (e.g. Figures 2c and 2d). HAI values
range from 0, for pairs that are never located within the distance threshold to 1, for pairs
that occur exclusively together. HAI was calculated using the real data and again using
the simulated data to provide an expected value assuming random movement and
subsequent interaction.

3.7 Difference Coefﬁcient (c)

s-t-matches and simulated s-t-matches based on different distance thresholds:

Using this framework, c was calculated for distance intervals of 500 m, 2000 m, 5000 m,

4 Results

The sample size is not large enough to make meaningful generalizations about the effects
of season or pair types (M-F or F-F) on rates of interaction. As the goal of this study was
to explore how spatially explicit simulated data can be used to analyse interactions, the
results are considered primarily in this context, rather than in the context of an ecological
interpretation of interactions between brown hyenas.

4.1 Coefﬁcient of Sociality (Sc)

The coefﬁcient of sociality (Figure 3) was greater than 0 for all ﬁve hyena pairs, suggest-
ing that there was positive interaction (the observed distance between pairs was always
lower than both methods of estimating expected mean distance). The mean distance
between simulated t-matched pairs was greater than the mean distance of unmatched
pairs in all cases. Sc for dyad F2b-M2b_L05 suggested the least amount of interaction for
both expected value methods, while the coefﬁcients for F3a-F3b_L05 indicated neutral
interaction using unmatched locations as the expected value (Sc = 0.0009), but there was
positive interaction when using simulated t-matched data for the expected value (Sc =
0.114). There was also considerably more interaction suggested by this metric when

using simulated t-matched data as the expected value for F4a-M4a_Pk0607 (Sc = 0.26)
compared to using unmatched data (Sc = 0.07).

4.2 Minta’s Coefﬁcients of Interaction ( LA A⋅ , LB B⋅ , LIXN)
Minta’s coefﬁcients showed the greatest variability among methods used to generate
expected null values (Figure 4). The methods based on using HR and simulated data
generally produced more similar values in coefﬁcients that the method based on using all
observed locations of a and b. For example, in Figure 4a LA A⋅ and LB B⋅ are negative for
the dyad F4a-M4a_Pk0607 (indicating both individuals are using OZ less than expected)
when the expected values are based on unmatched data, and positive when the expected
values are based on HR area and simulated data. As the expected values based on the
unmatched data contained the data used to calculate the observed values, the compo-
nents of the contingency table are more similar in value, rendering this method the least
robust. Minta suggests using this method only when HRA and HRB cannot be estimated.
The other two methods showed symmetrical positive interaction for both individuals and
positive temporal interaction (LIXN).

The expected values were very close to the observed data when unmatched pairs
were used and in general, the expected values based on HR area were in between the

expected value for unmatched and simulated data. The large difference between LA A⋅
and LB B⋅ when HR and simulated data were used as the expected values is related to the
greater degree of overlap between OZ and HRB and the much higher expected number
of occurrences of b without a in OZ. All three methods used to generate expected values
resulted in similar LIXN coefﬁcients.

For dyad F2b-M2b_L05, LB B⋅ was a large positive value because b was located in
OZ more frequently in the real data than in the simulated data (n = 808 (real) vs. 634
(simulated); Figures 2a and 2d), while the simulated expectation of a in OZ was almost
equal to the observed frequency (n = 928 (real) vs 929 (simulated); Figures 2a and 2c).
The large negative LIXN coefﬁcient using the simulated data for the expected values
(Figure 4b) was related to the far greater use of OZ by b without a in the real data
compared to the simulated data (Figure 2d) and to the higher frequency of a and b both
occurring outside OZ in the real versus the simulated data (Figure 2b).

Similar positive and symmetric responses were observed for dyad F1a-F1b_Pk0708
using both HR and simulated data to calculate expected values (Figure 4c). All three
methods showed similar coefﬁcient values for dyad F3a-F3b_L05 (Figure 4d). Coefﬁcient
LA A⋅ was positive while LB B⋅ was negative, reﬂecting the fact that a was observed in OZ
more than expected by all three methods, and b was observed in OZ less than expected.
LA A⋅ was negative for dyad F2a-M2a_Pk0607 when using HR method because of the
greater overlap between OZ and HRA (Figure 4e).

4.3 Modiﬁed Doncaster Test (Don)
A Chi-squared test was used to compare real s-t-matches (distance < 500 m) to both
unmatched and simulated s-t-matched data (Table 4). These results indicated that there

was no signiﬁcant difference between either of the null model expected values and the real
number of pairs within 500 m for both of the dyads tracked during the lean season in 2005
(F2b-M2b_L05 and F3a-F3b_L05), suggesting no interaction for those two dyads. There
was a signiﬁcant difference between the observed pair frequency compared to both
methods of generating null model expected frequency for two dyads, F4a-M4a_Pk0607
and F2a-M2a_Pk0607, suggesting positive interaction. F1a-F1b_Pk0708 was the only
dyad that had different results for each of the null model methods; the method using
unmatched data resulted in a signiﬁcantly different number of pairs within 500 m
compared to the simulated data method. This would suggest that this dyad had positive
interaction if using Doncaster’s previous method of calculating expected values, and no
interaction if using the simulated data method based on CRW, as suggested by White and
Harris (1994).

4.4 Half-weight Association (HAI)

The half-weight association ranged in value from 0 (avoidance) to 1 (attraction), with
no value speciﬁed as being associated with neutral interaction. When calculated using
only the simulated data, HAI values were generally small, ranging from 0.008 (F2b-
M2b_L05) to 0.04 (F2a-M2a_Pk0607), suggesting avoidance more than neutral inter-
action (Figure 5). The smallest difference in values for real versus simulated HAI was
0.02 for dyad F2b-M2b_L05.) The difference between simulated and real HAI was at
least 0.11 for the other four dyads, and the largest difference was measured for the dyad
F4a-M4a_Pk0607 (real HAI = 0.58, simulated HAI = 0.025).

4.5 Difference Coefﬁcient (c)

The difference coefﬁcient comparing the frequency of s-t-matches for real and simulated
data at different distance intervals was positive for all ﬁve hyena pairs at the interaction

distance threshold of 500 m, suggesting that the hyenas were interacting more than they
would be expected to under the random movement null hypothesis (Figure 6). The value
of c was highest for dyad F4a-M4a_Pk0607 (c = 8.5) at 500 m, and the coefﬁcient was
negative for all ﬁve dyads at distance intervals greater than 10,000 m. The values of c were
lowest for the dyad F2b-M2b_L05 (c = 1.3 at distance < 500 m) and the expected number
of pairs based on the simulated data was higher than the observed number of pairs for
distances between 500 and 2000 m. The only other dyad tracked during the same season
(F3a-F3b_L05) was a female-female pair that had relatively high interaction for distance
< 500 m (c = 3.8).

5 Discussion

The focus of the work presented here was to explore how spatially explicit simulated
data can be used to analyse dynamic interactions between individuals. Five different
techniques that have been used to quantify dynamic interactions based on GPS data of
pairs of individuals were utilised, and all were compared in the context of spatially
explicit simulated data intended to represent biologically realistic null models for indi-
vidual movement, and subsequently paired interactions.

The results shown here illustrate the importance of using realistic and meaningful
null models with which actual interactions can be compared. Indices or coefﬁcients
can be useful in comparing actual interaction rates and very high or very low values can
generally be interpreted as being associated with positive or negative interaction but they
often lack the ability to describe neutral interaction or to provide a null model for
interaction. The results of this exploratory study give an indication of the variability in
and among dynamic interaction metrics as a function of the way ‘expected values’ based
on assumptions of random interaction are calculated. In one of the few tests used here
that involved a statistical signiﬁcance test (Doncaster’s test), results suggested there was
positive interaction when using one method of calculating expected values but neutral
interaction when using a more realistic spatially explicit method of calculating expected
values (dyad F1a-F1b_Pk0708, Table 4).

Only one of the measures studied here, half-weight association index (HAI), did
not use expected values and simply compared the number of simultaneous locations
within a distance threshold to the number of simultaneous locations for which only one

of the two individuals was located in OZ. As the index ranges from 0 (avoidance) to 1
(attraction), it seems reasonable to presume that a value close to 0.5 might suggest
neutral interaction but when calculated using simulated data, the values ranged from
0.008 to 0.04. All HAI calculated for real data were higher than their simulated versions
and it might be more meaningful to interpret the index for real data relative to the index
calculated for the simulated data. Differences in HAI values (real – simulated) ranged
from 0.02 (F2b-M2b_L05) to 0.555 (F4a-M4a_Pk0607) and further study could inves-
tigate the use of these index differences as a metric to objectively describe interactions
relative to assumptions of random movement/neutral interaction.

Poole’s coefﬁcient of sociality (Sc) was the only purely distance-based measure of
interactions studied here, wherein the mean distance of simultaneous locations is com-
pared is the mean distance of all locations. The ‘middle’ of the range of possible values
(-1 to +1) is 0, suggesting that neutral interaction is associated with no change in distance
between simultaneous and non-simultaneous locations. In this analysis, mean distance of
all locations was always lower than mean distance of simulated simultaneous locations,
and therefore Sc using all distances to calculate the expected value was much smaller
(Sc ranged from 0.009 to 0.085) compared to using simulated data (Sc ranged from 0.059
to 0.26).

Minta’s coefﬁcients of interaction (Minta 1992) showed wide variation in the nature
of interaction they described as a function of the technique used to generate expected
values (Figure 4). While the techniques based on HR overlap and simulated movement
data had more similar results, rather than selecting one method, it might be interesting
to investigate further the differences resulting from the two techniques (e.g. Figures 4b
and 4e). Each of them represents a slightly different conceptualization of expected null
values, where the HR technique is based on spatial overlap and the simulated data is
based on random movement of each of the two individuals.

Finally, the modiﬁed Doncaster test (Doncaster 1990) compared the frequency of pairs
within a distance threshold for the real simultaneous data to the expected frequency under
the assumption of random interactions (Table 4). In addition to the original technique for
generating expected values based on pairs of all locations, the frequency of pairs within the
distance threshold of the simulated data were also used (White and Harris 1994). There
were similar results for four of the ﬁve dyads (real unmatched and simulated data were
either both signiﬁcantly different from the observed values or both were not signiﬁcantly
different), but for dyad F1a-F1b_Pk0708 the number of pairs in the unmatched data was
signiﬁcantly different from the observed number of pairs, while the number of pairs in the
simulated data was not different (Table 4). This implies that the simulated data method
may be the more conservative way to analyze interactions. This should be examined
further, as no study has compared both of these methods using the same data.

6 Conclusions

In a recent overview, Holyoak et al. (2008) estimated that there have been at least 26,000
papers published between 1997–2006 that address some aspect of organism movement
in ecology. Many outstanding issues associated with modelling animal movement in
general and spanning several disciplines remain. GIScience-related issues include under-
standing the effects of uncertainty and temporal scale on calculation of movement
parameters (Laube and Purves 2011). Ecological issues include understanding animal

behavior and state-changes associated with movement characteristics (Fryxell et al.
2008, Hebblewhite et al. 2010) and understanding how movement relates to habitat or
resource use (Beyer et al. 2010). There are also technological issues associated with the
effects of GPS precision and bias (Frair et al. 2010).

Dynamic interaction between individuals is an important parameter related to
disease transmission, territoriality, mating, and predation. Analysis of interactions should
be more extensively addressed within the developing movement pattern analysis frame-
work. The use of spatially explicit simulated data as a null model to investigate animal
movement has been widely accepted (Smouse et al. 2010), while “shufﬂing” coordinates
and (aspatial) ideal gas law encounter rates are still often used as a null expectation for
interactions. Further investigation of both appropriate methods to quantify interactions
and techniques to generate relevant null expected rates are needed. This study helps to
illustrate the difﬁculty in objectively interpreting interaction rates using methods that
have been applied previously. Certainly extreme positive or negative interaction can be
teased out using many of the indices and metrics described here, but there is still a great
deal of uncertainty associated with being able to answer the general question “are
individuals interacting more or less than they would if moving randomly across space?”
Current dynamic interaction metrics can be modiﬁed and new metrics developed to
more explicitly address this question as well as more sophisticated issues associated with
using null models of movement and neutral interaction. Mace and Waller (1997) suggest
that meaningful “intraspeciﬁc interaction studies should include simultaneously derived
elements of time, space, and habitat” (p. 39), and future interaction analysis should
address habitat heterogeneity, analogous to the application of resource selection func-
tions in movement ecology (Fieberg et al. 2010).

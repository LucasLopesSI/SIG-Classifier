Abstract. Soil moisture is an important hydrologic variable in both natural and
agricultural ecosystems. Recent experiments, based on remote sensing data, pro-
vided observations of soil moisture distributions at a regional scale. One of the
instruments is the Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR).
Deployed on the aircraft, it measures brightness temperature (with the spatial
resolution about 400 m) that can be converted into estimates of volumetric soil
moisture. The soil moisture retrieval algorithm requires additional data layers
(like soil physical temperature, land cover, and soil texture) that come from
diVerent sources and have to be combined together in a uniform GIS. The
objective of this paper is to report results of the GIS use to map soil surface
moisture from passive microwave measurements and to quantify spatial structure
of soil moisture distributions. The data were collected across a 10 000 km2 area
in Oklahoma during June and July 1997. The precipitation data and ground
measurements from the test sites were also incorporated into GIS. The GIS data
layers enable soil moisture distribution analysis with geostatistical tools. Semi-
variograms of soil moisture were nested and showed the presence of two scales.
Rainfall was the dominant factor in(cid:143) uencing soil moisture distribution at the
regional scale, whereas soil texture was important at the local scale. Information
about soil moisture, obtained with remote sensing techniques over space and
time, and organized in a GIS with complementary environmental data layers, can
be used in landscape pattern analysis, landscape models, land use assessment and
management.

Introduction
Geographical Information Systems are essential for collecting and analysing data
on environmental processes in space and time. GIS are especially useful in working
with dynamic phenomena over large areas when the volume of information is large
and environmental variables are interrelated (Burrough 1986). These features are
inherent for observations of soil moisture distributions at a regional scale.

Recent advances in remote sensing provide a growing database for understanding
patterns of water content and rates of water transport in soils and landscapes
(Jackson and Le Vine 1996, Nielsen et al. 1996). Both active and passive microwave

methods provide powerful tools for analysing soil moisture distributions and are
currently used intensively (Jackson et al. 1996, Du et al. 2000). Active methods
employ radar to send microwave pulses that are then re(cid:143) ected, and the received
signals are recorded. Passive methods rely on measuring natural emission from the
land surface at microwave wavelengths. Soil water content aVects the microwave
measurements in both methods, so that changes in soil moisture in time and space
can be registered. Microwave techniques are capable of measuring the surface soil
moisture up to the depth of 5 cm (Jackson 1993). At wavelengths used in soil
moisture studies, microwave measurements are not sensitive to weather conditions
and can detect soil moisture through cloud cover. Vegetation is semi-transparent for
microwaves, making it possible to observe the underlying surface. Solar illumination
is not necessary, and the observations can be made around the clock. The topography
of the area can aVect the brightness temperature measurements (based on the viewing
angle of the radiometer) when slopes are greater than 10° (Jackson 1993). Active
microwave instruments generally oVer relatively high spatial resolution, up to 20 m
even from spacecraft altitudes. However, backscattered radar signals are often diYcult
to interpret in terms of soil moisture content because of variability in other environ-
mental factors such as surface roughness. Passive microwave systems on satellite
platforms have low resolution up to 50 km, but deploying them on aircrafts typically
yields resolutions between 100 and 1000 m. Airborne passive measurements were
successfully implemented in recent soil moisture studies at a regional scale (Jackson
et al. 1995, 1999).

The soil moisture algorithm, based on the passive measurements, requires addi-
tional environmental data to be combined with microwave data. A major potential
of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is the capability of handling many layers
of map information relating to an area. This feature is especially advantageou s when
we are dealing with data layers derived from diVerent sources and need to combine
them. For these reasons, a GIS is typically used in the passive microwave soil
moisture studies on large scales (Oldak et al. 1999 ).

Spatial variability of soil moisture is an inherent property of soils, and it needs
to be quanti(cid:142) ed to interpret measurements of soil water contents. Passive microwave
observations provide ample data for that purpose. Geostatistical techniques were
found useful to quantify spatial variations in landscapes with remote sensing data
(Curran 1988). The basic geostatistical function is the semivariogram. It relates the
variance of diVerences in paired measurements to the distances separating locations
of the measurements. This dependence of variation in measurements on the distance
between sampling locations appeared to be useful, in particular, to select sampling
strategies (Qi and Wu 1996, Legendre and Legendre 1998, Sanderson et al. 1998 ),
to relate distributions of various soil and landscape features (Hollenbeck et al. 1996,
Sanderson et al. 1998) and to map landscape parameters inferred from spatially
irregular and regular measurements (Rossi et al. 1992, 1994).

Studies typically show that for any given resolution, i.e. the volume or area over
which soil moisture is measured, the variation in paired measurements grows as the
distance between sampling locations increases (Nielsen et al. 1996). Stabilization of
the variability, beginning from some separation distance, or range, was observed in
soil moisture data from remote sensing (Schmugge and Jackson 1996). The range
was thought to be a natural spatial scale at which soil moisture should be character-
ized and compared with other landscape features (Hollenbeck et al. 1996). This
approach concurs with using geostatistics as a tool for de(cid:142) ning scales (Shlesinger

et al. 1996, Hyppanen 1996, Sanderson et al. 1998, Menntemeyer and Box 1987,
Legendre and Legendre 1998, Meisel and Turner 1998). However, Vinnikov et al.
(1996) reported the presence of two spatial scales in soil moisture distributions that
they derived from ground soil moisture data. They referred the smaller scale to
landscape features and the larger scale to atmospheric processes. Scales can be
de(cid:142) ned with geostatistics by modelling semivariograms (Curran 1988); by (cid:142) tting
theoretical semivariogram equations to experimental semivariograms and extracting
parameters that show the separation distance at which the semivariogram (cid:143) attens
and the environmental variable in question becomes spatially uncorrelated.

Soil surface drying periods after rainfall events of various intensities present a
good opportunity to observe and compare spatial variations and scales of soil
moisture in relation to the other environmental data layers in GIS.

The density of remote sensing measurements provides data on both spatial and
temporal variability of surface soil moisture contents (Jackson and Le Vine 1996).
Changes in spatial structures of soil moisture may alter scales at which moisture
contents should be characterized. Persistent features in semivariograms of soil mois-
ture were observed at diVerent resolutions (Kachanoski and de Jong 1988, Schmugge
and Jackson 1996, Hollenbeck et al. 1996 ).

The objective of this paper is to report results of the GIS use to map soil surface
moisture contents from passive microwave measurements and to quantify spatial
structure of soil moisture distributions.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Field site

Data collected in the 1997 Southern Great Plains Hydrology Experiment (SGP97;
Jackson et al. 1999; (http://hydrolab.arsusda.gov/sgp97/)) will be examined. One of
the objectives of this project was to map soil moisture on a daily basis during four
weeks, 18 June through 16 July. The study area, as shown in (cid:142) gure 1, lies predomi-
nantly within the Central Rolling Red Prairies and Central Rolling Red Plains
mostly within the state of Oklahoma (Gray and Galloway 1969). The slopes calcu-
lated from a 100 m resolution Digital Elevation Model (Miller 1997) within the (cid:143) ight
area being analysed in this work (shown on (cid:142) gure 1) vary from 0 to 2.3% , but most
fall in 0.5 to 1.1% . The total area under study was about 10 000 km2 .

Annual rainfall ranges from 875 mm in the east (Red Prairies) to about 711 mm
in the west (Red Plains). Among soil texture categories silt loam was the dominant
soil texture (59.7% ), followed by loam (16.8% ) and sandy loam (14.5% ). Soils in
the region are predominantly Mollisols (grassland soils) having low leaching (low
precipitation –subhumid to semi-arid climate) with relatively large annual additions
of organic matter. Pasture and forage were the dominant land cover categories
(48.4% ) in the research area, followed by wheat (21.8% ), urban area (7.1% ), alfalfa
(5.5% ), shrubs (4.8% ), trees (3.3% ), and corn (3.2% ). Other categories include
bare soils, legume, summer corn and summer legume, which altogether with the
unclassi(cid:142) ed areas utilize 5.9% of the area in question.

2.2. GIS for the research area
2.2.1. Input data layers

The soil moisture retrieval algorithm combines data layers coming from diVerent
sources ((cid:142) gure 2). There were aircraft and satellite data, thematic maps and point
measurements.

outline) on the map of soil texture categories of the top layer (0–5 cm). The three
black rectangular boxes show the location of the test sites—Central Facility (CF),
El Reno (ER) and Little Washita (LW ). Black points represent the location of the
Oklahoma Mesonet stations, black lines—boundaries of the counties. Coordinates
are in UTM, zone 14, row S.

The core layer for the model data input was the brightness temperature data. It
was measured with the Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR)
deployed on the NASA-P3 aircraft. The observation area was 40 km wide East-West
and 250 km long North-South ((cid:142) gure 1). ESTAR produces a spatially distributed
map product. The resulting pixel size from the ESTAR image depends on latitude,
changing from 554.6 m in the x direction and 461.9 m in the y direction at 34° of
latitude to 555.0 m and 436.2 m respectively at 38.5°. The uniform GIS database
required re-gridding of the original irregular resolution data. The original brightness
temperature data were interpolated to a regular 800 m grid using Surfer software
(Golden Software Inc., 1999). This grid size in UTM (Zone 14 S) coordinate system
was established as the basic resolution for the GIS layers in the soil moisture retrieval.
Essential data layers for the model were derived from land cover categories. The
presence of vegetation cover reduces microwave sensitivity to soil moisture variations.

calculations.

Two features are important for assessing the in(cid:143) uence of vegetation canopies on
microwave signal: vegetation water content and canopy structure (Jackson and
Schmugge 1991). These two parameters determine the optical depth of the canopy,
which is in turn responsible for vegetation layer transmissivity, attenuating the
microwave signal from the soil surface. Canopy structure is described by an empiric-
ally derived value, which depends on vegetation type, wavelength and its polarization.
Another feature of the surface, its roughness, eVects the emission signal. Increasing
roughness results in an increase in the emissivity over that of a smooth surface.
Surface roughness, vegetation water content and canopy structure parameter are
associated with land cover types. This is why land cover is a critical data layer in
the GIS database.

Land cover categories were developed from several Landsat TM images, acquired
during the time of the SGP97 experiment as described by Doraiswamy et al. (1998 ).
These original land cover categories were important for screening for speci(cid:142) c classes
(grasses, stalk-dominated vegetation, bare lands, shrubs, and others) in order to
evaluate the in(cid:143) uence of surface roughness and vegetation cover on soil emissivity.
Using the land cover classes, (cid:142) xed values from the attribute tables were assigned to
obtain a spatial distribution of the canopy structure parameter, surface roughness,
vegetation water content and soil bulk density under diVerent land cover type
categories (Jackson et al. 1999 ).

In determining the vegetation water content special attention was paid to the
grass categories, which was the dominant land cover type in the research area. For
these categories, water content was estimated based on (cid:142) eld measurements. The (cid:142) eld
measurements, conducted during the experiment period, within the test areas as
shown in (cid:142) gure 1, were compared with NDVI values. NDVI was calculated from
the 25 July Landsat TM image. A second order polynomial function was used to

A. Oldak et al.

establish a relationship between NDVI and vegetation water content (Jackson et al.
1999). With this function embedded into the GIS model, the spatial distribution of
vegetation water content was calculated for the grass areas.

All four data layers derived from the land cover classi(cid:142) cation, gridded as 30 m
cells, were averaged in 27×27 blocks of pixels and georegistered to 800 m resolution
to match the established GIS database.

Another data layer important for model calculation was soil texture data. Soil
texture data layers over the SGP97 area were developed using a version of the State
Soil Geographic Data Base (STATSGO) from the USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Service in 1 km grid. The data set was provided by Pennsylvania
State’s Univerity’s Earth System Science Center (Miller 1997). For the soil moisture
retrieval algorithm information about the top layer of the soil is needed. The layer
of the depth 0–5 cm was resampled to the 800 m resolution of the established GIS
database. For each texture class a percent of clay and a percentage of sand were
assigned based on soil texture samples and published data (Jackson et al. 1999 ).
These two data layers were input for further model calculations.

Soil temperature data were needed for computing the emissivity of soils. Data
collected at the 122 Oklahoma Mesonet stations, at 10 cm under sod for each day,
were interpolated to the 800 m grid (Golden Software Inc. 1999). Temperature
information was stored as separate data layers for each day of the observation period.
Also, cumulative rainfall for the 24 hours prior to the ESTAR observation were
obtained from the Oklahoma Mesonet stations for each day of the experiment. These
data were interpolated to the 800 m grid resolution to match GIS data base. Rain-
fall data layers were important when soil moisture distribution was analysed and
assessed.

2.2.2. Ground truth data

On each day of the experiment, soil samples were collected from the top layer of
the soils at sites in the Central Facility, El Reno and Little Washita areas (see
(cid:142) gure 1). In each area there were 10 to 14 smaller test sites of uniform land cover,
texture and topography (Jackson et al. 1999). Samples were taken from each of the
test sites at the time of the aircraft over(cid:143) ight. Volumetric soil moisture was determined
and averaged within the test sites. These data were later used for model validation.

2.2.3. Model calculations and validation

All needed GIS database layers were assembled and merged for soil moisture
algorithm calculations. Using these spatial data as the input to the model, computa-
tion was performed for each day of the experiment. The retrieval algorithm, described
in Jackson et al. (1999), was implemented inside PCI (1998).

Preliminary results were compared with the ground truth data (see (cid:142) gure 2). The
comparison revealed that the model parameters needed adjustment, especially those
associated with land cover types. Corrections for the input values of the vegetation
structure parameter and vegetation water content were applied, especially within the
areas covered by dense native grasses (Jackson et al. 1999). Finally, after the model
validation, images for 16 days during the experiment were produced (selected images
of the common area selected for further analysis are shown in (cid:142) gure 3). They show
spatial and temporal soil changes of soil moisture content within the top (0–5 cm)
layer of the soil.

The comparison of remote sensing and ground measurements showed that stand-
ard errors are within 3% interval (Jackson et al. 1999). In the El Reno area, which
was covered by dense native grass, the predicted soil moisture was lower than the
ground measurements. The opposite was true for sites in Central Facility area where
winter wheat was the dominant crop.

2.3. Geostatistical data analysis

Having all the data layers organised in one uniform GIS for the research area
helped to compute experimental semivariograms for moisture contents, drying rates,
clay, sand and silt contents, and elevation. The semivariogram c, which relates the
variance of diVerences in paired measurements that is separated by the distance d,
was computed as (Legendre and Legendre 1998):

c(d )=

n
1
2N(d ) å
i=1

n
å
h=1

whi (yh - yi)2

(1)

Here n is the total number of observations, weights whi are equal to 1 when the
measurements in locations h and i are separated by the distance d, and are equal to
zero otherwise, N(d ) is the total number of pairs separated by the distance d. The
GSLIB software (Deutsch and Journel 1992) was used in computations.

Semivariograms were modelled (Curran 1988) by (cid:142) tting theoretical semivario-
gram equations to the experimental semivariograms. Equations that we used were:

and the power model:

cG(d)=C0d
The (cid:142) rst three models describe the (cid:143) attening of the semivariogram when the observa-
tion locations are separated by the distance equal or larger than a. Beyond that
distance, the samples are not spatially correlated. The sum C0 +C1 is the value of
variance of the variable at which the semivariance levels oV. It is referred to as the
sill. The non-zero intercept value C0 is called the nugget eVect. It corresponds to the
local variation occurring at scales (cid:142) ner than the sampling interval, such as sampling
error, (cid:142) ne-scale (cid:142) eld variability and measurement error (Legendre and Legendre
1998). The power model describes an unbounded increase in semivariance within
the range of separate distances observed.

(5)

During visual inspection of experimental semivariograms computed for the three

drying periods ((cid:142) gure 4), we observed:

1. The nugget eVect values were relatively small compared with sill values. The
number of points in the beginning of semivariograms before they levelled oV
was not large, and this precluded the reliable (cid:142) nding of the nugget C0 .

2. Some of the semivariograms revealed distinct two-scale variability. As the
separation distance increased, the semivariance increased, then levelled oV,
then began to increase again, and then levelled oV again.

3. The shape of the semivariograms did not give clear indications on which of

the equations (2)–(5) should be used to (cid:142) t the data.

The examination of the experimental semivariograms reveals that variation of
soil moisture within the 800 m pixel areas is small compared to the semivariogram
values (experimental semivariograms almost pass through the origin). In addition,
Famiglietti et al. (1999) report small variation of ground observation within this
pixel size. Based on these results we decided to set the nugget eVect equal to zero
while modelling the experimental semivariograms. The models we used consisted of
sums of two components:

c(d)=c1 (d)+c2 (d)
where each of the component functions c1 (d) and c2 (d) was one of the four given by
equations (2)–(5). This gave sixteen combinations for each of the experimental
semivariograms. To decide which of the sixteen is the best, we ranked them by the
root-mean square error, and then applied the Williams-Kloot test (Williams and

respectively, in j=1, 2, ... K observations. Williams and Kloot (1953) proposed to

have to be compared with the tabulated values of the Student’s distribution function

level. Models will be distinguishable if |tl |>tK-1;1-a/2. If the models are distinguishable
and tl <0 then the second model is better. If the models are distinguishable and
tl>0 then the (cid:142) rst model is better. A signi(cid:142) cance level of 0.05 was used. A version
of the Marquardt-Levenber g algorithm (van Genuchten 1981) was used to (cid:142) t models
to data.

3. Results

Figure 3 shows nine soil moisture images, derived from ESTAR using the above-
described GIS approach, that were selected for the analysis in this work. Three
drying periods on 18–20 June, 1–3 July and 12–14 July can be observed (compare
(cid:142) gure 3 and (cid:142) gure 5). The soil moisture varies because of wetting by rainfall events
and periods of drying. The sequences of images in (cid:142) gure 3 show the progressive
drying. The average soil moisture for each day of the drying periods decreases as
shown in (cid:142) gure 5. The northern part of the region, represented by the rainfall
recorded close to the Central Facility test site is generally wetter compared to the
central and southern parts ((cid:142) gures 1 and 6). Heavier and more frequent rains
occurred there. Figure 5 presents the relationship between the soil moisture content
and the type of the dominant soil texture categories. Silt loam, containing the higher
amount of clay and silt, as compared to loam and sandy loam, remains wettest on
all days during all three drying periods. It is followed by loams and sandy loams
with a progressively decreasing amount of (cid:142) ne particles. The soil moisture decrease
rate during the drying periods is the highest in silt loam and the lowest in sandy loam.
The three drying periods were chosen for the semivariogram analysis of soil
moisture distributions. As the areas of the soil moisture images diVer from each
other on each day of the experiment (Jackson et al. 1999), the semivariograms were
computed for the same area of each drying period shown in (cid:142) gure 3. Semivariograms
are shown in (cid:142) gure 4.

Spatial structures of soil moisture distributions were diVerent on the three drying

periods. This is re(cid:143) ected by the diVerences in the semivariograms shapes. Their
common feature is that the values of moisture variances decrease with time in each
drying period. The semivariograms of the (cid:142) rst (on 18–20 June) and the third (on
12–14 July) drying periods have well-expressed sills and ranges. The sum of two
spherical models gave the best (cid:142) t, and two scales of changes in semivariograms
values were detected. The sills and ranges calculated from the (cid:142) tted models are
presented in table 1. Semivariogram s of the 18–20 June period reach their (cid:142) rst sills
at distances about 6–8 km. On the larger scale second ranges, which are greater by
an order of magnitude, increase as the drying progresses (table 1). On the contrary,
the semivariograms of the 12–14 July have their second ranges apparently decreasing
as soil becomes drier. The (cid:142) rst ranges do not show a clear trend related to drying.
On 14 July, the scale of spatial dependence changed signi(cid:142) cantly, as compared to
two previous days.

Semivariograms of soil moisture on the 1–3 July period were also (cid:142) tted by the
sum of two models. The (cid:142) rst ranges appear between 3–6 km. Beyond these distances,
the semivariance increases without visible bonds. The variation in soil moisture
appears to be spatially dependent within the whole range of distances in this study.
Semivariograms, calculated for the rainfall events, are shown in (cid:142) gure 7. The
shape of variograms does not permit using equations (2)–(5) to (cid:142) t models. The
semivariogram s of the rainfall events on 30 June show an increasing dissimilarity of
precipitation as the distance increases between the sampling points. Semivariograms
of soil moisture on 1–3 July have the same features at large scales. Spatial variation
in rainfall increases up to about 60 km separation distance on 17 June. It declines

ranges of semivariograms of soil moisture on 18–20 June drying period. The rainfall
data of 11 July have an in(cid:143) ection point on their semivariograms at about 30–40 km.
This distance is close to the (cid:142) rst ranges of semivariograms of soil moisture on
12–13 July.

sill values are presented in table 2. The diVerences between the observation points
of these three texture fragments are growing rapidly with the increasing lags. Sills
are reached at 7–25 km separation distance. The variance of clay content is the
smallest, followed by silt and sand content variances.

Soil drying rates were calculated as the diVerences of soil moisture content on
the days of drying periods divided by the number of days. Semivariograms of soil
moisture drying rates are shown in (cid:142) gure 9. They reach their sills at distances between
13 and 27 km (table 1). The highest sill was found in semivariograms for the period
of the fastest drying on 12–14 July. No second sill was detected. The trend in spatial
variation of precipitation on 30 June is preserved in the semivariogram values of
soil drying rates on 1–3 July.

boundary conditions to simulate water transport in soil and subsoil. These values
may provide an insight into relationships between water (cid:143) uxes and more temporally
stable landscape features, such as soil cover, relief and vegetation. The data reported
in this paper show that microwave remote sensing oVers a promising way of mapping
surface soil moisture. This experiment (Jackson et al. 1999) proved the reliability of
using passive microwave instruments in soil moisture mapping on a regional scale
using GIS modelling.

Soil texture was found to have a signi(cid:142) cant eVect on soil moisture distribution
and range over the study area ((cid:142) gure 5) as in previous studies with passive micro-
wave imagery in the Little Washita area of 740 km2 (Jackson et al. 1995) and in the
HAPEX-Sahel experimental area (Hollenbeck et al. 1996). The soil moisture spatial
distribution follows the texture pattern.

The spatial structure of soil moisture appears to be related to the spatial structures
of soils and precipitation. This is expressed by the similarities in their semivariogram
features. Semivariograms were calculated based on the appropriate GIS data layers.
The (cid:142) rst distinct observed scale of soil moisture variability can be partly explained
by scales of soil texture. Ranges of clay, silt and sand contents generally are of the
similar order of magnitude as the (cid:142) rst ranges of the soil moisture semivariograms
calculated for the drying periods (tables 1 and 2). The increasing diVerences of soil
moisture between observation points at short distances follow the spatial variation
in contents of soil texture fractions. This is especially noticeable in data of the (cid:142) rst
and the second drying periods and the last day of the third one in relation to the
clay and in the (cid:142) rst two days of the third drying period with regard to sand and silt.
The spatial structure of precipitation seems to control the long-range scaling in
soil moisture. Spatial dependences of rainfall distribution ((cid:142) gure 7) are followed by
the changes in soil moisture variation (see second range in table 1). These relations
are especially noticeable at large lag distances, but they appear to be masked by soil
texture eVects at shorter separation intervals.

Some features of soil surface moisture distributions appear to be related to the
speci(cid:142) cs of soil drying. The semivariogram value, relating variance of water content
to the distance decreased as soil dried in all three periods studied. The wetter the

soil the faster it dries, and less variation in soil moisture can be found at the late
stages of drying. In opposite, the coeYcient of variation is increasing as drying
progresses (see (cid:142) gure 5). This was observed both in this and in previous studies
(Schmugge and Jackson 1996, Hollenbeck et al. 1996). The second scale range was
not found for soil drying rates (table 1). A reason for that can be that the soil drying
rates have relatively weak dependences on soil water content, per se, when water
content is relatively high. Drying at this stage is governed mainly by potential
evaporation rates. Below some critical water potential, the drying rates begin to
drop sharply as the drying progresses (Philip 1957).

Although temporal trends in second ranges of semivariograms can be con(cid:142) rmed
statistically using the estimation of the standard error of the (cid:142) tting models, it is
diYcult to explain their nature at this stage of study. On one hand, they may be just
artifacts of the (cid:142) tting procedure. On the other hand, they may re(cid:143) ect eVects of the
rainfall intensity on spatial variations of surface moisture via in(cid:142) ltration and small-
scale runoV-runon processes. Both excess and lack of water in soils (when soil water
content exceeds (cid:142) eld capacity or when soils are completely dry) decrease the spatial
variation of surface soil moisture. Water contents were relatively low during the
third drying period ((cid:142) gure 5) and drying rates were the highest ((cid:142) gure 9). This could
lead to the decrease in second ranges. The (cid:142) rst drying period had high water contents
and diVerences in surface water contents could be magni(cid:142) ed by the spatial redistribu-
tion of water. Our results imply that there may exist fast changes in spatial variability
of soil moisture, but more data are needed to quantify actual spatio-tempora l
variability of soil moisture (cid:142) elds. Vinnikov et al. (1996) indicated that the temporal
component of soil moisture scales may be interrelated with spatial scales.

In contrast to our observations of decreasing soil moisture variability (illustrated
by the lowering values of the semivariogram, (cid:142) gure 4) within the drying periods,
which are represented by the decreasing mean soil moisture over the research area
((cid:142) gure 5), Famigletti et al. (1999) reports increasing soil moisture variability with
decreasing mean soil moisture content within the remote sensing footprint. The
diVerent extent of the scales and research areas might be responsible for these
opposing results.

Topography is commonly viewed as a signi(cid:142) cant factor in soil moisture distribu-
tion in landscapes (Swanson et al. 1988, Moore et al. 1991, Falkenmark and Mikulski
1994). Recent studies showed signi(cid:142) cant eVects of topography characterized at diVer-
ent scale on both soil moisture distribution (Florinsky and Kuryakova 2000) and
on soil moisture retention (Pachepsky et al. 2001). Those studies addressed (cid:142) ne-
scale soil moisture distributions within sites smaller than 300×300 m, i.e. smaller
than one pixel of grid in this work. At the coarser scales used in this work, direct
eVect of topography on soil water redistribution due to runoV and subsurface lateral
(cid:143) ow could be masked by the fact that the ESTAR measurements of soil moisture
come from the uppermost 5 cm soil layer. The experiment took place in the summer
time when a top layer of soil is controlled by high evaporation rates in the semiarid
climate of Oklahoma. The evaporation causes signi(cid:142) cant drying before any substan-
tial runoV can transport water between pixel areas. Besides, at resolutions used in
this work, 99% of the investigated area had slopes less than 1.25% with the most
common values of 0.18–0.52% . Nevertheless, topography could manifest itself in
moisture distributions indirectly, in particular, by aVecting the spatial distribution
of rainfall, and in(cid:143) uencing soil formation and soil properties (Rogowski 1996). This
issue presents an interesting avenue to explore using GIS technique.

Applications of geostatistics resulted in detecting diVerent lengths of semivario-
gram ranges of soil moisture variations. No ranges of soil moisture content were
reported in studies comprising areas from 6 m×6 m to 30 m×30 m, when samples
were 5 cm×5 cm cores (Gummatov et al. 1993, Schmugge and Jackson 1996). Using
transects of up to 1 km length resulted in semivariogram ranges on the order of 10 m
(Vieira et al. 1981, Vachaud et al. 1985, Kachanoski and de Jong 1988). With a 1 km
grid sampling, a range value of 4 km was found (Nielsen et al. 1996). Vinnikov et al.
(1996) used the ground weather station net and found scales of 100 km of magnitude.
Western and Blo¨ schl (1999) demonstrated an increase in ranges of semivariogram s
of soil moisture with increasing size or volume of the sample, minimum distance
between sampling locations, and size of the sampled area. A similar eVect was found
from results of simulating natural variability as related to remote sensing (Collins
and Woodcock 1999). Hu et al. (1997) found that the variability of surface moisture
from remote sensing imagery followed the fractal scaling law. This type of variability
in moisture content (cid:142) elds follows the general theoretical concept of landscape ecology
that ‘the description of variability is contingent upon the window through which the
system is viewed’ (Levin 1992). The sampling design along with the landscape
speci(cid:142) cs aVects values of ranges that can be obtained from geostatistical analysis.
Therefore, scales and variability ranges found in this study may be speci(cid:142) c to pixel
size. Quantifying the eVects of pixel size on the semivariogram ranges in surface
moisture data presents an interesting avenue to explore.

5. Conclusions

Microwave remote sensing oVers fast and reliable ways of mapping soil surface
moisture contents. Passive microwave remote sensing is currently the most reliable
approach. This and previous experiments proved the feasibility of using passive
microwave instruments in soil moisture mapping on a regional scale. GIS proved to
be a necessary tool in soil moisture computation and later analysis because of the
large area and multiple data layers that were needed.

The semivariogram analysis allowed for detecting two factors governing spatial
variability of soil moisture at two diVerent scales. The precipitation is responsible
for soil moisture variability on a larger scale, while soil texture controls soil moisture
variations on smaller scales. The overall variability measured by semivariogram
value decreases as the soil dries out. The analysis of ranges and sills of semivariogram s
of soil moisture in this and previous studies indicated to be speci(cid:142) c to pixel size,
which is an interesting avenue to explore.

Knowledge of the spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture is important
in land use management. It is essential in studies involving relationships between
landscape components. The GIS-generated temporal series of soil moisture maps
over large areas enable the analysis of water distributions as related to various
landscape components.

Thinking about Space-Time Connections: Spatiotemporal
Scheduling of Individual Activities

Department of Geography, The University of Iowa

Abstract
This article presents a spatiotemporal model for scheduling applications that is driven by the events and
activities individuals plan and manage every day. The framework is presented using an ontological
approach where ontologies at different levels of generalization, e.g. domain, application, and task ontolo-
gies, are linked together through participation and inheritance relationships. S_Events are entered into a
schedule as a new S_Entry, or modiﬁcations can be made to existing entries including reschedule, post-
pone, change location, and delete as schedules vary over time. These schedule updates are formalized
through changes to planned start and end times and the planned locations of S_Entries are expressed
using SWRL, a semantic web rule language. SWRL is also used for reasoning about schedule changes and
the space-time conﬂicts that can occur. The sequence of entries in a schedule gives rise to S_trajectories
representing the locations that individuals plan to visit in order to carry out their schedule, adding an
additional spatial element to the framework. A prototype Geoscheduler application maps S_Entries
against a timeline, offering a spatiotemporal visualization of scheduled activities showing the evolution of
a schedule over space-time and affecting spatiotemporal accessibility for individuals.

1 Introduction

Individuals regularly use some kind of calendar or diary to schedule and track their appoint-
ments as they go about their daily activities. In a digital environment, scheduling applications
exist, tracking events and activities in the context of a planner or calendar, i.e. a table showing
time at different granularities (e.g. days, weeks, months and years) and allowing the input of
entries, for example, meeting a customer today at 2 p.m. (Ashiru et al. 2004, Adnan and
Watling 2011). The focus for this research is the development of a formal model for a spatio-
temporal scheduler. This model goes beyond the temporal organization of events, providing a
spatiotemporal view of the planned activities with a focus on the set of possible temporal and
spatial updates for activities entered in a schedule. Scheduling applications, such as digital cal-
endars (e.g. Mac OS X iCal) commonly store temporal information about activities allowing
for a chronological ordering, while the location of activities is stored but not, or at least not
explicitly, represented or made available for analysis. The developed model is ontology-driven
with both temporal and spatial information about activities or events in a domain being taken
into account. The ontology-based approach provides reasoning capabilities about the entries
entered into a schedule, including reasoning about possible spatiotemporal modiﬁcations to
the schedule and about schedule conﬂicts. The sequences of scheduled events in combination
with their expected locations reveal opportunities for ordering activities in such a way that

connections between activities and people are more likely, and the possibilities afforded by
scheduled activities are maximized, increasing the spatiotemporal accessibility of individuals.
Representing daily activities and movements spatially has been a focus for researchers inter-
ested in, for example, modeling space-time patterns of human activities with a focus on the
different kinds of movement behaviors that are possible (see for example, Parkes and Thrift
1975, Kwan et al. 2003, Laube et al. 2005, Yu 2006, Dodge et al. 2008). This is comple-
mented by an extensive literature in time geography on space-time prisms and space-time
paths where accessibility is the focus, for example, what locations is an individual able to
reach given a certain time window (Miller 1999, Yu 2006, Timmermans and Zhang 2009).
Recently, research on accessibility has investigated an approach for space-time accessibility in
the context of an individual’s activities in an urban environment for cases involving joint
activities such that the co-presence of group members at the same location is required
(Neutens et al. 2008, 2010a, b; Fang et al. 2011). The geocomputational model designed to
support synchronization of joint activities (Neutens et al. 2008, 2010a, b) requires location,
timing and duration information. Work by Fang et al. (2011) extended accessibility modeling
using a network space-time prism and time-of-day preferences, congestion pricing for travel,
travel time and distance in their model for predicting joint activity opportunity spaces in an
urban area. In these studies, modiﬁcations to schedules such as rescheduling are not considered
and are not modeled by the developed toolkits. A multi-dimensional choice model that uses
timing, duration and multiple choice dimensions including travel delays (e.g. start travel later),
has been applied in a transportation modeling context (Ettema et al. 2007).

To design a spatiotemporal scheduler, we use an ontological framework as a foundation
for developing and prototyping tools that incorporates multiple ontologies at different levels of
generalization that are linked to each other (Guarino 1998, Yan et al. 2008, Duce 2009, Yang
and Worboys 2011). A domain ontology, application ontology and task ontology are inte-
grated to provide support and allow for reasoning about schedule changes. Three primary
classes that cut across this ontology framework are introduced including, Schedule, S_Event,
and S_Entry. The ontology is formalized using OWL classes and an OWL-based rule language
SWRL. Based on an analysis of the possible occurrences of schedule modiﬁcation operators
(moveUp, postpone, holdSooner, holdLater, endSooner, endLater, moveNear, moveFarther),
the possible sequences of updates are investigated to reveal when scheduling conﬂicts might
arise or the order of events may change. Modifying the spatial and temporal properties of
activities has similar implications for scheduling (e.g. moveNear and holdLater can be used
interchangeably to result in a re-ordering of activities). These rules are expressed using SWRL
(Semantic Web Rule language) on top of OWL (Web Ontology Language) to enhance the
expressivity of the developed ontology. In this way, the ontology provides a framework for cre-
ating, managing, and modifying scheduled activities. Spatial aspects are included in the ontol-
ogy through modeling planned trajectories based on the locations of scheduled activities and
the paths that individuals would need to follow when undertaking the scheduled activities.
Locations of events are used to manage and optimize sequences of activities under conditions
of schedule changes, and lay a foundation for more complex scheduling needs, for example,
multi-user and shared schedule applications such as those described by Neutens et al. (2010b)
and Fang et al. (2011). For this work, it is assumed that all events and activities occur at ﬁxed
locations. While the locations of events can change, moving events (e.g. demonstrations,
parades) are not considered here and will be part of future research.

For this work, the events or activities being scheduled are associated with a university
campus, for example, making deliveries to campus buildings or managing meetings, however,
the framework is generalizable to many other different types of schedule applications, for

example, the scheduling of healthcare workers in a hospital setting, sales associates’ schedules
for a company, or for transportation scheduling.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows: the next section discusses related
research on ontologies and planning, and space-time paths and activities of individuals espe-
cially as these topics relate to scheduling. The following section introduces three main classes
for the formal model, Schedule, S_Event, and S_Entry. Sections 4 and 5 discuss these classes
further in the context of an ontology for Scheduling, showing how the classes are related, dis-
cussing the classes and their properties in further detail, and introducing the task ontology,
S_Update that handles modiﬁcations to schedule entries such as reschedule and postpone.
Section 6 discusses the relations between S_Events and the possible conﬂicts that can arise
during scheduling. How trajectories or spatial paths of planned events are incorporated into
the ontological framework and a prototype Geoscheduler are presented in Section 7. Conclu-
sions and future work topics are presented in the ﬁnal section.

2 Related Work

Recent research in the ﬁeld of time geography has focused on different activities in space and
much progress has been made regarding the application of concepts such as space-time prisms
and paths including both physical and virtual (i.e. using information and communication tech-
nologies) spaces. In this recent research, researchers have investigated how connections among
individuals are enhanced in virtual space while they occupy physical locations (Ohmori et al.
2006, Yu and Shaw 2008, Shaw and Yu 2009, Yin et al. 2011). This research tracks the activi-
ties of an individual through space-time and investigates how individuals can inﬂuence their
environment even beyond their physical presence. This work connects well with the ideas pre-
sented in this article, since entries in a schedule and how they evolve over time may be the
result of the kinds of interactions that these studies describe. Through interactions in physical
and virtual space, people make decisions about their activities and how much time they will
spend doing various tasks.

Designing ontological frameworks has highlighted the role of different levels of ontologies
based on their level of generality (Guarino 1998), giving rise to the distinction between top-
level ontologies and domain and task ontologies. Recently this has been applied to modeling
different spaces, such as indoor and outdoor spaces where, for example, domain ontologies
(e.g. indoor or I-Space, and outdoor or O-Space) and task ontologies (e.g. navigation tasks)
are designed to model different microworlds rather than using a single comprehensive ontol-
ogy (Yang and Worboys 2011). These different ontologies are linked through inheritance rela-
tionships where properties are inherited from upper levels to lower levels of the ontology
framework. In this work, we take a similar approach and employ domain, application, and
task ontologies in a framework to support modeling calendar transactions.

Research on ontologies by investigators working on the foundational ontology, DOLCE, have
investigated the possibility of a plan ontology referred to as the DOLCE+DnS Plan Ontology that
focuses on tasks, their sequencing, and the necessary controls applied to the tasks (Gangemi et al.
2004). In this work, a plan is a description of a conceptualization that encompasses one or many
tasks for a domain, one or many roles held by one or many agents, and at least one goal. Tasks can
be scheduled tasks if they have a temporal parameter, or sequential if they have a successor rela-
tion. Plan ontologies have also been considered for military tasks (Hung et al. 2004) where they are
used for military course of action planning. Further related research has involved a possible exten-
sion to DOLCE that is based on an ontology of information objects. An information object is a

socially constructed object that expresses a conceptualization that can vary among individuals, and
be realized in different manners. For example, alpine landscape is an information object that can be
realized as a digital image with varying semantic information (e.g. where and when the image was
taken) (Gangemi et al. 2004). These ideas on information objects are similar to how we envision a
schedule entry, as the conceptualization of the S_Event will carry certain semantics for an indi-
vidual (that will differ among individuals).

Mobile applications are being designed with more emphasis on personalized and contex-
tualized responses to queries (Yu and Spaccapietra 2010). Research on location-based services
including mobile applications considers how ontologies are used to provide dynamic informa-
tion to a user based on the semantics of a situation. Flame2008 is a mobile application that
was built for visitors to Beijing during the 2008 Olympic Games (Weibenberg et al. 2004). As
part of this research, if a user is watching an event at a stadium and it is lunchtime, for
example, the system can provide suggestions for eating lunch at the stadium. This previous
work on personalized mobile applications involves planning and situation-aware context mod-
eling. The present study extends these ideas into the realm of scheduling.

3 Three Classes to Start

The discussion begins by outlining three classes that serve as key classes for an ontology to
support modeling scheduled events and the movements between these events. The three basic
classes are S_Event, Schedule, and S_Entry. S_Events represent the planned activities that are
represented in a schedule. S_Events include attributes name (name), location (loc), start time
(st), end time (et), and date (date) that model the dynamic happenings that occur in a domain,
for example, a university campus. Examples of S_Events include attending a lecture or a ﬁtness
class, going to a meeting, or a delivery of soda and snacks to a campus diner. S_Events are
assumed here to be durative.

A Schedule is the repository for all the different kinds of events and activities that occur in
a domain and that need to be managed over time. Schedules are timetables of, for example, the
deliveries of goods to various buildings on campuses, as well as the activities of individuals.
Entries in a schedule are created and manipulated according to the space-time occurrence of
events that are relevant. This work assumes that an individual manages a single schedule, but
multiple schedules would be possible, and future work will consider sharing and linking sched-
ules among individuals, such as was modeled in Fang et al. (2011). Schedules have owners
(owner), i.e. individuals that create and manage a schedule and an identiﬁer (id).

Another key class for this model is the class S_Entry. An S_Entry represents the S_Events
that an individual wishes to manage in a Schedule. S_Entries have attributes name (pname),
planned location (ploc), planned start time (pst), planned end time (pet), and planned date
(pdate). Members of class S_Entry are created by the scheduler, and can also be modiﬁed as
necessary as plans change (e.g. the location or time of an activity might change).

These three classes play a signiﬁcant role for modeling scheduling tasks. In the next
section, we describe how these classes ﬁt into an ontology for scheduling applications, particu-
larly the task ontology that supports modiﬁcations to schedules, a key aspect needed for suc-
cessful scheduling in a dynamic environment.

categories or universals” (http://www.ifomis.org/bfo/overview). The ontology framework
follows Guarino (1998), who describes integrating multiple ontologies that are organized
according to their level of generality, i.e. upper level, domain, task and application ontologies.
Domain and task ontologies describe the vocabulary related to a ﬁeld or realm and associated
tasks, while application ontologies describe concepts depending on both a particular ﬁeld and
a task. These different ontologies work together for modeling tasks and the ontologies are
linked to each through participation and inheritance relationships (Figure 1). For this work,
the domain ontology includes classes that refer to the types of activities that are associated
with a university campus, i.e. the dynamics that serve as the source for S_Events. S_Events
form a subsumption hierarchy with the more general class Event that is linked with an upper-
level ontology, in this case, the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), an open source foundational
ontology (http://www.ifomis.org/bfo/).

The application ontology includes classes that relate to scheduling (classes Schedule and
S_Entry). Closely linked to the application ontology through a participation relation is the task
ontology that includes class S_Update and its subclasses. The task ontology classes together
model possible manipulations and modiﬁcations of a schedule (Figure 1).

This ontology draws on upper level ontology elements continuant and occurrent (http://
www.ifomis.org/bfo/) (Figure 2). Continuants refer to entities described in BFO as SNAP enti-
ties that exist wholly if they exist at all, and endure through time while keeping their identity,
for example, a building or a road. SNAP entities are commonly modeled in a GIS as objects.
Occurrents describe dynamics including events or processes, i.e. entities that have temporal
parts, such as a trafﬁc jam or running a race. In BFO, occurrents model SPAN entities, and
provide a means for describing dynamics in an ontology. The different activities that are
ongoing in a domain (e.g. classes, meetings, going to the gym, delivering a new computer to an
academic department) are treated here as S_Events. S_Event is a subclass of Event (also
referred to as the temporal boundary of process in BFO) and is an occurrent class in the ontol-
ogy (Figure 2a). The tracking of S_Events is handled through a Schedule that is modeled in the
ontology as a continuant class. Schedules are composed of S_Entries (Figure 2b). The creation
and modiﬁcation of schedule entries is handled by the task ontology S_Update. In this work,

5 Interactions Between Individuals and Schedules

Interactions with schedules occur by inserting new entries or modifying previously created
entries. For this research, we focus on the scheduling of activities on a campus and the naviga-
tion that arises from undertaking these events. Interacting with schedules is accomplished
through occurrent class S_Update. S_Update involves different kinds of subtasks that can
insert a new entry (create), remove an existing entry (delete), or change the schedule (resched-
ule, change date, change location) (Figure 3). The scheduling subtask creates an S_Entry and
values are assigned to attributes pname, pst, pet, pdate, and ploc of this class. Rescheduling
refers to altering the planned start or end time of an S_Entry that occurs when an S_Event is
moved up (holdSooner) or held later that same day (holdLater). Holdsooner captures four dif-
ferent cases where the start time of an S_Entry is moved so that it begins earlier, while the sub-
sequent end time remains the same, occurs earlier, or occurs later, depending on whether the
duration of the event is changed. HoldLater represents the converse cases where the planned
start time of an S_Entry is moved so that it begins later, while the subsequent planned end time
either remains the same or also occurs later. ChangeDate means that the date of the entry is
altered, capturing that
the S_Event starts on an earlier day than originally scheduled
(moveUp), or at a later date (postpone). ChangeLoc refers to modiﬁcations to the entry needed
when the place of activity is changed, such as cases where the event is moved closer to the indi-
vidual’s location (moveNearer) or to a more distant location (moveFarther). An S_Entry may
be deleted if an activity is not going to be held, and in this case, values for planned start time,
end time, and planned date of the entry are removed from the schedule.

The ontology classes represented as OWL classes and the relations between classes are
represented as OWL object properties. The task Create takes the elements of an S_Entry
(pname, pst, pet, pdate, ploc) and returns an S_Entry. Note that two S_entries representing the
same S_event will assume the same identity (Table 1). In this work, an entry may be modiﬁed

and evolve over time, or new entries may be created. The name of the entry is used to denote
identity (i.e. the same name denotes one entry). Delete removes an S_Entry from the schedule.
Deleting an S_Entry describes cases where the S_Event is no longer relevant for the schedule.

SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) is an OWL-based rule language that provides users
with the abilities to express semantics that cannot be expressed using OWL alone, and sup-
ports reasoning with an ontology (http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/). In this work,
SWRL is used to capture the underlying semantics among different types of S_Updates. A
SWRL rule contains antecedent and consequent terms, both of which consist of conjunctions
of atoms. An atom is formed by a predicate symbol and arguments p(arg1,arg2 . . .). Predicate
symbols can include OWL classes, object properties and data types. Arguments can be OWL
instances, data values or variables referring to them. SWRL rules are created to represent the
semantics underlying different types of S_Updates to entries. There are three main groups,
Reschedule, ChangeDate, and ChangeLoc (Table 1). Reschedule rules, including holdLater,
holdSooner, endLater, and endSooner, express the semantics of different ways to modify the
temporal aspects of a schedule on a speciﬁc day using data properties of two S_Entries as well
as SWRL temporal built-ins, e.g. before and after. ChangeDate rules capture the semantic of
altering the date of an activity by comparing PlannedDate of two entries. ChangeLoc rules
represent the spatial semantics in scheduling by comparing the location data property and dis-
tances for two entries.

To illustrate how the SWRL rules work, consider the rule for reschedule (Table 1, line 3).
In this example, ?en1 and ?en2 are variables representing two S_Entries, while ?t1 and ?t2 are
two data values for the PlannedStartTime. The sameIdentity(?en1, ?en2) clause states ?en1 and
?en2 represent the same S_event, but that they are two separate entries in the schedule
(Table 1, line 1). PlannedStartTime(?en1, ?t1) states that ?en1 has a PlannedStartTime with the
value of ?t1. Temporal:notEqual(?t1, ?t2) represents a temporal built-in for SWRL that com-

pares two timestamps, ?t1 and ?t2. For Reschedule(?en2) all the antecedent terms are satisﬁed
and ?en2 is reasoned to be a rescheduled entry. These rules test what updates have been
applied to an S_Entry.

Sequences of S_Events in a schedule require a spatiotemporal buffer of a certain size
between events so that enough time is allowed to travel between events. If two events or activi-
ties are near one another (e.g. in this work within 1/2 mile (see Section 8)), the duration of time
between events can be kept to a minimum. The exact distances and amounts of time that must
be allowed depend on certain instance-level requirements such as travel mode (e.g. walking or
campus bus) and trafﬁc levels.

6 Relations between S_Entries

When multiple entries are scheduled, changes to the starting or ending time of entries (i.e.
holdSooner/holdLater and endSooner/endLater) affect the relations among entries (Table 2).
Allen’s (1983) temporal interval calculus can be applied to model the relations among entries
represented in a schedule. These relations change when alterations occur with respect to the
timing of entries (Allen 1983). For example, assume that one entry (entry1) is in the schedule
before another (entry2) such that the two entries are disjoint in the schedule. Changes to the
schedule involving entry2 might result in it now conﬂicting with entry1, a situation that could
present problems to an individual wishing to attend both activities. In this work, it is assumed
that given a pair of entries, the later entry is rescheduled, while no changes are made to the
ﬁrst (earlier) entry, although we recognize the possibility of the ﬁrst entry being rescheduled as
well. A conﬂict between two S_Entries arises when they meet, overlap, one S_Entry starts the
other, one S_Entry ﬁnishes the other or one S_Entry occurs during another S_Entry. The
inverses of the previously mentioned interval relations also result in a conﬂict.

Basically, when an entry is moved in a schedule, the entries either continue to be disjoint
with no conﬂict between them, or a conﬂict arises (i.e. two entries fall into one of the above
conﬂict categories). Using SWRL, we can represent a conﬂict situation where entry1(en1) and
entry2(en2) overlap as:

S_Entry(?en1) (cid:2) S_Entry(?en2) (cid:2) differentIdentity(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) PlannedStart-
Time(?en1, ?t1) (cid:2) PlannedEndTime(?en1, ?t2) (cid:2) PlannedStartTime(?en2, ?t3) (cid:2)
PlannedEndTime(?en2, ?t4) (cid:2) temporal:overlaps(?t1, ?t2, ?t3, ?t4) -> temporalCon-
ﬂicts(?en1, ?en2)

The temporal extension of SWRL captures the set of Allen’s interval relations, so the other
types of conﬂict can be captured by a similar rule. There is a special case where two entries can
change order. If entry2 is held sufﬁciently earlier and ended sufﬁciently earlier such that it now
occurs in the schedule prior to entry1, then there is a ﬂip in the order of events. We can express
this occurrence using SWRL as:

differentIdentity(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) PlannedEndTime(?en1, ?t1) (cid:2) PlannedStartTime(?en2,
?t2) (cid:2) temporal:before(?t1, ?t2) -> plannedBefore(?en1, ?en2)

The spatial corollary of these rescheduling changes occurs when the location of S_Events
are altered. If the change in location is moveNearer, typically this will increase the available
time between events, since the travel time is likely (although perhaps not always) reduced.
With moveNearer, the possibility of a conﬂict arising is minimized. If the change in location is
moveFarther, the effect is to reduce the amount of time between events, since the travel time
will usually increase. When this type of change occurs, there may be insufﬁcient time to stay
until the end of the ﬁrst event and still arrive on time to the second event, due to insufﬁcient
time to travel between them. Indeed, the locations of S_Events may not be completely inde-
pendent of the locations of neighboring S_Events (i.e. those events immediately before or
after), as a scheduler may alter the location so that an activity happens nearer to the prior
event or to the following event (Neutens et al. 2010b, Fang et al. 2011). In this case, the

change in location results in more time being available for the scheduler, possibly improving
space-time connectivity. In reality, the location and times of S_Entries will be altered frequently
to avoid conﬂicts among activities, and modifying the space and time properties of S_Events is
used to manage scheduled activities. For example, if an individual does not have enough time
to arrive on time at a meeting across town, she can choose to hold the meeting later or move
the meeting place nearer.

7 Spatiotemporal Representation of a Schedule

The planned movement of a person between scheduled activities is represented in the ontology
as an S_Trajectory. Since we are concerned here with the planned trajectory (i.e. an informa-
tion object), this class is also modeled as a continuant class (Figure 4). In this work, S_Entries
are partOf a S_trajectory, and S_trajectory is a subclass of class PlannedSTSetting, i.e. the rep-
resentation of the spatiotemporal region in which the trajectory exists (Worboys and Hornsby
2004). As shown in Figure 4, these two classes are also part of the application ontology. An
S_Trajectory has one scheduled beginning (S_Begin), end (S_end), and many possible sched-
uled stops (S_Stop) (Yan et al. 2008, Stewart Hornsby and Li 2009). Furthermore, each
S_Stop, S_Begin, and S_End isA S_Entry. In this way, entries act as the boundaries of the
S_Trajectory, and shape the planned routes generated by a schedule.

Given these fundamentals, the functionality of a system for handling schedules can be
demonstrated illustrating the opportunities for representing and analyzing the spatiotemporal
properties of planned events and activities.

7.1 Viewing S_Events in a Geoscheduler

Using Google Maps API and an open source timeline widget developed to visualize temporal
data (http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/), a prototype Geoscheduler has been designed to
test the representation of planned activities and support spatiotemporal scheduling applica-
tions. Developed in Javascript, the Geoscheduler links a Google Maps view with a schedule
timeline (Figure 5). The prototype supports users interacting with the viewer from a browser
and updates S_Entries in real time. Elements of the viewer include a base map showing loca-
tions of entries and planned trajectories or paths among activities, and a timeline viewer repre-
senting times and durations of S_Entries in a schedule. Besides providing a web-based spatial

exists where the times for one event overlaps the times of another event that is held elsewhere on
campus

visualization for all the entries in a schedule, Google Maps API also offers a module for spatio-
temporal analysis, including distance calculation, route planning, and travel time estimation.
This feature is important for connecting the spatial and temporal components of the applica-
tion. Based on the spatial information about S_Entries (i.e. planned locations), the viewer can
dynamically calculate route information and estimate time for travel, that when coupled with
temporal information, can help a scheduler with managing their activities. Meanwhile, the
analysis result will also be synchronized on both map and timeline, providing users with a spa-
tiotemporal view of their schedule.

Entries are classiﬁed according to the schedule updates that have been applied (e.g. hold-
Sooner, postpone, reschedule, etc.), and the viewer represents S_Trajectories that connect

Spatiotemporal Scheduling of Individual Activities

S_Entries, showing distance and time information about the planned routes between activities.
The viewer represents scheduled activities with respect to the current time, capturing past and
future scheduled events, and supporting visual inspection of a schedule as it evolves over time.
Ideally, space-time connectivity between scheduled activities should be maximized such
that there are no awkward gaps (wasted opportunities), or conﬂicts between activities, etc.
Recommendations to the user can be automatically generated if any conﬂicts between entries
arise. While create, reschedule, changeDate, changeLoc and delete can be applied to an entry
to optimize the management of activities, the actions of individuals are frequently the drivers
for these updates. For example, if two activities overlap temporally, the user will not be able to
attend both activities, and must choose which one to attend (Figure 5). In this example, an
appointment at the hospital overlaps the time of a meeting elsewhere on campus and given the
overlap, a conﬂict arises in the schedule. The absence of a trajectory connecting entries to
others in the schedule signiﬁes planned activities that are inaccessible given other entries in the
schedule. In this case, an entry can be rescheduled or moved, for example, to later in the day
or moved nearer to a previous event.

7.2 Modeling Events Close in Space or Time

S_Entries may model events that are close to each other in time, but spatially may be too
distant or unreachable, making attending both events impossible (unless an event can be held
later or moved nearer) (Figure 6). For this work, when an S_update on one S_entry causes a
conﬂict with a second S_entry update actions are recommended on the later S_entry by
default. These recommendations will be generated automatically as a notiﬁcation, for example,
on a mobile device. For example, the case where an appointment (entryB) is scheduled after a
seminar (entryA), and entryA and entryB are spatially distant but temporally close, the recom-
mended options for a user are to delete entryB, move entryB nearer, or hold entryB later
(Table 2). Since SWRL does not support negation or disjunction, each case is represented with
a separate rule. This semantic is expressed formally in SWRL as:

differentIdentity(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) PlannedLocation(?en1, ?l1) (cid:2) PlannedLocation(?en2,
?l2) (cid:2) Distance(?dis, ?l1, ?l2) (cid:2) swrlb:greaterThan(?dis,distanceThreshold) -> spa-
tialDistant(?en1, ?en2)
differentIdentity(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) PlannedEndTime(?en1, ?t1) (cid:2) PlannedStartTime(?en2,
?t2) (cid:2) temporal:duration(?d, ?t1, ?t2,temporal:minutes) (cid:2) swrlb:lessThan(?d,temporal-
Threshold) -> temporalClose(?en1, ?en2)
PlannedBefore(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) spatialDistant(?en1, ?en2) -> recommendDelete(?en2)
PlannedBefore(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) spatialDistant(?en1, ?en2) -> recommendHoldLater(?en2)
PlannedBefore(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) spatialDistant(?en1, ?en2) -> recommendMoveNearer
(?en2)
PlannedBefore(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) temporalClose(?en1, ?en2) -> recommendDelete(?en2)
PlannedBefore(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) temporalClose(?en1, ?en2) -> recommendHoldLater(?en2)
PlannedBefore(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) temporalClose(?en1, ?en2) -> recommendMoveNearer
(?en2)

A derived rule spatialDistant that is based on spatiotemporal relations between entries in
the schedule, represents a domain-dependent property for reasoning about travel distances. A
distance threshold is compared to travel distance to determine whether entries are planned at

Figure 6 Two S_Entries are temporally close but spatially distant

destinations near or far. Depending on the travel mode (e.g. walking, campus bus), the dis-
tance threshold equals the distance an individual can be expected to travel during the temporal
gap between two activities. Likewise, a temporal threshold is needed for a temporalClose rule.
The temporal threshold also depends on the travel mode. Note that temporalClose and spa-
tialDistant rules actually result in similar schedule outcomes, just from different perspectives,
one from the temporal perspective and the other from the spatial.

Alternatively, activities may occur near to each other on campus, but with a large tempo-
ral gap between them. In this S_Trajectory, entryB and entryD are scheduled on one side of the
river while entryC is planned to be held on the other side. By adjusting the schedule, the later
entry (i.e. entryD) can be rescheduled (holdSooner), so that the schedule becomes more effec-
tive and an individual can maximize efﬁciency with respect to their use of space and time.
Using SWRL this is represented as:

differentIdentity(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) PlannedLocation(?en1, ?l1) (cid:2) PlannedLocation(?en2,
?l2) (cid:2) Distance(?dis, ?l1, ?l2) (cid:2) swrlb:lessThan(?dis,distanceThreshold) -> spatial-
Close(?en1, ?en2)

plannedBefore(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) spatialClose(?en1, ?en2) (cid:2) temporalDistant(?en1, ?en2)
-> recommendHoldSooner(?en2)

In order to model spatialClose, a distance threshold has to be set. In the campus scenario,
a distance threshold of within a 1/2 mile is used to represent close distances. For other activity
domains, the distance threshold can be set according to the travel mode of the owner of the
schedule. Likewise, temporalDistant is a rule used to determine whether the interval between
two entries is greater than a temporal threshold, indicating where entries may be spaced too
far apart in the schedule. For this work, a temporal threshold of one hour is used as a working
temporal threshold. From this discussion, the possibilities relating to spatiotemporal schedul-
ing illustrate how temporal and spatial aspects of scheduling create both challenges (e.g. over-
lapping events or distant events), and also beneﬁts (create more free time, reduce wasted time,
or avoid long travel distances).

8 Conclusions and Future Work

This work presents a framework for the spatiotemporal scheduling of events and activities that
an individual undertakes on a regular basis, and that requires management by a schedule. The
framework has been developed using an ontological approach that describes key classes,
Schedule, S_Event and S_Entry and the relations that hold between the classes. Classes in the
ontology are either continuants modeling object-based entities or occurrents capturing dynam-
ics and events. The framework links a domain ontology (campus events) with an application
ontology (scheduling), and a task ontology (S_Update). Including the planned trajectories
formed by scheduled entries in the framework allows spatial aspects of scheduling to be
accounted for in the model. SWRL rules formalize the set of possible schedule updates and
show the combinations of updates that underlie common schedule modiﬁcations. Developing a
formal model for spatiotemporal scheduling gives a foundation for developing schedulers that
maximize possible space-time connections, i.e. ensuring that it is possible to participate in the
events and activities that are most important, reduce conﬂicts in the schedule, and make more
efﬁcient use of time where possible. The prototyping of a Geoscheduler has afforded an oppor-
tunity to test the ontology-driven framework in an implemented environment. Further testing
will be conducted to ensure that updates, including trajectory updates, and conﬂict-handling
work as expected, and the development of recommendation notiﬁcations.

This work identiﬁes many interesting aspects relating to spatiotemporal scheduling espe-
cially how scheduling affects spatiotemporal accessibility in a domain, relevant for transporta-
tion and urban applications, for example, as well as designing personal
location-based
services. Developing a system that provides automatic adjustments or modiﬁcations to a sched-
ule to maximize connectivity between activities could be very beneﬁcial for improving space-
time accessibility. At the same time, an individual will likely want some control over how their
schedule evolves. Building support for both cases is necessary. Next steps are to extend the
work to involve other individuals’ schedules so that events can be shared and synchronized as
desired. There are many open research questions, including extending S_Entry modeling to
include emotions or preferences associated with events (e.g. a person enjoys attending a certain

event and does not want to miss it, while strongly disliking other activities), including addi-
tional spatial information, for example, information on possible barriers to movement or
trafﬁc information, and moving events (e.g. demonstrations or parades), and developing a spa-
tiotemporal notiﬁcation system necessary to support scheduling by sending out alerts stem-
ming from schedule changes. The task ontology S_Update has been developed to be domain
independent, however, it would be possible to extend the task ontology and S_Update class
with domain or application speciﬁc kinds of tasks. This will also result in the task ontology
being more closely integrated with the domain ontology offering more opportunity for better
and easier integration of these two models.

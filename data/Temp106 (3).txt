Abstract

This article outlines a semi‐autonomous approach for using 

a fusion of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and optical 

remote sensing data to identify and measure small impound‐

ments (SIs) and their dams. Quantifying such water bodies 

as hydrologic network features is critical for ecosystem and 

species  conservation,  emergency  management,  and  water 

resource planning; however, such features are incompletely 

mapped at national and state levels. By merging an airborne 

LiDAR‐derived  point  cloud  with  a  normalized  water  index 

using airborne optical imagery we demonstrate an improve‐

ment  upon  single‐source  methods  for  identifying  these 

water bodies; classification accuracies increased over 10% 

by using this multi‐source fusion method. Furthermore, the 

method presented here illustrates a cost‐effective pathway 

to  improve  the  National  Inventory  of  Dams  (NID)  and  in‐

cludes a framework for estimating dam heights, with results 

showing  strong  correlations  between  derived  dam  heights 

and those recorded in the NID (r=.78). With the steady in‐

crease  in  available  LiDAR  coverage,  the  87,000+  dams  in 

the  NID  could  be  updated  using  this  technique,  a  method 

which could also be expanded for global inventories of SIs 

and dams.

Dams of all sizes are a ubiquitous feature of the river and stream network of the United States. From the main 

stems of major rivers such as the Tennessee and the Columbia to even small headwater tributaries, nearly every 

stream in the U.S. has been impounded, often more than once. Of the 5.2 million kilometers of streams in the 

coterminous U.S. that were inventoried by the U.S. National Park Service, fewer than 2% were judged as “high 

quality”, with only 42 rivers greater than 200 km in length having substantially free‐flowing conditions (Benke, 

1990). As of this writing, 87,359 dams were contained in the National Inventory of Dams (NID) of the U.S. Army 

Corps of Engineers, a database which includes dams considered to be: (1) “high hazard;” (2) at least 1.8 m high with 
a storage capacity of at least 62,000 m3; or (3) 7.6 m high with at least 19,000 m3 reservoir capacity. High as that 

number is, it does not account for the vast majority of dams and artificial water bodies in the U.S. which fall below 

the Army Corps of Engineers's requirements, a number which has been estimated to be around 2 million (Graf, 

1993; Smith, Renwick, Bartley, & Buddemeier, 2002).

Accurate data about the distribution and characteristics of such smaller dams and their reservoirs, which are 

here referred to as small impoundments (SIs), are important for purposes of species and ecosystem conservation, 

emergency management, and water resource planning. SIs have significant effects upon aquatic and riparian eco‐

systems through habitat fragmentation (Chin, Laurencio, & Martinez, 2008; Dunham, Vinyard, & Rieman, 1997; 

Wofford, Gresswell, & Banks, 2005), reduction in total water availability (Ignatius & Stallins, 2011), and habitat 

conversion and degradation (Anderson, Freeman, & Pringle, 2006; Deitch, Merenlender, & Feirer, 2013; Helms, 

Werneke,  Gangloff,  Hartfield,  &  Feminella,  2011;  Mantel,  Muller,  &  Hughes,  2010;  O'Connor,  2001;  Phillips  & 

Johnston, 2004; Poff & Hart, 2002). SIs can present considerable hazards. Dam failure is frequently the result of 

the failure of spillways that were designed to handle at most a 100‐year flood, and many small dams do not have 

spillways adequate to handle even that amount. Given that the likelihood of a 100‐year flood occurring during the 

lifespan of a dam designed to last for 50 years is 39.5%, the risk of small dam failure is orders of magnitude greater 

than that of large dams (National Research Council (U.S.), 2012). Since small dams fail so much more frequently 

than larger ones, they tend to be responsible for most of the annual cost of dam failures; furthermore, cascading 

failures of many small dams during a flood event has caused the failure of larger, more hazardous dams down‐

stream (Lewis & Harrison, 2002; Pisaniello, 2009). For hydrological analysis and flood forecasting, the location 

and average free storage (amount of storage capacity above normal reservoir levels) of SIs need to be accounted 

for. Finally, as watershed‐level planning and management of water resources become more common, information 

about SIs will  be needed for such things as assessing current storage capacity available for irrigation needs or 

estimating water losses from evaporation.

Since  its  development,  there  have  been  concerns  about  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  NID, 

which relies upon reports from state agencies and is not updated annually. In 2008, for example, the state of 

Washington conducted a survey to identify unpermitted dams that should be in the inventory and regulated 

by the state (Johnson, 2011). The survey identified 28 dams classified as high‐hazard dams (including 11 that 

had  safety  deficiencies  requiring  immediate  attention)  and  11  classified  as  significant‐hazard  dams.  In  turn, 
research conducted at the University of Georgia on the 7,500 km2 Upper Oconee River watershed found more 

than 5,400 impoundments, whereas only 276 dams were listed in the NID (Cowie, 2002). A remote sensing 

approach is an attractive way to address gaps and inaccuracies in dam inventories; however, current methods 

of automated water body identification and extraction using multi‐spectral imagery (MSI) are not able to dif‐

ferentiate dammed impoundments from other types of water surfaces. Recently, there has been an increasing 

body of research showing the effectiveness of fusing light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data with MSI to aid 

in many classification tasks, including classifying wetland areas (Lang & McCarty, 2009; Wu & Lane, 2017). We 

propose a method using a LiDAR–MSI data fusion approach to identify impounded reservoirs and measure the 

height of their dams.

The purpose of this research is to create a semi‐automated methodology that combines aerial LiDAR data with 

high‐spatial‐resolution MSI to identify and characterize SI. We seek to create a procedure which can be provide 

a relatively inexpensive first estimate of the size and distribution of SIs. To accomplish this, multispectral aerial 

imagery  data  and  a  LiDAR  pulse  return  density  raster  are  first  used  in  combination  to  identify  water  surfaces 

and extract them as water body features in a GIS. With a LiDAR‐derived digital elevation model (DEM) and U.S. 

Geological Survey hydrographic data, we then used a decision‐tree framework, which splits input data according 

to a series of inductive rules, to classify these identified water bodies as potential SIs (as opposed to off‐stream 

storage  ponds,  wetlands,  etc.)  and  estimate  the  structural  height  of  their  dams  in  a  semi‐automated  fashion.

this is the first published methodology for detecting impoundments as distinct from other water bodies and ex‐

tracting dams as terrain features. As such, this method has an applications sector which stands to benefit greatly 

from its adoption. Second, this approach contributes to the state of the science for leveraged remote sensing of 

the Earth surface using multiple sensors, demonstrating the viability of a multimodal approach for a classification 

task that cannot be effectively accomplished using either MSI or LiDAR alone.

Remote sensing, particularly through multispectral satellite imagery, has been a crucial tool for mapping water 

bodies  and  delineating  shorelines  since  the  launch  of  the  Earth  Resources  Technology  Satellite  (later  renamed 

Landsat 1) in 1972. In that year, NASA started to systematically locate and map water bodies for inclusion in the 

NID by applying a density slice technique to one of the Multispectral Scanner's near infra‐red (NIR) bands. Since 

water strongly absorbs NIR energy, all but very shallow water bodies are almost completely black when viewed in 

NIR. While this single‐band method works well in relatively clear water, sediment‐laden (turbid) waters are more 

difficult to distinguish. As the turbidity of a water body increases, so does its reflectance of visible light, particu‐

larly in the green region. A common way of dealing with this issue is by comparing the brightness in multiple bands 

using a normalized difference index. By dividing the difference in brightness for two bands by the total brightness 

for both bands, normalized difference indices both enhance the contrast of a land cover of interest and reduce 

the variance in brightness values due to differences in illumination conditions. Over the past few decades, sev‐

eral normalized difference indices have been developed for a variety of purposes and remote sensing platforms 

(Campbell & Wynne, 2011; Lillesand, Kiefer, & Chipman, 2015). Multiple indices have been developed for use with 

the remote sensing of water resources; these include the normalized difference water index NDWI (McFeeters, 

1996), the modified normalized difference water index mNDWI (Xu, 2006), the automated water extraction index 

AWEInsh (Feyisa, Meilby, Fensholt, & Proud, 2014), for areas where topographic shadowing is not prevalent, and 

tasseled  cap  wetness,  TCW  (Baig,  Zhang,  Shuai,  &  Tong,  2014;  Crist  &  Cicone,  1984).  The  NDWI  is  one  of  the 

most commonly used indices for surface water identification (Chen, Su, Li, & Sun, 2009; d'Andrimont, Marlier, & 

Defourny, 2017; McFeeters, 1996; Xu, 2006) and as such is the one employed in this study. By comparing the dif‐

fering reflectance in green and NIR bands, as shown in: 

NDWI =

Green − NIR
Green + NIR

(1)

NDWI values tend to be high for both clear and turbid water, reducing omission error. A weakness of this and other 

optical methods, however, is that developed surfaces, especially asphalt, and areas in shadow are both spectrally sim‐

ilar to water, increasing commission error for scenes in urban areas and those at a high resolution (d'Andrimont et al., 

2017; Xu, 2006). One way to increase classification accuracy over pure optical methods is to incorporate LiDAR data 

in the classification task.

As aerial LiDAR data have become more widely available in the past two decades, its use in the identifica‐

tion of water surfaces and shorelines has become a focus for research activity (Gillrich & Lichvar, 2014; Lang & 

McCarty, 2009; Parent, Volin, & Civco, 2015). Several methods for the classification of water surfaces from aerial 

LiDAR  data  have  been  developed,  usually  employing  some  combination  of  elevation  data  derived  from  LiDAR 

point clouds (LPCs) and the information derived from the physical characteristics of the interaction of the laser 

pulses with water. One method involved binning elevation data to look for local spikes in elevation frequencies 

that indicated a large flat surface. This, coupled with mean intensity data, was used to create breaklines for water 

features (Toscano, 2015). Other methods have also used local neighborhood information about different combi‐

nations of elevation points, curvature, surface roughness, point density, and the flight lines of the scanner aircraft

(Höfle, Vetter, Pfeifer, Mandlburger, & Stötter, 2009; Sangireddy, 2011; Smeeckaert, Mallet, David, Chehata, & 

Ferraz, 2013, Supplement C; Wei, Yang, Jiang, & Cao, 2016).

In addition to elevation data and neighborhood characteristics, the radiometric properties of LiDAR can be 

exploited to delineate land–water interfaces. Since topographic LiDAR scanners typically use NIR laser beams, 

water only a few decimeters deep can absorb most or all beam energy, leading to a characteristic “dropout” in 

pulse returns. On the other hand, unlike passive MSI in the NIR band, the active pulses of LiDAR can be reflected 

off calm water surfaces, which act like a mirror. Since this is specular reflection, only pulses emitted at low inci‐

dent angles, typically less than 10∘, will be reflected back toward the scanner; therefore, even calm water surfaces 

will produce characteristic dropout, unless they are both small and located directly under the scanner flight path 

(Gillrich & Lichvar, 2014; Höfle et al., 2009). While not all open water will fail to produce LiDAR returns, large gaps 
in an LPC, greater than 50 m2, are almost invariably due to water surfaces, making such LiDAR shadows valuable 

as an input for land cover classification (Höfle et al., 2009; Parent et al., 2015).

The spread in the availability and coverage of aerial LiDAR data has also resulted in a great deal of interest in 

incorporating LiDAR as a feature or as ancillary data in land cover classification methods, especially for complex 

urban environments (Chen et al., 2009; Parent et al., 2015; Yan, Shaker, & El‐Ashmawy, 2015). Fusing LiDAR data 

with optical imagery is particularly attractive because it may act both as a complement, by adding information 

about the spectral properties of targets, and as a supplement, by adding derived height data. The former is useful 

for increasing the separability of land cover types and adding information about areas that are shadowed or oc‐

cluded in optical imagery, while the latter is valuable for such tasks as differentiating vegetation types by height 

or  distinguishing  buildings  from  pavement.  LiDAR–optical  fusion  methods  have  been  shown  to  be  specifically 

effective  for  water  surface  identification  (Chen  et  al.,  2009;  d'Andrimont  et  al.,  2017).  We  take  LiDAR–optical 

fusion for water classification by using LiDAR data to classify impoundments as distinct from other water bodies.

but nonetheless contains a variety of land cover types to test the robustness of a feature identification method, 

including, per the 2011 U.S. National Landcover Dataset, urban and suburban developed land (6.4%), as well as 

pasture  (10.2%),  row‐crop  (3.0%),  forest  (54%),  shrub  or  herbaceous  vegetation  (15.5%),  wetlands  (2.1%),  and 

miscellaneous open land (8.8%). Lee County is bisected by the divide between the Tallapoosa and Chattahoochee 

watersheds and, as such, is drained primarily by headwater and low‐order streams.

Our source LiDAR data were acquired in 2014 by a cooperative program between the Lee County government, 

the cities of Auburn and Opelika, and Auburn University. Our MSI data were four‐band, 1 m imagery acquired in 

2013 for the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The LiDAR data were 

provided in the projected coordinate system NAD 1983, U.S. State Plane Alabama East. The LiDAR acquisition 

was performed by the Atlantic Group with a Leica ALS‐70 HP, a topographic aerial laser scanner with a wavelength 

of 1,064 nm, at a precision, defined as the smallest measurable difference, of 0.003 m and a mean point spacing 

of 0.36 m. The LiDAR data were validated by comparison with ground control points, with an average root mean 

square error (RMSE, for all land cover types) of 0.13 m when compared to ground measurements (The Atlantic 

Group, 2014). As the source data were provided in feet, all GIS operations and geometric calculations in this proj‐

ect were done in these units before being converted to metric units for statistical analysis and reporting.

4.2 | Identification and delineation of water features

The  LiDAR‐optical  fusion  method  employed  in  this  study  uses  the  characteristic  dropout  in  NIR  LiDAR  pulse 

returns  as  an  additional  criterion  to  improve  on  the  results  from  using  traditional,  pixel‐based  multispectral 

water surface classification. The advantage of using both the LiDAR return dropout and multispectral imagery 

in classification is that these remote sensing methods can help offset each other's weaknesses. High‐resolution 

multispectral imagery is good for delineating water surfaces; however, it is poor for differentiating water from de‐

veloped surface types such as pavement and rooftops due to the similarity of their spectral signatures. Thus, opti‐

cal methods have a low omission error but a high commission error. Conversely, methods focusing on exploiting 

the radiometric characteristics of topographic LiDAR can exhibit low commission and high omission rates. While 

developed surfaces, such as asphalt, have only a 10–15% reflectance at the NIR wavelengths used for topographic 

LiDAR, a typical high‐density LiDAR acquisition will still get many returned pulses over these surfaces while, at the 

same time, large areas of water produce few, if any, returns (Song, Han, Yu, & Kim, 2002; Yan et al., 2015). Since 

calm water surfaces directly beneath the aerial laser scanner unit can create clusters or strips of returns through 

specular reflection, it is not possible to use these void areas alone to delineate water features. If the water surface 

identified from the relative absence of pulse returns is combined with the water surfaces derived from imagery, 

then delineation of water features can be made both more accurate and more complete than when using either 

type of data alone.

Our method, outlined in Figure 3, begins with raster and point cloud data, which are processed and synthe‐

sized to create a vector feature class of potential SIs. From the LPC, we created a point density raster using pulse 

returns ground and single point returns at a 3 m horizontal resolution. Pixels without pulse returns were classified 

as water and converted to vector format. At the same time, NAIP imagery was used to create an NDWI raster. 

As  originally  described  by  McFeeters  (1996),  NDWI  values  0–1  were  classified  as  water;  however,  as  optimal 

thresholds have been found to vary considerably for different areas and different mixtures of land cover types, 

it is common practice to choose a threshold specific to the area under study (Fisher, Flood, & Danaher, 2016; Ji, 

Zhang, & Wylie, 2009; Zhang et al., 2011). For this study, we used an NDWI raster as the input descriptive feature 

for a maximum likelihood supervised classification, a method that addresses the issue of spectral overlap between 

classes by taking into account the spectral variability within each class. The water surface class was converted to 
vector format, with polygons at least 4,000 m2 in area being exported into a new feature class of LiDAR‐identified 

water surfaces. We considered water features smaller than this to be too small to be significant in this study. We 

discarded any NDWI‐derived polygons that did not intersect with a LiDAR‐derived feature, and then aggregated

stream impoundments and distinguish them from other types of surface water bodies. Water surface 
classifications are first performed separately using MSI and LiDAR data. Intersecting features from both data 
sets are merged to create a new water body feature set. Those water features which also intersect with an 
National Hydrography Dataset flowline are considered potential SIs

the NDWI and LiDAR polygons into a new water surface feature class. Complete visual inspection of the water 

body data set compared with the available NAIP imagery itself verified that all 767 features were actual water 

body surfaces, with all developed surfaces eliminated during the classification process. As this study specifically 

focuses on identifying stream impoundments, we used the high‐resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) 

flowline layer to distinguish potential SIs from other reservoirs. The 493 water features which intersected with 

an NHD flowline were exported to a new feature class of potential SIs. Results from this workflow for a single 

study location are shown in Figure 4, showing the improvements possible through the use of multiple sensors and 

a decision‐tree framework.

4.3 | Identification and measurement of dams

After fusing the LiDAR and multispectral imagery data to identify potential SIs, LiDAR‐based elevation data were 

used to both distinguish SIs from other water surfaces and estimate the height of the identified dams. For this 

study,  elevations  for  points  and  surfaces  were  derived  directly  from  the  LPC  using  an  Esri  LAS  Dataset  while 

slope was calculated from a 3 m horizontal resolution bare‐earth DEM which was created using natural neighbor 

interpolation, a method that has been shown to be both computationally efficient and generally accurate in LiDAR

fusion of these features allows for water surfaces to be identified with greater accuracy and completeness than 
using one data modality alone. Projection: NAD83 UTM 16N

applications (Bater & Coops, 2009). We then identified actual impoundments from the set of potential SIs and 

measured the heights of their dam structures using Python and ArcGIS Desktop 10.4. Figure 5 shows the work‐

flow and an example of its implementation.

The first step in the process to estimate dam height is to select a point on the DEM that can be used to esti‐

mate the elevation of the base of the dam. As this point is either at or close to the junction between the down‐

stream embankment of the dam and the natural surface, we refer to it as a downstream (DS) point. Since a dam 

embankment has a far steeper gradient than a natural stream channel (except at some waterfalls), if one queries 

points along the potential path of a channel downstream of an impoundment (here taken to be the NHD stream 

channel line), one will find the point where the stream resumes its normal channel to be where the gradient be‐

comes minimal. To identify potential DS points for the potential SI database created previously, the DEM cells

that lay within a four‐cell buffer of an NHD blue line and had a calculated slope gradient 3% were sampled. This 

slope threshold was chosen experimentally by starting with an initial value of 1% and increasing the value until 

most low‐gradient stream segments had many potential DS points. Since DEM characteristics such as horizontal 

resolution and degree of smoothing can have significant effects upon slope calculations, this threshold may need 

to be increased or decreased to achieve the best results for a given data set. For each potential SI, the nearest DS 

point that was: (1) at least 2 m below the LiDAR‐derived surface elevation of the water body; and (2) within 90 m 

downstream was selected to represent the elevation of the base of the dam. We chose the vertical threshold to 

exclude commission errors from steep stream segments and the distance threshold to account for the fact that 

a suitable DS point may be a short distance downstream from the actual dam base and for the maximum basal 

width of a small earth dam based upon guidelines given by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the UN Food and 

Agricultural Organization (Stephens, 2010; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2004). If there was no DS point found 

within a reasonable distance of the possible SI, we concluded that either the potential SI was not an impounded 

water body (e.g., a stream segment, wetland, etc.) or its dam was too low to be included in our data set. This step 

provided an additional criterion in the decision tree for classification as an SI. The difference between the highest 

point on a buffered line between the SI and the DS point was then calculated as the estimated structural height of 

the dam, with the maximum value within that buffer serving as the estimated top of the dam structure.

To  compare  the  accuracy  of  the  LiDAR–NDWI  fusion  method  for  classifying  open  water  surfaces  with  using 

NDWI alone, we manually classified all NDWI‐derived features prior to applying the LiDAR dropout features as a 

SWAN and GRIFFIn    |  183

criterion. Through manual interpretation of NAIP imagery and a triangulated irregular network representation of 

the LiDAR data, we assigned each of the 999 NDWI‐derived features to one of six classes: (1) impoundments that 

intersect with a flowline; (2) impoundments that do not intersect with a flowline; (3) developed surfaces (4) artifi‐

cial ponds (5) wetlands; and (6) free‐flowing stream segments. We considered each feature that represents a true 

water surface (i.e., is not a developed surface, such as asphalt or rooftop) to be a correct classification.

We compiled separate error matrices for the water body delineation and dam prediction steps, calculating us‐

er's accuracy, producer's accuracy, F1 score, and total accuracy. User's accuracy is the ratio of correctly classified 
features to all features given that classification. Producer's accuracy is the ratio of correctly classified features 

to the total number of those features in the ground truth data. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the user's 
accuracy and producer's accuracy. Finally, total accuracy is simply the ratio of correctly classified samples to all 

samples.

As shown in Table 1, using the LiDAR dropout data as an additional criterion increased user's accuracy by more 

than 10 percentage points; however, it also resulted in the omission of 3% of the valid water features. Examining 

the LiDAR data for these features, we found that the omission was consistent with the potential for specular re‐

flection to produce LiDAR pulse returns from water discussed in Section 2. Since still water can act like a mirror for 

LiDAR pulses, if a water body is sufficiently small and located directly under one of the flight lines of the scanner 

aircraft, there may be no gap in pulse returns large enough to be considered significant and thus the water body 

will be missed using this method.

We tested the performance of the dam identification and measurement method by first testing its classifica‐

tion accuracy before comparing the LiDAR‐estimated dam heights to the existing dam inventory for Lee County. 

We used the 492 features from the LiDAR–NDWI data set that intersected with a flowline as the input potential 

SIs for our location and measurement method. The primary means we use to distinguish an impoundment from 

other types of open water is to look for a decrease in stream elevation of at least 2 m within a threshold distance 

downstream of the potential SI, as detailed in Section 4.3.

Table 2 shows that this method achieved a user's accuracy of 0.99, filtering out all but four of the unimpounded 

water surfaces. Subsequent examination found that these misclassified features were stream segments directly

waterfalls or cascades, while the false negatives occurred when steep terrain reduced the number of potential 
DS points. Projection: NAD83 UTM 16N

upstream of waterfalls. The false negative rate was 3.4%, with our method failing to identify 16 valid SIs which, 

on closer inspection, we found was a result of a combination of steep terrain immediately below the dam and the 

low resolution of the NHD blue lines in comparison to our DEM. In these instances, the minimal floodplain area 

below the dam meant that there were fewer potential DS points and these points were clustered close to the 

stream bank. When the horizontal error of the NHD blue line is relatively high, these DS points can fall outside the 

flowline buffer. Correct detections, false negatives, and false positives are shown in Figure 6.

To provide a statistically valid analysis of the accuracy of the height estimation method we tested the method 

on Lee County dams which already had heights documented in the NID. Of the 44 dams in the study area with 

previously recorded NID height values, 10 were excluded from the analysis because they were part of a cascade 

dam system or were completely absent from available NAIP imagery. For the remaining 34 dams, heights were 

estimated  from  the  LiDAR  DEM  and  the  results  were  compared.  The  results  of  a  correlation  analysis  showed 

good correspondence between the NID and estimated values, with a Pearson's r = .78, a standard error (RMSE) 

of 1.27 m, and a mean average error (MAE) of 1.08 m. As can be seen in Figure 7, much of the error resulted from 

a few samples, including one instance where the dam height method identified a low‐head spillway instead of 

the maximum crest of the dam and two instances where the NID‐listed height did not correspond with a manual 

examination of the LiDAR terrain data.

Of the 457 dams that were identified using this method, four were false positives and nine were upstream 

parts  of  a  cascade  of  dams  with  their  structural  bases  hidden  by  downstream  impoundments.  Since  we  could 

not accurately estimate the structural heights of these dams, we omitted their heights from the final data set. 

As shown in Figure 8, the remaining 444 dams ranged in height from 2 to 19 m. with a median height of 5 m and 

standard deviation of 2.5 m. Looking at the overall distribution of dam heights, 127, or almost 28%, of the SIs have 

an estimated height of at least 7 m, thus probably warranting a field survey to determine if they should be included 

in the NID, and the majority are at least 5 m tall. The implications of these results are profound in that they start 

to quantify the degree to which the NID might underestimate the number of SIs in the U.S., while suggesting a 

solution which may be implemented to update it.

Accurate information on impoundments, even relatively small ones, is important for hazard assessment, watershed 

planning,  and  species  and  habitat  conservation.  Despite  this,  our  research  shows  that  the  current  inventory  of 

dams within the state of Alabama likely contains only a fraction of the total number of dams in the state. Given 

the prohibitive cost of undertaking ground surveys of impoundments, there is great utility in using remote sens‐

ing to rapidly assess the distribution of potential dams. Multispectral imagery has been successfully employed for 

SWAN and GRIFFIn186  |    

decades in the detection and mapping of water bodies; however, there are limitations in using MSI data alone for 

water classification. The similarity in the spectral characteristics of developed surfaces and shadows to water re‐

sults in commission error, while occlusion by vegetation can lead to omission error around forested shorelines and 

wetlands. The last two decades have seen a rapid increase in the availability and quality of aerial LiDAR data, which 

has stimulated research into methods for using raw LiDAR return data and derived elevation data to increase the 

accuracy and precision of water body extraction. The LiDAR–MSI fusion approach we propose in this work uses 

the difference in return frequency between developed and water surfaces to reduce commission error and derived 

elevation data to both distinguish impoundments from other types of water bodies and reservoirs and estimate 

dam heights. Using Lee County, Alabama as a study area, we have shown that this method can be effective at all 

three of these tasks. By using the spectral characteristics of NIR LiDAR, we correctly excluded developed surfaces, 

increasing user accuracy of water body detection by more than 10% over using MSI alone at the cost of a 3% drop 

in producer accuracy. Similarly, using LiDAR‐derived elevation data allowed us to distinguish impoundments from 

other water bodies with a 99% user accuracy. Finally, we showed that automated dam height estimates from LiDAR 

correspond well with listed dam heights, having a correlation of 0.78 and standard error of 1.27 m.

Using our proposed LiDAR–MSI method, scarce resources can be targeted toward those impoundments most 

likely to present possible hazards. In addition to helping to inventory unsurveyed dams, this method can also be 

applied to update existing GIS dam data sets and correct errors. For instance, it is not uncommon for dams within 

the NID to have incorrect coordinate information, sometimes being located near or on the wrong stream within a 

watershed or even in an entirely different watershed altogether. Different groups have rectified this by snapping 

NID point data to stream data; however, our method can make these features more spatially accurate by directly 

identifying the dam's location along a stream (Goslin, 2005). Our method can also be used to update databases to 

account for dams that have been breached or removed. An additional benefit of this method is that it is efficient 

in terms of time and processing resources. Producing the feature set covering all of Lee County took less than one 

day of processing on an average consumer PC. Furthermore, with little required user input, this method could be 

implemented in a parallel processing workflow to cover a far larger area within a similar amount of time.

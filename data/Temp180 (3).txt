Land use and land cover change (LUCC) is the result of the complex
interactions between behavioural and structural factors (drivers) associated
with the demand, technological capacity, social relations and the nature of
the environment in question. Although no general theory of land use change
exists, different disciplinary theories can help us to analyse aspects of LUCC
in specific situations. However, paradigms and theories applied by the
different disciplines are often difficult to integrate and their specific research
results do not easily combine into an integrated understanding of LUCC.
Geographical approaches often aim to identify the location of LUCC in a
spatially explicit way, while socio-economic studies aim to understand the
processes of LUCC, but often lack spatial context and interactions. The
objective of this study is to integrate process information from a socio-
economic study into a geographical approach. First, a logistic regression
analysis is performed on household survey data from interviews. In this
approach the occurrence of the land use types corn, wet rice and banana is
explained by a set of variables that are hypothesised to be explanatory for
those land use types, with fields as the unit of analysis. The independent
variables consist of household characteristics, like ethnicity and age, and plot
and field information, like tenure, slope and travel time. The results of these
analyses are used to identify key variables explaining land use choice, which
subsequently are also collected at watershed level, using maps, census data
and remote sensing imagery. Logistic regression analysis of
this spatial
dataset, where a ten percent sample of a 50 by 50 m grid was analysed,
shows that the key variables identified in the household analysis are also
important at the watershed level. Important drivers in the study area are,
among others,
slope, ethnicity, accessibility and place of birth. The
differences in the contribution of the variables to the models at household
and watershed level can be attributed to differences in spatial extent and
data representation. Comparing the model with a mainstream geographical
approach indicates
informed by the household
analysis gives a better insight in the actual processes determining land use
than the mainstream geographic approach.

Introduction

Land use and land cover change (LUCC) research has received much attention
during the past decade, because of the pivotal role of LUCC in many urgent issues
like global climatic change, food security, soil degradation and biodiversity (Turner
II et al. 1995, Lambin et al. 2001, Geist and Lambin 2002). LUCC research involves
many disciplines, since it operates at the interface of natural and human sciences.
LUCC is the result of the complex interaction of behavioural and structural factors
associated with the demand, technological capacity, social relations and the nature
of the environment in question. A theory of land use change, therefore, needs to
conceptualise the relation between the driving forces and land use change, relations
among the driving forces, and human behaviour and organisation. Different
disciplinary theories can help us to analyse aspects of land use change in specific
situations. The synthesis of these theories is essential, but the paradigms and
theories applied by the different disciplines are often difficult to integrate and their
specific research results do not easily combine into an integrated understanding of
LUCC. Up to now researchers have not yet succeeded in integrating all disciplines
and complexity of the land use system into an all-compassing theory of land use
change (Verburg et al. 2004a). Conclusions drawn from disciplinary LUCC studies
can vary substantially between disciplines (Lambin et al. 2001), which implies that
the complexity of the land use system as a whole is not completely understood.

From a geographical perspective LUCC studies have been carried out mainly at
national and sub-national level, using available geographic information from maps,
census data and remote sensing. These data are used to construct driving factors of
land use change that are used to explain the location of land use change (Veldkamp
and Fresco 1997, Kok and Veldkamp 2000, Serneels and Lambin 2001, Nelson et al.
2001, Pontius et al. 2001). What is often lacking in these studies is explicitness about
processes and human behaviour. The drivers used are proxies for the processes that
determine land use change. The identified relations between land use change and the
supposed driving factors are valid at the pixel level and do not straightforwardly
translate into the determinants of LUCC at the household level, the level that is
central in decision making. The strength of this geographical approach is its spatial
explicitness, which helps to explain land use pattern, which can be directly used in
geographical modelling approaches (e.g. Pontius et al. 2001, Verburg et al. 2002,
Pijanowski et al. 2002). This approach contrasts with the approach of the social
sciences that generally conduct micro level studies aiming at understanding people–
environment relations (Turner 2003).

Socio-economic studies often focus at the household level to gain insight in the
factors that influence land use decisions. These studies provide information about
decision-making processes and human behaviour. But, in general, they do not
incorporate a spatial component. Therefore, the relation between the households
and the biophysical environment and their interactions and spatial dependencies are
not represented, consequently disregarding the spatial nature of the problem
(Geoghegan et al. 1998).

In literature it is acknowledged that for a better understanding of the land use system
it is important to combine the strengths of both approaches and to come to an
integrated approach by linking the social and geographic disciplines (Liverman et al.
1998, Walsh and Crews-Meyer 2002, Fox et al. 2003). The process that enhances the
link between the social sciences and the geographical sciences is often referred to as
‘socialising the pixel’ and ‘pixelising the social’ (Geoghegan et al. 1998).

‘Socialising the pixel’ can be described as moving form patterns to processes.
Information within spatial
imagery that is relevant for the social sciences is
identified and used to inform concepts and theories (Lambin et al. 1999, Geoghegan
et al. 1998). Some recent LUCC studies have presented preliminary results that link
the pattern from geographical approaches to the human behaviour by incorporating
landscape data in social data. A number of studies aim to link household level data
directly to pixels in remote sensing images (e.g., Vance and Geoghegan 2002, Walsh
et al. 2003) to better understand the human–environment interaction. Mertens et al.
(2000) aggregate household level data to the village level and combine the
aggregated data at that level with spatial data. Walker et al. (2000) and Staal et al.
(2002) base their analysis on household level data, but add spatial data to the
household data using the geographical position of the households.

Conversely, ‘pixelising the social’ involves moving from processes to patterns. For
example, socio-economic theory is tested in a spatially explicit way (e.g. Chomitz
and Gray 1996). Other approaches, like multi-agent modelling start with social and
decision-making theories and move from there to construct spatial explicit models
(Parker et al. 2002).

The approach applied in this study explores the results of statistical models based
on socio-economic theories at the household level and uses the outcomes in the
construction of geographical models in order to incorporate the theories about
human decision making in these spatially explicit models. This approach aims to
link the widely used geographical approaches based on statistical models (Veldkamp
and Fresco 1997, Kok and Veldkamp 2000, Serneels and Lambin 2001, Nelson et al.
2001, Schneider and Pontius 2001) and the socio-economic approaches using
household level data (Walker et al. 2000, Staal et al. 2002, Vance and Geoghegan
2002).

The objective of this paper is to provide an alternative approach for the
mainstream geographical studies that are applied in LUCC research in order to give
more attention to the processes and behaviour that determine the land managers’
decisions. The core of the approach is to use the understanding of socio-economic
processes and environmental constraints at the household level and exploit those to
create process related spatial variables at the watershed level (‘pixelising the social’).
With this new set of process relevant variables an empirical model is constructed in
which the variables are examined for their explanatory power to predict the current
land use pattern. Using this approach we aim to construct a spatial model at the
watershed level that has a better fit than the mainstream geographical approach and
gives better insight in what processes (driving forces) are important in the decision
making process of the land managers.

The socio-economic approach and the geographical approach often work at
different scales and at different organisational levels. This alternative approach aims
to provide tools and methods to facilitate the exchange of information between the
two approaches.

2. Study area and data collection

2.1 Study area

The study area is situated in Cagayan Valley in the north-eastern part of the island
Luzon, The Philippines (figure 1). The study area comprises 13 villages of the
municipality of San Mariano, Isabela province, and its size is approximately

23,000 ha. San Mariano is accessible by concreted road in a 30-minute drive from
the highway leading from Manila to the north. The study area is situated between
the town of San Mariano in the west and the forested mountains of the Sierra Madre
mountain range in the east. The mountainous area in the east consists of
metamorphic and intrusive rocks as well as limestone and the hilly part in the
west consists of dissected marine deposits. The elevation ranges from 40 to
800 m.a.s.l. The climate is hot and humid, but with strong spatial and temporal
variations. A short dry season occurs between November and May (Van den Top
1998).

The area is inhabited by various ethnic groups, among others: Ilocano, Ibanag
and Ifugao, which are migrants or descendants of migrants that came to the area
from the 1900s onwards, and Kalinga and Agta, which are the indigenous
inhabitants of the area. In the migration history of the area some general patterns
can be identified. A century ago the whole study area was covered with tropical rain
forest and few people lived in the area. From the 1900s to 1940 migrants from the
nearby Cagayan valley settled in the area and started small scale (selective) logging
for construction purposes and some local trade. In the same period some waves of
migrants came from Ilocos to look for land to cultivate. In the period after World
War II up to 1960 people from Cagayan valley and the Cordillera (central Luzon) to
look for prime agricultural land. From 1960 to 1990 people entered the area for
employment in the logging industry, coming from Cagayan valley, the Cordillera,
and from other logging areas. The latter are predominantly Tagalog speaking people
by origin, though, currently they speak Ilocano. Between 1960 and 1990 corporate
logging companies deforested large parts of the area. In 1989 a logging moratorium
was issued in San Mariano. This moratorium was lifted in 1990, but in 1992 another

129

moratorium was enacted. By that time the logging companies had already pulled out
of the area (Jongman 1997). The moratorium made the people switch from logging-
based activities to agriculture. At present, most people in the area are farmers. From
1990 to present there are still migrants coming to the area. Those people migrate
mainly because of livelihood problems in their own area, for land speculation or
because they are invited by relatives that migrated before (Van den Top 1998).

During the time of corporate logging activities accessibility of the area was
relatively good. The companies constructed logging roads to transport logs out of
the area. People and goods were transported with the same trucks as the logs. Most
of the current roads still follow the former logging roads. However, since the logging
moratorium the accessibility decreased, because of a lack of maintenance of the
roads, which was formerly done by the logging companies (Jongman 1997).
Currently, the situation is improving because of the efforts of the municipal
government. All transport out of the area passes through San Mariano proper,
which is the main market for selling products and buying agricultural inputs.

At present, the land use in the study area shows a gradient from intensive
agriculture (mainly rice and yellow corn), near San Mariano, via a scattered pattern
of rice, yellow corn, banana, grasses and trees, to residual and primary forest in the
eastern part of the study area.

2.2 Data collection

Three datasets were collected: a spatial dataset for a mainstream geographic
analysis, a household dataset based on questionnaires and an enhanced spatial
dataset consisting of maps with variables that were selected based on the household
level analysis completed with other maps that are considered to be also explanatory
for the land use in the study area. The spatial datasets are created independently of
the household dataset; no information from the household level was aggregated to
construct the spatial dataset, but instead other sources of information were used that
more fully cover the whole area and give a better representation than aggregated
household data.

2.2.1 Land use data for the two spatial approaches. Land use data were interpreted
from Landsat ETM+ data (http://www.landsat.org) from June 2001 and ASTER
data from March 2002. First, unsupervised classifications were made from subsets
of both images. Second, the classes of the unsupervised classifications were recoded
into land use types according to a set of 96 field observations. Finally, the land use
map was constructed by combining the classifications of the two images. In this
procedure the ASTER image was first resampled from 15 m resolution to the same
grid as the Landsat image (30 by 30 m). Then, the land use classes of the 2 images
were put in separate layers. In a GIS (Geographical Information System) these
layers were combined, one on top of the other, in such a way that the best land use
classification was established according to the field observations. For each land use
type the image was used that best distinguished that land use type. For example, the
ASTER image was best able to distinguish forested areas, so this classification was
put on top the landsat classification of a banana/secondary growth mixture that
included parts of forested areas. Finally, the image was resampled to a 50 by 50 m
grid that coincides with the other data. The classes in the final land use map are
yellow corn (including some other arable crops), wet rice, grass, forest and a class
that includes banana, secondary forest, reforestation and residual forest (figure 2).

Banana plantations and low-density forest types were difficult to distinguish,
because the banana cultivation is quite extensive and often many trees grow in
between the bananas. Especially close to the forest area this causes difficulties in
classifying, nearby, there is considerable residual and secondary forest. Therefore, a
subset of the study area was created based on field observations. The western half of
the area was identified as an area in which the class ‘banana, secondary forest,
reforestation, residual forest’ can be considered to contain almost exclusively
extensive banana plantations. In the analysis for banana only this area was used.

2.2.2 Spatial data for mainstream geographic approach. Following the approach of
the mainstream spatial geographical models (e.g. Verburg and Chen 2000, Schneider
and Pontius 2001, Stolle et al. 2003) a dataset is constructed using data that are
readily available. The spatial dataset is a set of maps in a GIS containing
information derived from census data, maps, and field surveys (table 1) collected at
the watershed or meso level. With these data, spatial measures are constructed that
are proxies for the processes that determine the location of different land use types.
The data are converted into uniform grids with cell dimensions of 50 by 50 m to
facilitate the analysis.

Distance measures are calculated as the Euclidean distance of a cell to the nearest
destination of interest, which is a method that is often applied in the mainstream

spatial geographical models of land use change. The destinations of interest are the
market place in San Mariano, the nearest road (roads that are accessible by all
vehicles during dry season), the sitios (villages and smaller settlements), and rivers
and streams. A digital elevation model (DEM) was derived from the contour lines
and elevation points of a 1:50,000 topographic map of the area (NAMRIA
unknown). From the 50 by 50 m DEM a slope map was derived. A population
pressure map was constructed using a map with villages (as points) and the number
of inhabitants per village. It is assumed that the population pressure is related to the
number of inhabitants in the village and is higher close to the village than further
away. The assumption is that villagers want to have land nearby their house,
because of accessibility and safety reasons, and land nearby is scarce. Therefore, the
population pressure in a cell was calculated as the number inhabitants in a village
divided by the distance to that village, summed up for all villages (after Haynes and
Fotheringham 1984). In this model the pressure is high near the village and
diminishes quickly with increasing distance. In this approach the influence of a

2.2.3 Household level data. To collect the household level data an interview
campaign was carried out between June and November 2002 using a structured
questionnaire. The selection of explanatory variables of land use to be incorporated
in the questionnaire was based on literature (Doorman 1991), theories from a range
of disciplines and expert knowledge of the area. Some of the theories that were
considered while constructing the questionnaire are the relation between land use
and accessibility (e.g. Chomitz and Gray 1996), land suitability, and household life
cycles (Perz and Walker 2002). The aim was to construct a questionnaire containing
all variables that could possibly have an influence on land use decisions of farmers in
the area. The hypothesised relations are provided in the description of the data
(table 2). During a 2-month field survey in three different barangays (villages), the
questionnaire was tested, a range of possible answers was determined and the
questions were adapted to the understanding of the villagers. It is important to
consider what questions will best fit the purpose under study. The standardised
questionnaire was written in English and was translated during the interview by the
interpreter/field assistant in a local language (either Ilocano or Ibanag).

The selection of households to be interviewed was based on a combination of
stratified sampling and systematic random sampling using population data available
at the POPMAT (population manipulation action team) member in the village. The
sample was stratified according to the 13 barangays under study. This sampling
strategy was selected to obtain an equal coverage of the households over the study
area according to the relative population size of the village. In all barangays every
twentieth household was selected (systematic random sampling with sampling
interval 20) from the POPMAT. Because the POPMAT data were structured by
purok (neighbourhood) an extra spatial stratification was introduced. From a total
of approximately 3150 households in the 13 barangays, 151 households were
interviewed. The number of interviews per barangay ranges from six in small
barangays to 20 in the biggest.

The household survey is structured in a nested hierarchy (figure 3), with at the top

used for one of the land use type or crop. A household often owns or uses different
plots at different locations and each plot might be cultivated with a different crop.
Each of the variables was collected at the appropriate level, e.g. soil characteristics
at the field level, accessibility at plot and household level and household structure at
the household level (table 2).

The location of the households was recorded. However, the location of the fields
was not made spatially explicit due to time constraints, except for a few field checks.
Studies that do map the fields often use this information to link data from other
sources, like maps, to the fields. In this household analysis all information regarding
land use, slope and soil, was obtained through
the plots and fields,
questioning the respondents. Therefore, mapping of the fields was not strictly
necessary. The consequence of obtaining all data through questioning is that the
values represent the characteristic as perceived by the farmers instead of a more
objectified method.

2.2.4 Enhanced spatial dataset. The land use data as well as the slope data in this
dataset are the same as in the mainstream geographic dataset. Besides this,
additional variables were included according to the insights obtained in the
household analysis (table 1) about the most explanatory factors of land use in the
area. These variables are considered to be also possible drivers in the spatial analysis
at the watershed level. However, the data of the households were not used to
construct the enhanced spatial dataset. Instead, information from maps, census and
field survey was used.

Many variables that can be observed at the household level are difficult to
represent in a spatially explicit way (e.g. age of a household member). However, it is
possible to construct ‘creative’ spatial variables (Geoghegan et al. 1998) that best
represent the processes affecting the land use decisions. For these spatial variables
other data sources are used like census data from the municipal office or data

collected through other surveys. For example, the ethnicity of the owner of each grid
cell was not determined, but separate population pressures were calculated for each
ethnicity based on census data.

In contrast to the mainstream approach, the enhanced approach incorporates
improved accessibility measures based on an in-depth study on accessibility (Witte
2003, Verburg et al. 2004b). Four accessibility measures were created for this study:
travel time to market in the dry season, travel time to market in the wet season,
travel time to the nearest village and travel time to the nearest road. Due to bad
roads and higher water levels in the rivers a substantial difference exists between the
travel time in wet and dry season. To study whether the limitations of the wet season
or the opportunities in the dry season are most explanatory for land use both were
taken into account in the analysis. Witte (2003) used the travel speed on different
types of roads and travel speed off road depending on slope to calculate travel time
to the destinations market, village and road.

The measure distance to river as used in the mainstream approach was separated
in a measure for big rivers and a measure for the small rivers, because the small
rivers can often be used for irrigation purposes, while the big rivers cannot unless
pumps or large irrigation systems are available. Big rivers can be used as a way to
transport goods in the wet season and illegally cut logs. For the distance measures to
rivers the Euclidean distance was used.

A map depicting the ethnicity of the individual landowners could not be obtained,
because in this study no database was available that links all land managers to their
individual parcels. Instead, an indicator was created to represent ethnicity based on
the population census data. For the four largest ethnic groups, Ilocano, Ibanag,
Ifugao and Kalinga, an ‘ethnic population pressure’ was created. The procedure to
calculate this measure is similar to the procedure used to calculate population
pressure for the mainstream approach, though in the new measures the numbers of
inhabitants were disaggregated into the number of people per ethnic group to create
four ethnic population pressure maps.

Information about the place of birth and tenure was available at village level. So,
a map of village territories was necessary. Therefore, GPS (global positioning
system) recordings of all settlements were used to construct Thiessen polygons that
delineate a map with the village boundaries. Place of birth is represented as the
percentage of male inhabitants born in the municipality of San Mariano. The
variable tax declaration is the percentage of land per village that is registered to a
land manager by the municipal office.

Besides the variables above two sets of variables were included that are considered
to have an important contribution to the spatial distribution of the land use, but
which were not taken directly into account in the household survey. Forest-related
land use policies (DENR-CENRO 1998) were incorporated to see whether or not
these programs have any influence on the land use in the area. Generally, these
policies are related to forest conservation, protection and development. FLMA
(Forest Land Management Agreement), ISF (Integrated Social Forestry), and
SIFMA (Socialized Industrial Forest Management Agreement) are reforestation
and agroforestry programs based on community participation. The participants are
granted tenural security for 25 years and are committed to achieve the goals of the
program regarding the planting of trees. The programs aim at providing sustainable
livelihood for the occupants based on the sustainable use of forest products. A part
of the area, which varies per program, is allowed to be devoted to agricultural crops.

The IFMA (Industrial Forest Management Agreement) programs aims at
developing industrial forest plantation as an alternative and sustainable source of
raw material for private corporations involved in forest-based industries (Balagtas-
Mangabat 2002). Geomorphological variables (Van Egmond 2003) were included to
approximate landscape characteristics. The area was subdivided into five areas:
active floodplain, terraces, marine sediments,
limestone and metamorphic and
intrusive rocks.

3. Methods

3.1 Analysis

In this paper three logistic regression models are presented. The analyses focus on
the current land use rather than land use change. First, a model is constructed using
the spatial data of mainstream geographic approach. This model is presented to
illustrate the difference with the approach advocated in this study. Second, a model
is presented using the data collected in the household survey. This model will be
referred to as the household model. Third, a model referred to as the enhanced
spatial model is constructed based on the explanatory drivers identified in the
household level analysis supplemented with specific spatial drivers. This is the model
aimed at in this study: a spatial model incorporating proxies for process information
that does justice to the causal relations in land use change decision making having a
better predictive power than ordinary models. For all three analyses three land use
types were analysed: yellow corn, wet rice and banana. Forest could also be studied
in the spatial approaches, but this was not analysed in this study, because forest was
not included in the household survey.

In the spatial models we are interested in the occurrence of a land use type relative
to all other land use types including forest and other non-agricultural uses.
Therefore, the logistic regression approach was chosen. For the household analysis a
multinomial approach could have been appropriate, since only agricultural options
are included in the model and in the dataset. In multinomial regression the categories
are explained against a reference category. In this study we want to explain every land
use type relative to all other options rather than relative to one specific land use type.
Therefore, we decided to apply logistic regression analysis in this study.

Using logistic regression the assumption is made that all people in the area
respond in a similar way to the variables. Though this does not have to be the case.
A possible way to integrate the effects of communities (like villages or ethnic groups)
and households within a single model is to use a multi-level model (Goldstein 1995,
Polsky and Easterling 2001). In the multi-level approach the estimated parameters
of the model are allowed to vary according to the hierarchical stratification of the data.
Beforehand, there was no complete insight in the processes determining land use
in the area. Therefore, a stepwise procedure is used in this study to construct the
logistic regression models in order to explore what variables may be explanatory for
the observed land use.
To see whether

the socio-economic and
geographical approaches succeeded, the results of the household analysis and the
watershed level analysis are compared and discussed. To assess the benefit of the
alternative approach in comparison with the mainstream geographical approach
the results of those models are also compared.

3.1.1 Mainstream geographic approach. In the mainstream geographic approach a
logistic regression model is constructed in which the probability is estimated for the
occurrence of a land use type at a location as a function of explanatory variables.
For the selection of relevant factors explaining the pattern of land use a stepwise
procedure was used (forward stepwise regression with probability levels of 0.01 for
entry in the model and 0.02 for removal from the model). The independent variables
are proxies of land use drivers and considered to explain the location of the different
land use types. The following variables were included in the stepwise procedure:
distance to market, distance to village, distance to road, distance to river, slope,
elevation and population pressure. The hypothesised relations are listed in table 1. A
ten percent sample from the available grid cells was drawn to reduce spatial
autocorrelation. This approach does not fully account for spatial autocorrelation
and is in fact a loss of information (Overmars et al. 2003). However, it is commonly
used and will minimise spatial autocorrelation to a level that will not affect the
results (Verburg and Chen 2000, Serneels and Lambin 2001, Stolle et al. 2003).
Practical procedures that can fully account for spatial autocorrelation in logistic
models are currently not available.

3.1.2 Household model. The household model is a logistic regression model in
which the probability is estimated for a field to have a land use type or not as a
function of explanatory variables. The model is based on the data collected in the
household survey. All variables (table 2) are hypothesised to be explanatory factors
for land use. They are assumed to influence the preference of the land managers for
a land use type at a certain location. From the variables a selection was made using a
stepwise procedure (forward stepwise regression with probability levels of 0.05 for
entry in the model and 0.10 for removal from the model) to select variables from the
household survey to form a model to fit the land use data. Records with a missing
value in one of the variables were removed from the dataset. Therefore, a subset of
187 observations (fields) from a total of 376 was used for this analysis. Models are
constructed for the land use types yellow corn, wet rice and banana.

In most socio-economic studies of this kind the household level is the level of
analysis since this is the level at which the land manager take his/her decisions. For
example, tests are carried out to determine whether or not a household adapts a
certain agricultural technique. But, using the household as the level of analysis, it is
difficult to take field characteristics, such as soil quality and flooding risk, into
account. These characteristics can vary between fields used and do influence the
decision to use the land in one way or the other. Using the household as the unit of
analysis it is also difficult to compare the results with a spatial analysis that uses grid
cells or pixels as the unit of analysis, which are also units of land. Therefore, in this
analysis the field will serve as the unit of analysis. This enables us to use the physical
characteristics of the site, together with the characteristics at the plot and household
level (figure 3), which are attached to the field level.

In the household analysis the assumption is made that the land use decision for a
field is made independent from the land use on other fields of the same household.
To test this assumption the standardised residuals of the models are regressed (linear
regression) on variables containing the number of fields of the other land use types.
For example, in the case of the corn model these variables would contain the
number of banana fields and the number of wet rice fields owned by the farmer. A
significant relation of one of the variables with the residuals would suggest that the
assumption might not hold. The residuals of the models for wet rice and banana did

K. P. Overmars and P. H. Verburg

not have a significant relation with these variables, so the assumption holds for
those models. The residuals of the corn model showed a significant (p,0.05)
negative relation with the number of wet rice fields and banana fields. Using a
somewhat richer specification of the model, by adding two variables, the relation
with the number of banana fields turned out to be insignificant, though the relation
with the number of wet rice field still appeared. So, evaluating the model in its
current specification it seems that decision for corn is not taken completely
independent from the decisions made for the other fields.

3.1.3 Enhanced spatial model. For the enhanced spatial dataset, variables were
derived that best represent the process identified by the factors that performed well
in the household level model. This approach inherently assumes that the drivers at
the household level correspond to the drivers at
the watershed level. This
assumption only holds when the same unit of analysis (resolution and extent) is
used in both analyses, because otherwise scale dependencies (Walsh et al. 1999,
Verburg and Chen 2000) can play a role. The unit of analysis in the household
analysis was chosen to be the field. In the spatial dataset used in this study the units
of analysis are grid cells of 50 by 50 m. That observation unit does not completely
resemble the field of the household survey, since one field can be represented in the
spatial data as several grid cells (in the case of fields larger than 0.25 ha). This can
cause spatial autocorrelation, because cells from the same field, which are
neighbouring cells, have the same properties. Besides this, the probability for a
field to be in the sample will be different for both datasets. Both effects might
hamper a good comparison between the household and spatial models. The farmer’s
decision at the household level was made for the whole field, so this data
representation suits the processes that caused the land use and will be applied to
both datasets. So, ideally, fields should occur at most once in the spatial dataset, like
in the household dataset. Therefore, a sample of ten percent was drawn from the
cells available in the grid, which approximates that every field occurs only once (at
most) in the dataset and reduces spatial autocorrelation.

The enhanced spatial model is, like the mainstream geographic model, a logistic
regression model in which the probability is estimated for a grid cell to have a land
use type or not as a function of explanatory variables. A stepwise procedure was
used (forward stepwise regression with probability levels of 0.01 for entry in the
model and 0.02 for removal from the model) to select the relevant factors explaining
land use.

3.2 Logistic regression

In the all three models the dependent variable is binary, meaning that a certain land
use type occurs at a certain location (value 1) or not (value 0). When the response
variable is binary, a good way to describe the shape of the response function is a
tilted S or its reverse. This response curves can be described mathematically by
logistic response functions. Equation 1 is a linearised form of the logistic response
function and is referred to as the logit response function (Neter et al. 1996).

variables. The ratio p/(12p) is called the odds, log (p/(12p)) is the log odds, also
named ‘logit’. The logit of Equation (1) can be converted to an expression for the
odds and to an expression for the probability, but these are three different ways
of expressing the same thing (Menard 2001). The interpretation of the parameters
bn is facilitated by the odds ratio (exp(bi)). The odds ratio can be interpreted as
the change in odds for the considered event upon an increase of one unit in the
corresponding factor, while the other factors are considered to be unchanged.
This means that the odds (p/p21) are multiplied by exp(bi) for every unit increase
of the variable (Neter et al. 1996).

To estimate the relative contribution of different variables within a model a

standardized logistic regression coefficient was used (equation 2) (Menard 2001).

To indicate goodness of fit, the R2 measure used in OLS regression cannot be
applied in logistic regression. There are pseudo-R2 measures available for logistic
regression, but those can only be used to compare different specifications of the
same model and cannot be used to compare different models. Therefore, the ROC
(Relative Operating Characteristic) (Swets 1988) was used to indicate the goodness
of fit of the models. This measure is capable of assessing the quality of the predictor
and can be compared between different models. The ROC summarises the
performance of a logistic regression model over a range of cut-off values by
classifying the probabilities. The value of the ROC is defined as the area under the
curve linking the relation between the proportion of true positives versus the
proportion of false positives for an infinite number of cut-off values. The ROC
statistic varies between 0.5 (completely random) and 1 (perfect discrimination).

4. Results

4.1 Models based on mainstream geographic approach

The logistic regression models of the mainstream approach are shown in table 3.
The stepwise procedure selected 4 (corn), 2 (wet rice) and 3 (banana) variables
that have a significant contribution to the models. Distance measures turned out
to be explanatory in all three models. Distance to village and distance to road are
contributing significantly to all three models and distance to market to the corn
model. Since these variables are highly correlated with population pressure this
variable did not appear in any of the models. Distance to river also does not
appear in any of the models. Slope appears in the mainstream geographic models
for corn and banana. More detailed interpretations of these models are discussed
in section 5 when the models are compared with the results of the spatial models.
The ROC values for these models are 0.77, 0.73 and 0.70 for corn, wet rice and
banana respectively. No collinearity between the independent variables was
found.

The results from the household analysis are presented in table 4. For all land use
types a clear relation with slope can be observed, which is in line with the
hypotheses. The variables steep slope and moderate to steep slope have a negative
effect on the probability for a field to have corn. The model for wet rice shows a
positive relation with flat slope and flat to moderate slope. On the contrary banana
has a positive relation with steep and a negative relation with flat slopes. So, slope is
a good determinant to make the distinction between corn and wet rice on the flatter
fields and banana on the steeper fields. An explanation for this is that for corn and
wet rice, regular tillage is necessary, and for wet rice, irrigation has to be applied.
Both activities can be best performed in the flatter areas. The remaining steep parts
are cultivated with banana in which no regular tillage is applied.

The different preferences of ethnic groups turned out to be significant as well as
the variable place of birth, which is partly related to the ethnic groups, because some
groups have a distinct migration period. In general, the Ibanag have a tradition in
growing corn and are less focused on rice cultivation. The Tagalog speaking people,
the Ifugaos and also the Ilocano people have a tradition in rice cultivation. In the
corn model a positive relation was found with the Ibanag people and a negative
relation with the Ifugao people. In the wet rice model a positive relation with the
Ifugao and Ilocano people was found. But, besides ethnicity also the variable place
of birth turned out to contribute significantly to the model. Being born in San
Mariano has a positive effect on the probability of corn and a negative effect on the
probability of wet rice. This can be caused by the fact that newcomers are mainly
people that grow rice traditionally. Another explanation for this could be that new
migrants will focus primarily on subsistence and therefore cultivate rice, which is the
main staple crop.

In the model for wet rice the variable creek has a significant positive contribution
to the probability. In the corn model this relation is negative, where no relation was
expected. The presence of a creek on a plot is important to grow wet rice, because
this crop is irrigated. Corn is mainly grown on the large flat terraces near the big
rivers and is primarily dependent on rain. These plots are not all connected with the
big rivers, but even if they were close to the big river natural irrigation would not be
possible because of the height difference. So the plots near the river cannot be used
for irrigated rice.

Besides the strong relation with slope banana cultivation has a negative relation
with the variable ‘first year the farmer started on the plot’, which means that recently
acquired plots are often cultivated not with banana, but with other crops like corn
and rice. Banana is negatively related with plot size. This is remarkable, because the
hypothesis was that small fields are cultivated with corn and rice and bananas are
cultivated extensively on the larger plots. A possible explanation is the limited
capacity for farmers to transport bananas from their fields leading to acreages
planted with banana that do not exceed the transportation capacity.

The variables included in the models can be explained in terms of how they affect
land use decisions. On the other hand some variables that were hypothesised to be

transportation costs and tenure were expected to be important. Transportation costs
were hypothesised to influence the decisions for cash crops like yellow corn. Another
strong relationship that was not included in these models is the positive relation
between tenancy and corn.

The independent variables of

the three models were investigated on any
correlation to see if there was any collinearity within the models. This resulted in
excluding transportation cost in the wet rice model, because this variable was highly
correlated with ethnicity Ifugao. The other variables did not show high correlations
among each other.

The ROC values that are used to give an indication for the goodness of fit are high
for all three models, but especially for the land use types wet rice (0.92) and banana
(0.92). The ROC for the corn model is 0.84. The high ROCs indicate that the
variables used in the model can very well predict the occurrence of the land use types
corn, wet rice and banana at the household level.

4.3 Enhanced spatial models

The enhanced spatial models are presented in table 5 and the results are visualised in
figure 4. This figure shows the actual land use pattern (left) and the predicted
probability (right). Especially for land use types corn and banana the predicted
probabilities seem to fit
the visual
interpretation of the goodness of fit is more difficult, because there are not many
rice fields present in the area. The ROC values for the spatial models are 0.78, 0.76
and 0.74 for respectively the corn, wet rice and banana model.

the observed data well. For wet rice,

The spatial models, incorporating the improved variables, have characteristics of
both the household and mainstream geographic models (table 5). The variable
improved distance to village appears in the models for wet rice and banana. Wet rice
is an intensive crop and is cultivated close to the villages and banana is situated
further away. So, people grow the intensive crops close to their houses, or
conversely, people have settled where the conditions for growing their main crops
are best. The variable improved distance to market wet is negatively related with
corn. The (time) distance to market represents the costs to transport in- and outputs
to the market and the negative relation indicates that the crop is grown at places
with low transportation cost, generating the largest profits. The variable distance to
small river turned out to be positively correlated with corn and negatively with
banana. Only the small rivers are used for irrigation, since hardly any technology is
used to use the water from the big rivers. Therefore, the variable distance to small
river was created to approximate suitable locations for irrigation. Slope was selected
in the corn and in the banana model and the relations are as hypothesised: negative
for corn and wet rice and positive for banana. Geomorphological variables appear
in all spatial models. These variables are not directly related to a process, but were
introduced to approximate environmental characteristics like soil fertility and
suitable landscape properties. In general the active floodplain and terraces are flat
and have better conditions for crop production. On these sites the intensive crops,
yellow corn and wet rice, are cultivated. The less favourable areas are left for
banana, which is cultivated in an extensive manner in this region. The variable
indicating place of birth (original municipality), which was introduced based upon
the experiences with the household level analysis, appeared to be significant in the
model for wet rice. The relation is the same as in the household model. The variable
tax declaration also turned out to be relevant in the wet rice model. The positive

relation suggests means that wet rice is cultivated more on plots with a relatively
strong tenural security. The positive relations with forest policies in the wet rice
(project ISF) and banana model
(project IFMA) are contrary to what was
hypothesised. It was expected that all agricultural land use types would occur less
or equal at locations designated for forest policies compared to other areas, because
the forest policies are mainly focused on reforestation and agroforestry. However,
the ISF program aims at developing only 20 percent of the area with forest trees and
the remaining 80 percent with agroforestry and it aims at increasing upland
production (Balagtas-Mangabat 2002). So, the higher probability of wet rice in the
ISF area could well be caused by the program. The relation between banana and
IFMA could be caused by misclassification of the remote sensing images, since banana
and secondary forest or reforestation are difficult to distinguish from each other.

The variables selected initially by the stepwise procedure were checked on
collinearity. This resulted in excluding improved distance to village from the corn
model (because of correlation with the variable improved distance to market) and
ethnicity Ibanag from the banana model (correlated with Geo. Rock).

In contrast with the household models the spatial models do not incorporate any
ethnicity variables, but do incorporate accessibility measures. These differences are
discussed in the following section.

5. Discussion and conclusions

The mainstream geographic models explaining LUCC are based on readily available
biophysical and geographical data, or on data that are easy to calculate from basic
data, like distance measures. From the results of the mainstream geographic model

in this study it could be concluded that the location of the land use types yellow
corn, wet rice and banana are primarily determined by distance to village, road and
market, and slope. These are location-specific measures, which are basically physical
characteristics. However, the distance measures can be proxies for other process
related variables like transportation cost and travel time to the field.

The household models show somewhat different results. From the household
analysis, it is clear that variables from all three levels present in the household survey
(household, plot and field) play a significant role. Biophysical characteristics of the
field, like slope and the presence of a creek, as well as socio-economic characteristics
of the household, like ethnicity and place of birth, are important. This advocates the
incorporation of household characteristics in the spatial model, in addition to the
geographical characteristics. The household model also shows the relevance of using
the field as the unit of analysis in the household study. By taking the smallest unit as
the level of analysis and linking the higher-level characteristics to this level the
biophysical and socio-economic variables can be incorporated jointly in the
statistical analysis. The result shows that both types of variables play a role in
explaining the occurring land use.

The spatial model presented in this paper combines the best of both. The dataset
for this analysis was a combination of newly specified spatial variables that best
represent variables that were significant in the household model and improved
spatial variables complemented with spatial variables that are considered to have
explanatory power at the watershed level. In these models a combination of
accessibility measures, social and physical variables turned out to be explanatory for
land use. The main differences between the household models and the spatial models
are that (1) the variables that are representing the same do not always have the same
relative importance (indicated by the standardised b (b*) in the models) and (2) that
the goodness of fit (indicated by the ROC value) of the spatial models is
substantially lower than the household models. The following paragraphs will
discuss the causes for these differences.

The differences in the relative importance of

the parameters between the
household and the spatial models could be caused by scale effects through
differences in resolution or extent. The resolution of both analyses, however, is
practically the same. The fields of the farmers in the area are generally between 0.25
and 3 ha. In the household study the field was taken as the unit of analysis and all
fields are represented once. But, in the spatial dataset the larger fields consist of a
number of cells, because in the spatial analysis cells of 50 by 50 m (0.25 ha) are used.
By taking a ten percent sample from the data this was overcome. So, there is no
difference in resolution between both datasets. Therefore, scale dependencies as a
result of resolution, as mentioned by Walsh et al. (1999) and Verburg and Chen
(2000), are not likely to occur. However, there are differences in extent. In both
analyses the study area consists of the same 13 barangays in San Mariano. However,
the household data only represent the land that is occupied by farmers and the
spatial data consist of the whole area, including forest and other land that is not
like accessibility and
occupied. This
geomorphology, which can make the distinction between these land use types and
the agricultural land use types, are relatively more important in the spatial analysis.
Differences can also occur because the two approaches use different sampling
techniques. The household analysis uses a random draw from the households in the
area, while the spatial approach draws randomly from the grid cells in the study

the reason why certain variables,

area. This could be a possible explanation for the effect that different variables are
found to be important in the two approaches.

Another important source of differences between the spatial model and the
household model is the different ways of data representation. The two analyses are
based on different datasets that were collected at different organisational levels. No
household data are used in the spatial analysis, so aggregating errors can hardly
occur. The information extracted from the household models is used as an
indication of what variables might be important at the watershed level. In this study
attempts are made to represent household level variables at the watershed level in
order to ‘pixelise the social’. Social variables and/or processes and household
characteristics are captured in maps. Because of these two different levels of
organisation it is not always possible to represent the data in the same way.

A group of variables, like typical household characteristics such as ethnicity, can be
mapped potentially if one knew what field on the map is used/owned by whom. This
approach has recently been adopted by some authors (e.g. Vance and Geoghegan
2002, Walsh et al. 2003). In this study the aim is to be spatially explicit in the whole
study area, meaning that all land parcels of all people in the area should be mapped.
This turned out to be impossible in this study due to its size and consequently time and
financial constraints. Therefore, more aggregated variables based on census
information were created to proxy the variable. For example, the ethnicity of the
field’s owner was not recorded for every field, but instead a value indicating
population pressure was calculated per ethnic group for each pixel.

Another group of variables included in the household model are based on
farmers’ perceptions. As indicated before, the fields in the household analysis were
not mapped. But instead, the field characteristics are collected through questioning
the respondents. The approaches that do map fields can use this information to
attach other mapped data to this field. In this study mapped data are only used in
the two spatial approaches. The result of this approach is that in the household
survey the variables are values as perceived by the farmers in contrast to more
objectified sources of data. This has to be taken into account while interpreting the
data. An advantage of this approach is that it saves time, because not all fields have
to be visited. So, in the household survey the answers of the farmer are perceived
values and therefore relative to the knowledge of that farmer. The scale used to rank
certain variables varies between the farmers. A variable included in the spatial
model, from more objectified sources, is based on only one scale. For example, let us
assume that the most fertile soil of a farmer in the mountains is less fertile than the
most fertile soil of a farmer cultivating in the lowlands and that the farmers’ strategy
is that they all grow corn on their most fertile soil. This would mean that soil fertility
is only explanatory at the household level, but not at the spatial level, causing a
difference in outcome of the two models.

Closely related to this are variables that are approximated by the respondents, like
the question: ‘how long do you travel from your house the this plot?’ A calculated map
will be a more objectified answer to this question than the estimation of many
respondents. On the other hand, the calculated map is also based on a number of
assumptions (e.g. the travel speed on all parts with the same slope is the same), which
possibly does not represent the conditions that are perceived by the households.

Some variables are just difficult to obtain at the household level, because the
respondents do not have any knowledge of the subject, like geomorphological units
or governmental policies, whereas they might respond indirectly to these factors.

These different data representations and the difference in extent are responsible
for the different behaviour of the variables in the household model and in the
enhanced spatial model. They can even cause variables to occur in one model, but
not in the other. Besides this it is widely acknowledged in literature that higher-level
processes cannot be represented as simply the sum of lower level characteristics
(Coleman 1990). Despite out efforts to keep the extent and the resolution of the
household and spatial models the same these effects can cause differences between
the two approaches.

The differences in extent and the aggregated representation of some variables are
also likely to cause the lower explanatory capacity (as indicated by the ROC) in the
spatial models compared with the household models. The larger extent of the spatial
model means that the spatial model also has to differentiate between the land use
types corn, wet rice and banana and the areas that are not in use. This may explain
why the explanatory power of a variable is lower in the spatial model than in the
household model. An alternative model specification, which would be closer to the
specification of the household model, is to exclude the areas that are not in use or
owned by any farmer. The interest in this study is in the whole area, so this
alternative was not applied.

Furthermore,

the spatial variables derived from aggregated data cannot
completely represent the variability as perceived by the individual households.
Information is lost in comparison with household level data, which will lead to a
lower goodness of fit. Less accurate variables, like the ethnicity measures, tend to be
less important in the spatial model and contribute less to the ROC.

The difference between the spatial model and the mainstream geographic model is
clear. The mainstream geographic model is built out of readily available topographic
and census data, like the approach followed in most regional level studies. The data
were processed into variables that are mainly proxies for the processes at hand and
give no insight in the processes that determine the land use. The enhanced spatial
model does provide insight in those processes, because the variables used in the
spatial model are constructed to represent a process with roots in the household
model, which is the level where land use decisions are taken. However, the overall fit
of the enhanced spatial model is only slightly higher than the mainstream model.
ROCs for corn, rice and banana are 0.77, 0.73 and 0.70 for the mainstream
model and 0.78, 0.76 and 0.74 for the enhanced spatial model. The added value of a
spatial model compared to the household model is that it allows the inclusion of
spatially relevant variables that provide the context for household level processes.
This way we have included social processes in spatial models (‘pixelising the social’)
and added spatial dimension to household level decision-making (‘socialising
the pixel’).

This study can make a significant contribution to empirical land use change
studies. The approach, which jointly analyses the household and watershed level,
can serve as a connection between spatial models at a broader scale and more social
research aimed at the explanation of the causal relations that drive land use change.
In that respect the findings of this research can be a base for spatial statistical
models (e.g. Verburg et al. 2002) as well as more actor-based approaches studying
the farmers’ decision process (e.g. De Groot 1992, Parker et al. 2003). Basically, the
former will give insight in the dimensions and locations of the land use change and
the latter can provide insights in how to influence the process, which can be relevant
in policy making.

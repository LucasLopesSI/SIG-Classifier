Axial lines are deﬁned as the longest visibility lines for representing individual linear
spaces in urban environments. The least set of axial lines that cover the free space of
an urban environment or the space between buildings constitute what is often called
an axial map. This is a fundamental tool in space syntax, a theory developed by Bill
Hillier and his colleagues for characterizing the underlying urban morphologies. For
a long time, generating axial lines with the help of some graphic software has been a
tedious manual process that is criticized for being time consuming, subjective, or even
arbitrary. In this article, we redeﬁne axial lines as the least set of individual straight line
segments mutually intersected along natural streets that are generated from street center
lines using the Gestalt principle of good continuity. Based on this new deﬁnition, we
develop an automatic solution for generating the newly deﬁned axial lines from street
center lines. We apply this solution to six typical street networks (three from North
America and three from Europe) and generate a new set of axial lines for analyzing
the urban morphologies. Through a comparison study between the new axial lines and
the conventional or old axial lines and between the new axial lines and natural streets,
we demonstrate with empirical evidence that the newly deﬁned axial lines are a better
alternative for capturing the underlying urban structure.

Introduction

1.
Axial lines refer to the longest visibility lines for representing individual linear spaces
in urban environments. The least set of axial lines cutting across the free space of an
urban environment constitute what is often called an axial map. Based on the axial map,
or more precisely the intersection of the axial lines, space syntax (Hillier and Hanson
1984, Hillier 1996) adopts a connectivity graph consisting of nodes representing axial
lines and links if the axial lines are intersected for understanding the underlying mor-
phology. The status of individual nodes in the connectivity graph can be characterized
by some deﬁned space syntax metrics, most of which have a closed link to graph-theoretic
metrics such as centrality (Freeman 1979). Thus all axial lines are assigned some met-
rics for characterizing their status within the axial map. This is fundamental to space
syntax for urban morphological analysis. However, for a long time generating the axial
lines has been a tedious manual process using some geographic information systems (GIS)

and computer aided design (CAD) software tools. It is considered to be time consuming,
subjective, or even arbitrary (e.g., Jiang and Claramunt 2002, Ratti 2004). Researchers
have attempted to seek automatic solutions (e.g., Peponis et al. 1998, Turner et al. 2005,
Jiang and Liu 2010), but none of them really work efﬁciently and effectively for large
cities.

We believe that the lack of an automatic solution for generating axial lines for large
cities is due to the ambiguity of the conventional deﬁnition of axial lines. The conventional
deﬁnition is essentially based on the notion of visibility. This deﬁnition works well for
small urban environments in which buildings are visual obstacles and the space between the
buildings constitutes the free space on which people can freely move around. For example,
the automatic solutions mentioned above are mainly targeted for such a case. However,
we cannot adopt the same deﬁnition at the city level for generating the axial lines. This is
because human movement at the city level is constrained by street networks rather than the
free space between buildings. We therefore think that visibility cannot simply be applied
for generating axial lines for large cities. Instead, we suggest walkability or drivability as
the basic notion for deﬁning the axial lines at the city level. We deﬁne axial lines as the least
set of individual straight line segments mutually intersected along natural streets that are
generated from street center lines using the Gestalt principle of good continuity (Thomson
2003, Jiang et al. 2008). Based on the new deﬁnition, we can develop an automatic solution
for generating the axial lines from street center lines.

This article is further motivated by the increasing availability of volunteered geo-
graphic information contributed by individuals and supported by the Web 2.0 technologies
(Goodchild 2007). In this respect, the OpenStreetMap (OSM, www.openstreetmap.org)
community has collected and contributed over a few hundred gigabytes of street network
data for the entire world. The quality and quantity of the OSM data for Europe and North
America can be compared with those data maintained by the national mapping agencies.
We believe that the volunteered geographic information or the OSM data in particular
provide an unprecedented data source for various urban studies. Furthermore, they can
successfully be used for generating axial maps for individual cities.

The contribution of this article is threefold: (1) we provide a new deﬁnition of axial
lines, and consequently an automatic solution for generating the axial lines from street
center lines; (2) we conduct a comparison study between the new axial lines and the con-
ventional axial lines and between the new axial lines and the natural streets and ﬁnd that the
new axial lines can be a better alternative for illustrating the underlying urban morpholo-
gies; and (3) along with the ﬁrst point, we demonstrate to our surprise an application of the
head/tail division rule. This rule illustrates a regularity that can be used for partitioning
values (that exhibit a heavy-tailed distribution) between a minority head and a majority
tail; refer to Jiang and Liu (forthcoming) for more details.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we redeﬁne the axial
lines and introduce a procedure to automatically generate them from street center lines.
This new deﬁnition is justiﬁed from the limitation of the conventional deﬁnition initially
developed by Bill Hillier and his coworkers. In Section 3, we apply the procedure to six
street networks and generate the new axial maps and compute the related space syntax
metrics for illustrating the underlying urban morphologies. We discuss some results from a
comparison study between the new axial lines and old axial lines and between the new axial
lines and natural streets in terms of how they capture the underlying urban morphologies
and trafﬁc ﬂow. Finally, Section 5 provides a conclusion to this article and points out the
future work.

2. Redeﬁning and auto-generating the axial lines

Before redeﬁning the axial lines, let us take a look at how they were conventionally deﬁned.
The initial deﬁnition of the axial lines is based on a prior deﬁnition of the convex map of
free space (Hillier and Hanson 1984). The convex map is deﬁned as the least set of fattest
spaces that cover the free space. Based on the prior deﬁnition, axial lines are deﬁned as
‘the least set of such straight lines which passes through each convex space and makes
all axial links’ (p. 92, Hillier and Hanson 1984). In practice, no one seems to care about
the deﬁnition of a convex map. Instead, a simple procedure is adopted for generating the
axial lines, that is, ‘ﬁrst ﬁnding the longest straight line that can be drawn. . ., then the
second longest, and so on until all convex spaces are crossed and all axial lines that can be
linked to other axial lines without repetition are so linked’ (p. 99, Hillier and Hanson 1984).
This conventional deﬁnition of axial lines or the procedure for generating axial lines relies
much on the notion of visibility. Due to this fact, the axial lines are also called the longest
visibility lines. This deﬁnition makes perfect sense for a small urban environment in which
buildings are considered visual obstacles and the space between buildings is walkable.
In this circumstance, there are already some automatic solutions for generating the axial
lines (Peponis et al. 1998, Turner et al. 2005, Jiang and Liu 2010).

For large cities, the space between buildings is not always walkable and only streets
or sidewalks are truly walkable. Thus we cannot rely on the visibility between buildings
to generate axial lines. Instead, we must consider only the walkable space for generating
axial lines. In this article, we deﬁne axial lines as the least set of straight lines that are
mutually intersected along individual natural streets. A natural street is deﬁned as a self-
organized street generated from individual adjacent street segments that have the smallest
deﬂection angles. Perceptually, the self-organized natural street forms a good continuity
based on the principle of Gestalt psychology (Thomson 2003, Jiang et al. 2008). Under
this deﬁnition, two parallel straight streets with a few meters gap in between, yet visible to
each other, would be represented as two axial lines, since they are distinctly walkable or
drivable spaces. The same idea is applied to a highway that is separated by a small barrier
into two different driving lanes. Eventually, the least set of the longest axial lines constitute
the newly deﬁned axial map.

Based on this new deﬁnition, generating axial lines becomes a relatively easy and
straightforward task. First, we need to form individual natural streets based on street seg-
ments or arcs and using some join principles such as every-best-ﬁt, self-best-ﬁt, and self-ﬁt
(Jiang et al. 2008). Among the three join principles, the every-best-ﬁt principle is the best
choice, since it tends to form natural streets that are similar or close to the corresponding
named streets (Jiang and Claramunt 2004). As suggested in the previous study, we adopt
45◦ as the threshold angle for terminating the join process. Once the natural streets are
generated, we then assess their curviness and convert them into a set of axial lines. If the
initial natural streets are straight enough, they directly become axial lines. For those streets
with a big bend, we chop them into two or several straight parts based on the degree or
extent of curviness.

To identify a big bend, we simply draw a baseline linking two ending points of a
natural street (with distance d) and check how far (x) is the farthest vertex from the
baseline (Figure 1). In fact, both x and x/d follow a lognormal distribution – one of
the heavy-tailed distributions; we will illustrate this fact in the following experiments.
This fact allows us to use the head/tail division rule (Jiang and Liu forthcoming) for
the following chopping process. The head/tail division rule states that given a vari-
able V, if its values, v, follow a heavy-tailed distribution, then the mean (m) of the

values can divide all the values into two parts: a high percentage in the tail and a
low percentage in the head. It is a bit surprising to us that the arithmetic mean of x
or x/d can make such perfect sense for the chopping process. The underlying idea of
identifying bends for the chopping process is to some extent similar to the detection
of character points in line simpliﬁcations or generalization (e.g., Ramer 1972, Douglas
and Peucker 1973), but we introduce another parameter ratio x/d. More importantly, the
thresholds for the parameters are automatically determined by the head/tail division rule
in the process. This process can be summarized as the following recursive function:

Initialize mean(x) and mean(x/d) 
Calculate x and x/d of current street 
Function Chop (x, x/d, current street) 
   If ((x > mean(x) and x/d >= 10%*mean(x/d)) or (x <= mean(x) and

 x/d >= mean(x/d))

      Split current street into two pieces: back street and

Calculate x and x/d of front street 
Chop (x, x/d, front street) 

 

Else 

      Link two ending points of the current street as an axial line 

To better understand the above function, let us adopt some speciﬁc ﬁgures to elaborate on
the chopping process. We learn from Table 1 that the mean of x is about 30 meters and that
of x/d is about 15%. If x is greater than 30 and x/d is greater than 1.5% (10% of 15%),
then we will split a natural street into two. Alternatively, if x is less than 30 and x/d is
greater than 15%, then we will do the same chopping. Of course, the two parameters x and
x/d vary from one network to another as we see in Table 1, but every network has its own
parameter settings derived from its own mean for the chopping process.

Let us explain how the 1.5% or 10%∗mean(x/d) in general is determined and what
is the implication of this parameter setting. For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that
mean(x) = 30 and mean(x/d) = 15% again; refer to Table 1 for actual parameter settings.
With reference to Figure 1, suppose the farthest vertex is in the middle of a street, we note

88.28, and α = 180 − 2 × 88.28 = 3.44. Therefore, the 1.5% parameter setting implies
that all the deﬂection angles between intersected axial lines derived from one street are at
least 3.44◦. In other words, two valid intersected axial lines must have deﬂection angles
greater than 3.44◦. This criterion is used to cross-check those axial lines derived from dif-
ferent streets that still intersect each other. If the deﬂection angle between two intersected
lines is less than 3.44◦, they are replaced by one axial line. This process is somewhat
like generating continuity lines (Figueiredo and Amorim 2005). What is unique for our
approach is that all axial lines are generated under the same condition, which is statistically
determined.

Apart from the above procedure, we develop an additional function to detect round-
abouts. Initially roundabouts are for road safety purposes, but structurally they serve the
same purpose as street junctions. In this respect, we have to differentiate roundabouts
from ring roads based on their sizes. It is also important to note that roundabouts are very
common in European cities, but they hardly appear in North American cities.

3. Experiments on generating the axial lines
We choose six city street networks for the following experiments and these generated net-
works are adopted from a previous study (Jiang and Liu 2011). The six cities reﬂect typical
street patterns in the literature, representing different morphological structures (Jacobs
1995). The three North American cities are grid like and planned, while the three European
cities look irregular and self-evolved. All the street networks were downloaded from the
OSM databases. The street networks are shown in Figure 2. We ﬁrst create topological
relationships for the street networks. This has to be done since the original OSM data are
without topology, much like digitized lines without generated coverage – a topology-based
vector data format. Through the process of creating topology, all line segments will be
assigned a direction and become arcs that meet at nodes and have left and right polygons.
This can be easily done with some GIS software packages such as Environmental Systems
Research Institute’s ArcGIS. Next, based on the arc-based street networks, we generate
natural streets according to the every-best-ﬁt principle and parameter settings mentioned
in Section 2; the algorithmic functions can be found in Jiang et al. (2008). The natural
streets are visualized using a spectral color legend with red and blue, respectively, repre-
senting the highest and lowest local integration (Figure 3). Local integration is one of space
syntax metrics for characterizing integration or segregation of streets (Hillier 1996, Jiang
and Claramunt 2002). The classiﬁcation is based on Jenks’ (1967) natural break, so the
variation within classes is minimized, while the variation between classes is maximized.

while red lines are drawn last.

Before generating the axial lines, we need to verify whether the two parameters, the
baseline length d and ratio x/d, follow a heavy-tailed distribution including power law,
exponential, lognormal, stretched exponential, and power law with a cutoff (Clauset et al.
2009). It is found that the two parameters exhibit a striking lognormal distribution as shown
in Figure 4. This sets a prerequisite for using the head/tail division rule (Jiang and Liu
forthcoming) for the chopping process.

Next, based on the natural streets we automatically generate the axial lines according to
the parameter settings provided in Table 1. The axial lines are visualized according to local

It should be noted that the process of computing axial lines is pretty fast, thanks to some
efﬁcient data structure. It cost only 25 seconds to generate 40,000 lines for London, and a
few seconds for other axial maps (Table 1).

4. Results and discussion

Based on the above experiments, we ﬁnd that the connectivity of both axial lines and nat-
ural streets follow a lognormal distribution, which is one of the heavy-tailed distributions
(Clauset et al. 2009). This is in line with an earlier study (Jiang 2009), which claimed
a power-law-like distribution for the London axial lines deﬁned in the conventional way.
The heavy-tailed distribution implies that there are far more shorter (or less connected)
streets than longer (or well-connected) ones. It appears that the longest natural streets (in
red) are much more common (Figure 3) than the longest axial lines (in red) (Figure 5).
This is understandable since natural streets tend to aggregate more street segments than
axial lines. Considering this, it might come natural to consider the axial lines as a better
representation for capturing the underlying urban morphologies. This is because the fewer
the longest axial lines, the more memorable they are to city residents (Miller 1956, Tomko
et al. 2008). This point is applicable to the comparison between European cities and North
American cities, that is, there are fewer longest streets in European cities than in North
American cities. We believe that the fewer longest streets in European cities tend to shape
our mental maps better than the more longest streets in North American cities, simply
because (1) there are many longest streets in North American cities and (2) the longest
streets are somewhat with a similar length.

Let us take a more detailed look at the London axial map. There is already one manu-
ally drawn axial map based on the conventional deﬁnition of axial maps available at http://
eprints.ucl.ac.uk/1398/. Visual inspection of the two London axial maps, although the areas
covered are very different (Figure 6), indicates that both maps capture the urban morphol-
ogy well. For example, both the axial lines conventionally and newly deﬁned exhibit the
same lognormal distribution (Figure 7). More speciﬁcally, Oxford Street and those inter-
sected with it constitute the core of the pattern, so they are shown in red in the axial maps.
In the following, we will further make a comparison between the conventionally and newly
deﬁned axial lines from the point of view of capturing trafﬁc ﬂow.

which have been used previously in a study (Hillier et al. 1993) to verify whether the
new axial lines’ space syntax metrics correlate with the trafﬁc ﬂow. There are a range
of space syntax metrics among which local integration is one of the best indicators of
trafﬁc ﬂow. It should be noted that the observed data are of pedestrian ﬂows captured in
individual gates allocated in some street segments. This is not a perfect data set, since not
every street segment along a street has a gate. For example, some very long axial lines (or
natural streets) covering or consisting of many street segments have only a couple of gates.
However, it has been used as a benchmark data set in the literature. Given the imperfectness

of the data, we could not expect a very good correlation between location integration and
trafﬁc ﬂow.

We manually pinpoint the individual gates in the new axial lines and the natural streets.
Eventually, we obtain the R2 values between local integration and pedestrian ﬂow for the
three representations: new axial lines, old axial lines, and natural streets as shown in
Table 2. In addition, we run a t-test indicating the correlation is statistically signiﬁcant.
From Table 2 and the t-test, we can conclude that the new axial lines capture well the
pedestrian ﬂow, at least as good as the old axial lines or natural streets. However, given
the fact that generation of the new axial lines can be done automatically, the newly deﬁned
axial lines are a better representation than the old or conventional ones.

We have illustrated that new axial lines and old axial lines are very similar at a global
scale in terms of capturing the underlying structural patterns and trafﬁc ﬂow. However, we
note that some new axial lines are better justiﬁed than the corresponding old axial lines;
refer to Figure 8 for some highlighted axial lines in black. Obviously, the number of the
new axial lines is fewer than that of the old axial lines. From the criteria of the least set of
lines, the new axial lines are valid while the old axial lines are invalid. This can explain the
fact shown in Table 2 that some correlation coefﬁcients for the new axial lines are higher
than those for the old axial lines and natural streets. The key point here is that if an axial
map is not consisting of the least set of the lines, then it cannot be claimed to be a valid
axial map. Thus the axial map’s ability to predict trafﬁc ﬂow is signiﬁcantly reduced. This
is like the continuity lines (Figueiredo and Amorim 2005) and angular segment analysis
(Turner 2007), which are better than the original axial lines in predicting trafﬁc ﬂow.

To this point, we have provided evidence that the newly deﬁned axial lines can be an
alternative representation of the conventional axial lines and of the natural streets. We have
seen that the new axial lines could be a better alternative representation in capturing the

5. Conclusion

This article redeﬁned axial lines from the perspective of the walkability or drivability of
streets or street networks rather than being based on the visibility between buildings or
any spatial obstacles in cities. We have illustrated that this perspective makes better sense
when generating axial lines at the city level. We deﬁne axial lines as the least set of rela-
tively straight lines that are mutually intersected along individual natural streets. The new
deﬁnition is less ambiguous compared with the conventional one. Based on this new per-
spective and deﬁnition, we develop an automatic solution for generating the axial lines for
large cities. To our surprise, some thresholds related to curviness of natural streets can be
determined by the head/tail division rule (Jiang and Liu forthcoming), since they exhibit a
heavy-tailed distribution. We conduct a comparison study between the new axial lines and
the old axial lines and between the new axial lines and natural streets. We have proved that
the axial line representations are a powerful tool for urban studies just as Wagner (2007)
indicated in his study on conventional axial lines.

We have illustrated through experiments and a comparison study that the new axial
lines can capture the underlying urban morphologies just as good as the conventional axial
lines and natural streets. Unlike the old axial lines, the new axial lines are deﬁned without
ambiguity. Both new and old axial lines seem to be based on the same principle of spatial
perception, in terms of either visibility or drivability. On the other hand, the natural streets,
like named streets identiﬁed by unique names, seem to be based on the spatial cognition for
their deﬁnition or generation. We could remark that both axial lines (new or old) and streets
(natural or named) are modeled from different perspectives, but they can all essentially
capture the underlying urban morphology if they are correctly derived. In this respect, a
ring road is represented as one street, but it is chopped into many axial lines. However,
from the point of view of auto-generation, both the new axial lines and natural streets show
a striking advantage to the old axial lines.

Abstract
Advances in computer technologies have improved the quality of maps, making map comparison and
analysis easier, but uncertainty and error still exist in GIS when overlaying geographic data with multiple
or unknown conﬁdence levels. The goals of this research are to review current geospatial uncertainty lit-
erature, present the Error-Band Geometry Model (EBGM) for classifying the size and shape of spatial
conﬁdence intervals for vector GIS data, and to analyze the interpretability of the model by looking at
how people use metadata to classify the uncertainty of geographic objects. The results from this research
are positive and provide important insight into how people interpret maps and geographic data. They
suggest that uncertainty is more easily interpreted for well deﬁned point data and GPS data. When data is
poorly deﬁned, people are unable to determine an approach to model uncertainty and generate error-
bands. There is potential for using the EBGM to aid in the development of a GIS tool that can help indi-
viduals parameterize and model spatial conﬁdence intervals, but more research is needed to reﬁne the
process by which people use the decision tree. A series of guiding questions or an “uncertainty wizard”
tool that helps one select an uncertainty modeling approach might improve the way people apply this
model to real-world applications.

1 Introduction

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology has revolutionized the way scientists study
the Earth, but its expansion has brought to light inherent and operational factors that lead to
uncertainty in geospatial data and GIS analyses. This uncertainty is a major concern within the
GIS and GIScience community (Goodchild 2010) because GIS is a tool used for overlaying
geospatial data, for inference, and for estimation about geographic phenomena. Many
advances have been made over the last 30 years in communicating and modeling the uncer-
tainty of spatial data, yet some procedures, such as estimating conﬁdence intervals for the
coordinates of a geographic feature, remain difﬁcult because data that are spatial rarely have
frequency distributions for coordinates, can be mobile, or are areal. Other complications with
GIS analyses exist because data are overlaid having different scopes, times, classes, accuracies
and precisions, which leads to vast uncertainties in geospatial data fusion (Burrough 1986;
Goodchild 2000; Plewe 2002; Fisher et al. 2005). Therefore, the methods and interpretation of
GIS estimates must evolve to capture and communicate uncertainty. Using spatial conﬁdence
intervals similar to conﬁdence intervals for non-spatial data is one potential approach to
model spatial uncertainty for use in GIS overlay processes.

Fisher et al. (2005) present a well developed uncertainty classiﬁcation scheme, where dif-
ferent mathematical approaches are suggested for modeling uncertainty based on the proper-
ties of geographic objects. This model adapted from Klir and Yuan (1995), is useful for
conceptualizing uncertainty modeling, but it does not have tools associated with it to
parameterize uncertainty or compute spatial conﬁdence intervals. There is potential to
parameterize uncertainty using APIs such as the UncertML (Williams et al. 2008), but no
current linkages between that framework and Fisher et al. (2005) exist. Furthermore, neither
of the previous works address uncertainty in overlays, such as the research by Du et al. (2005)
on the 9-intersect overlay model.

For a simple example of why this is important, consider the uncertainty of GIS data using
probabilities. If you have four layers that are 95% accurate and follow simple probability
under the assumption of independence, the conﬁdence in the output is only 82% (0.954 =
0.815). For eight layers, the conﬁdence decreases to 66%. This logic and the concerns over the
reliability of GIS analyses spawned various data quality standards and policies that attempted
to institutionalize the management of geospatial data uncertainty and standardize metadata
(USBB 1947; ASPRS 1990; FGDC 1998; ISO19157 2013). However, a major obstacle
remains. Most depictions of geographic information are single realizations that rely on a
sample of one, limiting options for statistical analysis.

In model construction, it is expected that estimates will have measures of conﬁdence.
However, GIS models are limited by data, small sample sizes, and inadequate tools for quanti-
fying error. This makes it difﬁcult to answer questions such as: (1) what is the conﬁdence inter-
val for the mapped location of this parcel boundary? (2) How far away should the utility
company dig from the mapped location of the underground gas-line? (3) What is the margin of
error in the estimate of a forest stand’s acreage? Figure 1 illustrates a geographic boundary
with and without a hypothetical spatial conﬁdence interval, often referred to as an error-band
in GIS uncertainty literature. The realization that boundaries are not crisp and possibly inde-
terminate can lead to many questions in a GIS analysis (Burrough and Frank 1996).

The goals of this research are to review current uncertainty models, present the Error-
Band Geometry Model (EBGM) for classifying the size and shape of spatial conﬁdence

intervals for vector GIS data, and analyze how people use metadata to classify the uncertainty
of geographic objects. A thorough review and synthesis of GIS uncertainty literature led to the
development of an uncertainty classiﬁcation framework (Figure 2) that is based on the tax-
onomy of uncertainty proposed by Fisher et al. (2005), but expanded to include the EBGM. In
the current literature such models have been discussed theoretically and conceptually, but have
not been uniﬁed or practically tested. It is unclear how people use and interpret current models
for uncertainty classiﬁcation. In this research the interpretability of an uncertainty classiﬁca-
tion framework was tested via experimental evaluation of GIS users classifying uncertainty
using summarized metadata and maps to simulate interaction with GIS data. The main ques-
tions addressed in the experimental evaluation are:

1. How do GIS users interpret metadata and select approaches for modeling uncertainty

from Figure 2a?

2. Can GIS users determine geospatial data error-band geometry from metadata (Figure 2b)?

Ultimately, the goal is to determine if the EBGM can be used to enhance geospatial data
fusion by understanding how people apply metadata and other geospatial data-quality infor-
mation to error-band generation. It is important to understand the interpretability of the
model by Fisher et al. (2005) and the EBGM before exploring methods to parameterize error-
band width and test whether the error-bands truly represent the margin of error. This research

takes a critical step forward in GIS research by applying GIS uncertainty theory to real-world
examples. A framework to guide uncertainty classiﬁcation which can be used to develop GIS
tools will enhance and expand GIS applications to many scientiﬁc problems.

2 Review of Modeling Error and Uncertainty Research

Uncertainty is unavoidable in GIS because the real world is diverse, complex, and dynamic. It
can arise in any of the following six aspects: lineage, positional uncertainty, attribute uncer-
tainty,
logical consistencies, completeness, and temporal uncertainty; and errors can be
random or systematic. Some uncertainties are inherent (inherent error) to spatial data while
others are introduced (operational error) through user input, generalization, or other subjec-
tive decisions (Leung et al. 2004a).

Early research in what is today GIS uncertainty focused on hard computing, for example
probability theory (Arthurs 1965), adjustment of observed data (Mikhail and Ackermann
1976), evidence theory (Shafer 1976), and spatial statistics (Cressie 1993). More speciﬁc to
spatial conﬁdence intervals was research on error/epsilon bands (Perkal 1956; Chrisman 1982;
Blakemore 1984), s-bands (Shi and Ehlers 1993; Shi 1994) and the g-donut (Dajun et al.
2003). Others discussed using systems that store the measurements themselves and not the
derived data (i.e. coordinates). These ideas led to measurement-based geographic information
systems (Buyong and Kuhn 1992; Goodchild 1999; Leung et al. 2004a). Unfortunately, there is
no such working system. Soft computer theories were also explored, for example, fuzzy logic
(Zadeh 1965), genetic algorithms (Zhang and Goodchild 2002), and sensitivity analysis
(Crosetto and Tarantola 2001). Others combined the hard and soft computing approaches, for
example, the cloud model combined randomness and fuzziness (Wang et al. 2003). Even with
the expansive literature and GIScientists’ devotion to understanding accuracy and error in GIS
data, there are no tools in general use for geospatial conﬁdence interval estimation. A notable
attempt is Brown and Heuvelink’s (2007) paper in which they released their Data Uncertainty
Engine (DUE). The engine is software for assessing and simulating uncertainty, but it is lacking
in GIS compatibility, is not intuitive, and cannot calculate spatial conﬁdence intervals in GIS.
In an effort to better deﬁne and represent the boundaries of the vector model Perkal pub-
lished the idea of utilizing bands or buffers to model uncertainty in 1956. The Epsilon Gener-
alization Model (EGM) uses circular bands to represent the level of conﬁdence in a boundary
(Figure 3). In the EGM, the margin of error is equal across the length of a line, meaning the
uncertainty is the same at the end and middle of the line. The EGM is conceptually easy to
understand, but it is limited in its scope by a lack of suitable methods for calculating the width
of the band, referred to as epsilon. Chrisman (1982) and Blakemore (1984) used the EGM to
study cartographic error and more speciﬁcally categorized error generically. For example, the
error of a digitized line is 1.5 m (refer to Jenks 1981 for a review of digitizing error).

Uncertainty Classiﬁcation and the Error-Band Geometry Model

Research that is more recent suggests using a normal or Gaussian distribution to simulate
error (Dutton 1992; Shi and Liu 2000). However, a major problem remains; the variance of
positional error for most spatial data is unknown. Monte Carlo simulation is one method to
generate probability density functions from which one can generate error-bands, but this
method still requires making assumptions (i.e. arbitrarily deﬁning the mean and variance).
Leung et al. (2004a) explored another error-band modeling approach, using the approximate
law of error propagation to generate covariance-based error-bands, but their model does not
work with coordinate-based GIS or derived products (Leung et al. 2004a). One last criticism
of most error-band models is they do not provide a gradient of conﬁdence levels: 90%, 95%,
and 99%. Probabilistic epsilon generation as explored by Honeycutt (1986) is a good example
of the inability to infer error from a sample of one, but none of these methods are available to
the average GIS user or analyst.

An alternative to the EGM is the fuzzy error-band model. It represents a probability-like
surface for locations in a continuous manner (Laviolette et al. 1995). The probability-like
values are created using “fuzzy set” membership that mimics human thinking and terms such
as “near” and “far” or “more” and “less”. In error-band applications, the values range from
0–1, much like a probability. Based on the type of topologic operation, the fuzzy values either
increase or decrease with distance extending outward from a boundary, point, or line. For
example, if you are trying to determine if a point is inside a polygon, by overlaying the point
with a fuzzy error-band the value of the point’s location can be identiﬁed (Wenbao et al.
2001). If the point value were a one (Figure 4a), this would indicate that location is inside the
polygon, but if it were a 0.25 (Figure 4b), you would be “less” certain. Figure 4 is an example
of a linear decreasing fuzzy error-band, so the values decrease with distance outward from the

Figure 5 Generalized error-band modeled from point errors of a non-generalized line

polygon boundary. Although the fuzzy error-band model has some advantages, people have
been hesitant to incorporate it in GIS tools because fuzzy logic is often based on subjective
decisions. Fuzzy set membership works by using a series of distance and standardizing equa-
tions, based on user input to provide fuzzy values.

Further development on error-bands included deriving the variance in the X and Y direc-
tions from an arbitrary point on a line segment based on the law of error propagation (Zhang
and Tulip 1990; Caspary and Scheuring 1992). Dutton (1992) used Monte Carlo simulation to
model the error distribution of geometric objects, but the above methods were not useful in a
GIS. Shi and Liu (2000) and Dajun et al. (2003), using strictly geometric methods, developed
the g-band and g-donut, respectively, which estimate error at points or vertices along a line to
compute the uncertainty of that line, as opposed to using the line itself. Shi (1994), used a
similar approach (s-band), but modeled thematic and positional uncertainty. These models
assume that errors occur at points and that the center of a line is actually more accurate than
the ends. This is problematic because it suggests more conﬁdence in a point’s location along a
line where points do not exist (i.e. the mid-point, Figure 5). In effect, it infers that places we do
not measure are more accurate than those we do measure. Geometry alone, however, does not
add processes such as line generalization to the equation, so such point-based models have
serious limitations.

Many methods to quantify the uncertainty of boundaries in vector GIS are available, but
the variety of approaches and failure to establish standards suggests that generating error-
bands for individual data is difﬁcult. A better approach may be setting error-band widths
based on categories of data or based on the needs of a GIS user. Couclelis (1996) developed a
typology for geographic boundaries in which 120 different types of boundaries were identiﬁed.
Boundary situations exist in three dimensions: (1) empirical nature of the data; (2) mode of
observation; and (3) user purpose. These dimensions and the examples of boundary categories
help in categorizing geospatial error, but do not mesh with the mathematics of calculating
error-band width and make programming a GIS tool labor intensive. Therefore, further explo-
ration into the basic geometry of error-bands follows with the presentation of the Error-Band
Geometry Model.

3 The Error-Band Geometry Model

A synthesis of error-band literature and a need for tools to model spatial conﬁdence intervals
in a GIS led to the development of the EBGM. It consists of eight simple categories (Figure 5),
based on geometry (point, line, and polygon) and relationships with other geographic objects
(uniform, non-uniform and segmented). The classes cover all two-dimensional GIS data, but
could have application to three-dimensional data.

Procedurally, a bivariate normal or Gamma distribution can be used to model the
uncertainty of coordinates in a GIS when it can be assumed the variance in the X and Y

this is not always
coordinates are the same. This results in circular error-bands, but
the case, making it possible that the error-bands could be elliptical in nature. For example,
GPS continuously operating reference stations (CORS) record error over time for both the X
and Y coordinate. Sometimes those numbers are not equal; therefore suggesting an error-
band for a CORS could be elliptical. For simplicity, the EBGM is presented under the
assumption that the X and Y variances are equal. Most data quality standards deal with
error at points and are good examples of point-uniform data for this model (Figure 6a;
USBB 1947; FGDC 1998). Other error-band applications expand on this concept by
constructing bands for individual points and connecting them to create line and polygon
buffers (Figures 6d and 6g; Dutton 1992; Shi and Liu 2000; Dajun et al. 2003; Love et al.
2007).

Speciﬁcally when dealing with point data, quality information is sometimes expressed in
metadata at the dataset level. For example, 95% of the points are within 3 m horizontal
positional accuracy. Following the framework, the point data have error-bands with uniform
geometry, i.e. the same width and shape for all the points. However, not all collections are
that simple. Frequent GPS users know the accuracy of each GPS point varies. The map in
Figure 7 illustrates the large variance in the margin of error for GPS recordings taken at
approximately the same time. This illustrates a situation in which point data are non-
uniform in their error-band geometry (Figure 6b). It is not possible for a topological connec-
tion to other points in a point dataset, and as a result, points never have segmented
geometry (Figure 6c).

reception

Lines and polygons are more complicated because they can be segmented and are fre-
quently generalized. The concern is that not all point locations (vertices) in geospatial lines are
known. The vector model dictates that we sample lines and generalize them, and therefore,
should model error for the smallest object with data quality information. For a generalized
line, it would not be its points, rather it is mostly likely to be the line feature or line dataset. A
useful method for generalized data is to model uncertainty at the dataset level (uniform,
Figure 6d). For example, you could construct error-bands for all the roads in a roads centerline
shapeﬁle.

Expanding on this concept, the model can be reﬁned to include non-uniform line error-
bands. For instance, if the roads shapeﬁle was a composite from different counties and one
county’s data was higher quality than the other counties, then the roads from each county
would have error-bands of different widths (Figure 6e). If the metadata allow, the line error-
band class can be further reﬁned to individual segments of individual lines. Imagine you are
digitizing roads for a layer in a GIS using orthophotography. At certain areas on the map, the
road is not visible due to tree canopy cover. Therefore, it is logical that you would be more
certain of the correct position of the line where it were clearly visible and less certain along the
segment of the line that was not visible (Figure 6f).

Leung et al. (2004a) illustrate how under different cases error-bands can take on different
shapes. The different shapes are critical to the segmented error-band geometry class, for

example some segments could be modeled with a uniform shape (line type, Figures 6f and 6i),
while others might have a wedge shape and be modeled using the error-band width of the end-
points (wedge type, Figures 6f and 6i). While polygons are topologically different from lines,
they are still collections of points and lines. The various shapes of polygon error-bands vary in
the same ways as lines (see Figures 6h and 6i; Leung et al. 2004b, Dajun et al. 2003, Love
et al. 2007), and line versus wedge types of segmented error-band geometry.

4 Evaluating Uncertainty Classiﬁcation and the EBGM

The review of literature and presentation of the EBGM provide a good base for uncertainty
classiﬁcation, but it is unclear how practical or useful these models are to people. To better
understand how people would use such models, we experimentally evaluated the ways in
which people interpret metadata and apply that information to uncertainty classiﬁcation and
the EBGM (Figure 2). Twenty-six students from an intermediate GIS class were administered
an Internet-based survey asking them to classify uncertainty for 12 examples of GIS data and
provide feedback (Figure 8). The test examples were constructed from typical GIS operations
or were published from various government and academic institutions. There were three sets
of tests with random question orders, and tests were distributed at random. The survey
involved viewing an image representing common GIS data and applications, answering
multiple-choice questions, and providing feedback. Speciﬁc deﬁnitions and instructions were
given to the test subjects.

The classiﬁcation system for the experiment had two categories related to Figure 2. Cat-
egory 1 (Figure 2a) captured data for the purpose of identifying uncertainty knowledge
(known or unknown), which records if a person has information about the uncertainty in an
example dataset (objective, useful in frequentist models), or has no previous knowledge about
uncertainty, but has a belief (subjective, useful in Bayesian and fuzzy models):

• Known: information on accuracy, precision, standard deviation, error, resolution or other
appropriate measure is provided with the data, or you feel comfortable estimating error –
the data is well deﬁned.

• Unknown: no information on accuracy, precision, etc. is provided or you are not comfort-
able estimating error and need assistance, but may have some beliefs – the data is poorly
deﬁned.

The second category is error-band geometry (Figure 2b), which classiﬁes data into three
categories (uniform, non-uniform, or segmented). For example, an NMAS-based dataset of
well-known points has a reported horizontal positional error, therefore the user should know
the error at the points, and because the error is at the dataset level the error-band geometry
should be uniform (e.g. all points with the same error-band width). In another case, the precise
locations for a boundary line between a forest stand and a defunct logging operation is difﬁ-
cult to determine as trees gradually return to clear-cut areas over time. This might require an
analyst to use “belief” that the boundary is in a particular location rather than having a meas-
ured value from which to estimate error.

Statistical analysis of the test subjects’ answers was conducted with JMP 9©, to look at
overall agreement, individual agreement on questions, response frequencies, and compute
agreement statistics using the Pareto platform. Signiﬁcance in agreement for each question was
tested using likelihood-ratio chi square tests and methods from Agresti and Coull (1998) and
Agresti (2002).

5 Results of the Uncertainty Classiﬁcation Experiment

Visual interpretation of the test subject’s responses using Figure 9, a mosaic bar chart, indi-
cates that several questions have a high percent agreement, meaning that people agreed on a
common uncertainty classiﬁcation. This suggests that the uncertainty classiﬁcation frame-
work has application to certain types of data, speciﬁcally well-deﬁned point data. The
mosaic is useful for comparative analysis, especially when referencing the response results to
individual questions (Figures 8 and 9). Question 1 had the highest level of agreement, which
was GPS ﬁre hydrant data with reported accuracy information. Question 9 had the lowest
level of agreement, which involved digitizing a landscape phenomenon that was poorly-
deﬁned or fuzzy.

Signiﬁcant agreement in the overall uncertainty classiﬁcation was found for seven of the
12 questions (Table 1). Known/Non-Uniform was the most common uncertainty classiﬁcation.
Results on individual categories show seven questions had signiﬁcant user agreement for
Category 1 (Table 1). Two of the 12 questions had signiﬁcant agreement for Category 2
(Table 1).

A more detailed examination relating to the properties of the data reveals an agreement
bias by geometry of the data. Point data had the highest frequency of statistically signiﬁcant
p-values for the likelihood ratio chi-square test (Table 1). All questions that mentioned GPS
had signiﬁcant agreement. Five of the seven questions with signiﬁcant results were well-deﬁned
objects related to utilities or infrastructure. The other two were government produced data
sets. One speciﬁcally mentions the NMAS (USBB 1947). Four of the ﬁve questions with no sig-
niﬁcant agreement can be classiﬁed as poorly-deﬁned objects, such as a forest boundary. The
exception was Question 5, which was a geocoding example.

6 Discussion and Conclusions

This article has provided an in-depth review of uncertainty and error-band models, and experi-
mentally tested how people might use these models to classify uncertainty. It is clear from the
experimental evaluation that uncertainty classiﬁcation is a difﬁcult task; however, people did
agree on a class under certain circumstances. This is where the importance lies. Just because

Uncertainty Classiﬁcation and the Error-Band Geometry Model

13

some questions lacked agreement should not detract from the signiﬁcance of the results; rather
it poses some interesting theoretical questions. For example, are there properties of the data
that make certain types of uncertainty harder to classify? In this research the answer is yes.
When the data referred to objects that were well-deﬁned, collected with GPS, or referenced a
data quality standard, people agreed on the uncertainty class. Alternatively, when the data
dealt with poorly-deﬁned objects, for example forest clearings and other areal boundaries,
people had a lack of agreement. This makes sense from an end-user standpoint because there
are many methods to model uncertainty when positional accuracy information is available or
the object can be considered rigid (Brown and Heuvelink 2007). For example, it is relatively
easy to model uncertainty of a survey or a building, but more difﬁcult for natural objects such
a lake, wetland, or areal boundary (Burrough and Frank 1996). What this means is that when
spatial data is poorly deﬁned, people cannot decide on a method to model uncertainty and
error-bands.

Another interesting ﬁnding was that agreement was not equal when comparing the two
categories of the uncertainty classiﬁcation framework. People agreed far more on Category 1
(uncertainty knowledge), which is related to the uncertainty scheme created by Fisher et al.
(2005). This in itself is important because there has been no research to evaluate how people
use Fisher’s uncertainty scheme. Our results suggest that it is a useful model for GIS analysts,
and that there is potential to incorporate that decision tree into a GIS tool. However,
further research needs to be performed to determine if people can differentiate between ambi-
guity, vagueness, discord and non-speciﬁcity. More research opportunities include analyzing a
person’s decision to use frequentist, Bayesian or fuzzy logic approaches to error-band width
computations.

The results on Category 2 (error-band geometry) were not all signiﬁcant but still informa-
tive. The EBGM lacked agreement on a majority of the survey questions, suggesting that
people have a harder time applying metadata to a model for spatial conﬁdence interval genera-
tion. This might be because the concept of conﬁdence intervals for spatial data is somewhat
confusing and not common in commercial GIS applications. It could be that not all situations
require uncertainty be modeled with an error-band, or that the type of analysis dictates the
error-band approach to be used. It should be noted that the two questions with agreement
were GPS examples. Many mobile applications such as Google Maps now show error-bands
around a GPS location. This exposure might explain why agreement was higher than the non-
GPS examples. It also supports that uncertainty might be best modeled at the point level, even
for lines and polygons as suggested by Shi and Liu (2000) and Dajun et al. (2003). There needs
to be further exploration into EBGM to link properties of the data and the analysis to EBGM
classes. A series of guiding questions or an “uncertainty wizard” tool that helps one select an
uncertainty modeling approach might improve user agreement and make these concepts easier
to understand for the analyst.

One could speculate as to why agreement varies with geometry and why the test subjects’
agreement varied, but the greater importance of this framework is that it provides a systematic
structure to model uncertainty in geospatial data. If spatial conﬁdence intervals can be created
for various datasets, that information can be used in the data fusion process, thereby allowing
the analyst to easily compute the conﬁdence of overlay operations. For example, a city engi-
neer might be concerned about the number of buildings that are in or out of a ﬂoodplain given
the uncertainty of the data. In that example there are two layers, which results in nine realiza-
tions of an overlay because there is a “mean” inner and outer boundary for each layer. There-
fore, the potential for different outcomes in any overlay is 3x, where x = the number of layers.
This means uncertainty is compounded as the number of layers increase. Being able to

visualize the different outcomes of overlays using spatial conﬁdence intervals and having tools
to do such operations would greatly enhance GIS analyses. However, for that to happen the
storage of geospatial data accuracy needs to advance beyond the overall statistics used in
metadata and be attributed at both the feature and segment level. These recommendations
follow closely with the idea of measurement-based GIS (Buyong and Kuhn 1992; Goodchild
1999; Leung et al. 2004a), but always having the original measurements is not a reality so
there needs to be alternatives.

Another area for future research is to explore if people can estimate spatial conﬁdence
intervals given the absence of metadata. However, there are limited tools to conduct such
research. One potential tool is Brown and Heuvelink’s (2007) DUE, the closest working
system for the issues addressed in this article, but it lacks a spatial conﬁdence interval compo-
nent. This research takes the DUE and the research by Fisher et al. (2005) a step further by
trying to implement a methodical process for creating and visualizing conﬁdence intervals in a
GIS. Even with that ability, there is still no protocol for using conﬁdence intervals in the
overlay process, indicating another area for future research.

The results from this research provide important insight into how people interpret maps
and geographic data. There is potential to use the EBGM to aid in the development of a GIS
tool that can help individuals parameterize and model spatial conﬁdence intervals, but more
research is needed to reﬁne the process by which people use the decision tree. Only when we
can pair the human dimension with quantitative spatial measurements will it be possible to
generate meaningful and useful spatial conﬁdence intervals for geospatial data that can be used
in GIS overlay operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL CORRELATES
WITH VIOLENT INJURY

Violence is a significant contributor to the global burden of injury, posing a public health challenge.
With the goal of informing policy decisions, this work uses a combination of GIS and environmental scans
to  identify  features  of  the  built  environment  that  correlate  with  areas  of  high  violent  injury  incidence.
Hotspots in the Metro Vancouver area were identified using kernel density estimation. Possible environmental
correlates  to  violent  injury  were  culled  from  a  detailed  literature  review;  teams  then  travelled  to  each
hotspot to record which of the correlates were present (e.g., alcohol-serving establishments, high density
housing). Several suspected features of the built urban environment were found to be present in the majority of
hotspots, the most prevalent being alcohol-serving establishments. Using the Vancouver Area Neighbourhood
Deprivation Index, a high proportion of hotspots were found to be in or near socially deprived neighbour-
hoods. However, the findings suggest that violent injury is a geographically complex phenomenon whose links
to the built environment are multiscalar and varied. First steps are taken towards developing profiles of violent
urban spaces, with ultimate goal of making our cities safer physical and social spaces.

La violence est un contributeur important au fardeau mondial des blessures et représente un défi pour la
santé publique. Dans le but de documenter les décisions stratégiques, le présent article utilise une combi-
naison de SIG et d’analyses environnementales pour recenser les caractéristiques de l’environnement bâti qui
correspondent à des régions où il y a une incidence élevée de blessures causées par des actes de violence. Des
points névralgiques dans le secteur du district régional du Grand Vancouver ont été recensés en utilisant
l’estimation de densité par noyaux. Des correspondances environnementales possibles avec des blessures
causées par des actes de violence ont été extraites d’une revue détaillée de la littérature; des équipes se sont
ensuite rendues dans chacun des points névralgiques pour enregistrer les correspondances qui étaient pré-
sentes (p. ex., des débits d’alcool, des ensembles d’habitation à haute densité). On a découvert la présence
de nombreuses caractéristiques soupçonnées de l’environnement urbain bâti dans la majorité des points
névralgiques, les plus prévalents étant les débits d’alcool. En utilisant l’indice de privation des quartiers du
secteur de Vancouver, on a constaté qu’une proportion élevée des points névralgiques se situait dans ou à
proximité de quartiers socialement défavorisés. Toutefois, les conclusions suggèrent que les blessures causées
par des actes de violence sont un phénomène géographique complexe dont les liens avec l’environnement bâti
sont  multiscalaires  et  variés.  Les  premières  mesures  sont  adoptées  pour  développer  des  profils  d’espaces
urbains violents, avec l’objectif final de rendre les espaces physiques et sociaux de nos villes plus sécuritaires.

The Burden of Injury

Falls, cuts, burns, gunshot wounds, and punch-
es  comprise  only  a  few  of  the  myriad  ways  in
which  a  person  can  be  injured. Altogether,  injuries
cause  30%  more  deaths  than  tuberculosis,  malaria,
and  HIV  combined,  and  representing  10%  of  total
global  mortality  [WHO 2006].  Injury  is  also  the
fourth leading cause of death in Canada and the lead-
ing cause of death for Canadians ages 1 to 44, con-
stituting  a  significant,  yet  often  overlooked,  public
health problem [Nantulya and Reich 2002; Smartrisk
2005;  Public  Health  Agency  of  Canada 2006].  In
this paper, we expand upon geographic methods for
identifying drivers of injury and present the results
of our findings in the Metro Vancouver region. 

Contrary to common perception, injury is not a
random occurrence; it is strongly correlated in space
and time [Dovey 2000]. Areas of high injury inci-

dence, known as hotspots, have been directly linked
to  features  of  the  built  environment  [Dovey 2000;
Schuurman et al. 2009]. For example, high numbers
of injuries are found near alcohol-serving establish-
ments  [Taylor  et  al.  2011].  The  built  environment
has been shown to have significant effects on human
behaviours  and  events  [Maghelal  and  Capp 2011].
As such, injury can be driven both by human behav-
iours (e.g., a bar fight) and inherent environmental
risk (e.g., high traffic levels at an intersection). An
enhanced  understanding  of  how  these  phenomena
manifest in space is necessary to inform proactive,
targeted policy interventions to reduce the econom-
ic,  social,  political,  personal,  and  medical  dimen-
sions of the burden imposed by injury.

Injury and the Social-
Physical Environment

Social  deprivation  has  often  been  shown  to
conform  to  geographical  patterns  [e.g.,  Pacione
1995; Pearce et al. 2006; Bell et al. 2007; Maroko et
al. 2009; Green et al. 2011]. Furthermore, it has been
shown in the literature that areas of social depriva-
tion experience higher relative rates of injury [Bell et
al.  2009;  Hameed  et  al.  2010;  Schuurman  et  al.
2010]. Among early investigations of injury found in
the  literature  (notably,  Read [1969]),  the  majority
focus is on victim demographics [e.g., Goodwin and
Hutchinson 1977; Todd and Walker 1980; Wolfe and
O’Day 1981]. Other researchers have examined the
relationship between injury and features of the built
environment. However, the social and physical per-
spectives  intersect  in  urban  space,  where  they  are
widely  recognised  as  being  covariates;  that  is,  the
built urban environment tends to reflect socio-eco-
nomic characteristics of its denizens and vice-versa. 
Research examining features of the built envi-
ronment  has  accelerated  in  recent  decades,  with
numerous  potential  correlates  to  injury  identified
and  potential  patterns  of  causation  described
[Brantingham  and  Brantingham 1993;  Koepsell  et
al. 2002; Retting et al. 2003; Schuurman et al. 2009;
Caplan  et  al.  2010].  In  tandem,  efforts  are  being
made to conceptualise features of the built environ-
ment  in  methodological  terms,  that  is,  how  our
understanding  and  perception  of  the  environment
can  produce  meaningful  findings  towards  reducing
the  burden  of  injury.  For  example,  Maghelal  and
Capp [2011] present a list of variables related to fea-
tures  of  the  built  urban  environment  that  affect
pedestrian behaviours, but also include a classifica-
tion of variables. Their classification scheme distin-
guishes between objective (e.g., lighting, land-use),
subjective (e.g., odour, noise, sense of security), and
distinctive  (e.g.,  pedestrian-friendly  area,  clear  line
of sight) observable phenomena. This is particularly
useful for determining which potential correlates to
injury can be objectively assessed.

Environmental Scan

In this work, we identify features of the built
environment  present  in  areas  of  high  injury  inci-
dence.  Following  the  protocol  established  by
Schuurman et al. [2009] we refer to this process as
an  ‘environmental  scan’.  Originating  in  the  busi-
ness literature [e.g., Gordon and Narayanan 1984;

Bryson 1989], this term has come to encompass a
range  of  methods  for  identifying  and  evaluating
external  factors  influencing  a  variety  of  organisa-
tions [Abels 2002; Graham et al. 2008]. Schuurman
et al. [2009] apply this concept within a geograph-
ical  realm  to  contextualise  pedestrian  injury  as
influenced  by  features  of  the  built  environment;
this method was also used by Dai et al. [2010]. In
this  work,  we  apply  the  environmental  scan  tech-
nique  to  interpersonal  violence  hotspots,  detected
using  a  novel  method.  This  environmental  scan
methodology can be conceptualised using Wilson’s
‘street  subjects’
[2011] 
(observers,  characterised  as  cyborgs  [Schuurman
2002; 2004]) examined the built urban environment
to  code  (classify)  ‘street  objects’  (features  of  the
built environment). An immediate limitation is the
definition  and  interpretation  of  street  objects  as
subjective functions of an observer’s own percep-
tion of objects in space-time. That is, one’s classifi-
cation  of  an  object  may  differ  from  another’s. As
such, the prescription of well-defined criteria is of
benefit, as is observer training [Wilson 2011].

framework,  where 

Interpersonal Violence

In this work, we focus on injury as the result of
interpersonal violence, which has been shown to be
a  significant  contributor  to  the  global  burden  of
injury  [Nantulya 2002;  Mair  and  Mair 2003;
Smartrisk 2005]. Interpersonal violence is defined in
the literature as “intentionally inflicted bodily harm,
injury, or death” [Brink 1998, 38]. Every year, over
1.6 million people die as the result of interpersonal
violence, and in 2000 the global mortality rate attrib-
utable to interpersonal violence was 8.8 per 100 000
[WHO 2002]. Homicide alone accounts for at least
eleven  per  cent  of  injury-related  deaths  worldwide
[WHO 2006]. Such statistics fail to include unreport-
ed  violent  incidents;  the  true  figures  are  certainly
much greater. Regardless, it is indisputable that vio-
lence  is  a  significant  public  health  problem  [Mair
and Mair 2003].

Significant  geographical  disparities  in  inter-
personal  violence  risk  exist  at  multiple  scales.
Globally, the highest homicide rates are concentrat-
ed in Latin America and Africa, where regionally, the
highest  rates  are  found  in  low-income  urban  areas
[Shaw-Taylor 2002; WHO 2006]. Violence incidence
is significantly higher in urban areas than suburban
and rural areas, due largely to uneven population dis-
tribution  [Nelson  et  al.  2001].  However,  some
authors  provide  evidence  of  higher  rates  (i.e.,  per

capita)  of  violence  in  rural  areas  [Osgood  and
Chambers 2000; Logan et al. 2003].

In  the  literature,  violence  is  primarily  studied
from four general disciplinary orientations. The psy-
chological, 
sociological,  and  criminological
approaches often use qualitative methods to describe
the various dimensions of violence [e.g., Casteel and
Peek-Asa 2000; Grossman 2009]. Critical, feminist,
and activist approaches are often driven by Marxist-
normative interpretations of violence and extrapola-
tion  of  these  concepts  beyond  medically-defined
phenomena.  For  example,  the  notion  of  ‘structural
violence’ provides a term for forms of real and per-
ceived oppression through social inequity [Galtung
1969; Meth 2004]. Medical and epidemiological per-
spectives  on  violence  comprise  quantified  clinical
analyses  of  violence,  including  spatial-analytical
approaches [e.g., Brink 1998]. Drawing upon these
three orientations is the fourth: public health and pol-
icy is concerned with the use of social and medical
health knowledges to inform decision-making [e.g.,
WHO 2010]. We position this work within the spa-
tial-epidemiological  realm,  drawing  upon  previous
research in the GIScience paradigm.

Sherman  et  al.  [1989]  identified  hotspots  of
criminal activity and spatially associated features of
the built environment, signalling an emergent focus
on urban form in the criminology literature. Several
years  later,  Brantingham  and  Brantingham [1993]
found that cognitive maps are useful tools for inves-
tigating criminal decision making. Their study iden-
tified perceived surveillance and anonymity as fac-
tors in opportunistic crime, concluding that the built
urban environment has a significant impact on these
factors and the overall geometry of criminal activity.
In 1995, they expanded upon this study to generate a
list  of  crime  generators  and  attractors. Braga  et  al.
[1999]  provide  an  extensive  set  of  environmental
features found within their study of fifty-six violent
injury  hotspots.  These  include  recreation  facilities,
high-density  housing,  transit  nodes,  convenience
stores, and homeless shelters. Alcohol availability is
widely considered to be a significant factor in inter-
personal  violence  incidence  [e.g.,  Norstrom 2000;
Gorman et al. 2001; Gruenewald and Remer 2006;
Livingston 2008; Mabunda et al. 2008; Branas et al.
2009; Taylor et al. 2011]. Zhu et al. [2004] examined
the effectiveness of alcohol outlet density and socio-
economic  status  as  predictors  of  interpersonal  vio-
lence, finding both to be effective at census tract res-
olution.  They  also  found  strong  covariation,  addi-
tional evidence of the codependence between social
and physical urban geographical features. Lighting is
also associated with interpersonal violence, although
other  factors  tend  to  confound  its  apparent  effect

[Farrington  and  Welsh 2002;  Loomis  et  al.  2002;
Staunton et al. 2007]. Furthermore, in urban areas,
lighting tends to be highly localised (streetlights may
have an effect size of only ten metres).

Interpersonal violence is a significant contribu-
tor to the burden of injury locally and globally, soci-
etally  and  personally.  For  policymakers  to  address
this burden, the spatial nature of injury as the result
of interpersonal violence must be better understood.
Features  of  the  built  environment  associated  with
interpersonal violence are found in the literature, but
in  order  to  observe  them  the  injury  hotspots  must
first be located. For this, we present a novel analysis
method to identify and rank hotspots.

Hotspot Identification

Geographic information systems and the associ-
ated  quantitative  and  qualitative  spatial  analysis
techniques provide powerful tools to examine geo-
graphical data, identify trends, and create predictive
models. Such approaches have been used extensive-
ly in epidemiological research, including studies of
injury  [e.g.,  Gorman  et  al.  2001;  Livingston 2008;
Bell  and  Schuurman 2010;  Cusimano  et  al.  2010].
Numerous  techniques  can  be  used  to  examine  the
spatial-temporal distribution of injury. If an injury is
represented as a point in space-time, GIS can be used
to identify areas of high point density; the resulting
‘density  map’  displays  areas  of  high  incidence.
Caplan et al. [2010] create a three-dimensional rep-
resentation of firearm violence, where density values
are projected as elevations to produce a three-dimen-
sional terrain. On this type of map, the peaks repre-
sent centroids of firearm violence. We expand upon
this method to rank hotspots, as described below. In
the  literature,  the  most  common  spatial  analysis
technique  for  identifying  hotspots  is  kernel  density
estimation. This method creates a point density func-
tion  around  each  incident  location,  which  can  be
thought of as a hill. The peak of the hill corresponds
to the exact location of the incident and has the high-
est  density  value  (elevation). As  distance  from  the
peak increases, density value decreases until a user-
specified distance, at which point the density value
reaches  zero.  When  executed  for  multiple  points,
these  ‘hills’  vertically  accumulate  to  produce  an
interpolated terrain. 

In  order  to  determine  which  hotspots  are  sig-
nificant,  the  Jenks  algorithm  can  be  used.  This
technique  examines  the  resulting  density  values
(elevations)  and  identifies  natural  breaks  in  their
distribution. A natural break can be thought of as a

271

sudden change in a frequency distribution. The user
selects  a  number  of  desired  classes,  and  the  algo-
rithm determines at which values breaks occur. This
allows  the  user  to  identify  densities  reflecting  an
independent  pattern  from  the  rest  of  the  data.
However,  selection  of  the  number  of  classes  poses
challenges.  North [2009]  presents  an  algorithm  for
determining the optimal the number of classes, but
also  argues  that  ultimately,  the  user  should  select
exogenous  classes  that  reflect  the  number  of  influ-
ences the user is trying to identify. 

While the hotspot detection literature is mature,
there appears to be an emphasis on sophisticated sta-
tistical modelling and a deficit in the operationalisa-
tion of specific parameters. While algorithms for the
optimal bandwidths, natural breaks, and other inputs
are  calculable,  these  are  vulnerable  to  the  method-
ological fallacy of data driving data. An understand-
ing of the phenomena comprising the data is crucial
to selecting the most appropriate method and param-
eters. Often the selection of these is arbitrary or not
thoroughly  explained.  This  work  uses  a  unique
method  to  identify  the  most  significant  injury
hotspots, as explained in the methods section.

This literature review points toward a persistent
gap in methodological definition; that is, whether a
hotspot is a precise point in space-time, a statistical-
ly-delineated  region  in  Cartesian  space  [e.g.,  Di
Martino and Sessa 2011], or an exogenously-defined
area (e.g., an administrative district as per Bharti et
al. [2010]. Patil et al. [2008] define a hotspot as an
area  with  some  unusual  characteristic  of  interest.
While  spatial-statistical  methods  provide  powerful
visual  tools  for  identifying  hotspots,  contextual
information is crucial to interpreting and validating
the results. Expert opinion holds value in examining
the spatial-temporal distribution of data and identi-
fying hotspots. Unfortunately, there appears to be a
gap in the literature between research dependent on
statistical modelling and research focussing on qual-
itative  information.  That  said,  some  authors  do
bridge  the  gap.  For  example,  Taylor  et  al.  [2011]
consulted  the  Jacksonville  police,  who  identified
hotspots and provided valuable contextual informa-
tion. In spatial epidemiology, doctors and other med-
ical  personnel  are  often  listed  authors,  implying  a
contextualising  role  in  a  publication.  Qualitative
knowledge  about  interpersonal  violence  and  the
study  area  was  used  to  refine  hotspot  detection
parameters and locations.

Data and Methods

This  work  follows  the  protocol  developed  by
Schuurman et al. [2009]: hotspot identification and

environmental scan. Interpersonal violence hotspots
are  found  separately  within  Metro  Vancouver  (for-
merly  known  as  the  Greater  Vancouver  Regional
District).  Data  were  obtained  from  the  British
Columbia Trauma Registry and include all recorded
injuries  resulting  from  an  assault,  including  inten-
tional  gunshot.  Excluded  are  sports  injuries,  acci-
dental  firearms  discharge,  or  self-inflicted  injury.
Only  injuries  with  an  injury  severity  score  (ISS)
greater than 15 are used. The ISS scale [Baker et al.
1974] ranges from 0 to 75 and is derived by assess-
ing the severity of the worst injury to each body sec-
tion (head, face, chest, abdomen, extremities, exter-
nal  structures)  using  an  abbreviated  injury  score
(AIS ranges from 1 to 6, with 1 being minor and 6
being unsurvivable). The top AIS score from each of
the  three  most  severely  injured  body  sections  is
squared, the sum of which is the patient’s ISS score.
One  key  limitation  with  this  measure  is  that  it
includes only the worst injury on a body section, so
if  a  patient  is  assessed  with  two  projectile  wounds
through the chest, only the worst is considered, even
though  both  may  have  damaged  vital  organs.  The
data  comprise  points  representing  each  location  at
which  an  injury  incident  took  place  between
January  1,  2001,  and  December  31,  2008,  inclu-
sive.  Following  data  cleaning,  1332  interpersonal
violence injury points were mapped. 

Control  points  (i.e.,  randomly-generated  spots
to conduct environmental scans) were not included,
because  this  work  is  concerned  with  the  burden  of
injury  from  a  public  health  perspective.  That  is,
hotspots  should  identify  spaces  where  the  greatest
numbers of violent injuries occur so that the findings
may  be  used  to  address  the  total  burden  of  injury.
Hotspots were identified using kernel density esti-
mation in ArcGIS. Ripley’s K function was used to
determine  the  optimal  bandwidth.  The  resulting
density map was reprojected as a 3D ‘injury terrain’.
The  hotspot  ranking  system  is  best  explained  by
analogy,  where  the  injury  terrain  is  flooded  like  a
virtual  lake,  until  all  peaks  (hotspots)  are  sub-
merged. The water level is gradually lowered until
one island appears, representing the ‘hottest’ injury
hotspot. This first peak to appear is ranked number
one. The water level is gradually lowered, and each
subsequently emerging peak is given a rank. In this
way, each hotspot was ranked according to its peak
density  value.  The  top  thirteen  hotspots  were
selected  for  further  investigation,  as  a  large  break
was observed between the thirteenth and fourteenth
hotspot  peak  density  values,  identified  using  the
Jenks algorithm in ArcGIS.

Injury and violence literatures were consulted to
produce lists of suspected environmental correlates

to  interpersonal  violence,  listed  in  Table  A.  These
features  are  used  to  construct  matrices  of  known
potential  correlates.  The  matrices  were  then  taken
into the field to record which features are present at
each  of  the  thirteen  hotspots  (within  100  metres
Manhattan distance from the hotspot centroid). This
phase was conducted in teams of four, each member
of which made independent observations. In order to
test  the  aforementioned  association  between  injury
and  social  deprivation,  injury  hotspots  were  classi-
fied  using  the  Vancouver  Area  Neighbourhood
Deprivation Index (VANDIX), developed by Bell et
al. [2007]. This index was developed in consultation
with  medical  health  officers,  who  ranked  socio-
economic  indicators  of  deprivation  in  Vancouver
(for more information, see Bell, et al. [2007]). The

thirteen hotspots were mapped over neighbourhoods
classified  into  quintiles  according  to  their  overall
VANDIX  score.  The  findings  were  tested  against
random  distributions  using  randomly-generated
points created using ArcGIS.

Results

Interpersonal violence injury locations appear
to cluster in low-income neighbourhoods and dense
urban areas. Ripley’s K function was used to esti-
mate the optimal bandwidth for kernel density esti-
mation for the injury points. Measuring clustering
at  five  metre  intervals,  from  zero  to  1000  metres,

this method found a logarithmic increase difference
between observed and expected clustering, extend-
ing  far  beyond  1000  metres,  meaning  that  spatial
clustering  becomes  increasingly  significant  as
bandwidth  increases.  However,  larger  bandwidths
were  found  to  produce  hotspots  that  do  not  accu-
rately  reflect  injury  locations.  That  is,  many
derived  hotspots  appeared  between  incident  clus-
ters,  not  accurately  reflecting  actual  areas  of  high
injury  incidence.  Additionally,  because  this  work
concerns  features  of  the  built  environment,  small,
observable areas must be identified. A disturbance
in the clustering pattern was found for bandwidths
between 90 and 105 metres. This may be indicative
of an underlying scalar variable attributable to het-
erogeneity  between  neighbourhoods  or  the  built
structure  of  urban  areas.  (e.g.,  intersection  spac-
ing/block size). As such, a bandwidth of 100 metres
was selected for KDE. The resulting output was pro-
jected as a 3D ‘injury terrain’, where the peaks rep-
resent violent injury hotspots (as shown in figure 1). 
Environmental scans were conducted in the top
thirteen  interpersonal  violence  injury  hotspots.  It
was found that twelve of the thirteen violent injury
hotspots  contained  at  least  one  alcohol-serving
establishment.  Over  three-quarters  of  all  interper-
sonal violence hotspots were near high-density res-
idential housing, and 84% of were near commercial
and mixed commercial/residential land use parcels.
Twelve  of  the  thirteen  hotspots  were  contained  a
transit node (bus stop or metro station). Adult busi-

nesses (e.g., sex shops, dedicated pornography out-
lets, exotic cabarets) were found within six hotspots,
and public restrooms within ten. Homeless shelters
were also found in 38% of the interpersonal violence
hotspots. In combination, these features illustrate the
quintessential  economically  marginalised  inner-city
neighbourhood  [Brantingham  and  Brantingham
1995;  Taylor  et  al.  2011].  These  findings  coincide
with those in the literature.

To  examine  the  relationship  between  violent
injury and socioeconomic deprivation, the VANDIX
was  used. All  thirteen  hotspots  were  mapped  over
neighbourhoods classified into quintiles according to
their  overall  VANDIX  score.  It  was  found  that
twelve  of  thirteen  hotspots  are  within  or  border
neighbourhoods in the two most deprived quintiles.
This,  when  compared  to  an  average  of  three  ran-
domly-generated hotspots, indicates significance in
the spatial association between neighbourhood dep-
rivation  and  violent  injury  incidence.  However,
there is no direct evidence in the data suggesting that
the residents of deprived neighbourhoods are those
engaging in violent behaviours, so caution must be
made to avoid this inference. A more suitable basis
for  explanation  lies  in  the  broken  windows  cycle
[Doran  and  Lees 2005],  where  people  within  a
decaying urban environment (not necessarily resi-
dents)  are  more  likely  to  engage  in  destructive  or
antisocial behaviours.

There  was  one  noteworthy  exception  to  this
emerging  geographical  pattern  of  violent  spaces.

Vancouver’s  nightclub  district  features  the  second
hottest violent injury hotspot. However, it does not
contain any adult businesses, homeless shelters, or
abandoned housing, nor does it border any socially
deprived neighbourhoods. This case is attributable
to the spatially and temporally concentrated nature
of alcohol supply, consumption, and patronage, fur-
ther elevating violent injury risk. Additional analy-
sis  contrasting  time  of  day  may  provide  further
insight into this pattern. Such spaces form a second
urban  profile  of  violent  injury,  suggesting  that
another  important  feature  may  be  the  spatial/tem-
poral concentration of pedestrian traffic.

Limitations

The data include only incidents reported at local
trauma hospitals. As such, these data certainly under-
represent  domestic  violence.  Excluded  are  injuries
with an injury severity score less than 15 and those
injuries that resulted in a fatality prior to admission to
a trauma  centre.  As  the  incidental  difference
between  injury  and  severe  injury  is  an  often  an
arbitrary difference of millimetres or milliseconds,
fatal  and  non-fatal  injuries  were  equally  weighted.
Another  concern  rests  with  the  temporality  of  the
data,  in  that  they  comprise  an  eight-year  range.
Features  observed  in  March  2012  may  not  have
been present when a particular incident took place.
GIS-based  hotspot  detection  incurs  implicit
assumptions  about  space,  which  may  affect  the
validity  of  resulting  representations.  For  example,
kernel  density  estimation  assumes  a  uniform
Cartesian space and no directionality. Steenberghen
et al. [2010] discovered that KDE tends to overde-
tect  clustering  along  roadways  (and  Okabe  et  al.
[2008]  developed  a  network-constrained  GIS  tool
to  counteract  this  problem,  used  by  Dai  et  al.
[2010]). It cannot be assumed that the standard ker-
nel  is  an  appropriate  model  for  injury  density
(Okabe et al. [2009] also counteract this problem,
but it is not addressed in this article). 

The  only  hotspot  not  containing  an  alcohol-
serving  establishment  was  found  to  be  across  the
street  from  a  prison.  However,  the  prison  popula-
tion  is  not  included  in  our  dataset,  nor  does  this
neighbourhood  fit  the  profile  of  a  violent  urban
space. It would appear that this hotspot may have
been  the  result  of  a  detection  anomaly,  as  it  had
fewer  injury  points  in  its  vicinity  than  the  others.
However, it is possible that social or environmental
correlates exist as the hotspot region but are simply
not  yet  identified  by  researchers.  Further  analysis
of  this  hotspot  may  reveal  a  missing  variable,

although the sample size within this dataset is not
sufficient  to  support  any  inferences. The  presence
of this hotspot illustrates the potential fallibility of
KDE  as  a  hotspot  detection  method.  Further
research  will  compare  KDE  to  other  methods  to
determine which is most appropriate for identifying
injury clusters.

Significance of Findings

Through  this  work,  we  have  confirmed  the
spatial association between violent injury and sus-
pected  features  of  the  built  environment  from  the
literature.  Most  prevalent  are  alcohol-serving
establishments,  high-density  housing,  and  transit
nodes; social deprivation also appears to be a key
predictor.  However,  characterisation  of  violent
spaces in the Canadian city requires a more holistic
view  of  the  built  and  social  urban  landscape.
Subsequent  work  will  examine  combinations  of
features  and  socio-economic  indicators  to  expand
upon  and  refine  profiles  of  violent  urban  spaces.
However,  caution  must  be  taken  not  to  automati-
cally  assume  causation  between  features  of  the
built  environment,  social  deprivation,  and  violent
injury.  Furthermore,  one  must  not  overstate  the
presence  of  violence  in  deprived  neighbourhoods,
at  peril  of  further  marginalising  these  spaces  and
contributing to the broken windows cycle.

Most  disconcerting  was  the  extreme  violent
injury incidence found in the Downtown East Side
neighbourhood of Vancouver. This skews the entire
distribution of densities, leading to an underrepre-
sentation  of  hotspots  in  other  areas.  More  impor-
tantly, the sheer volume of injury that occurs in this
neighbourhood injects urgency into this research.

This work is intended to underscore the value
of GIScience methodologies in public health. Such
approaches not only allow researchers to study spa-
tial-temporal patterns, but also comprise a multidi-
mensional,  integrative  vision  of  space  that  lends
itself to informing decisions about urban policy.

Historical maps are vital tools for landscape reconstruction from the late medieval period onwards. However, the
planimetric accuracy of local and regional maps before the nineteenth century is often considered problematic. This paper
proposes a method for the evaluation of these maps, through integration in multiple computer programs such as ArcGIS,
MapAnalyst and statistical software (SPSS). This method has been tested on a sample of historical maps depicting
coastal landscape change in an area at the present-day Dutch-Belgian border (ranging from the local to the supra-regional
level and from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries), and variations in planimetric accuracy over time have been
interpreted. Results point to an exceptionally high accuracy of earlier medium- and large-scale maps – scale being the first
determinant of planimetric accuracy – since no significant rise in accuracy over time was found. Notwithstanding this
overall accuracy, many maps display pronounced local distortions. However, rather than disqualifying maps for landscape
reconstruction, systematic analysis of these distortions can help to facilitate the interpretation of the historical maps and
their use for landscape reconstruction. Finally, a method for integrating map accuracies in landscape reconstructions
based on multiple maps is proposed and illustrated.

INTRODUCTION

landscape evolution,
For spatio-temporal modelling of
research usually relies on three types of data, depending
on the time-frame chosen for the analysis. For more recent
landscape evolutions (in both the last decades and century),
accurate sources like satellite data, aerial photography,
digital elevation data, etc. are available, while long-term (for
instance covering the Holocene) evolutions can be studied
through the soil archive or using geophysical methods.1 For
mid-term analysis (from about 1400 to the present) we
dispose of a valuable alternative: historical maps. Although
historical maps, especially those older than 1850, are often
admired as pieces of art, they are scarcely used as sources to
reconstruct landscape change in the past mainly because of
their heterogeneous quality and the uncertainty regarding
scales, projections, mapping techniques, and conditions
of surveying. One vital component of the quality and
usefulness of
the planimetric
accuracy, regarded as a key part of overall cartographical
accuracy (Hu, 2010; Jenny and Hurni, 2011; Manzano-
Agugliaro et al., 2013). Before using these maps, one

prime importance for archaeologists,
and environmental scientists. Historical maps are often the
most important sources particularly for those features that
are no longer visible in the landscape but which might
remain, however, preserved underground. In this article we
will present a time-efﬁcient method of assessing the accuracy
of historical maps because, we will argue, accuracy-assess-
ment could signiﬁcantly enhance the potential of historical
maps for landscape reconstruction. Furthermore, our sample
data also indicate that the (planimetric) accuracy of older
local maps, produced before 1850 often (but not always)
equal the level of accuracy reached in the nineteenth century.
This, again presents a convincing argument for the integra-
tion of such older and often overlooked maps in landscape
analysis, archaeology, history, and planning, provided that
their accuracy has been assessed.

The test-case developed in this article focuses on coastal
landscapes. Coastal areas are often prone to rapid change
either induced by natural processes such as changes in sea-
level or sediment distribution, or due to often intense
human pressure, something which seems to have been a
permanent feature of many coastal areas over the last two
millennia. The challenge of anthropogenic sea-level and
climate change further prompts scholarly investigation into
coastal change in the past (Thoen et al., 2013; Woodroffe
and Murray-Wallace, 2012). A systematic use of historical
maps to reconstruct coastal or estuarine change has the
potential of adding an important level of analysis to our
understanding of coastal evolution; however, efforts to do
are usually limited to the post-1850 period, precisely
because of the uncertainty regarding the accuracy of older
maps (Thieler and Danforth, 1994).

Cartographical accuracy
In this article we will extensively use and analyze
cartographical material, focusing on the planimetric accu-
racy of maps on various scales, and ranging over a time
period from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century. When
referring to accuracy, we will use deﬁnitions supplied by
Blakemore and Harley who distinguish three main elements
of the accuracy of historical maps: topographic, chrono-
metric and geometric accuracy. The ﬁrst aspect concerns the
quantity and quality of the depiction of landscape features,
the second aspect involves the correspondence of date of
manufacturing/depiction of the map and the termini post
quem and termini ante quem2 of the features depicted in the
map. The third aspect, the subject of this study takes into
account both geodetic accuracy (referring to the position-
ing of a map in a global coordinate system) and planimetric
accuracy (referring to distances and angles/directions as
depicted by the map versus real distances) (Blakemore and
Harley, 1982; Laxton, 1976). However, different terminol-
ogies for the geometric accuracy have been used in the
past. In this paper we only refer to planimetric accuracy (as
a part of the geometric accuracy) of a series of maps, since
we do not assess the positioning within global coordinate
systems.

In doing so, we attempt to offer an answer to questions
which were already present in the 1960s: ‘Among the
yawning gaps in work on cartographic history, is the lack of
precise information about map accuracy’ [Imhof, 1964,
pp. 141–144; 52, as cited by for instance Ravenhill and Gilg
(1974, p. 48)] and ‘The process of evaluating the accuracy
of maps is an ultimate goal of cartographical scholarschip’
(Harley, 1967, p. 9). Rather surprisingly, until very recently
Harvey’s call to investigate accuracy of older maps met with
little response, particularly considering the advances in
computer aided analysis and more speciﬁcally the develop-
ment of geographic information systems (GIS) since the
1980s which has revolutionized spatial analysis in every
discipline, including coastal research and history (Boden-
hamer et al., 2010; Gregory and Ell, 2007; Knowles,
2008). Moreover, most previous work on cartography and
accuracy assessment concentrates on ‘national’ or regional
maps overlooking the large-scale local maps.3 These are the
two issues on which this paper elaborates.

Previous research on planimetric accuracy
As mentioned above, the debate on map accuracy was
already active in the 1960s. Early methods of estimating the
planimetric accuracy are used by, for instance, Bo¨nisch
(1967, pp. 67–68) who proposed a very simple but
adequate methodology for calculating mean positional
errors by measuring a number of distances between points
on the map, and comparing them by the real distances
(based on a modern map). Other authors estimated latitude
and longitude locations of points on a historical map which
contained a regular geographical grid and compared those
with the
and longitude
(Ravenhill and Gilg, 1974), the length of line segments
on historical and present-day maps (Yerci, 1989), or
alternatively through line-point comparison (Locke and
Wyckoff, 1993). A more elaborated analysis was conducted
by Hooke and Perry (1976) who used both area, scale bars,
straight line distances, and the lengths of standard survey
lines in order to investigate the accuracy of tithe maps used
for taxations. Visual point-by-point comparisons were also
made using, for instance, churches as reference points by
Laxton (1976). Other authors made statistical analyses of
error vectors generated by comparing transformed histor-
ical shoreline maps using Euclidian regression4 (Lloyd and
Gilmartin, 1987). Different combinations of
formulas
which expressed errors (together with regression analysis)
were also made by Murphy (1978). The development of
desktop GIS from the 1980s onwards provided new
possibilities for the evaluation of planimetric accuracy
(Hu, 2010). Historical maps could now be directly overlaid
with geo-located modern maps using geo-rectifying tools
supplied by the GIS-system, resulting in the possibility of
making both analytical and graphical evaluations (Liveratos,
2006). Of course combining historical map-data and (more
accurate) modern data requires more detailed insights in
this accuracy (Skalosˇ et al., 2011; Tima´r et al., 2008). This
led to several new studies on accuracy, for instance on
regional maps using sinuosity measurements (Pearson,
2005) and sometimes even on a local scale by, for instance,
Hu (2001) who assessed the Map of the Prefectural Capital
of 1261 on its accuracy although still using Bo¨nisch’s
(1967) methodology, but now integrated in a GIS which
facilitated the accurate measuring of distances and calcula-
tion of distortions in distance and rotation. Specialist
software like MapAnalyst was even developed (Jenny
et al., 2007) and applied (Bower, 2009). All authors have
tended to use their speciﬁc own methods which makes
results of the above-mentioned studies interesting, but hard
to compare to each other since the choice of methodology
heavily inﬂuences factors such as the calculated values.

Whoever tries to assess the planimetric accuracy of
historical maps automatically encounters certain difﬁculties.

(2011) have employed a trial-and-error method which is
based on probable projection systems and their speciﬁc
parameters.7 Nevertheless, a satisfying solution remains
elusive let alone a solution that can be applied to a series of
maps over a long time period. This paper does not seek to
offer a method for
reducing these projection-related
problems, but relies on the fact that the induced errors
are mostly small in case of medium- and large-scale maps
(that form a large part of our database) as well as smaller
areas: ‘for the study of old maps, the inﬂuence of the
geodetic coordinate system (i.e. the shape and position of
the reference ellipsoid) can often be neglected, as the
inﬂuence of mismatching geodetic coordinate systems is
often small compared to the inherent planimetric distor-
tions of the map’ (Jenny and Hurni, 2011, p. 409).
Furthermore, most land surveyors and map-makers have
not been speciﬁcally interested in projection systems, but
have simply wanted to depict the real distances as accurately
as possible (Laxton, 1976, p. 52).

result, uncertainty about the accuracy of historical maps
for landscape
remains high, and its inherent potential

been fully explored. This paper aims to evaluate the
planimetric accuracy of a series of 30 maps for a coastal
the Waasland polder
region in northwestern Europe:
region, which is part of the Scheldt estuary in northern
Belgium and the southwestern part of The Netherlands.
The area offers us an excellent test-case since historical map
production was undertaken very intensely in this area from
the sixteenth century onwards. Keeping in mind the above-
mentioned drawbacks of accuracy assessment, we aim to
introduce new perspectives on map accuracy assessment by
comparing a large number of maps by using a uniform
methodology as well as the opportunities offered by GIS
and specialist software (MapAnalyst). In the last part of the
article, a test-case will be developed which demonstrates
how a more reliable assessment of the accuracy of the
historical maps allows better localizing of historical land-
scape features depicted on these maps to be achieved.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study area
For this paper we will focus on local and regional maps of
the Waasland polder region, accompanied by small-scale
maps depicting the (entire) Scheldt estuary (south-west
Netherlands and Belgium). The Waasland polder region is

demarcated by the Dutch-Belgian border in the northwest
and sandy soils in the south and forms a part of coastal
Flanders (see Figure 1). North of this border the former
Hulsterambacht was to be found.

During the medieval and early modern period the
Waasland polder region formed the northernmost part of
the County of Flanders. Following the Eighty Years War
and the Treaty of Munster (1648), the region was divided
between the Dutch Republic in the north and the
Habsburg Netherlands in the south. The estuary of the
river Scheldt dominates the environmental history of this
region. From the mid Holocene (c. 5500 BC) the area was
gradually turned into a freshwater marsh and covered with a
thick peat layer. In the Roman period, renewed tidal
intrusion of seawater and human exploitation of the peat
resulted in a gradual submersion of this peat and the
conversion of
the region into an estuarine landscape
consisting of tidal channels, mudﬂats, and salt marshes. In
turn the latter were gradually embanked from the high
Middle Ages onwards (Vos and van Heeringen, 1997).
During the late Middle Ages, the Scheldt polder region –
just like the rest of coastal Flanders – was heavily hit by the
economic and demographic crisis, acerbated in this region
by increased storm surge ﬂooding and so-called military
inundations of land in periods of civil war in the last quarter
of both the ﬁfteenth and the sixteenth centuries (Soens,
2011). Subsequently

owners (often residents from Antwerp) and, from the late
seventeenth century onwards, the Arenberg family who

2012).

Sources: maps and their production in coastal Flanders
The Waasland polder region forms an excellent test-case for
a serial cartographic analysis, since this area was part of one
of the ‘core-regions’ of early modern cartography where
major developments in cartography took place, particularly
in the late ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries. Under the
inﬂuence of the rediscovery of early writings on land
surveying, the great explorations, the art of book printing,
and technical developments such as trigonometry and
measurement instruments, the quantity and quality of
cartographical products rose signiﬁcantly, mainly in Italy,
Germany and the Low Countries (De Maeyer et al., 2004).
In Flanders Leuven played a major role (Bossu, 1982) with
work undertaken by scientists like Gemma Frisius (trigo-
nometry), Jacob van Deventer, and Gerard Mercator
(projection system) (Koeman, 1983).

If we focus on coastal Flanders it seems that land
surveyors were active quite early on. We ﬁnd references to
land surveyors as early as 1190 in Furnes and from 1282 in
Bruges (Janssens, 2006, p. 89). The oldest cartographical
products from Sealand Flanders date from 1307 and 1358
(Augustyn, 1999, p. 44; Gottschalk, 1955–1958, pp. 153–
155). Local and regional maps from the fourteenth and
ﬁfteenth centuries were still highly pictorial with limited
topographical information, however, by the 1540s the ‘land
surveyor and mathematician’ Franc¸ois Van de Velde was
able to deliver detailed maps of different parts of the Scheldt

estuary using a projection that at least visually corresponds
with modern maps (Figure 2):

From the sixteenth century onwards, the exponential
increase in the production of local and regional maps was
mainly the work of land surveyors, who were increasingly
asked to add maps to their measurements of individual plots
of land, parishes, or districts in the context of disputes, land
tax assessments, and also land reclamations. In our test-area,

plenty of work was made available to the land surveyors
after the huge land reclamations in the Western Scheldt
estuary in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that saw
the creation of many new ‘polders’ through reclamation on
lands that had been ﬂooded during the Eighty Years War
(1568–1648). Surveying the newly embanked polder was
usually an obligation stipulated in the so-called bedijking-
soctrooien (embankment patents). Examples of this are
found in 1650 (‘perfect maps should be presented’),9 in
1667 (plots should be ‘measured and priced’10 by neutral
persons), and in 1688 (‘land surveyors should do the
delimitation of plots’)11 (Wolters, 1869, pp. 103, 185,
231). Therefore it should not come as a surprise that in
1696 the aldermen of the region formulated a desperate
request to the central Habsburg government to urgently
increase the maximum number of land surveyors (Janssens,
2006, p. 165). Although the measurements by the land
surveyors were often very accurate, they were performed
with simple instruments: a book of instruction from 1662
advises that the only instruments needed were a land
surveying cross, a measurement chain (and someone to
carry it), ten to eleven penetration pins, a ‘wooden rod’,12 a
notebook, and a few pickets (Janssens, 2006, p. 306). To
demonstrate their skill with these instruments and to
guarantee a certain quality, the land surveyors were required
to take practical examinations (Janssens, 2006, p. 338).

The combination of the rapid development of techni-
ques, the need for measuring new embankments, and the
certiﬁed quality of land surveyors led to a large number of
high quality maps for the coastal plain and the Waasland
region. Luckily, numerous maps have been preserved and

of the calculated Root Mean Square Errors after georectify-
ing an old map, however, a more specialized program has
been developed which adds options for the visualization of
(local) errors: MapAnalyst.14 The methodology used in this
program in order to deﬁne the planimetric accuracy of
historical maps, is described by Jenny (2006, 2007, 2010)
and Jenny and Hurni (2011): basically, after setting Ground
Control Points (see below) on both an old and a new map,
an Euclidian (four parameter, also called Helmert-transfor-
mation) or afﬁne (ﬁve or six parameter-transformation) is
used to transform points on the old map to the new map
and vice versa.15 Parameters for the transformation are
calculated with the ‘least-squares-method’, resulting in
(Jenny, 2006,
minimum errors between point
pp. 240–41; Jenny and Hurni, 2011, pp. 403–404).16
For this paper we have used the Helmert-transformation
which only uses scaling, rotation, and translation in x and y
and therefore leaves the historical map as original as possible
during overlay with a modern map. According to Jenny, the
standard new map in MapAnalyst – open street map – which
uses
‘can be considered an
unfortunate choice for the distortion analysis of old maps,
because the Mercator projection adds considerable areal
distortion at medium and higher latitude’ (Jenny, 2010, p.
179). This distortion is removed in further calculations,
but for this reason, and for the reason that open street map
is not the most accurate map for local use, we have chosen
to base our analysis on the recent 1 : 10,000 digital
topographical maps for Belgium and The Netherlands,
both (re-) projected in the Lambert 1972 coordinate
system (i.e. the system used for the Belgian topographical
maps). Since these base maps are too large to import
directly in MapAnalyst, Ground Control Points
(see
below) were set using ArcGIS 9.3. The coordinates of
these points were then imported into MapAnalyst and
visualized on a low-resolution version of the combined
1 : 10,000 maps which was spatially located through a
.jgw-ﬁle. Through this method GCPs were able to be set
with maximum precision and further calculation could be
carried out correctly.

the Mercator projection,

As mentioned before, in order to transform the new map,
identical points on both the old and new map (Ground
Control Points, GCPs) need to be identiﬁed, a somewhat
delicate task (Laxton, 1976, p. 20). Therefore, attempts
were made to:

can be used for (e.g. coastal) research. It is important to
note is that the most interesting maps are often not to be
found in open access internet databases, rather in either
local or state archives. In the (state) archives of Ghent,
Brussels, Beveren, and Middelburg, over 300 historical maps
(from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries) displaying the
Waasland polders and surroundings, were found.13 Many
of these maps were ordered by, or linked to the Arenberg
family (having obtained most of the former seigniory of
Beveren) who coordinated the embankment and drainage of
four major ‘polders’ in the region: the Oud-Arenbergpolder
(ﬁnished in 1688), the Nieuw-Arenbergpolder (ﬁnished in
1784, Figure 3), the Prosperpolder (ﬁnished in 1846), and
the Hedwigepolder (ﬁnished in 1907), the last three being
undertaken entirely by the Arenberg family (De Kraker,
2007; Verelst, 2002).

Of course not all of these maps are suitable for the above-
mentioned analysis. Thirty maps, with dates ranging from
1570 to 1896, have been selected based on scale, subject,
and date (see Notes 20–22).

Methodology
The methodology described in this paper consists of a
combination of different computer programs and methods
to calculate, analyze and visualize the planimetric accuracy
of the historical maps. In the data pre-processing phase the
planimetric accuracy of each separate map was analyzed,

Figure 4. Methodology used in this paper

Overall quantiﬁcation of the planimetric accuracy can
be done by calculating the Mean Positional Error (with
accompanying standard deviations). The Mean Positional
Error (MPE) is, in this case, deﬁned as [(gv2)/n22)]1/2
for the old map. The factor v is deﬁned as (vx2zvy2)1/2
with vx and vy the vector distances in x and y 2 in metres
2 between the actual points in the old map and the place
they would be if the old map was perfect. Alternatively
the same calculations could be made in real metres, using
the new map and corresponding vector distances.17 The
result should be interpreted as the average distance
between a randomly chosen point on the map and its
actual position in case the old map is actually as accurate
as the modern map (in scaled ‘mapped’ metres or ‘real’
metres). The displacement vectors (v) were exported to
the statistical program SPSS in order to carry out further
statistical tests. In addition, MapAnalyst offers a few very
helpful tools for the visualization of local distortions in
the historical maps using error vectors and diction grids.

For each map an image was generated of these local
distortions.

Data analysis
The pre-processing phase resulted in a database with the
MPEs and individual error vectors, integrated in SPSS, and
a series of visualizations of local errors and distortions in the
form of ‘distortion grids’ for each map. In total thirty maps
were analyzed, for a period ranging from 1570 to 1896. In
order to make ‘fair’ comparisons, the maps were divided
according to scale. Classical scale assessment (dividing
distance on maps through real distance and classifying
them into large, medium-, and small-scale maps) is not
always the best option in relation to historical maps. The
size of old maps can vary widely which can, of course,
inﬂuence the calculated scale. If old maps were excessively
large, they would in many cases be deﬁned as ‘large-scale’,
while visual interpretation would classify them as ‘medium-
scale’ and vice versa for maps that are excessively small.

Applying the classical scale values (,5000 as large-scale,
5000 to 50,000 as medium-scale, and .50,000 as small-
scale) on our database would result in very comparable
maps being classiﬁed differently since their original size
varied widely. Furthermore, this traditional choice of scale
values would be rather arbitrary and would distort all
further outcomes.

The choice was therefore made to classify the maps
according to mapped surface. In order to calculate this
surface, boundaries of the map area were digitalized (using
ArcGIS 9.3) using the georectiﬁed maps.18 The database
was easily divided by using surface break values of around
100 and 1000 km2. Maps with a mapped surface below
100 km2 displayed a single or a few embankments, maps
with a mapped surface between 100 and 1000 km2
displayed the Waasland polder region (sometimes com-
pleted with the area north of the boundary),19 and maps
with a mapped surface of over 1000 km2 displayed the
entire Western Scheldt estuary (sometimes completed with
a large inland surface). The ﬁrst category was therefore
classiﬁed as what we will call ‘large-scale maps’ (class 1,
,100 km2, 12 maps),20 the second category as ‘medium-
scale maps’ (class 2, 100 to 1000 km2, 12 maps),21 and the
third category as ‘small-scale maps’ (class 3, .1000 km2,
six maps).22

The MPEs for the different maps were compared in
terms of scale by using SPSS in order to create boxplots.
Signiﬁcance was tested using a non-parametric Kruskall–
Wallis test, while evolutions over time were visualized
through scatterplots and quantiﬁed using linear regression.
R2-values were calculated in order to quantify the explana-
tion in variation of MPE by the factor ‘date of production’.
As mentioned before, each MPE was calculated from
numerous GCPs (see formulas in the section on ‘Data
pre-processing’) all of which have a ‘v-value’, that is, the
real distance between a point in the actual landscape and the
corresponding point on the historical map after translation,
rotation, and scaling. This means we have a large number of
v-values for each map, amounting to 1482 samples in total.
A further investigation into the MPE and its evolution was
therefore made by splitting each MPE into these partial
components. The additional beneﬁt of analyzing individual
v-values lies in the fact that no more calculations (and
therefore data-alterations and simpliﬁcations) for an overall
MPE had to be made. Results could be biased by the fact
that maps with a larger number of GCPs have a larger
inﬂuence on the outcome. In order to avoid this potential
bias, a random sample of v-values was taken for each map
according to the smallest number of GCPs for a map in its
class. This resulted in six samples for each large-scale map,
19 samples for each medium-scale map, and 57 samples for
each small-scale map, amounting to 642 samples in total.

The visualizations in MapAnalyst were used in order to
investigate the local distortions within each map. The
displacement 2 or error 2 vectors (visualized in the old
map) begin at the location of a GCP in the old map, and
end were it would be if the old map was as accurate as the
new map. The longer the vector, the greater the displace-
ment (Jenny et al., 2007, p. 90). Outliers (vectors with a
length of over three times the standard deviation) can be
marked. Based on the displacement vectors, and using a

method based on multi-quadratic interpolation (which
minimizes the inﬂuence of outliers), a distortion grid is
visualized. The meshes (cells) of the distortion grid are
rotated and compressed or enlarged (Jenny et al., 2007,
pp. 90–91). Compressed cells mean that the distances on
the old map appear smaller than they would be if the old
map proves to be as accurate as the new map, for enlarged
cells the opposite holds true. A scaled and rotated (but
undistorted) reference grid can be shown for comparison.
Note that on parts of the map were no GCPs were set, the
mesh cells will appear rectangular since no local distortion
can be calculated. Alternatively, the mesh can only be
visualized for areas containing GCPs. These visualizations
were assessed by visual comparison, complemented with
quantiﬁed analysis in MapAnalyst and QuantumGIS in
order to investigate clusters of error vectors or individual
outliers and the relation between goal of production and
local distortions.

landscape of

Test-case
In order to explore the potential of the accuracy-testing of
historical maps for the study of (coastal) landscape changes,
part of the dataset of thirty maps was used including their
respective accuracy measurements, in order to reconstruct
the Waasland polder region
the coastal
between 1570 and 1850,
including historic landscape
features such as dikes, roads, and buildings which are no
longer visible in the present-day landscape. Integrating
historical maps in a GIS to enable retrogressive landscape
analysis is, of course, not entirely novel (Cousins, 2001;
Heere, 2008; Oetter et al., 2004). Integrating planimetric
scarce (Lloyd
accuracy assessments, however,
and Gilmartin, 1987; Vuorela et al., 2002), and studies
combining different maps per time section,
including
estimated accuracies, are especially hard to ﬁnd.

remains

To explore this issue, a retrogressive landscape analysis
was conducted in the area surrounding the (former)
embankments of the Doelpolder (embanked around 1567,
inundated around 1583–1585, and re-embanked in 1613–
1614), Luyspolder (embanked around 1567, inundated in
1583–1585, re-embanked in 1650, and inundated around
1715) and Peerdenschor (embanked around 1650 and
inundated in 1715) (Van Gerven, 1977, see Figure 13a–
e). Borders of the study area are formed by the maximum
extension (and a small buffer surrounding this) of the
above-mentioned embankments. Based on these dates of
(re-) embankments and inundations, and on the availability
of historical maps (often produced just prior or after
important embankments in the region) in the database, ﬁve
time sections were chosen: 1570, 1620, 1690, 1790, and
1850. A few ‘extra’ maps had to be added to the selection
of maps that were suitable for the planimetric accuracy
assessment in order to cover the complete study area for
each time period. This was the case for maps of the
Luyspolder around 1686 (ARA, Kaarten & Plans I, 2655)
and Peerdenschor (ARA, Kaarten & Plans I, 411) around
1715 that could not be checked for planimetric accuracy
since almost no present-day Ground Control Points could
be found. In addition, parts of four series of maps were
integrated:
the Primitive
Cadastral maps from around 1830, the commercial versions

the famous Ferraris maps,

of these maps (made by P.C Popp) from around 1850, and
the Bonnebladen of Sealand, dating around 1850. Since a
quantitative analysis of these large series of maps surpasses
the goals of this paper, only an estimate for the accuracy
based on a small part of these series of the ﬁrst three maps
has been made.23 For these reasons the maps of large series,
and the aforementioned maps which could not be checked
on planimetric accuracy (indicated with ‘unkown’ MPE or
MPE in brackets), have not been included in further
statistical tests.

As Table 1 indicates, several maps were used for each
time section in the reconstruction. In order to choose the
most appropriate map for each part of the reconstruction,
we aimed to use the map with the smallest positional error
since this would, at least in theory, provide the most
accurate depiction of that area. Note that topographical
detail (in most cases increasing with a higher positional
accuracy) and date (as close as possible to the date of the
time section) also play a role, meaning that qualitative
interpretation continues to play a crucial role. For example,
Figure 5 shows
two maps of around the same date
depicting the same part of the tidal marsh. The left map
was made in 1813 and was ordered by the embankment
government of Doel. The tidal marsh (divided in higher and
lower parts) was measured and depicted by Coppens, a
relatively active cartographer in this region. The map on the
right-hand side, dating from 1816, was instructed to be
made by the Mayor of Doel and contains a detailed division
between the higher and lower tidal marsh. The right-hand
map was chosen for this particular part of the analysis on the
basis of its lower MPE.

All this has resulted in ‘parallel’ maps, obtained by
digitizing the georectiﬁed maps in ArcGIS 9.3, for each
time section: one depicting the land-use within the study
area, and one depicting the MPEs (divided in classes) of the
maps that were used for the particular parts of the land-use
map.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Data-analysis: evolution and differences in MPE
The ﬁrst tests that were conducted concerned the MPE of
the series of maps. The boxplots in Figure 6 show a large
difference in MPE between the maps of different scales.
This is illustrated by the Kruskall–Wallis test on the mean
ranks (P-value50.000). Mean values differ signiﬁcantly,
however,
some medium-scale maps have exceptionally
larger MPEs than expected while some small-scale maps
tend to be more accurate than average. These anomalies
explain why further tests (Man–Whitney, note 26) show no
signiﬁcant difference between medium and small-scale
maps. However,
it can be
concluded that scale is a major variable inﬂuencing the
planimetric accuracy of a map.25

the boxplots

looking at

Next, the evolution of the MPE over time was analyzed.
Overall 2 for the three classes together 2 map accuracy
increased over time (decreasing MPE), although the low
R2-value (0.266) indicates a low extent of the variation
explained by the independent variable ‘time’ (Figure 7).

large-scale maps

However, it is best to look at the different map scales
separately. Results point to increasing map accuracy over
time for medium- and small-scale maps, but only for small-
scale maps does the R2-value (0.880) point to a real
interrelation of time and accuracy. For medium-scale maps
only 17.2 per cent of the variation could be explained by the
independent variable time. For
the
accuracy actually decreased according to the trend line,
but the R2-value is exceptionally small (0.046) meaning this
decrease is not signiﬁcant. To conclude therefore, time as
an – independent 2 variable offers only a limited explana-
tion for map accuracy: sixteenth, seventeenth, or eighteenth
century maps can be just as accurate as more recent maps
(such as those from the nineteenth century), at least when
mapping relative
than
1000 km2 in our sample – since for the medium- and
large-scale maps no signiﬁcant changes over time in map
accuracy were found. However, sample size when analyzing
the different map scales (twelve samples for the large and
small-scale maps and only six for the small-scale maps) limits
the reliability of the above-mentioned results.

territories 2 smaller

concise

As mentioned before,

further investigations into the
MPE and its evolution were made by splitting each MPE in
its partial v-values, resulting in six samples for each large-
scale map, 19 samples for each medium-scale map, and 57
samples for each small-scale map. Individual v-values were
plotted according to the date of
the original map
(Figure 8). Results are similar to those for the overall
difference in MPE and this again points to increasing map
accuracy over time for medium- and small-scale maps, but
only for small-scale maps the R2-value (0.290) points to a
limited interrelation of time and accuracy. This value is far
smaller than the value found for the MPE, due to the
inﬂuence of outliers (not erased by MPE calculations, see
below) and a far larger variation in the individual v-values
within each map. For medium-scale maps only, 6.3% of the
variation could be explained by the independent variable
time. For large-scale maps the accuracy decreased according
to the trend line, but the R2-value is exceptionally small
(0.033). We come to the same conclusion as for the
evolution of the MPE which, in case of the medium- and
small-scale maps, is statistically signiﬁcant (see note 28 on
ANOVA-testing), namely that time as an independent
variable offers only a limited explanation for map accuracy.
Sixteenth, seventeenth, or eighteenth century maps can be
just as accurate as more recent (nineteenth century) ones,
something which contradicts, for example, a number of
ﬁndings relating to maps of the British Isles (Carr, 1962, p.
142).

The above-mentioned analyses show that a map’s date is
not an all-encompassing explanation for variable map
accuracy. We have therefore analyzed the reasons for the
production of maps, and their MPEs. The reasons were
categorized in six classes:

1.

2.

3.

pre-embankments maps (depicting the projected new
embankments)
embankment maps (aiming to depict an embankment
accurately)
intertidal maps (depicting the intertidal area outside
embankments)

hydrographical and military maps are clearly less

categories of maps are largely explained by the
preferred scale of the map: intertidal and embank-
ment maps were unexceptionally made at a large-
scale (see Figure 9, bottom). For pre-embankment

plans medium-scale maps were also used mainly in
the thirst phase of embankment planning, while the
other categories only comprised both medium and
small-scale maps. Administrative maps focusing on
state boundaries, might be very accurate with regard
to the position of the boundary they aim to depict,
but the overall accuracy of the map can be very poor
(as other landscape features are only depicted for the
visual orientation of the user). In any given period,
different
levels of accuracy could be obtained
by the mapmakers. Retracing the original aim of
the map is highly instrumental in explaining both
the level of accuracy and the scale of a map, as well
as the difference between landscape elements which
are located in an accurate way and others which are
not.

(Bower, 2009, p. 124). Only extreme outliers30 are clearly
marked, but visual
interpretation of the length of error
vectors makes it easy to reveal smaller anomalies. This
allows to distinguish between geographic zones and land-
scape features which are located in an accurate way, and
others where distortions are more important. In the end,
such analysis allows to retrieve information on the mapping
process, which was not provided by the map legend or
additional data. After visual interpretation, two elements
were strikingly present on a large number of maps: grouped
clusters of error vectors (occurring in ten out of the thirty
maps) and clearly misplaced features in illustrative parts of
the maps (occurring in six out of the 30 maps).

The ﬁrst observation concerning the distortion vectors is
that GCPs with large displacement vectors tend to be
grouped in clusters, especially on small-scale maps. An
excellent example illustrated in Figure 10 (left) is found on
the military map of 1676 (ZA, Zelandia Illustrata, 1303,
showing – former 2 fortiﬁcations and possible areas for
military inundations although it seems the map was never
entirely ﬁnished), where about 10 GCPs in one area should
be located far more eastward,
resulting in enlarged
distortion grid cells. This clustered group has an average
error vector of 2025.91 m, extremely large since the entire
group is dislocated. However, when removing this struc-
tural distortion, the error vectors of the seven GCPs only
average 496.84 m, showing that their relative positions are
far more accurate.31 Similar distortions are found on the
medium scale map of around 1650 (ARA, Kaarten & Plans
I, 269, showing the administrative boundaries within
Sealand Flanders) in Figure 10 (right). The clustered group

Data-analysis: local distortions
In most cases map ‘cartouches’ or legends contain few
information on the original mapping process, making it
difﬁcult to predict which features are mapped in an accurate
way, and which are not. Software like MapAnalyst not only
helps to reveal the overall accuracy of a map, but it can also
inform us on local variations in accuracy within one map
image, and therefore relative displacements of points

surrounding Sas van Gent and Philippynen. Right: ARA, Kaarten & Plans II, 269 (medium-scale map of 1650), showing uniform distortions
in the area of the Konings-Kieldrechtpolder

(N57) has an average error vector of 1900.12 m, while
their relative average error is only 215.24 m. Not surpris-
ingly, these large error vectors are found in the part south of
the boundary between Flanders and Sealand Flanders, while
the northern part was the point of interest of the map.

Some maps (like the inundation map of 1745, ZA,
Hattinga, 270) even show groups of large displacement
vectors with contradictory directions, resulting in both
relatively larger and smaller displacement grid cells. Even
more recent maps, like the hydrographical map of 1892
(ZA, Polder van Walcheren, 683),
from these
misplacements, in this case the dikes between Philippine
and Biervliet which are less accurately displayed then the
rest of the elements on the map. Probably this part of the
map was of less interest to the map-makers, who intended
to show water depths in the Western and Eastern Scheldt.
However, the error vectors are much smaller since the
overall accuracy of the map is outstanding.

suffer

Larger distortions also occur on the more illustrative
parts of certain maps. An excellent example is to be found

for the map of the inundation risk in the coastal area of
around 1600 (ARA, Kaarten en Plans II, 176, Figure 11,
left) where the villages in the left bottom corner are clearly
‘misplaced’ and four very large (two even more than three
times the SD) displacement vectors (including two outliers)
can be found. These four places should be located far more
west and therefore the distortion grid shrinks in this area.
Perhaps this obvious error might be explained by negli-
gence on behalf of the cartographer, as the map primarily
discussed ﬂood risk in an area far more north than the four
villages. However, perhaps, positioning these villages closer
to the area threatened by ﬂooding could also have been a
deliberate strategy by those who commissioned this map, as
the map was used in a law suit deciding on which villages
had to pay for ﬂood protection.

A frequent error also concerns the inclusion of large cities
on a map. On several maps in our sample, the city of
Antwerp is located in a corner of the map, with its
geographical location signiﬁcantly less accurate than other
parts of the map. Often the mapmaker had probably

The study of partial distortions can also help to reveal the
actual origins of a map when information about
its
production and original goal is missing when, for instance,
the ‘cartouche’ is empty or incomplete. The map of 1664
situation
(Coeck, Scheepvaartmuseum, displaying the
around 1600, Figure 12) does not come with a cartouche
describing the reason for making this map. However,
looking at the displacement factors in the map, it turns out
that most points with smaller error factors are fortiﬁcations
in the frontier zone while other locations tend to be less
accurately localized. The GCPs in Figure 12 have an
average error of 625.35 m for the fortiﬁcations (N56)
and 1809.57 m for
road
crossings and churches). A military reason for manufactur-
ing of this map seems not to be the most plausible one.

the other elements

(N54,

The methodology used, because it is based on the
visualization of positional errors, does of course present
some potential pit-falls. First of all, the way GCPs are
selected during digitalization inﬂuences the planimetric
errors in the map. If a large city is depicted in a simpliﬁed
(pictorial) way, setting many GCPs within or near the city
inﬂuences both the local distortions and overall map
accuracy. Not setting GCPs in certain areas leads to an
undistorted grid, however, this area may still be inaccurate.
It is therefore always recommended to distribute the GCPs
as uniformly as possible. However, sometimes certain areas
are simply not suitable for setting GCPs. Rapidly changing
features, such as a tidal marsh in a coastal or estuarine area,
are not suitable since the location of tidal channels in the
seventeenth century, for example, does not correspond with
their present-day location. Therefore, on maps with an
extensive tidal marsh (quite common in this test-region)
our analysis seems to indicate that the tidal marsh has been
depicted accurately; however, in reality there simply was no
data available in order to assess accuracy.32 Drawing error
grids only surrounding the GCPs offers a solution for this
problem. Secondly, some GCPs are inherently less subject
to causing large error vectors. Corners of embankments,
fortresses, road crossings, etc. are more easily and correctly
identiﬁable in the present-day landscape then ‘symbolized’
elements like church towers, for which one can inevitably
only assume to which present-day part of these elements the
map symbols point to.

Test-case in ArcGIS: the further use of historical maps
As mentioned in the section on ‘Test-case’, ﬁve chron-
ological cross-sections were chosen in order to conduct a
landscape analysis of the Doelpolder and its surroundings.
For each time section,
several maps were selected,
georectiﬁed, and digitalized. This resulted in two ‘parallel’
maps for each time-slot (Figure 13a–e), one depicting the
land-use within the study area, and the other depicting the
MPEs (divided in classes) of the maps that were used for
the particular parts of the land-use map. For the MPE-maps
the grey scale symbolizes the planimetric accuracy of the
maps used for (parts of) the reconstruction and the darker
the element, the higher the accuracy. Since GCPs can only
be set on constant elements (and therefore not on tidal
channels for example), the MPE was extrapolated to the
intertidal area. The maps used for this landscape analysis
were ‘splined’ based on their Ground Control Points,

Figure 12. Map of 1664 (map of Coeck, Scheepvaartmuseum)
showing large differences in MPE between the accurate display of
fortiﬁcations (upper left, extreme right) and the inaccurate display
of the Doelpolder (upper middle)

insisted on including the city for the purpose of the overall
geographical orientation of the map-user. In order to do so,
he sacriﬁced part of the overall topographical accuracy of his
map (ZA, De Waard, 1303 and ZA, Hattina, 270). Map
ZA, Hattinga, 270 (Figure 11, right, showing the results
of the tactical inundations during the Eighty Years war,
copied by the famous cartographer Hattinga), for instance,
has an extremely large error of 5108.87 m for the city of
Antwerp compared to an overall mean positional error of
1057.82 m. Of course, these local outliers (point pairs with
extremely large errors) have an impact on the overall
map accuracy. Removing the Antwerp point pair lowers
the overall MPE from 1057.82 to 858.30 m. Logically, the
effect of these outliers on overall MPE depends on the
number of outliers, the v-values of these outliers (in this
case an extremely large value) and the total number of
GCP’s. This also implies an effect of subjective choices
made during the setting of GCPs, best countered by
distributing the GCPs as evenly as possible and by choosing
different elements as GCP.

Sometimes entire parts of a map are displayed with a
lower accuracy. This is most clearly illustrated by the
northern coast of the Western Scheldt, for instance in the
above-mentioned map of 1676 (ZA, De Waard, 1303),
the map of Coeck dating from 1664 (Scheepvaartmuseum)
and the map of 1748 (ZA, Zelandia Illustrata I, 1560),
where almost all topographical detail
is left out for the
northern coastal area. On the same maps the more inland
areas are also less accurate, indicating that the map-maker
had been focusing on the coastal (shoreline) area, south of
the Western Scheldt.

This observation raises the issue of the relationship
between the goal of a map and its local accuracy. Logically
elements of speciﬁc interest to the map-maker should be
localized more accurately, however, is this true for the maps
in our selection? As indicated in the map cartouche the
small-scale military map 1676 (ZA, De Waard, 1303) aimed
to display fortiﬁcations (forten, redouten and retrensimen-
ten) in the border region of the Dutch Republic and the
Habsburg Netherlands, with special
reference to the
inundated ones. Furthermore, as might be expected, most
of the fortiﬁcations are located more precisely than parts of
the map with little fortiﬁcations.

meaning these points on the historical maps were made to
fall completely into place with the actual points on the
geolocated 1 : 10,000 present-day maps. In a few cases (for
instance for small-scale maps having the GCPs uniformly
spread around the entire map) extra GCPs were added. For
those maps depicting an area that is presently completely
submerged, GCPs were set based on the historical map and
the landscape reconstruction. For these maps, no positional
error could be calculated. Note that by using the ‘spline’
function, the calculated MPEs do not reveal exactly to what
extent certain elements of the reconstruction is misplaced.
Nevertheless, the MPEs are mostly useful as a relative
measurement of the accuracy of parts of the reconstruction.
On the MPE-maps, grey scale indicates the accuracy of parts
of the map. Inner dike polygons were not assessed (and
therefore marked in white) since the outline of these
polygons is deﬁned by multiple line or polygon elements
(like former tidal channels) which all have different MPEs, it
makes it impossible to deﬁne one mean positional error.33
Black parts of the MPE-maps indicate elements that are still
present in the actual landscape and therefore an MPE of 0
has been assigned. If an element was continuously present
to a more recent situation, the MPE of the maps depicting
this more recent situation was used. For instance, if for a
certain time section the outer dike area was derived from
maps with a high MPE but the dikes depicted on these
maps were still present on a more recent map with a low
MPE,
the outer dike area for this time section was
reconstructed with a lower accuracy than these dikes.

The ﬁrst reconstruction (dating from 1570) concerns the
period just prior to the military inundations at the end of
the sixteenth century. Based on map RAG, Kaarten &
Plans, 451, the villages that were later submerged and
covered with sediments (located as buildings left of the
most westward dikes) are located with a surprisingly high
accuracy.

In 1620, the entire Luyspolder had already been ﬂooded
by the large-scale military inundations. The Doelpolder
(located south of the former Luyspolder) was re-embanked.
The most interesting element is a former fortiﬁcation
located north of the Doelpolder, unfortunately the location
is highly questionable since the MPE of the map (Map of
Coeck, Scheepvaartmuseum) used for this reconstruction
only has a moderate score.

In 1690, the Luyspolder was already re-embanked, just as
the Peerdenschor had been. Note that MPE-values are
impossible to give for certain parts (like, for instance, the
buildings in the Luyspolder, including a former castle or the
Peerdenschor itself) since for these maps, only very few
identiﬁable points in the present-day landscape could be
found.

For 1790, many interesting maps were found. Therefore
the reconstruction consists of various maps (with various
MPEs) and a great deal of effort was made to use the most

accurate map for each part of the reconstruction. This led,
for instance, to a highly accurate reconstruction of the tidal
marsh northwest of the Doelpolder. Note that buildings in
the polder west of the Doelpolder (Nieuw-Arenbergpolder)
were located more accurately than buildings
in the
Doelpolder itself.

The maps used for the reconstruction of 1850 also
proved to be accurate. Only the tidal channel in the north
was superimposed from a different map (Bonnebladen,
1850) with an unknown level of accuracy, however,
buildings in the Doelpolder are now positioned with almost
perfect accuracy.

As the analysis shows, some reconstructions could be
made with a great level of accuracy while other reconstruc-
tions should be interpreted more carefully. The combina-
tion of both land-use maps and MPE maps makes it possible
to assess these anomalies.

POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

Applying and testing the methodology demonstrated in this
article on different test-cases and other sets of pre-1850
historical maps, could offer a major contribution to at least
three different ﬁelds of research. First of all, systematically
testing the planimetric accuracy of historical maps could
signiﬁcantly improve our interpretation of both individual
maps and our knowledge of the historical development of
cartographical skills and methods in general. Studying local
distortions in the accuracy of historical maps in particular
might prove helpful in identifying the origins of anonymous
maps and unravelling the often highly complex ‘geneaol-
ogy’ of maps (Jenny and Hurni, 2011). Pre-modern
mapmakers often based their maps on pre-existing maps
(Ratti, 1988; Rubin, 1990; Shannon and Winstanley, 2007;
Stone, 1975), combining newly surveyed features with
features derived from older maps. Identical positional errors
or similar distortion grids on different maps might reveal
unsuspected connections and intertextuality between these
maps.

Secondly, further research has to conﬁrm our conclusion
about the minimal gains in accuracy in local cartography
between the sixteenth and the eighteenth century, mainly
due to the high degree of accuracy of large-scale maps
which could be reached already in the late sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. Not every region will dispose of a
sufﬁcient amount of large-scale historical maps for this early
period. However, if such data are available, the cartographic
features displaying a high degree of planimetric accuracy,
can be used for detailed landscape reconstructions on a
time-scale, which is not usually documented by either aerial
photography nor the soil archive (Vuorela et al., 2002).

Thirdly, the assessment of planimetric accuracy seems
in analyzing landscapes displaying rapid

such as coastal areas

(Thieler and
landscape change,
Danforth, 1994), but also landscapes of rapid urbanization
(e.g. San Antonio-Gomez et al., 2014; Tucci, et al., 2010).
A systematic testing of accuracy might also counter part of
the critics on the accuracy of even late-nineteenth century
Ordnance Maps, which sometimes proved unreliable on
outer-dike features and intertidal areas (Baily and Inkpen,
2013; Bromberg and Bertness, 2005). After veriﬁcation for
accuracy,
landscape reconstructions based on historical
maps can provide a valuable tool for landscape manage-
ment, especially when aimed at the preservation or even
reconstruction of historical landscapes.

CONCLUSIONS

Because of doubts existing with regard to their planimetric
accuracy, historical maps produced before 1850 have only
reluctantly been integrated in GIS-based analyses of
landscape change. In this article we have argued that a
systematic assessment of the accuracy of these maps, using
specialized software like MapAnalyst, allows at least parts of
the existing uncertainties to be banished, and enables
researchers to explore the potential of historical maps
without being misguided by the positional errors they
display. Using a sample data-set of 30 historical maps from
the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, we ﬁrst assessed
their accuracy and then used them for the reconstruction of
a (partly) submerged coastal
landscape in the Western
Scheldt estuary (Belgium/The Netherlands).

During the assessment of the planimetric accuracy of
these maps, a number of striking ﬁndings emerged. As one
might expect, the scale of the historical map (for a large part
determined by the original goal of the production of the
map) had a large inﬂuence on the planimetric accuracy of
the map. Large-scale maps (for instance to be found as
embankment plans) have a signiﬁcantly larger planimetric
accuracy then medium- or small-scale plans (for instance
made for military reason). More surprisingly however, the
quality of older maps (dating from the sixteenth or
seventeenth century) could be as high or even higher than
more recent maps. This is certainly the case for large-scale
maps, but even medium- and small-scale maps showed
rather weak correlations between date and positional
accuracy.

The Mean Positional Errors are not the only variable to
convey the planimetric accuracy of the historical maps.
Local distortions may also play a large role. Maps proved to
contain clusters of large displacement vectors, exceptional
outliers (for instance more illustrative depictions of large
cities), or higher accuracy for typical elements such as
fortresses. Following the automated detection of these
clusters, a qualitative non-automated expert-judgment
might explain these clusters, and even can shed a light on
the map’s original goal and production process involved in
the making of it. Hence, a systematic assessment of the
planimetric accuracy of historical maps would greatly
contribute to both the interpretation of
(pre-1850)
historical maps, and their use in landscape analysis, history
and archeology.

(paper) map, rather the calculations for the MPE in the new map
are correct since the scale factor has the same deviation. The
formulas are derived from (Beineke, 2001). Errors can be
calculated in the old map or in the new map. Calculations in
new map proved (after comparison with calculations
in
QuantumGIS) to be more reliable than calculations in the old
map, since the last calculations use map metres for which the
(occasionally-occurring) extremely small values result in error
prolongation when rounding off within calculations. Therefore all
statistical tests and other calculated values are based on calculations
in ‘new map’. Additionally standard deviations are calculated
through [g(v^2)/(2n–4)]1/2 [after Beineke (2001)].

18. Note that only those parts of maps which actually contained an
image were digitalized, meaning that, for instance cartouches or
blank areas were left out.

19. One exception was found: Map ARA, Kaarten & Plans I, 2634
displayed the frontier zone between the northern and the southern
Low Countries but only a small inland part was mapped, resulting
in a relatively small mapped surface while the Waasland Polder
region was exceeded.

20. Large-scale maps used for the planimetric accuracy assessment:

23. The Bonnebladen were obtained in an already georectified form

meaning that no accuracy tests could be conducted.

24. Note that this map depicts the several embankment phases of the
Doel- and Luyspolder. The accuracy was determined for the
situation of 1614 and extrapolated for other time periods.

25. Note that the size (and therefore original scale of the map) could
influence these MPE-measurements. A drawing error of 2 cm on a
1 : 10,000 map results in smaller MPE in real metres than the same
drawing error on a 1 : 50,000 map. However, tests in old map
distances reveal that the median of the MPE in map metres is
almost six times smaller for large-scale maps than for medium-scale
maps. The differences between medium- and small-scale maps are
less pronounced.

26. Kruskall–Wallis tests reveal a significant difference in means (P
value50.000). However, Mann–Withney test calculations are:
U53, W581, P value50.000 (large-medium); U52, W580, P
value50.001 (large-small); U517, W595, P value50.075 (med-
ium-small). Large-scale compared to medium-scale and small-scale
result in significantly differencing means, whereas medium-scale
compared to small-scale do not result in significantly differencing
means.

27. ANOVA-testing gives P values of 0.004 (3 classes); 0.504 (large-

scale); 0.180 (medium-scale) and 0.006 (small-scale).

28. ANOVA-testing gives P values of 0.000 (3 classes); 0.128 (large-
scale); 0.000 (medium-scale) and 0.000 (small-scale). Large-scale
sample size proves to be insufficient. Unfortunately, due to the
small amount of identifiable (present-day) points on some old
maps, sample size could not be increased.

29. Kruskall–Wallis tests reveal a significant difference between the

averages (P value50.005).

30. Defined as three times bigger than the standard deviation:

[(g(v^2)/(2n24)]1/2.

31. These values were calculated using QuantumGIS. The structural
distortion was removed through using the ‘spline function’ which
makes all GCPs correctly located, and thereafter unchecking each
GCP of the cluster, giving its relative positional error compared to
all the other GCPs. Residuals in pixels were multiplied with the
Helmert-scale factor.

32. These types of uncertainties can, for instance, also be found for

mountainous areas (Jenny, 2006, p. 242).

33. Note that,

for the reconstructions of 1690 and 1850,

the
northernmost tidal channel was superimposed on the tidal marsh
based on two different maps. For the tidal marsh, the MPE was
still deducted from the map it was based on.

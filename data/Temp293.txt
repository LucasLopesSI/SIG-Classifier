Monitoring vegetation condition is an important issue in the Mediterranean region, in
terms of both securing food and preventing fires. Vegetation indices (VIs), mathematical
transformations of reflectance bands, have played an important role in vegetation
monitoring, as they depict the abundance and health of vegetation. Instead of storing
raster VI maps, aggregated statistics can be derived and used in long-term monitoring.
The aggregation schemes (zonations) used in Greece are the forest service units, the fire
service units, and the administrative units. The purpose of this work was to explore the
effect of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) in vegetation condition monitoring at
the above-mentioned aggregation schemes using 16 days Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites acquired by the moderate resolution imaging
spectroradiometer satellite sensor. The effects of aggregation in the context of MAUP
were examined by analyzing variance, from which the among polygon variation (objects’
heterogeneity) and the within polygon variation (pixels’ homogeneity) were derived.
Significant differences in objects’ heterogeneity were observed when aggregating at the
three aggregation schemes; therefore there is a MAUP effect in monitoring vegetation
condition on a nationwide scale in Greece with NDVI. Monitoring using the fire service
units has significantly higher pixels’ homogeneity; therefore there is indication that it is
the most appropriate for monitoring vegetation condition on a nationwide scale in Greece
with NDVI. Results were consistent between the two major types of vegetation, natural
and agricultural. According to the statistical validation, conclusions based on the examined
years (2003 and 2004) are justified.

Introduction

1.
Condition of vegetation is a parameter of major importance in the Mediterranean region, as it
is directly linked to the risk of natural vegetation catching fire and the productivity of
agricultural crops. Monitoring vegetation is useful for international and national agencies
that organize fire prevention plans, compensate for agricultural yield loss, and develop
national policies. In Europe, such monitoring is dictated by a number of European and
Council Regulations, such as ‘Forest Focus’ (2003/2152/EC), support system for producers

of certain arable crops (1999/1251/EC), and support for rural development from the European
Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (1999/1257/EC). Monitoring schemes on a
nationwide scale for these operations can be very costly if based on field surveys or very
biased if based on secondary statistics, such as agricultural census, surveys of farmers’
organizations, and registers for agricultural services (Droogers 2002, Biggs et al. 2006).

Vegetation indices (VIs) have been used extensively in vegetation monitoring, as they
are correlated to various parameters that describe vegetation condition, such as green Leaf
Area Index, phenology, fraction of photosythetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation,
canopy density, dryness, and the health of natural and managed vegetation (Asrar et al. 1984,
Gao 1996, Silleos et al. 2002, Zhang et al. 2003, Gitas et al. 2004). Among the numerous
VIs available, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; Tucker 1979) is widely
used for monitoring vegetation condition (Baret and Guyot 1991, Huete et al. 1985)
although certain drawbacks have been reported (Huete et al. 2002). The methods developed
for monitoring vegetation condition using VIs (Moulin et al. 1997, White et al. 1997) are
difficult to apply on regional or nationwide scales due to frequent cloud cover and variable
viewing angles (Zhang et al. 2003); therefore multi-temporal image composites have been
proposed for large-scale operations (Ferreira and Huete 2004, Maselli 2004, Chuvieco et al.
2005). Finally, more advanced methods for vegetation condition monitoring have been
developed that combine VIs with land surface temperature, formulating the Vegetation
Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) for drought monitoring (Wan et al. 2004), monitoring
desert vegetation dynamics (Dall’Olmo and Karnieli 2002), and mapping land cover at
regional scales (Lambin and Ehrlich 1995).

Instead of studying and storing raster NDVI maps, aggregated statistics can be derived
and used in long-term monitoring, offering advantages such as easier interpretation,
increased functionality in warning systems, and decision support systems. However, in
these cases the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP; Openshaw 1983) applies. The
MAUP refers to the variation in results due to the use of alternative aggregation schemes
on equal or similar scales and is endemic to all spatially aggregated data and is formally
defined as ‘a problem arising from the imposition of artificial units of spatial reporting on
continuous geographical phenomenon resulting in the generation of artificial spatial
patterns’ (Heywood 1998). The effects of the MAUP can be divided into two components:
the ‘scale effect’, where results vary when the same data are aggregated at increasingly larger
areal units, and the ‘aggregation’ or ‘zoning effect’, where results vary due to aggregation
with alternative units of analysis at the same scale.

Except for the field of human geography – where MAUP was first

introduced
(Gehlke and Biehl 1934, Openshaw and Taylor 1979) – it was only recently that the
MAUP was considered in the physical sciences. MAUP has been studied in the context of
landscape ecology and the effects of data aggregation on the analysis of landscape structure
(Jelinski and Wu 1996), in data preparation for regional ecological analyses (Wicks et al.
2002), in assessing the performance of irrigation systems (Chemin and Alexandridis 2006),
in a deer habitat study (Plante et al. 2004), and in general environmental research with an
example of decision support system for admission of pesticides in the EU (Van Beurden and
Douven 1999). In a specific study about forest vegetation, Marceau (1999) examined the
MAUP effect on forest remote sensing, considering however the images’ raster grid as a
form of arbitrary aggregation scheme and focusing on the scale effect. Finally, a few studies
have attempted to resolve the MAUP effect: Song (2003) suggested the use of dissimilarity
and diversity indices to compare data for segregation indices attributed to different geo-
graphic levels, and Hay et al. (2001) suggested an object-specific framework to reduce the
effects of MAUP when using remote sensing data for multi-scale analysis.

Despite the wide use of VIs for vegetation monitoring, the aggregation effect has not
been adequately explored in this sector, although it is generally acknowledged that depending
on the aggregation scheme selected, results may differ. The aim of this work was to
investigate the aggregation (MAUP) effects in vegetation condition monitoring using
MODIS NDVI composites. The specific objectives were (1) to identify the effect of
MAUP using the existing aggregation schemes in Greece and (2) to identify the most
appropriate aggregation scheme for nationwide vegetation condition monitoring.

2. Description of the study area
The study area consists of the vegetated areas of Greece, which covers 131,000 km2
(Figure 1). The area consists of the mainland and numerous islands that vary in size. It is
located in the Mediterranean climatic zone, with monthly average temperatures ranging from
5(cid:2)C in the winter to 28(cid:2)C in the summer. The mean annual precipitation varies throughout the
country, ranging from 400 to 1800 mm/year, corresponding to the strongly undulating
terrain. The wet months are March, April, and November, while July and August are very dry.
Vegetation cover of the area is typically Mediterranean and can be classified into two
major categories: natural (59%) and managed (41%), based on CORINE Land Cover 2000
of Greece (MINENV 2004). Since the two main vegetation categories of the study area are
different in their phenological cycles, it was decided to study them separately and provide
results for each main vegetation category. These two categories were defined using
a generalized CORINE Land Cover map. The map’s scale (1:100,000) was adequate for a
nationwide study, and its production date (2000) was not expected to create any problems at
this level of generalization.

The managed vegetation consists of irrigated annual crops (maize, cotton, alfalfa, and
others) concentrated around lowland irrigation systems, rain-fed cereals located on the

hillsides, and orchards scattered around villages, which correspond to Level 1 CORINE
Land Cover class ‘2, agricultural areas’. The phenological cycle of managed agricultural
vegetation is repeated on an annual basis. Development phases include seeding, growth,
maturity, and harvesting, which can largely be controlled by modern agriculture. Factors
such as current meteorological conditions, irrigation status, and availability of equipment
influence the timing. Generally, there is one growing season from early spring to early
autumn.

The natural vegetation consists of coniferous and deciduous forest, shrubs and pastures,
which correspond to Level 1 CORINE Land Cover class ‘3, forest and semi-natural areas’.
The phenological cycle of the natural vegetation is relatively stable throughout the year,
except in the case of extreme weather conditions. Generally, the various types of vegetation
leaf-out, grow to maturity, and senesce at approximately the same time each year. The most
notable changes occur after the dormant phase of winter, when rapid growth takes place in
the spring, followed by senescence in late summer or early autumn.

2.1. Structure of the existing aggregation schemes
The study area is currently monitored by several national agencies. Natural vegetation is
monitored by the Civil Protection Agency mainly for fire prevention, and agricultural
vegetation is monitored by the Hellenic Agricultural Insurance Agency for yield prediction
and crop damage (Silleos et al. 2002). The aggregation schemes that are currently being used
by these agencies were evaluated in this study:

l The first aggregation scheme examined was the Provinces of Greece. These are
NUTS3-level administrative units (EC 2003), based on early divisions of Greece,
which follow physiographic and human-made boundaries.

l The second aggregation scheme examined was the Fire service units of Greece. These
define the jurisdiction of local fire departments, governed by the Ministry of Internal
Affairs. They were designed based on administrative boundaries, catchment boundaries,
vegetation fuel type, approachability from local fire departments, and estimated time
of intervention in the event of fire.

l The third aggregation scheme examined was the forest service units of Greece. These
define the area managed by each local forest directorate, governed by the Ministry of
Agriculture and the General Secretariat of Forests and Natural Environment. Their
borders have been defined by government decrees, based on criteria such as the
general vegetation zones, landscape physiography, administrative boundaries, and
size of the area.

Therefore, the fire and forest service units had been defined by the relevant authorities from
the national NUTS3 administrative division, with appropriate modifications according to
their purpose. A sample of the study area with the three aggregation schemes is displayed in
Figure 2, where several similarities and differences are visible.

Center of NASA’s Earth Observing System Data Gateway (http://edcimswww.cr.usgs.gov/
pub/imswelcome/). The time series included a total of twelve 16-day composite NDVI
images (six for each year) from the end of April to the end of July (DOY 113–208). This
time period best represents a part of the growing season and phenological development of
vegetation. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that NDVI time series of different
vegetation during the non-growing season do not provide clear phenological separation
(Ramsey et al. 1995, Senay and Elliott 2000).

The MODIS instrument acquires data at 250 m spatial resolution (red and near-infrared),
500 m (five bands at visible and shortwave-infrared), and 1 km (29 bands at visible, near-,
shortwave-, and thermal-infrared). We used MODIS/Terra Vegetation Indices 16-Day L3
Global 250 m SIN Grid V004 (MOD13Q1) product. The VI output file contains 16-day
NDVI values, and this product relies on surface reflectance series (MOD09), which are
corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption, and aerosols (Vermote et al. 2002).
Sixteen-day composites were selected to reduce the effects of cloud cover, because
cloud-affected pixels have been substituted with other unaffected pixels of the same location
but of another date within the 16-day period. Global MOD13Q1 data are provided every
16 days at 250 m spatial resolution as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection.

In addition to the remotely sensed MODIS product, the CORINE 2000 Land Cover map of
Greece was employed (MINENV 2004). Ancillary GIS data layers used were the vectorized
polygons of the fire service units of Greece, the forest service units of Greece, and the
administrative units of Greece at NUTS3 level. These polygons were established by the relevant
authorities, as mentioned earlier. They cover an equal area (the entire country), and they are
roughly at the same scale (their mean polygon area is 1140, 1300, and 1250 km2, respectively).
The downloaded MODIS products were pre-processed (mosaicked, reprojected) and subset
to the borders of the study area (Figure 3). This pre-processing was applied to all the images of
the time period studied, thus producing a time series of MODIS 16-day NDVI images of
Greece at 250 m resolution. Areas covered by other land cover types (e.g. water, urban) were
removed from further analysis. Furthermore, areas covering natural and agricultural vegetation
were separated using the CORINE Land Cover map, so that results could be produced for each
major vegetation type separately. This analysis provided a data set of 1,227,000 and 867,000
MOD13Q1 pixels of natural and agricultural vegetation, respectively. Finally, the NDVI raster
data were overlaid with the polygons of the three aggregation schemes, and aggregated
statistics (zonal statistics) were extracted for each composite period. For every 16-day time
period, mean and standard deviation NDVI values were calculated for every polygon of the
three aggregation schemes, separately for natural and agricultural vegetation.

3.2. Statistical analysis

In order to investigate the MAUP effect in vegetation condition monitoring with NDVI on a
nationwide scale in Greece, the aggregated statistics from the three existing schemes were

compared. Based on the mean and standard deviation derived in the previous section, the
statistical analysis was formulated to respond to the two objectives set: (1) among polygon
variation (objects’ heterogeneity) was used to characterize the inconsistency when monitor-
ing vegetation with the three aggregation schemes, thus proving the existence of the MAUP
effect, and (2) within polygon variation (pixels’ homogeneity) was used to identify how
representative each aggregated value is for the original NDVI values, thus selecting the most
appropriate aggregation scheme for nationwide vegetation condition monitoring. Finally, the
differences between the 2 years of analysis were evaluated in order to confirm the temporal
consistency of the results.

Differences of among polygon variances across aggregation scheme and over time were
tested using the standard F test and the Fmax test proposed by Hahn (1969). Repeated measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for the effects of aggregation scheme, year and
time period, and their interactions on the within polygon standard deviations. The specific
model used was a special split-plot in time where the aggregation scheme was the whole plot
factor and year and period of observation were two split-plot factors arranged in a split-block
(or crisscross) type of structure. F-tests from this ANOVA were used to test the main effects
and interactions. Figure 4 describes the overview of the methods used.

Within polygon standard deviations were displayed in tabular form, with the means of the
standard deviations of aggregation scheme-by-vegetation types (Table 1), year-by-aggregation
scheme-by-vegetation types (Table 2), and the p-values (Table 3). Also, the temporal
evolution of among and within polygon variation for the examined time periods were
displayed as graphs (Figures 5–8).

Identification of MAUP effect in monitoring vegetation condition

4.1.
The temporal response of among polygon variation (objects’ heterogeneity) for the three
aggregation schemes (expressed as the standard deviation of the polygon means) is dis-
played separately for natural (Figure 5) and agricultural vegetation (Figure 6).

For natural vegetation when comparing aggregation schemes within each time period,
the fire service scheme had significantly higher among polygon variation (p , 0.07) than the
forest service scheme for all time periods except the end of April (DOY 113–128) in 2003
and the end of April to the beginning of May (DOY 113–144) in 2004. There were no
significant differences between the forest service and administrative schemes for any time
periods (p (cid:3) 0.07). For agricultural vegetation, the fire service scheme had significantly
higher among polygon variation (p , 0.07) than the administrative scheme for all time
periods for both years. There were no significant differences between forest service and

administrative schemes or between fire service and forest service for any time period except
the beginning of April in 2003.

For both 2003 and 2004, among polygon variances differed significantly (p , 0.05) over
time for natural vegetation for the fire service and forest service aggregation schemes. There
were smaller differences over time for agricultural vegetation with only the forest service
aggregation scheme having significant differences over time in 2003. There was a trend for
higher values (higher objects’ heterogeneity) towards June and July (DOY 145–208), which
was consistent with the variable phenology of the vegetation pattern in Greece. Specifically
for agricultural vegetation, the higher objects’ heterogeneity towards the end of July
portrayed the high contrast between the rain-fed (dry) and irrigated (green) vegetation of
the semi-arid summer. Smaller deviations may be due to cloud influence of the 16-day
composites, as confirmed by local visual examination of the product’s quality flags.

When considering the mean among polygon standard deviations (objects’ heterogeneity)
for each aggregation scheme averaged over time period and years, there were distinctive

differences between the three schemes. Although differences were small (Table 1), the fire
service scheme was significantly smaller (p , 0.05) than the forest service and adminis-
trative aggregation schemes. These results were consistent for natural and agricultural
vegetation for the 2 years (Table 2). Therefore, there is an indication that when monitoring
vegetation using the three aggregation schemes, significant differences could be observed.
This implies that vegetation condition may appear different when studied using statistics of
the same background information (NDVI) aggregated on different schemes, which could
lead to erroneous decision making by involved agencies.

4.2. Selection of the most appropriate aggregation scheme

The temporal evolution of within polygon variation (pixels’ homogeneity) for the three-
aggregation schemes (expressed as the standard deviation of pixels’ NDVI within the

polygons) is displayed separately for natural (Figure 7) and agricultural vegetation
(Figure 8).

There was a significant time trend (Table 3) with lower values (higher pixels’ homo-
geneity) towards June (DOY 152–181) for all aggregation schemes, which could be
attributed to the drying up of rain-fed agricultural and natural vegetation in the beginning
of the semi-arid summer. The excessively low values at the end of April 2003 (DOY
113–128) for agricultural vegetation are inconsistent with the other results and could be
due to random cloud influence.

The means of the within polygon standard deviations was consistently lower, indicating
higher pixels’ homogeneity, when monitoring vegetation using the fire service units.
Although differences were small (Table 1), the results using the fire service units were
significantly lower than the other two aggregation schemes (p-values 0.0117 and 0.0525 for
natural and agricultural vegetation, respectively). These relative differences were consistent
for natural and agricultural vegetation for the 2 years as indicated by the year x aggregation
scheme not being significant (Table 3) and by the relatively consistent differences between
the schemes over both years (Table 2). Therefore, this is an indication that the previously
presented results for 2003 and 2004 are consistent across years.

Combining the results that (1) the among polygon variation of the fire scheme is
generally larger than the other two schemes, (2) that the within polygon variation of the
fire scheme is smaller than the other two, and (3) these results are relatively consistent across
years, it is reasonable to conclude that the aggregated results would be closer to the original
values in the NDVI images when monitoring vegetation using the fire service units.
Therefore, this could be the optimum aggregation scheme for monitoring vegetation using
NDVI, as these aggregated statistics of vegetation condition would better match the actual
conditions, as described with NDVI.

5. Discussion and implications for vegetation monitoring

It has been demonstrated that the aggregation schemes currently being used in vegetation
monitoring can provide significantly different results. Moreover, when monitoring vegeta-
tion with the fire service units, there is higher among polygon variation (higher objects’
heterogeneity) and lower within polygon variation (higher pixels’ homogeneity) than the
other two aggregation schemes. These results suggest that monitoring vegetation condition
using aggregated statistics from the fire service units is being more physically justified, i.e.
the statistics would better represent the original values of vegetation condition parameters
(NDVI) and highlight differences across units (polygons). This could be due to the design of
the fire service units that were based on the characteristics that affect vegetation condition of
both natural and agricultural, such as landscape physiography (elevation, slope, aspect),
catchment boundaries (related to bio-climatic zones), and vegetation fuel type (related to
vegetation species, structure, density).

Considering the significant differences in the phenology of natural and agricultural
vegetation, which could provide an important bias at the nationwide scale, these two
major types of vegetation were studied separately. Results have been consistent between
the two vegetation types, with minor exceptions for agricultural vegetation (DOY 113–128
and 193–208 in 2003). This similarity could be due to the minor differences between the bio-
climatic zones of Greece, which is a relatively small country (Loukas et al. 2001).
Specifically,
the high temperatures and lack of rainfall during the beginning of the
Mediterranean summer (June) influence NDVI of both natural and agricultural vegetation,

with the exception of irrigated agriculture, which however accounts for only 12% of the
vegetation cover of Greece (Alexandridis et al. 2008).

Taking into account the rapidly changing phenology of Mediterranean vegetation from
spring to summer, a period of 3 months (May, June, and July) was studied to identify
possible seasonal variations. Higher objects’ heterogeneity and pixels’ homogeneity was
observed for all examined cases during the peak of the dry summer months (end of June to
the beginning of July, DOY 161–192). Once more, this could be attributed to the relatively
homogeneous phenology of Mediterranean vegetation, which renders it safer to monitor
with aggregated statistics during these months. This is beneficial as it coincides with the
beginning of the fire season.

The spring to summer periods of 2 years have been examined (2003 and 2004) to
evaluate the temporal consistency of results. Despite the high level of significance of the
results and the consequent validity of the conclusions, these could change with a potential
variation of vegetation pattern, either policy driven (e.g. a new Common Agricultural Policy
reform), climate driven, or after extreme fire events. Another reason for potential temporal
inconsistency of these results could be extreme meteorological conditions. Indeed, the years
we examined displayed normal conditions, which was evaluated using the daily Fire Risk
Index issued by the Civil Protection Agency for fire prevention (Gitas et al. 2004). This
Index was estimated taking into account the local meteorological conditions and vegetation
aridity, following the NFFDRS methodology (Deeming et al. 1972). It is evident in Figure 9
that the mean daily Fire Risk Index of the examined years do not deviate from the inter-
annual average. It remains to be verified whether the findings of this work apply during years
of extreme conditions, such as 2007.

Local users and agencies involved in nationwide vegetation monitoring in the study area
can benefit from this work to optimize the efficiency of their long-term monitoring
programmes. On the continental or global scale, other projects such as FAO’s GIEWS
(FAO 2000) could evaluate their aggregation strategy using the methodology presented.
They have been initially using districts as the aggregation scheme of NDVI-based vegetation
monitoring, thus taking advantage of information available from administrative sources;
however, other aggregation schemes have been proposed based on raster data clustering
(Griguolo and Santacroce 1996, Hay et al. 2001). Adopting these methodologies for
designing optimum aggregation schemes fell outside the scope of this work, which only
evaluated the existing schemes.

There are certain limitations to this work. First, we only examined the aggregation effect
from what is documented as MAUP; the other is the scale effect (Openshaw 1983), which
has been better documented in natural sciences (Cao and Lam 1997, Franklin and Woodcock
1997). Second, only the post-processing approach has been examined, in which the aggre-
gation occurs after the initial data sets (reflectance values) are inserted in the model (NDVI
calculation) (Van Beurden and Douven 1999). Finally, we examined the aggregation effect
using the mean technique, while van Beurden and Douven (1999) suggest trying all relevant
techniques and reporting on the sensitivity of the results. Future research could address these
issues, together with the effect of changing the spatial and spectral dimensions of vegetation
condition monitoring: investigating the effect of changing the pixel size of the raster
products and the effect of using more advanced VIs, which have been designed to reduce
the background soil effect (SAVI), atmospheric effects (EVI), and variable meteorological
conditions (VTCI).

6. Conclusions

The purpose of this work was to explore the aggregation (MAUP) effects in vegetation
condition monitoring using MODIS NDVI composites. Three existing aggregation schemes
(administrative units, forest service units, and fire service units) were examined using
descriptive statistics of aggregated NDVI values.

Significant differences in objects’ heterogeneity (high among polygon variation) were
observed when aggregating at the three aggregation schemes, which is an indication of the
MAUP effect in monitoring vegetation condition on a nationwide scale in Greece with
NDVI. Monitoring using the fire service units displayed significantly higher pixels’ homo-
geneity (low within polygon variation), which is an indication that it is the most appropriate
for monitoring vegetation condition on a nationwide scale in Greece with NDVI.

Results have been mostly consistent between the two major vegetation types examined
(natural and agricultural vegetation), both highlighting the MAUP effect and also indicating
the fire service units as the most appropriate aggregation scheme for monitoring vegetation
condition with NDVI. According to the statistical validation, conclusions based on these 2
years are justified.

Finally, the results of this work can help local and international agencies involved in

vegetation monitoring to optimize the efficiency of their monitoring schemes.

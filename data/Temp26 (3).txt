This  article  rests  on  a  vignette 
about  Mina  Hubbard  that  appeared

2014]. Hart’s edited biography
[
2005]  of  Mina  Hubbard  served 
as  the  basis  of  this  overview.  Others 
have  written  about  Hubbard,  includ-
ing 
[1997]. I refer the reader
to  both  of  these  accounts  about  the
Labrador expeditions.

When  writers  offer  a  scholarly 
set  of  papers  about  a  Canadian  map-
per, republish her travel diary, and even
devote  a  quasi-fictional  account,  we 
are  compelled  to  pay  attention.  That
mapper is Mina Hubbard (1870–1956),
whose  trajectory  took  her  to  map  one 
of  North  America’s  most  challenging
regions, namely Labrador. Even one of
Canada’s  most  gripping  story  tellers,
Pierre Berton, could not resist speaking
Berton
about Hubbard’s daring sojourn [
1978]. This article discusses Mina Hub-
bard’s background, her stamina, and her
techniques in mapping Labrador. It also
delves  into  the  contributions  she  made
to Canadian cartography.

2. Her Background

Figure 1: ‘On the Trail’—Mina Hubbard in Labrador.1

Born  on  April  15,  1870,  to  an
immigrant  family  in  rural  Ontario,
Canada, Mina Benson had six siblings.
Her mother was from Yorkshire, England,

and had immigrated to Canada when she
was  a  child  and  her  father  had  immi-
grated  to  Canada  from  Ireland  during
the Great Potato Famine. Mina’s parents

raised  her  and  her  siblings  according 
to strict Methodist beliefs. 

After  teaching  for  10  years  in  an
elementary  school,  Mina  decided  to

a  nurse.  She  worked  on  Staten  Island 
as  a  superintendent  where  she  met 
her  future  husband,  Leonidas  Hubbard
(1872–1903),  a  journalist  and  adven-
turer; they were married in January 1901.
They moved to the Catskills and invited
Leonidas’s  friend,  Dillon  Wallace,  to
live  with  them.  At  the  time,  it  was
impossible  for  Mina  to  know  how  her
husband’s upcoming trip to map part of
Labrador  would  revolutionize  her  own
life  and  thereafter  make  her  an  iconic
Canadian explorer. 

In  1903,  Dillon  and  Leonidas  set
off on an expedition to map the largely
unknown  territory  of  the  Naskaupi 
and  George  rivers  to  Ungava  Bay  in
Labrador.  They  were  not  successful 
in  their  endeavours,  and  Leonidas  did
not  make  it  out  alive.  Encountering
numerous  setbacks,  Leonidas  fell  ill 
due  to  exhaustion  and  starvation,  and
despite  Dillon’s  efforts,  Leonidas  sub-
sequently  died.  This  sudden  turn  of
events  caused  intense  friction  between
Mina  and  Dillon,  as  Mina  believed
Dillon  could  have  done  more  to  save
her husband’s life [
2005b: 92, end-
note 119]. Mina, not having been mar-
ried to Leonidas very long, was gravely
affected by her husband’s death. In effect,
it inspired both her and Dillon to finish
what their companion had started. 

Hart

Mina  brought  four  people  from
Labrador  with  her  on  her  journey:
George  Elson  (“with  rare  skill  and 
rarer  devotion”),  Joseph  Iserhoffm  of
half-Russian  and  half-Cree  descent 
(“a  man  of  Scottish  accent  and  few 
words”), Job Chapies (“a Cree of cheer-
ful  disposition  and  little  English”) 
Hart
[
2005: 100–101], and the 19-year-
old Gilbert Blake; a “half-breed Eskimo
Buchanan
boy trapper” [
2005: 14], who
had  hunted  and  trapped  along  the
Naskaupi  River  “since  he  was  twelve”
Greene
2005a:  10].  In  June  of  1905,
[
Mina  and  Dillon  set  off  on  separate 
missions  in  the  attempt  to  finish 
mapping  the  Naskaupi  and  George
rivers  to  Ungava  Bay.  On  27  August,
1905,  Mina  reached  Ungava  Bay.
Although Dillon arrived later, he there-
after  managed  to  scope  the  long  coast 
of Labrador.

3. Her Stamina

What might have seemed deterrents
to  some  women,  Mina  saw  as  mere
challenges. The first of these being that
during  the  early  1900s,  map  making 
and  exploration  were  seen  as  some-
thing  carried  out  by  men  exclusively.
Secondly,  she  lacked  any  formal  train-
ing  in  geography  or  any  scientific 
disciplines and lastly, she faced her own
personal  struggle  with  issues  regarding
gender  and  race in  Labrador.  However,
Mina was inspired to finish her husband’s
work  and  the  grief  over  her  husband’s
death,  it  is  said,  became  her  religion
Hart
[

2005: 88].

On  June  16  in  1905,  Mina  set  off
on her expedition; however the tension
between  Mina  and  Dillon  persisted  as
they planned their separate expeditions.
Both  requested  that  George  Elson  (a
guide  during  the  1903  expedition) 
join them on their trip, but he chose to
go  with  Mina  and  her  group.  These
issues made their way to the press and
people  became  skeptical  of  Mina’s
motives [
2005: 97]. Some claimed
that Mina was not sincere in her under-
taking,  believing  that  she  was  using 
the  endeavor to  find  answers  to  her 
husband’s  death.  Nevertheless,  Mina
remained  committed  to  finishing  her
husband’s journey because he could not

Heart so Hungry

Writers  have  already  passed  on  to
us  legacy  of  some  of  the  more  memo-
rable  aspects  of  Mina’s  temperament
that made her capable of initiating, sus-
taining,  and  finishing  such  a  dramatic
sojourn through Labrador. Randall Silvis,
in 
[2004: 77], alluded
to her attitude before embarking on her
sojourn  in  Labrador,  stating  that  “she
would  not  be  weak  or  cowardly,”  also
describing  her  as  “obstinate”  [89].  We
are  told  that  along  the  trail,  Mina  felt
unaffected  by  the  torment  of  blackfly
and mosquito bites [98]. Nothing could
disturb  her  sense  of  wonder  at  the 
peace  of  Labrador.  She  was  known  to
be  absolutely  fearless  under  all  condi-
tions and as such, led subsequent causes
related  to  women  and  peace  upon  her
arrival  in  England  and  following  her
sojourn in Labrador. 

We learn through 

William B. Cabot

[1908: 14], a descendant of John Cabot,
coureurs
that only some 30 explorers and 
du bois

have ever visited Labrador since
1674 (until about 1903), as these visits
involve  “heavy  portaging  over  rough
obstructed  ground  [which]  is  quite
beyond  the  strength  and  endurance  of
unaccustomed  persons.”  It  takes  one
week to portage 10 miles up a mountain
of  1000  feet.  [
1908:  18]. Cabot
describes  Labrador  further;  “its  great
body  of  cold  water,  chilling  the  warm
southwestern  winds,  is  overhung  with
clouds  and  cheerless  with  drizzl-
ing  rain”  [
1908:  4].  Labrador  is
600 000 square miles and it is this wilder-
ness that Mina lived in for 61 days.

Silvis

When  Randall  Silvis  summarized
her work in his historical fiction based
on  her  life  [
2004:  260],  he  con-
cluded  that  Mina  possessed  the  most
compelling personality of all the partic-
ipants  in  this  drama,  and  that  “she  has
the richest most complex story, the most
heartfelt  and  the  most  heart-driven.”
Another historian of her life, Anne Hart
Hart
[
2005b: 353], is convinced that the 
success of her journey through Labrador
demonstrated  “... strong  capacities  for
determination and control.” Using more
contemporary  language,  Pierre  Berton
stated  that,  “she  was  a  tough  baby”
Berton
[
[2005: 50] captured
her personality  and  described  her  as  a
“stubborn perfectionist, tender to those
she loved, implacable to those she found
wanting, ever alert to beauty, [and] she
is a compelling often endearing subject.”

Her Techniques

Quite  unlike  contemporary  map-
makers of today, explorers such as Mina
Hubbard had to rely on the time-tested,
inductive  approach  to  mapping,  which
terra
involved walking on foot through 
incognita

. Mina travelled nearly 970 km
in  a  region  entirely  inhospitable  to 
outsiders, and one with such delightful
names  as  Bald  Mountain,  Barren
Grounds  River,  Cold  Creek,  Crooked
River,  Devil’s  Dining  Table,  Hades 
Hills, Koksoak River, Muddy Lake, Shag

Her techniques were equally simple.
She “made observations and notes in her
journal, wrote about the Indian graves...
[and]  described  the  abandoned  camps”
Silvis
[
[2004:
85],  we  learn  that  she  took  readings
Greene
with  her  sextant  and  compass. 
[2005b:  44]  informs  us  that  she  used 
“a  sextant  and  artificial  horizon  to
determine latitude.” Occasionally, Mina
would obtain a crude map of a trail from
one of the local Indians [
2004: 87].
Whenever  she had  the  opportunity—
and  there  were  many—she  would
ascend a major hill to get her bearings
and anticipate the direction of rivers and
rapids  that  she  would  need  to  traverse 
or follow. Portage was 
. When
comparing  Mina’s  map  with  later 
maps, 
[2005b: 44] learned that
“she  has  considerable  difficulty  deter-
mining  latitude,”  and  that  “she  consis-
tently  places  [sic]  herself north  of  her
actual  position,  by  amounts  ranging
Greene
from  twelve  to  twenty  miles.” 
[2005b:  45]  offers  other  details  about
her  techniques,  and  how  the  use  of
water, instead of mercury in her artificial
horizon led to her errors. Her record of
distances travelled each day, as Greene
says,  helped  her  to  make  appropriate
adjustments.

5. Her Contributions

One  of  the  initial  reasons  for 
the  1905  expedition  was  to  meet  the
Naskaupi people, who were at the time,
said  to  be  the  most  isolated  Indians  in
North  America.  Consequently,  Mina’s
maps  were  seen  as  a  major  scientific
contribution. They “served as the basis
for official maps of the region until the
advent of aerial mapping in the 1930s”
Greene
[
2005b:  44].  “Hers,”  Greene 
further avers, “were the pioneer maps of
the Naskapi and George River systems,
and  the  first  map  to  indicate  that  Seal
Lake  and  Lake  Michikamau  were  in 
the  same  drainage  basin  and  that  the
Naskapi and Northwest Rivers were not
two distinct rivers, as has been generally

Greene

assumed, but one and the same” [
2005b:  45–6].  Greene  leaves  us  with
other insights about her training, experi-
ence, and contributions, namely that she
had no training in geography, but that her
maps  were  “surprisingly  accurate”
Greene
[

2005b: 44].

Following  Mina’s  mapping  of
Labrador,  she  did  not  return  to  her 
regular  occupation.  She  was  no  longer
teaching  or  nursing.  She  began  lectur-
ing,  writing  articles,  and  working  on
formally  documenting  her  time  in
Labrador,  while  speaking  publicly  in
numerous  settings.  In  the  first  half  of
1906 alone, Mina spoke as the “Ladies
night”  speaker  at  the  Methodist  Men’s
Social Union in Williamstown, as well
as at the Present Day Club of Princeton,
New Jersey, the Adams School Teachers’
Association,  and  the  Hamilton  Club 
of  Brooklyn,  New  York  banquet,  in
addition  to  her  involvement  with  a 
lecturing  trip  within  Canada,  and  her
continued  lecturing  when  she  returned
to  New  York  [
2005b:  355–357].
In 1907, she moved to England, where
she  continued  to  discourse  about  her
work.  In  the  meanwhile,  she  named 
a  number  of  geographical  features  in
Labrador  after  some  of  her  young
nieces,  such  as  Lake  Agnes,  Marie
Hubbard
Lake, and Maid Marion Falls [
2005: 193].

Hart

While  on  her  lecture  tours,  she 
continued  to  work  on  her  book  of 
A  Woman’s  Way
exploration,  entitled 
Through  Unknown  Labrador

,  com-
pleting  it  in  1908.  Published  by  the
American  Geographical  Society  and
adopted  by  the  Canadian  Geological
Survey, Mina saw her book as a “purely
Hart
pioneer  work”  [
2005b:  369]. The
British  (and  later  the  American  and
Canadian)  press  awarded  the  book
“approving  if  patronizing,  reviews”
Hart
[
2005b:  365].  By 1920,  her  book
was  out  of  print.  Nevertheless,  during
the  2005  centennial  of  her  sojourn  in
Labrador, 
[2005]
produced  a  lengthy  commentary  about
Mina,  which  included  her  diary  and  a
biography by Anne Hart [

Buchanan and Greene

2005].

Hart

As part of his background research
for his fictional-historical work, Randall
2004:  256]  declared  that, 
Silvis  [

plished  before  with  the  exception  of

Hubbard
[
2005: 341]. An editorial in the
[1  December  1905:  6]
New York
summarizes  Mina’s  feat:  “Not  a  few
strong  men  inured  to  the  hardships  of
pioneer exploring have been baffled in
Labrador; but this little woman, fragile
in  appearance  and  accustomed  to  the
refinement  of  life,  has  done  exactly
what she set out to do.”

As  aforementioned,  the  expedition
of  Dillon  Wallace  was  one  keenly 
vied with Mina’s to finish the mapping
of  Labrador.  In  the  opinion  of  Durgin,
“The main geographical results of both
expeditions  are  the  maps  which  the
books contain, and it must be admitted
that Mrs. Hubbard’s contribution to the
cartography of Labrador is far superior
to that of Wallace. It is both on a larger
scale  and  more  carefully  plotted  ...  It
would  require  a  third  exploration  to
show whether Wallace or Mrs. Hubbard
is the more accurate surveyor, but from
the  extremely  sketchy  character  of
Wallace’s  maps  we  may  hazard  the
opinion  that  the  lady  would  prove  the
safer guide” [

1908: 135].

6. Later Life

Aside  from  her  short  marriage  to 
an  heir  of  the  Rowntree  family  in
England (through which, with the help
of good lawyers, she was able to obtain
a secure life when the divorce was final-
ized  in  1915),  she  was  heavily  (and
fearlessly)  committed  to  the  Women’s
Enfranchisement  Movement,  and  fol-
lowed Theosophy  and  the  teachings  of
Rudolf Steiner. She was impervious to,
and  unafraid  of,  the  bombings  of
London  during  World  War  II.  Prior  to
this  however,  she  eagerly  pursued  the
idea  of  establishing  a  literary  salon  in
her  home  in  London,  and  becoming
host  to  such  figures  as  Bernard  Shaw,

oncoming train.” She was struck by the

Detecting ethnic residential clusters using an optimisation
clustering method

To understand residential clustering of contemporary immigrants and other ethnic
minorities in urban areas, it is important to ﬁrst identify where they are clustered.
In recent years, increasing attention has been given to the use of local statistics as a
tool for ﬁnding the location of racial/ethnic residential clusters. However, since many
existing local statistics are primarily developed for epidemiological studies where clus-
tering is associated with relatively rare events, its application in studies of residential
segregation may not always yield satisfactory results. This article proposes an optimi-
sation clustering method for delineating the boundaries of ethnic residential clusters.
The proposed approach uses a modiﬁed greedy algorithm to ﬁnd the most likely extent
of clusters and employs total within-group absolute deviations as a clustering criterion.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we applied it to a set of synthetic land-
scapes and to two empirical data sets in Auckland, New Zealand. The results show that
the proposed method can detect ethnic residential clusters effectively and that it has
potential for use in other disciplines as it offers an ability to detect large, arbitrarily
shaped clusters.

Introduction

1.
Residential concentration of immigrants and other ethnic minorities is a common phe-
nomenon in metropolitan areas. Chinatowns are present in most major cities throughout the
world, and other ethnic neighbourhoods such as Little Italy, Little India and Little Tokyo
have become a familiar part of the urban landscape (Olson and Kobayashi 1993, Kaplan
and Li 2006, Hutchison and Krase 2007). As a result, the reasons for the emergence of
such ethnic residential areas, as well as their roles and signiﬁcance in multi-ethnic soci-
eties, have been a long-standing interest of geographers and sociologists since the early
twentieth century (Duncan and Lieberson 1959, Lieberson 1963, Massey 1985, Fong 1994,
Li 1998, 2006).

In the past, when residential segregation was believed to be a direct function of accul-
turation and socio-economic mobility, most of the literature on ethnic settlement patterns
focused on measuring the degree of segregation. Most methodological attention at that
time was paid to developing index measures that can summarise the level of residential

separation in cities, and many indices have been proposed (Duncan and Duncan 1955,
White 1983, 1986, Massey and Denton 1988, Morrill 1991, Wong 1993).

However, a considerable number of recent studies have found that the direct relation-
ship between the degree of residential segregation and socio-cultural well-being of ethnic
minorities is weaker for recent migrants (Alba and Nee 1997, Rumbaut 1997, Alba et al.
1999). Global economic growth over the last two decades and the increasing international
mobility of people have paved the way for inﬂuxes of highly skilled workers, entrepreneurs,
investors and international students into many western countries, and such radical changes
in the immigrants’ socio-economic proﬁle have diversiﬁed residential patterns of ethnic
minorities (Iceland and Scopilliti 2008, Spivak et al. 2011). While the newcomers are
similar to earlier migrants in that they tend to settle in areas where their co-ethnic prede-
cessors are relatively concentrated, such new residential clusters are as likely to be located
in desirable suburbs where the middle-class, majority group once dominated (or even still
dominates) the population (Li 1998, Johnston et al. 2008). In this context, the degree of
segregation itself is less signiﬁcant than believed earlier, and it has become increasingly
important to understand ‘where’ people are clustered (Logan et al. 2002, Brown and Chung
2006, Johnston et al. 2008).

Earlier researchers (e.g. those prior to the 1980s) might have been able to rely on
their eyes to distinguish the boundaries of ethnic enclaves, because minority populations
at that time were often conﬁned to a few blocks of the city with fairly clear boundaries.
Contemporary ethnic neighbourhoods may, however, be located across several suburbs with
no clear boundaries in the manner of ‘traditional’ inner-city ghettos (Li 1997). The delin-
eation of such ethnic neighbourhoods in urban areas may be somewhat vague and arbitrary,
as there is often no clear-cut point on the continuum of population densities where a line
can be drawn between clusters and non-clusters.

The main purpose of this article is, therefore, to propose a more objective method for
detecting ethnic residential clusters. The approach here is a variation of a general opti-
misation method, which performs reasonably well when the number of clusters and their
approximate locations are known (Everitt et al. 2011). As will be demonstrated in a later
section, this method can effectively identify the most likely extent of clusters from random
starting conﬁgurations. To discuss the advantages and main applications of the proposed
approach, the next section introduces some relevant methods that have been used or could
potentially be used in the ethnic segregation literature. The subsequent section describes an
alternative clustering procedure using heuristic searches and is followed by two examples
to test its performance: (1) a set of idealised, synthetic data sets and (2) two residentially
segregated population groups in Auckland, 2006.

2. Existing methods
Since Duncan and Duncan (1955) proposed the index of dissimilarity to assess the uneven-
ness of a population distribution, it has been the most widely adopted method in the
ethnic segregation literature (Massey and Denton 1988, Wong et al. 2007). As Duncan
and Duncan clearly noted, this index is closely related to more classical methods such
as the Lorenz curve (Lorenz 1905) and the Gini index (Gini 1912), both of which were
developed in the early twentieth century. The Gini index provides information about
inequality that is quite similar to the index of dissimilarity (White 1986), and the Lorenz
curve visually represents the unevenness of population distribution (Duncan and Duncan
1955, Massey and Denton 1988). According to Massey and Denton (1988), such com-
parability of the dissimilarity index and its straightforward calculation and interpretation

1459

have made it one of the most popular methods for studying residential segregation since
the 1950s.

The ultimate goal of the index of dissimilarity and other similar indices of segrega-
tion (White 1983, Morrill 1991, Wong 1993, Reardon and O’Sullivan 2004, O’Sullivan
and Wong 2007) is to summarise the overall distribution of a population group in the
entire study region into a single number.1 This type of method may be considered a global
statistic, or a general test, and is useful for deﬁning the existence of ethnic residential seg-
regation in an area of interest. However, as the reasons for the residential concentration of
ethnic minorities have diversiﬁed in recent years, where they are clustered has become as
important as whether they are clustered (Li 1998, Logan et al. 2002).

The importance of using local statistics for residential segregation studies has arisen
from this context. Local statistics assess the degree of segregation at each spatial unit, such
as a census tract, and identify ‘hotspots’ that could be usefully studied in more detail.
Examples of such local statistics include the Geographical Analysis Machine (GAM)
(Openshaw et al. 1987), Kulldorff’s scan statistic (Kulldorff and Nagarwalla 1995), Getis–
Ord’s local G/G∗ statistics (Getis and Ord 1992) and local Moran’s I (Anselin 1995).
Each of these is brieﬂy outlined below. Although strictly speaking, the former two should
be classiﬁed as scan statistics and sometimes distinguished from local statistics; they are
reviewed here because they can also detect the locations of possible ethnic clusters.

Openshaw’s GAM attempts to investigate all possible sets of observations that are
spatially close to one another (Openshaw et al. 1987). The testing procedure begins by
superimposing a regular grid lattice with a grid size, g, and then at each grid node count-
ing the number of data points (e.g. the population of an ethnic group) within a distance, r.
If we can assume that the data follow a certain probability distribution, the statistical sig-
niﬁcance of a point being tested can be obtained by comparing the observed value with that
expected under the hypothesis of no segregation. Once all grid nodes have been visited and
examined, areas with a considerable concentration of the subject that is unlikely to occur
by random chance can be highlighted with one or more overlapping circles, depending on
the grid size, g, and the search radius, r.

Obviously, the accuracy and reliability of the result are dependent on the careful choice
of g and r (Openshaw et al. 1987). While there are no rules of thumb to determine these
parameters, it is generally recommended to make the grid size sufﬁciently smaller than
the search radius so that the test sets can be overlapped to a large extent. The use of an
appropriate test statistic for a given data set is also essential to gain reasonable outcomes
from GAM (Openshaw et al. 1987). Although the true underlying distribution is usually
unknown for studies based on samples, the Poisson probability density function is often
conventionally accepted as an adequate estimation in part because this method is widely
used in epidemiology.

Once all these parameters have been chosen, GAM can be a useful exploratory tool
to generate hypotheses as to where clusters might be located. Nonetheless, its signiﬁcance
tests are not considered reliable because the results are likely to contain an unacceptable
level of type I error (i.e. false detection) (Besag and Newell 1991). Since GAM carries out
a large number of overlapping statistical testing on the overlapping and dependent data sets,
the Bonferroni correction, which divides the local threshold of the p value by the number
of tests to maintain the overall level of statistical signiﬁcance, tends to be too conservative
(Haining 2003).

To overcome this shortcoming, Kulldorff and Nagarwalla (1995) have proposed the
use of the likelihood ratio test to identify the most signiﬁcant clusters among all possible
subsets of the data. As with GAM, it draws a regular or irregular grid lattice that goes

S.-Y. Hong and D. O’Sullivan

through all observed data points, which could be centroids of the given spatial units (e.g.
census tracts) if the data are in aggregate form. Instead of using an arbitrarily deﬁned circle,
however, Kulldorff’s scan statistic begins with a search radius of zero, which only includes
the selected data point itself and gradually increases the radius until it covers a certain
fraction, p, of the total population. Once all possible sets are constructed, it calculates the
likelihood function at each subset, z:

L (z, p, q) = pcz (1 − p)nz−cz qC−cz (1 − q)(N−nz)−(C−cz)

(1)

where N denotes the total population size in the study area, C the minority population in
the study area, nz the total population in the census unit z, cz the minority population in
the census unit z, p the probability of being a minority individual in the zone and q the
probability of being a minority individual outside the zone.

Among all (p, q) that meet the conditions p, q ∈ [0, 1] and p + q = 1, the one that
maximises Equation (1) is chosen, and the likelihood ratio test statistic can be derived as
usual with the null hypothesis, H 0: p = q, and the alternative, H 1: p > q. The signiﬁcance
of the results can be estimated through a large number of iterations in the Monte Carlo
simulation.

In the ﬁeld of epidemiology, Kulldorff’s scan statistic appears to be one of the most
widely used methods to detect clustering of a certain disease. There is also a substantial lit-
erature that advocates its application in a range of disciplines and circumstances (Kulldorff
et al. 1997, Hjalmars et al. 1999, Coulston and Riitters 2003). However, this method has
rarely, if ever, appeared in the segregation literature, while other similar forms of local
statistics, such as the local Moran’s I and local G/G∗ statistics, have become relatively
popular in recent years.

Anselin (1995) has shown that the Moran’s index of spatial autocorrelation, I, can be

decomposed into local values, Ii:

Ii = (xi − x)
s2

n(cid:2)

j=1

wij(xj − x)

where xi represents a data value (e.g. the population of an ethnic group) in a spatial unit i
and s denotes the sample standard deviation of x. This local indicator of spatial autocor-
relation (LISA), Ii, describes the extent to which the data values of the spatial units that
are adjacent to i are similar to or different from xi, and the ‘adjacency’ is deﬁned in the
weight matrix W. The sum of all LISAs is proportional to the global Moran’s I (Anselin
1995), and as with its global counterpart, a high value of Ii suggests statistically signiﬁcant
clustering of similar values at the location i.

The local G/G∗ statistics are another way of estimating spatial clustering at the local
level. At each data point i, the test statistic calculates an index indicating if high or low
values are clustered within a predeﬁned distance, d:

Gi(d) =

large positive index value indicates clustering of high values around the point i and a large
negative value implies clustering of low values.

While the general tests of segregation answer the question of whether a population
group is evenly distributed across the study region or not, these focused tests can address to
some extent the question of where possible clusters might be located. The local approaches
have been little used in the ethnic segregation literature until very recently, but they are
now receiving an increasing amount of attention from researchers (Wong et al. 2007).
Frank (2003), for example, examined residential patterns of eight urbanised areas in the
United States using the local Moran’s I. Brown and Chung (2006) also used the local
Moran’s I to explore ethnic concentrations in Franklin County, OH. Johnston et al. (2009,
2011) employed the local G∗ statistic to investigate residential clustering of ethnic groups
in Auckland.

It may be worth noting, however, that most local statistics have been originally devel-
oped for epidemiological or ecological studies where clustering is often very rare. GAM
and Kulldorff’s scan statistic tend to be utilised in a situation where data are generated
from observations, such as the occurrence of a disease, and the local Moran’s I and local
G/G∗ statistics are designed to detect statistically signiﬁcant clustering of the sample points
assuming no autocorrelation in the study region.

Ethnic segregation studies generally employ census data as the primary source of infor-
mation, and the presence of ethnic clustering is usually very apparent even on a simple
choropleth map of the population. Difﬁculties arise in delineating the boundaries of eth-
nic residential clusters, because contemporary ethnic neighbourhoods, especially those
located in suburban areas, have no clear borders. That is to say, the question that should
be addressed by a statistical tool is more related to the extent of ethnic clustering than its
presence or approximate location. Considering this, it would be more adequate to employ a
different approach that better ﬁts the context of ethnic residential segregation, and the fol-
lowing section proposes one possible method that uses a simple heuristic algorithm. The
clustering procedures described below are somewhat similar to recently developed varia-
tions of Kulldorff’s scan statistic (e.g. Tango and Takahashi 2005, Yao et al. 2011), but
they are designed to be more suitable for ethnic segregation studies.

3. Alternative approach
Suppose that the study region is divided into n census tracts, (cid:2) = {x1, x2, x3, . . . , xn},
and the aim is to identify a particular number of groups whose data values are distinctively
larger than those of the remaining census tracts. Each group is assumed to consist of geo-
graphically continuous census tracts, Ai = {xi1, . . . , xin}, where i = 1 . . . g, and they do
not overlap with one another. For convenience, let A0 denote a set of residuals that are not
included in Ai, so that (cid:2) = A0
Ag.
The fundamental idea behind the proposed clustering method is that the quality of a
given clustering can be represented by numerical indices, and the best possible subsets can

be found by optimising the index values. While statisticians have developed a number of
numerical clustering measures since the 1960s (Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza 1965, Jancey
1966, Hartigan and Wong 1979), this article uses one of the simpler criteria, the within-
group sum of absolute deviations, whose minimum value indicates the best solution:

g(cid:2)

ni(cid:2)

(cid:5)
(cid:5)μi − bij

(cid:5)
(cid:5)

aij

w =

i=0

j=1

(5)

where ni is the number of census tracts in Ai, aij is the weight of the corresponding census
tract and bij is the data value of interest, such as the population density of an ethnic group;
μi refers to the weighted mean of all data values in Ai.

The weighting factor, aij, can be determined to give more importance to certain areas,
which, for example, have longer shared boundaries with the current cluster or a larger pop-
ulation size. In the examples in Section 4.2, the census tracts are weighted by proportional
population size of mi, which is deﬁned as the population count of the census tract, i, divided
(cid:3)
mi = 1), so the data values (i.e. proportion
by the total population in the study area (i.e.
of ethnic minorities in the census tracts) based on a larger population size can be more
prioritised.

This clustering measure was chosen because the proposed method is intended to
be used with univariate, ethnic population data that are often exponentially distributed.
As demonstrated with the synthetic and empirical data sets in the next section, the sum of
absolute deviations works effectively on the exponentially distributed data. It may, how-
ever, be possible to adopt more general indices, such as the within-group sum of squares,
or local statistics as a clustering criterion depending on the nature of the data distribution.
Perhaps, the most straightforward way to identify a set of Ai that minimises w is to
investigate all possible combinations and choose the best one. When n is small and the
spatial neighbourhood structure is simple, this approach is feasible and even guarantees
the identiﬁcation of a global optimum (if there is one). Not surprisingly, however, it rapidly
becomes impractical as n increases, due to its computationally expensive nature, even with
today’s computing power (Everitt et al. 2011).

A greedy algorithm is an alternative that overcomes the limitation of examining all
possible combinations. While the algorithm has many variations that are modiﬁed to suit
the problem at hand and the nature of the data, the following sections outline the clustering
procedures that are implemented here to demonstrate its application in studies of ethnic
residential segregation.

3.1. Step 1: Choose starting points
The algorithm needs a starting point, or seed, from which to begin the clustering proce-
dures. The starting point is assumed to be part of a cluster, and violation of this assumption
can lead to an incorrect solution. One strategy to ﬁnd a good starting point is to create a
choropleth map of the population. Because residential clustering of ethnic groups is often
very intensive in practice (O’Sullivan and Wong 2007), approximate locations of ethnic
residential clusters can be identiﬁed on a simple map of the population distribution.

Or alternatively, one can utilise random sampling to ﬁnd a starting point. In this case,
it is essential to iterate the clustering procedures with different starting points to avoid a
local optimum. While the number of iterations, R, which is required to obtain an accurate
result, is very problem speciﬁc, depending on the data structure, the number of clusters

1463

to be found and their shapes, the examples in Section 4.2 show that a small number of
iterations (i.e. 10–50) may be sufﬁcient to produce reliable outcomes.

3.2. Step 2: Calculate and compare the clustering measure
Combine the current set of a cluster with each of neighbouring census tracts and calculate
the clustering scores, w. The neighbours can be deﬁned in various ways using, for example,
spatial contiguity (adjacency) or distance between the areal units. While different conﬁgu-
ration strategies could yield somewhat different clustering results, it is not our goal in this
article to advocate one strategy over another, as the choice should essentially depend on the
data at hand and other resources available. It may, however, be worth noting that since stud-
ies of residential segregation often employ aggregate geographic data, the use of queen- or
rook-based contiguity can be a reasonable option to deﬁne neighbourhood relationships in
most cases.

For the synthetic and empirical examples below, we use a queen-based contiguity
matrix, which considers any census tracts that share a boundary line, or a point, with a given
spatial unit as neighbours (Cliff and Ord 1973). This way tends to identify more neighbours
than the rook’s adjacency deﬁnition at each iteration of the algorithm, especially with reg-
ular areal units (e.g. grids), so is perhaps more suitable for exploratory searches. If time
and computing resources permit, however, it is more advisable to test several different
conﬁguration strategies and choose the one that produces the most interpretable result.

3.3. Step 3: Expand the current cluster

Replace the set with the one that minimises w and repeat Steps 2 and 3 until no further
improvements can be made.

3.4. Step 4: Repeat the procedures for each cluster

Repeat the procedures above for each cluster of interest, if the data set is expected to contain
more than one cluster. The number of clusters, K, should be determined before running the
algorithm, and as with the starting points, an incorrect choice of K can affect the overall
quality of the clustering results.

When K is unknown a priori, one useful way of estimating an appropriate number
of clusters is to use a large value of K in an initial simulation and see how each cluster
contributes to the optimisation of the w value. If i denotes the number of cluster expansions
and wi the within-group sum of absolute deviations at i, we can get a declining curve by
plotting wi against i. As will be demonstrated in Section 4.2, this graph can provide some
guidance as to which cluster contributes signiﬁcantly to the decrease of w and which does
not, and so help with the choice of K.

4. Examples

4.1. Synthetic data
In this section, the proposed clustering algorithm is applied to four synthetic data sets
that are shown in Figure 1. To construct the data sets, 900 random numbers were gen-
erated from an exponential distribution with λ = 0.005 and arranged in regular grids of
30-by-30 m. In the ﬁrst three data sets (Figure 1a–c), high data values are concentrated
around the central area, forming square (east-to-west), rectangular and T-shaped clusters,

respectively. In the last data set (Figure 1d), the high values are randomly distributed, and
there appears to be no signiﬁcant clustering. This last data set is designed to demonstrate
potential limitations of the method.

To apply the clustering procedures described in the previous section, one cluster was
assumed to exist in each of the data sets (which may not be correct for the last pattern
(d) however), and the algorithm was repeated 50 times to avoid a local minimum solution.
Starting points were chosen randomly with probabilities proportional to the data values
(i.e. the probability that the ith cell was selected as a starting point was pi = xi/
xi, where
xi denotes the data value assigned to i).

Figure 2 displays the ‘optimum’ extent of the clusters that gave the minimum w value,
along with box plots that show how the data were divided. The results for the ﬁrst three
examples (Figure 2a–c) suggest that the optimisation clustering method can reveal the size
and shape of clusters effectively: the clusters, which are shaded grey in the ﬁgures, have

accurately captured the important patterns in the data sets (i.e. square, rectangular and T-
shaped concentrations). The box plots also indicate that the cells with high data values have
been well separated from those with lower values and grouped as a cluster.

The last data set illustrates a potential limitation of the optimisation clustering method
when the number of clusters is chosen incorrectly. As in the k-means clustering method,
which may also be considered a variation of the greedy algorithm, the proposed approach
requires specifying the number of clusters as an input parameter. The problem is that it
always ends up with a speciﬁed number of clusters, regardless of whether they really exist
or not. While Figure 1d shows no apparent concentrations of the high data values, Figure 2d
presents a cluster with a very high w value of 0.969, which represents a poor quality of
clustering. This is because the present method does not carry out a signiﬁcance test on the
ﬁndings, and such a lack of formal statistical tests distinguishes the proposed optimisation
clustering method from many other local measures, including the local G∗ statistic.

The point that this example makes is that the main advantage of the proposed approach
lies in its ability to identify the extent of arbitrarily shaped clusters in an efﬁcient and
reliable manner rather than to evaluate the presence or absence of clustering. This charac-
teristic perhaps makes the method particularly useful in contemporary ethnic segregation
studies, where the existence of clustering is often very obvious but its exact location and
extent are not.

4.2. Census data
This section applies the optimisation clustering method to census population data in
Auckland, 2006. The Auckland region is 1 of 16 regions of New Zealand and encompasses
four cities and three rural districts.2 It is home to nearly one-third of the total national
population and is the most diverse region in terms of ethnicity and culture, where Paciﬁc
peoples and Asians comprise approximately 31.6% of the local population (Table 1).

In the 2006 census, the entire Auckland region consisted of 397 census area units
(CAUs), 320 of which were from the four cities and 77 from the three rural districts.
The study area in this section includes only the urban parts of the cities and consists of
297 CAUs, as shown in the map in Figure 3. The CAUs are the second smallest geographic
unit (after meshblocks) in New Zealand censuses and typically contain 3000–5000 people
in urban areas.

This section examines two population groups: Paciﬁc peoples (as a whole) and one
Asian ethnic group, Koreans. While Paciﬁc peoples and Koreans are very different in terms
of the population size, they are similar in the sense of being residentially segregated. The
index of dissimilarity between Paciﬁc peoples and others was 0.527 in the 2001 census
and that for Koreans was 0.453, both of which were considerably higher than other ethnic
groups, such as M¯aori, Chinese and Indians (Table 2).

Figure 4. Geographic distribution of Koreans (b) in the Auckland urban areas, 2006. The histogram
of Koreans (a) indicates that their distribution is similar to an exponential function (solid line).

The density histograms in Figures 3 and 4 also show that the two groups are unevenly
distributed across CAUs: in most census tracts, Paciﬁc peoples comprise less than 20%
of the local population (Figure 3a) and Koreans make up less than 5% (Figure 4a). There
are, however, a few census tracts, where the two groups form over 50% and 10% of the
local populations, respectively. These histograms appear similar to an exponential density
function with λ = 1/μ, where μ is the mean of the corresponding population (i.e. solid
lines in the ﬁgures).

Figures 3b and 4b exhibit the geographic distribution of Paciﬁc peoples and Koreans in
the study area, highlighting the CAUs with high proportions of them. Figure 3b provides
a visual impression that Paciﬁc peoples are mainly clustered in the southern part of the
region, which is consistent with earlier ﬁndings by other researchers (Johnston et al. 2009,
2011). By contrast, the Korean population is relatively concentrated in the northern part
of the region – North Shore City – but there appear to be several smaller clusters in the
western, central and eastern parts of Auckland as well (Figure 4b).

Based on this initial observation, the numbers of clusters, K, for Paciﬁc peoples
and Koreans were set to 2 and 4, respectively. Starting points were chosen randomly
with probability proportional to the data values (as in the previous examples), and the
optimisation clustering algorithm was repeated 100 times to avoid a local minimum
solution.

To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the local G∗ statistic was also
applied to these data sets. A spatial weight matrix was constructed based on the distance
between the centroids of the CAUs:

wij =

Cij(cid:3)

j=1 Cij

(6)

where Cij = 1 when the Euclidean distance between i and j is less than or equal to a given
threshold d and Cij = 0 when otherwise. Three different d values were tested, namely
2, 4 and 6 km, and the one that provided the most plausible solution, d = 4 km, was
chosen.

Figure 5 presents the residential clusters of Paciﬁc peoples, identiﬁed by the optimi-
sation clustering method and the G∗ analysis. The optimisation clustering method has
found two major concentrations as intended: one in south Auckland and another around
the western area of the central isthmus. The former consists of 42 CAUs and makes up
approximately 47% of the group population and the latter contains 38 CAUs and 17.3% of
Paciﬁc peoples. Considering that the remaining 217 CAUs comprise only about 35.7% of
the Paciﬁc population, the clusters presented in Figure 5a are clearly places where Paciﬁc
peoples were over-represented in 2006, and thus are reasonable. Although the box plot
indicates that several census tracts with a high proportion of Paciﬁc peoples are not classi-
ﬁed as a cluster, these are geographically scattered across the study area and did not form
a sizable group to be considered as a cluster. Such single-tract clusters could be captured
if K was set higher than 2, however.

The local G∗ statistic, on the other hand, did not identify any signiﬁcant concentrations
(i.e. z > 1.96) in the western part of Auckland, and the southern cluster seems to be
somewhat exaggerated (Figure 5b). In particular, several CAUs located at the approximate
centre of the southern cluster, which were not classiﬁed as part of it in Figure 5a, are
highlighted as signiﬁcant concentrations despite their low proportions of Paciﬁc peoples
(i.e. <5%).

This result can be adjusted by using different parameters, such as a smaller distance
band, d (Poulsen et al. 2010). However, this would make the test statistic focus on the
population composition of individual census tracts, while taking little account of the
surrounding units. The results from such approach could include many single-tract clusters,
which might not be of interest. If, for example, a researcher is interested in the spatial extent
of existing clusters and their changes over years, the proposed heuristic approach can be
advantageous over the local G∗ analysis, as the number of clusters and a starting point for
each cluster are all that are required as input parameters.

The clustering results for the Korean population data support this point (Figure 6).
While both the optimisation clustering method and G∗ presented similar results for the
northern cluster, which is large and approximately circular in shape, they provided some-
what different pictures for the smaller ones in the other parts of Auckland. Figure 6a shows
a north-to-south elliptical cluster in the east and an ‘eight’-shaped concentration around the
Central Business District (CBD). A couple of census tracts in the western part of Auckland

small concentrations together contained over a quarter of the total Korean population in the
study area (or 5364 out of 20,145), and the proportions of Koreans were approximately 4.5,
5.5, and 7.5%, respectively. These proportions are considerably higher than the regional
average of 1.8%, suggesting that the ﬁndings in Figure 6a are legitimate. Perhaps the reason

that the local G∗ analysis did not identify those localities as ‘hotspots’ (Figure 6b) is that
the shapes of the concentrations are not circular as presumed or that their sizes are smaller
than the pre-speciﬁed search extent of 4 km. As noted earlier, the optimisation clustering
algorithm does not require assuming the form of a target cluster, and this may make the
proposed method more robust for identifying small, arbitrarily shaped clusters than the G∗
analysis.

Figure 7. Changes in the clustering score, w, when the number of residential clusters for Paciﬁc
peoples in the Auckland urban areas, k, is assumed to be 1–6. For k ≥ 2, each cluster is distinguished
by a vertical dotted line. (a) k = 1; (b) k = 2; (c) k = 3; (d) k = 4; (e) k = 5; and (f) k = 6.

One potential drawback of the proposed method is that the number of clusters to be
found, K, should be determined in advance, as in the k-means clustering method. When
K is chosen too large, it is likely to produce clusters that are only marginally different
from the remaining areas while having no practical signiﬁcance at all. By contrast, if K is
set smaller than those actually existing in the data, it could result in failure to capture the
presence of important clusters.

To overcome this limitation, one can consider using a large value of K as an input
parameter in an initial run and inspect the decreasing rate of w through the cluster expan-
sion process. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, one can visually examine how each cluster
contributes to the increase of the overall clustering quality by plotting the w value against
the number of iterations. For instance, when K = 2 for Paciﬁc peoples, both clusters, dis-
tinguished by a dotted line in the graph, decrease the w value to a similar degree, but when
K = 3, one of the clusters only marginally affects the overall w value (Figure 7). This
pattern appears consistently for K = {4, 5, 6}, indicating K = 2 is likely to be the
most sensible choice. In a similar vein, Figure 8 indicates that K = 3 would be rea-
sonable for Koreans, as any more than that contributes to the decrease of w only very
slightly.

Another consideration before running the proposed algorithm, if starting points are
not known a priori, is the number of random seeds, R. While the choice of R should be
dependent on the size of the data set and available computing resources, multiple simula-
tions on the Auckland data set, which consists of 297 CAUs, showed a small number of
R (i.e. 10–50) can be sufﬁcient to draw reliable conclusions (Figures 9 and 10).

5. Conclusions

This article has proposed the use of an optimisation clustering method for determining
the extent of ethnic residential clusters. The method introduced in this article is the same
as most other local or scan statistics in the sense that it attempts to identify a set of
geographically close observations with high (or low, depending on the context) data val-
ues in relation to the rest of the data. What distinguishes the present approach from others
is that it does not require deﬁning ‘close’ or ‘high’ prior to its application, and this fea-
ture provides an advantage over the other traditional methods in terms of delineating the
boundaries of arbitrarily shaped clusters.

The idealised clustering patterns in the previous section have demonstrated that the pro-
posed method is capable of effectively identifying the extent of clusters and is particularly
useful when the cluster has a non-circular shape. The empirical cases have also illustrated
that the present approach can produce reliable outcomes from a small number of random
starting conﬁgurations, regardless of the shape and size of clusters.

While it is possible to obtain similar results from other recently developed clustering
methods (e.g. Tango and Takahashi 2005, Mu and Wang 2008, Yao et al. 2011), they set
the upper limit of cluster size for computational reasons or adopt inferential statistics, such
as the log-likelihood ratio, as a clustering criterion. These features may be reasonable for
epidemiological research, where the cluster to be found can be small and the data are usu-
ally derived from samples. As mentioned earlier, however, ethnic residential clusters tend
to be distributed across several suburbs (and thus very large), and the primary data source

is often the census data that are supposed to include information for the entire population.
Since the proposed clustering approach employs a simpler clustering measure, which does
not involve statistical signiﬁcance tests, the computation is more straightforward than the
other (scan statistic-based) ‘ﬂexible’ approaches, and hence it can be more advantageous
for detecting large clusters in a timely manner.

One potential problem of this exploratory method is that it requires specifying the
number of clusters, K, as an input parameter. As demonstrated with the synthetic exam-
ples above, a misspeciﬁcation of K could yield clusters that are only marginally different
from the remaining areas while having no practical signiﬁcance at all. This limitation
makes the proposed method more pertinent for contemporary ethnic segregation studies,
where the presence and approximate locations of clusters are often apparent but their exact
boundaries are not. It may be worth noting, however, that the application of this method
is not necessarily limited to the residential segregation studies. It has potential for use in
other disciplines that have similar settings to studies of residential segregation, as it offers
an ability to detect arbitrarily shaped clusters. Despite the recent development of several
Monte Carlo-based algorithms, the detection of arbitrarily shaped clusters is still a topic of

enduring methodological interest in the ﬁeld of cluster analysis, and the present algorithm
addresses this issue by iteratively optimising a clustering criterion.

Notes
1. Residential segregation is a multidimensional phenomenon that represents several distinctive
spatial patterns (Massey and Denton 1988, Reardon and O’Sullivan 2004). The index of dis-
similarity addresses one aspect of segregation, evenness, and there are other indices that can
assess, for example, the degree of interaction between the majority population groups and ethnic
minorities. While such exposure/interaction measures can provide useful insights into the ethnic
residential segregation (St John and Clymer 2000, Spivak et al. 2011), they were not discussed
in this article as it is less relevant to the clustering method proposed here.
In April 2009, the New Zealand government made a decision to combine the seven local author-
ities into one unitary Auckland Council. The new council is composed of 13 wards, each of
which is subdivided into a number of local boards and subdivisions. The study area based
on the district boundaries is approximately equivalent to the area consisting of the following
wards: Albany (excl. Hibiscus Coast Subdivision), North Shore, Waitakere (excl. Waitakere
Ranges Local Board), Albert–Eden–Roskill, Waitemata and Gulf (excl. Waiheke Local Board
¯Or¯akei, Maungakiekie–T¯amaki, Manukau, Howick, and
and Great Barrier Local Board),
Manurewa–Papakura (excl. Papakura Local Board).

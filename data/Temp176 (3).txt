Erratum

This article, originally published in Vol. 20, No. 1 (January 2006, pp. 31–52)
contained a misprint in table 1, p. 40.

The table reprinted overleaf is the same as that originally published except that
the shape of the compound periodic function shown in row (b), column f5¡4, now
correctly represents the addition of the simple periodic functions for f5¡1,2,3 and
4.

Taylor & Francis would like to apologise for this error.

Table 1. The main parameters for the first four simple periodic functions, f5¡1 to ¡4,
constituting the 1:10 million vector representation of the Australian mainland coastline. In the
second last row, (a), the simple periodic functions are shown graphically with a heavy line. All
four simple periodic functions start at the large dot and move in a clockwise direction. In the
last row, (b), also shown with a heavy line, are the compound periodic functions created by
adding its simple periodic function to those to the left of it. For instance, the compound
periodic function in the column f5¡3 is the addition of the simple periodic functions for
f5¡1,2 and 3. These compound periodic functions also start at the large dot and move in a
clockwise direction. The centroid of the coastline, given by the complex pair (k0, h0), was
133.81726 degrees longitude and 223.91249 degrees latitude. Amplitudes and wavelength are
in decimal degrees. The dimension of variance, V|¡f|, is decimal degrees squared.

Fluvial habitats are inherently variable. They are shaped by ﬂow magnitude, frequency,
timing and duration, by the effects of upstream and downstream features along ﬂow
paths and by bioclimatic processes and human activities in upstream contributing catch-
ments. Managing freshwater ecosystems requires tools and data that effectively account
for these multi-scale processes. We tackle these challenges in this analysis of the dis-
tribution of 17 native and alien ﬁsh species in south-eastern Australia. A ﬁne-scale,
stream-link-based GIS database comprising an extensive set of ecologically meaning-
ful attributes at multiple scales was developed to characterise the multidimensional
environmental space of freshwater biota. This article describes the methods and data
required to construct such a database. Boosted regression tree models were employed
to analyse relationships between species and 20 candidate environmental predictors.
For some species, competitors/predators were also included as predictors. Models were
evaluated from several viewpoints: the ecological plausibility and intuition arising from
them, their ability to predict to river links within the training area and for 11 species
for which data were sufﬁcient, their ability to predict to an adjacent but geographi-
cally distinct region. Despite modest environmental contrasts in the study area, these
data and species distribution models (SDMs) produced predictions with useful predic-
tive ability and discriminatory power. Critically, predictors of distribution identiﬁed as
important for the various species modelled were ecologically interpretable. Several –
but not all – of the models tested for transferability also predicted distributions reason-
ably well in the adjacent region. The GIS stream database and SDMs have immediate
applications, but also provide a valuable foundation for developing more sophisticated
tools for management and conservation in Australian freshwater environments.

Introduction
The freshwater ecosystems of south-eastern Australia are becoming increasingly degraded
via anthropogenic pressures. Direct pressures include dam construction, ﬂow regula-
tion, stream channelisation, de-snagging, draining of wetlands and construction of levees.
Indirect pressures include native vegetation clearing, agricultural development and the con-
sequences of erosion, sedimentation, nutrient run-off and alien species introductions (CES
2008). The profound changes in our riverine systems and the challenges of climate change
have increased the impetus for conserving freshwater-dependent biota and redressing the

degradation. In this context, predictive models of relationships between environment and
the distribution of biota are valuable tools.

Species distribution models (SDMs) have wide-ranging applications including:
quantifying species–habitat relationships; identifying unsurveyed sites of high potential
occurrence for rare species (Engler et al. 2004); supporting species recovery and rein-
troduction plans (Steel et al. 2004, Martínez-Meyer et al. 2006); contributing inputs for
conservation planning (Moilanen et al. 2008, Leathwick et al. 2008b); assessing impacts
of climate and land-use changes on species distribution (Thuiller et al. 2008); predicting
species invasion (Hartley et al. 2006) and designing cost-effective surveillance for invasive
species (Hauser and McCarthy 2009).

SDMs have been widely implemented in terrestrial and marine environments, but more
sparingly in freshwaters. This might reﬂect the availability of relevant data for modelling,
but also perhaps the complexity of the modelling task. Fish occurrence and abundance
patterns typically exhibit complex, non-linear relationships to habitat heterogeneity and
biotic interactions (Olden and Jackson 2002). Habitats in ﬂuvial systems are heteroge-
neous and nuanced, shaped as they are by the interactions of ﬂow magnitude, frequency,
timing and duration within the geomorphic templates. Additional complexity is overlaid
by the effect of upstream and downstream features along a ﬂow path (such as dams and
waterfalls) and inﬂuences arising from bioclimatic processes and human activities in the
upstream catchment area. In the ‘spatially continuous longitudinal and lateral mosaics’
(Fausch et al. 2002, p. 3) created by these multi-scale processes, different elements that are
critical for various ﬁsh life history stages are often separated in space and time (Kareiva
and Wennergren 1995).

The importance of understanding processes and their interactions from multi-scale per-
spectives has been demonstrated and repeatedly emphasised (Ward 1989, Schlosser 1991,
Jackson et al. 2001, Fausch et al. 2002, Durance et al. 2006, Lowe et al. 2006). Researchers
have been urged to apply landscape ecology principles and insights to riverine environ-
ments (Fausch et al. 2002, Wiens 2002). These recommendations are more than academic,
Fausch et al. (2002) noted that ecologists tend to work at small spatial and temporal scales,
and have been generally ineffective at providing managers with information and tools at the
landscape scales relevant to freshwater conservation. Durance et al. (2006, p. 1145) further
criticise research for failing management by neither indicating ‘where in the scale hierarchy
problems might arise nor the most effective scales for management response’.

Characterising the multidimensional environmental space of freshwater biota at multi-
ple scales requires a broad range of predictors. A notable shortcoming of some studies that
have attempted to predict the distributions of freshwater biota using variables at more than
one spatial scale is that variables used have sometimes seemed more dictated by availability
than functional relevance (see, e.g. Fransen et al. 2006). Austin (2002) has argued strongly
for the use of theoretically informed, proximal variables that represent resource and direct
gradients that inﬂuence species. Distal predictors (e.g. elevation) are less preferred because
they only indirectly inﬂuence species distributions through their relationships with func-
tionally relevant (proximal) predictors such as temperature. Recent examples show how
effective purpose-built, ecologically relevant stream datasets can be for both landscape-
scale strategic planning and ﬁner-scale decision support for conservation management (e.g.
Moilanen et al. 2008, 2011). Some base their analyses on environmental data from hierar-
chical stream networks that facilitate the tracing of upstream and downstream inﬂuences
(e.g. Leathwick et al. 2010), whereas others have emphasised multi-scale landscape met-
rics calculated for individual sites at riparian, reach and subcatchment levels (e.g. Hopkins
2009). Both approaches provide the requisite multi-scale perspective that enables more
integrative analyses for better management support. There has also been much interesting

work aimed at identifying meaningful and manageable attributes that can inform practical
landscape management strategies (e.g. Clapcott et al. 2010, Hopkins and Whiles 2011).

This research was motivated by the need for context-appropriate quantitative tools to
support conservation and management of biota in Australian freshwater environments. This
article aims to (1) present our methods for constructing a ﬁne-scale stream network GIS
database for Victoria (south-eastern Australia), consisting of ecologically meaningful envi-
ronmental attributes at multiple scales; (2) analyse patterns of distribution for a range of
native and alien riverine ﬁsh species with diverse life-histories and habitat requirements
and (3) demonstrate and brieﬂy discuss applications of the resultant mapping of species
distributions across stream networks.

Methods
Study area
The ∼127,500 km2 study area comprises catchments of the inland-ﬂowing river systems
of Victoria (Figure 1). Major systems include the Upper Murray, Mitta Mitta, Kiewa,
Ovens, Broken, Goulburn, Campaspe, Loddon, Avoca and Wimmera Rivers. These rivers
ﬂow into the Murray River, except for the Avoca and Wimmera, which terminate in

shows the location of the study area relative to the state of Victoria and Australia. The major
northward-draining river systems in the study area are annotated. The Murray River collects the
waters of the ﬁrst eight river systems in turn as it ﬂows westward. Major on- and off-stream storages
associated with the major river systems are indicated in purple.

ephemeral wetlands. The landscapes and climates of the major catchments are detailed in
Appendix 1 in Supplementary Material – in overview, headwaters arise in forested, moun-
tainous or hilly areas and drain northward through increasingly agricultural land. Several
on- and off-stream storages impact ﬂows (Figure 1).

Fish data

Fish occurrence data (Figure 1) were obtained from the Victorian Department of
Sustainability and Environment (DSE) (Aquatic Fauna Database, supplied 1 June 2007),
the Murray-Darling Basin Commission (SRA Asset SRA524, supplied 4 May 2007) and
Koster et al. (2006). All records came from sampling conducted between 1980 and 2006
(inclusive). After removing taxonomically uncertain records, pre-processing to remove
conspicuous errors, and exhaustive manual cross-checking of sites against auxillary infor-
mation and spatial datasets to validate positional accuracy, 1906 sites were selected for
the analysis. Presence–absence data were extracted for 17 ﬁsh species (11 native and non-
diadromous, 6 alien) that occurred in the dataset with a capture frequency ≥3% (Table 1).

Four of the species are considered to be threatened at the State and/or Commonwealth
level (Table 1).

Environmental data
In terrestrial environments, the unit for spatially explicit landscape planning/management
is typically a grid cell. As this is inappropriate for riverine systems, analysts tend to
employ grid or polygon-based representations of subcatchments/watersheds (e.g. Linke
et al. 2008). These are convenient because species records, when mapped, often do not
coincide exactly with mapped linework for rivers. While this might sufﬁce for broad-
scale visualisation and planning tasks (e.g. at scales of 10s–100s km2), it is generally
too coarse for the scales at which on-ground managers operate. When target entities
are riverine species/communities, stream-based representations such as the US National
Hydrography Dataset (http://nhd.usgs.gov), Australia’s Geofabric Surface Network (www.
bom.gov.au/water/geofabric/about.shtml), and the stream network described in this article
are more pertinent.

The backbone of our digital stream network database is an ordered, link-node repre-
sentation of Victoria’s streams. As detailed in Appendix 2A in Supplementary Material,
we constructed a 20 × 20 m cell-size digital elevation model (DEM) and from this pro-
duced a stream network with ﬂow directionality, connectivity and associated watersheds for
each of the 238,474 links in the study area. To characterise the riverine environments, esti-
mates of physiographic, bioclimatic, edaphic, land-cover- and human-disturbance-related
variables considered to have ecological relevance for freshwater biota, were computed for
every stream link at one or more hierarchically nested spatial scales (Appendix 2B in
Supplementary Material). The three scales were (1) the riparian zone with a width of 50 m
on either side of a link; (2) the immediate watershed of a link and (3) the entire upstream
contributing catchment area (UCA) associated with a link (see Figure 2).

Inputs for environmental variables were generated from best-available data or derived
from the most detailed and up-to-date sources for Victoria at the time of construction.
Physiographic variables were calculated directly from the DEM or indirectly, by calcu-
lating terrain attributes including topographic wetness index (Moore et al. 1993) and
multi-resolution valley bottom ﬂatness index (Gallant and Dowling 2003). Bioclimatic
variables were derived from interpolated surfaces estimated using the software pack-
age ANUCLIM 5.1 (Houlder et al. 2000), which uses thin-plate smoothing splines
ﬁtted to long-term meteorological station data. Edaphic variables were calculated from
modelled solum depth and plant available water holding capacity extracted from the
Soil Hydrological Properties of Australia spatial dataset (Western and McKenzie 2006).
Land-cover variables were derived from the Modelled Native Vegetation Extent spatial
dataset (NVE2007, DSE). For disturbance-related variables, an input raster of road density
(km/km2) was created using ArcGIS tools and road features captured at a 1:25,000 scale
(VicMap Transport, DSE).

Georeferenced data representing in-stream structures/features of potential inﬂuence on
ﬁsh, such as rapids, waterfalls, dam walls, gauging stations and fords were obtained from
VicMap Hydro and Transport and Thiess Services Pty Ltd. These features were spatially
joined to the stream network, explicitly ﬂagged in each affected link and used in computing
other variables (see below).

Variable estimates for each link were computed at the riparian, watershed and UCA
scales using a suite of custom ArcINFO scripts. Variables at watershed-scale were
quantiﬁed by overlaying watershed boundaries on the various environmental datasets.

Figure 2. Example showing nested spatial scales at which environmental variables for individual
links were computed. Flow direction is to the north. For the highlighted link, the hatched area indi-
cates the link’s riparian zone, the area enclosed by the dotted line denotes the link’s immediate
watershed (the upslope area that contributes ﬂow to the link) and the solid shaded area represents the
entire upstream contributing catchment area (UCA) for the highlighted link. The UCA encompasses
the ‘immediate watershed’ areas for all contributing links upstream of the highlighted link.

Riparian-scale variables were computed in a similar manner using buffer boundaries gen-
erated along each stream link. UCA-scale variables were computed from watershed- or
riparian-scale variables using network accumulation algorithms. The general modelling
approach for these operations followed that of Wilkinson et al. (2004). Finally, the direc-
tionality of the stream network was exploited to conduct ‘traces’ in upstream–downstream
directions along the ﬂow path of each link, computing a range of variables of poten-
tial ecological relevance using purpose-written tracing scripts. For example, estimates of
the average slope encountered along a link’s upstream ﬂow path or the maximum slope
encountered along a link’s downstream ﬂow path (US_AVGSLOPE and DS_MAXSLOPE,
respectively, in Table 2). These geoprocessing operations produced the ﬂuvial equivalent of
neighbourhood metrics for focal cells in terrestrial settings. The current number of avail-
able environmental predictors is 96 (Appendix 2B in Supplementary Material), but only a
subset was used for modelling (Table 2).

The spatially corrected ﬁsh sample sites were spatially joined to the network (tolerance
of 40 m) to extract estimates of predictors from corresponding stream links. We reviewed
the literature (Jackson and Williams 1980; Cadwallader and Backhouse 1983; McDowall
1996, 2006, Morris et al. 2001, Allen et al. 2002) for ecological insights on proximal and
distal predictors to guide our initial selection for the 17 target species (Williams et al.
2012). We concentrated on predictors that are temporally stable over the time period

that the ﬁsh data were collected. Predictors used for modelling had pairwise Pearson
correlations < 0.85.

Statistical modelling: boosted regression trees
We selected boosted regression trees (BRTs) to analyse the relationships between records
of whether a species was caught or not, and the environmental attributes of the associated
stream link. Details of the method are published (Elith et al. 2008, Hastie et al. 2009) so
here we give a brief overview (see Appendix 3 in Supplementary Material for elaboration)
and details of our modelling choices. BRTs are a combination of two algorithms: regression
trees (a type of decision tree) and boosting (a forward, stagewise model-ﬁtting procedure).
The ﬁnal BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model (Friedman et al.
2000) in which individual terms are trees (sometimes thousands of them) which have been
ﬁtted sequentially until an optimal level of complexity is achieved. BRTs are increas-
ingly used in ecology, with applications spanning SDMs and various other regression-style
analyses (examples and references in Appendix 3 in Supplementary Material). Relative
importance of variables, partial dependence plots (showing the marginal effect of a vari-
able on the response after accounting for the average effects of all other variables in the
model) and prediction can all be estimated for BRTs (Elith et al. 2008 and Appendix 3 in
Supplementary Material).

All analyses were carried out in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing 2008) using
the ‘gbm’ package (v1.6–3, Ridgeway 2007) plus additional code written by Elith et al.
(2008). BRT models were ﬁtted using a learning rate of 0.01 and a tree complexity of three
nodes, allowing up to three-way interactions among predictors. We used these settings as a
starting point and checked the number of trees in resultant models, adjusting the learning
rate downwards where necessary, to ensure ﬁnal models with around 1000 trees or more.
This mitigates against unwanted variation between runs of the stochastic modelling process
(Elith et al. 2008, Appendix 1). To control for overﬁtting, we used 10-fold cross-validation
(CV) for model development and automatic selection of the optimal number of trees. For
each species model, a ﬁnal set of predictors were selected from the full candidate set using
model simpliﬁcation code that sequentially dropped the least important predictors, until
the model was optimised for minimal average CV error in the 10-fold CV process (Elith
et al. 2008).

In addition to abiotic predictors, we considered biotic interactions. Including the
presence of other species as predictors might be informative regarding patterns of
co-occurrence or avoidance for native species. We reviewed literature on geographic distri-
bution and potential species interactions to identify the list of species thought to inﬂuence
each of the 11 native species (Appendix 4A in Supplementary Material).

If predictive performance is of interest, model evaluation should target independent
sites not used in model training, and a common method is to use sites set aside during
CV (Leathwick et al. 2008a). We did this using CV folds stratiﬁed by prevalence, utilising
the model building CV to provide measures of predictive performance (as detailed in Elith
et al. 2008). This gives an indication of predictive performance in the same general set of
rivers, which is primarily what we are interested in here. However, the hierarchical structure
of river systems means that some sites within a given CV fold will be along the same river,
and therefore this evaluation approach will be more optimistic than one that tests the model
on rivers outside the training sample. To assess model performance at spatially independent
sites (‘transferability’), we assembled data for 2492 sites across southern Victoria. This
is a difﬁcult test, because the south-draining river systems traverse different landscapes

and have substantially different disturbance histories compared with the north-draining
ones used for model training. We could evaluate 11 species models using these data; the
remaining species were too rare in these southern rivers for an informative result.

We used two model evaluation metrics – the percentage deviance explained and the area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Deviance explained measures the
goodness-of-ﬁt between predicted and raw values. We express it as a percentage of the
null deviance (the deviance of a model containing no terms and having a ﬁtted value for
all observations equal to the mean probability in the observations) for each species. AUC
measures a model’s ability to discriminate between sites where the species is present and
where it is absent. The AUC value is equivalent to the probability that a randomly selected
presence record will have a higher ﬁtted probability value than a randomly chosen absence
record. AUC ranges from 0 to 1–1 indicating perfect discrimination while 0.5 implies pre-
dictive ability that is no better than a random guess. We estimated deviance explained and
AUC for cross-validated models, and AUC for prediction to the geographically distinct
southern rivers.

Results

Since observations are the presence or absence of the species conditional on survey method,
and repeat visit data were unavailable for estimating detection probabilities, we report the
results as probability of observation or catch. While the survey method variable adjusts for
the variation in observation across methods, it does not allow absolute statements about
probabilities of occurrence. Model summaries and performance metrics for each species
are presented in Table 3. The number of variables retained in each ﬁnal model ranged
from nearly all variables retained in the case of Maccullochella macquariensis to only ﬁve
for Carassius auratus (Table 3). Mean cross-validated percentage deviance explained by
models was slightly higher for native species (42.8%) than for alien species (35.3%). Native
species models performed slightly better at discriminating between observed presences and
absences than models for alien species (mean cross-validated AUC of 0.928 versus 0.888).
From each species model, we extracted the top ten predictors based on their average
inﬂuence (Appendix 5 in Supplementary Material). Functions ﬁtted by BRT models for all
species are presented in Appendix 6 in Supplementary Material. Top predictors for each
species span a range of spatial scales from the riparian zone to the link watershed and
UCA (Appendix 5 in Supplementary Material). For 6 of the 17 species, catch response was
strongly dependant on the survey technique (SURV_METH is ranked among the top three
predictors for these species, Appendix 5 in Supplementary Material).

Including the presence of other species, turned out to be inﬂuential for Gadopsis
bispinosus, Galaxias fuscus and Macquaria ambigua (Appendix 5 in Supplementary
Material). The following results are based on relationships evident in ﬁtted functions for
each species (see Appendix 6 in Supplementary Material). The presence of Cyprinus
carpio was the strongest correlate of distribution for M. ambigua. Observations of
Macullochella peelii peelii were also positively correlated with the presence of C. car-
pio, but the marginal effect was very small. G. fuscus catch was negatively correlated with
the presence of Salmo trutta but the converse was true with respect to G. bispinosus.

To illustrate the relationships modelled with these data, we present ﬁtted functions for
the top four predictors in models for G. bispinosus, G. fuscus and C. carpio (Figure 3).
Here, we describe the main trends, particularly where data are more dense (see ticks at the
top of each pane, Figure 3). The partial plots for G. bispinosus (Figure 3a) indicate that it
is caught most frequently in links where the maximum slope along downstream ﬂow paths

is >30%. It also tends to be caught in links closer to headwater areas where the proportion
of tree cover in the UCA is >0.6 and where the mean UCA precipitation is >1000 mm
and watershed temperature in the warmest quarter is >16.5◦C. G. fuscus is most likely to
be caught in links where the UCA is nearly completely tree covered and where watershed
temperature in the wettest quarter is <≈4.5◦C and in the warmest quarter is <≈16.5◦C
(Figure 3b). C. carpio is detected most frequently using electroﬁshing, netting and mixed
methods and in links with where the UCA is large, link slope is <0.1% and watershed
temperature in the warmest quarter is >≈20◦C (Figure 3c).

Figure 4 illustrates mapped model predictions for the introduced S. trutta and two
native blackﬁsh, Gadopsis marmoratus and G. bispinosus, within the catchment of the
upper Goulburn River. Until relatively recently, G. marmoratus and G. bispinosus were
considered a single species (Lintermans 2000). However, when the relationships in envi-
ronmental space were modelled in our analysis and mapped, a quite distinct sorting of G.
marmoratus and G. bispinosus in geographic space becomes apparent (Figure 4b and c).
In river systems where both species have a high predicted probability of observation G.
marmoratus is replaced by G. bispinosus in the upper tributaries. S. trutta which is thought
to have adverse effects on both species via competition and predation has a high pre-
dicted probability of catch over considerable lengths of streams across the illustrated region
(Figure 4a). In particular, there is a high degree of overlap with the predicted distribution
of G. bispinosus.

Species prevalence in the south-draining rivers differed from that in the north (Tables 1
and 4), with the native species being considerably more rare in the southern catchments,
and the introduced species more common for all but one species. When models developed
with data from north-draining systems were used to predict to sites in south-draining rivers,
model performance ranged from little better than a random guess in the case of G. mar-
moratus to useful discriminatory ability with respect to Philypnodon grandiceps, C. carpio
and Gambusia holbrooki (Table 4). Models for alien species were better at discriminat-
ing between observed presences and absences than native species models (mean AUC of
0.724 versus 0.633), and the decrease in AUC from that estimated in the cross-validated
data ranged from 0.14 to 0.41 for native species and 0.12 to 0.21 for introduced species.

Discussion
Stream-link-based spatial infrastructure
Using commercially available and custom-written GIS geoprocessing tools, we created a
ﬁne-scale stream network GIS database and populated it with a suite of physiographic,
bioclimatic, edaphic and land-cover variables estimated at multiple scales. Calculating
multi-scale metrics for individual sites is an alternative means of providing the desired
multi-scale perspective for analysis. However, we opted to develop a hierarchical network-
based system because once built, it can be used with any set of input sites, can be
extended to include additional attributes, gives greater ﬂexibility for analysing upstream–
downstream effects on a site, and for assessing effects of management and conservation
priorities in a framework consistent with the functional connectivity pattern of river
systems (see, e.g. Moilanen et al. 2011).

This GIS database constitutes primary spatial infrastructure that can support the type
of multi-scale research and management of riverine ecosystems advocated by Fausch et al.
(2002), Durance et al. (2006) and Lowe et al. (2006). It has already been used to develop
freshwater SDMs for a state-wide spatial biodiversity prioritisation map (NaturePrint
v2.0, DSE 2012) and is being used to develop a quantitative classiﬁcation of riverine

habitat types (Bill O’Connor, personal communication, DSE). While the GIS database
includes the main biophysical attributes likely to inﬂuence biodiversity, we recognise that
to be of maximal utility for policy and management, it ought to include variables that
are amenable to management (Hopkins and Whiles 2011). Currently available predic-
tors that are amenable to management relate mainly to land-cover (e.g. proportion of
riparian tree cover) and in-stream structures (e.g. number of dam walls along a link’s
upstream/downstream ﬂow path) (Appendix 2B in Supplementary Material). Predictors
under development that will be management-relevant include a range of hydrological
indices to represent various aspects of the ﬂow regime and presence–absence of in-stream
coarse woody debris.

Evaluating the SDMs

For modelling ﬁsh species, we chose candidate predictors based on their likely ecologi-
cal relevance. Upstream catchment area (LINK_UCA_HA) featured among the top three
predictors for 11 out of the 17 species and may be important in indicating longitudinal posi-
tion of a site within a catchment. The variable sets that were identiﬁed as inﬂuential and the
relationships ﬁtted to them differed from species to species with no obvious dominant set
of predictors explaining variation in the probability of catch. This may be a function of the
modest environmental contrasts in the weathered landscapes of the study area. Inﬂuential
predictors for each species spanned the full range of spatial scales and included terms
relating to catch method, site location within a catchment, morphological, land-cover and
bioclimatic attributes. Together, they describe the mesoscale habitat characteristics of each
species. For some species, the variables and ﬁtted relationships had a relatively straight-
forward interpretation with respect to published accounts of a species’ preferred habitat.
For instance, this applied to M. peelii peelii and C. carpio, whose ﬁtted relationships (mid-
dle order to lowland catchment position, very low gradient slopes and warm temperatures
in the warmest quarter) matched well with published descriptions of habitat preferences
derived from ﬁeld studies (i.e. slow-ﬂowing or still waters with warm water temperatures
during spring–summer; Rowland 1988, Gilligan and Rayner 2007). For other species, the

variable set identiﬁed as inﬂuential was less obvious but suggested a range of ecologically
plausible interpretations.

Negative interactions with alien ﬁsh species are often cited as threats contributing to
native species’ decline in range and/or abundance. However, experimental studies allowing
rigorous testing of these hypotheses are few and challenging to implement under natural
conditions. Available evidence is mostly circumstantial; nevertheless, some interactions
such as the adverse impacts of trout on galaxiids have been exhaustively documented
(McDowall 2006). We included the presence of potential competitors/predators as addi-
tional predictors because we wanted to predict species distributions as accurately as
possible. Our intent in including potential competitors was not to attempt to make deﬁni-
tive statements about the nature of biotic interactions between species; with these data
alone, it is not possible to clearly attribute the relationship modelled between the target
species and its competitor to direct biotic interaction. Some of the species models might
include the competitor simply because it is an efﬁcient way to represent environments
important to the presence or absence of the target species. Furthermore, the competi-
tor’s distribution might indicate site-scale conditions or microhabitat characteristics not
represented in our predictor set. Rarely can biotic interactions be clearly identiﬁed from
SDMs (but see Leathwick and Austin (2001) for an exception). Indeed, in our models, the
responses modelled for competitors ranged from ecologically plausible to counter intuitive.
The conventional expectation of a negative relationship between the presence of S. trutta
on G. fuscus occurrence (Koehn and O’Connor 1990, McDowall 2006) was realised
(Appendix 6 in Supplementary Material). The presence of potential predators/competitors
had no detectable inﬂuence on the modelled catch of G. marmoratus, Galaxias olidus,
M. macquariensis, M. peelii peelii, Macquaria australasica, Nannoperca australis and
P. grandiceps. For two species apparently counter-intuitive results were obtained – that is,
positive associations between: the introduced S. trutta and G. bispinosus, and between the
introduced C. carpio and M. ambigua (Appendices 5 and 6 in Supplementary Material).
Nevertheless, these models appear to predict well within the region in which the models
were developed (on held-out, cross-validated data, ∼50% deviance explained and AUC
∼0.95, Table 3). Neither of these native species had sufﬁcient data in the geographically
independent dataset to test transferability.

The use of potential predators/competitors in these models is a possibly valid approach
that requires further testing. This might include predicting to various river systems, com-
paring the results from models with and without the competitors, and testing the modelled
results via additional surveys or expert evaluation (see Appendix 4B in Supplementary
Material for further discussion).

As demonstrated, the modest environmental contrasts of the study area posed no par-
ticular obstacle to developing models with valuable predictive ability and discriminatory
power in the training region. There is growing interest in assessing model transferability
(e.g. Heikkinen et al. 2012; Wenger and Olden 2012) and this study’s predictions to the
southern rivers adds an interesting (and rare) example evaluation of the ability of the mod-
els to predict to geographically independent rivers. For the 11 species tested, the models
always had a lower ability to discriminate between catch and non-catch in these south-
ern rivers (compare AUCs in Tables 3 and 4). This is understandable, as these rivers are
in substantially different landscapes with different disturbance histories. The lower preva-
lence of native species and higher prevalence of introduced species in southern rivers are
indicators of these different conditions. Most models retained some discriminatory ability
in the southern region. In reality, if predictions were required for these southern regions,
models would either be best ﬁtted to state-wide datasets or perhaps speciﬁcally to the

south-draining rivers. Nevertheless, being able to evaluate predictions in rivers not used
in model training is a useful test, and where data can be sensibly subdivided by river basins
for model training and testing, this may be preferable for many applications. In our case,
this was not feasible because over half the species analysed were patchily distributed across
the river basins.

Applications of mapped SDMs

A particular advantage of a ﬁne-scale, stream-link-based network over larger-scale, areal-
based representations is that predictions can be made at scales that can be feasibly
validated. Mapping quantitative models to speciﬁc spatial contexts, enables biologists to
visually compare their mental spatial models of ﬁsh occurrence with those developed
mathematically (McCleary and Hassan 2008). This allows expert evaluation of the models,
identiﬁcation of potential errors and enhancements, all of which are important to itera-
tive modelling processes. Predictions for unsampled streams provides information that can
assist ecological understanding, inquiry and management. For instance, mapped predic-
tions revealed the spatial sorting of the closely related G. marmoratus and G. bispinosus
(Figure 4b and c). Predictions can help identify sites of high potential occurrence of rare
species, suitable sites for establishing new populations of valued species and sites at risk
of invasive species proliferation. Species-by-species predictions for a region of interest
provides a robust method of deriving species assemblage proﬁles and provides a more
informative context for interpreting monitoring results (Magness et al. 2008). Using the
full capability of a GIS, mapped predictions can be summarised at any scale of manage-
ment interest and used in conjunction with conservation planning tools for tasks such as
quantitatively assessing the biodiversity conservation value of streams (see Moilanen et al.
2008, Leathwick et al. 2010, DSE 2012), and prioritising conservation and/or rehabilita-
tive efforts (see Moilanen et al. 2011). Both the GIS stream network database and SDMs
have immediate applications, but they also provide a ﬁrm foundation for the development
of more sophisticated tools for addressing challenges in the management and conservation
of Australian freshwater environments.

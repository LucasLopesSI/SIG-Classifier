ABSTRACT
Urban forms reﬂect spatial structures of cities, which have been
consciously and dramatically changing in China. Fast urbanisation
may lead to similar urban forms due to similar habits and strategies
of city planning. However, whether urban forms in China are iden-
tical or signiﬁcantly diﬀerent has not been empirically investigated.
In this paper, urban forms are investigated based on two spatial
units: city and block. The boundaries of natural cities in terms of the
density of human settlements and activities are delineated with the
concept of ‘redeﬁned city’ using points of interests (POIs), and
blocks are determined by road networks. Urban forms are charac-
terised by city-block two-level spatial morphologies. Further, rede-
ﬁned cities are classiﬁed into four hierarchies to examine the eﬀects
of diﬀerent city development stages on urban forms. The spatial
morphology is explained by urbanisation variables to understand
the eﬀects. Results show that the urban forms are spatially clustered
from the perspective of city-block two-level morphologies. Urban
forms tend to be similar within the same hierarchies, but signiﬁ-
cantly varied among diﬀerent hierarchies, which is closely related to
the development stages. Additionally, the spatial dimensional indi-
cators of urbanisation could explain 41% of the spatial morphology
of redeﬁned cities.

1. Introduction

Reasonable concepts and measures of urban form are diﬃcult to be determined to reﬂect both
overall and local distributions of human and socio-economic activities. Traditionally, cities are
deﬁned based on administrative boundaries, such as municipalities, prefectural cities and
country-level cities in China. However, modern city systems are complex and consist of
strongly interrelated components, including human networks and their links with the built
and natural environments (Chase-Dunn and Jorgenson 2002, Bettencourt and West 2010,
Taubenböck et al. 2017, Zou et al. 2017). In addition, urban morphology and clustered
functional areas have been dramatically changed during the past decades due to the rapid
urbanisation process globally (Taubenböck et al. 2012, Moghadam and Helbich 2013,

Ramachandra et al. 2015, Melchiorri et al. 2018), especially in China (Ma and Wu 2004, Wang
et al. 2005, Feng and Liu 2007, Zhou and Ye 2013). Thus, there is an apparent inconsistency
between traditional administrative boundaries of cities and the real densely populated or
functional central urban extent. For instance, the settlement pattern in reality can cover several
administrative cities, or it might be a small part of an administrative city. For the measures of
urban form, analysis based on a single spatial scale, e.g. city level, is lack of comprehensive
understanding of the complex city systems (Batty 2008, 2013a, 2013b). Urban forms reﬂect the
spatial structure of cities and it is a basic issue of analysing social and economic problems of
cities (Poelmans and Van Rompaey 2010, Webster 2010, Song et al. 2018b). To comprehen-
sively depict spatial structure of city systems, the assessment of urban forms should involve
both the morphological characteristics of city boundaries and the functional areas inside cities.
Therefore, this study will redeﬁne city extent to reﬂect their morphology and functional central
areas, and evaluate urban forms at both city and block levels.

In general, a city is deﬁned from three perspectives: a morphological area with a certain
population density or built-up region, a functional urban area covering core and periph-
eral scopes, and an administrative unit (Long 2016). Since the administrative boundaries of
cities cannot reﬂect the urban central regions with dense human and socio-economic
activities, data-driven methods are increasingly used to investigate real city systems in
recent researches (Long et al. 2016). In data-driven studies, urban central regions are
outlined by proxy variables of human and socio-economic activities with multi-source
data, including remote sensing images (Cai et al. 2017, Huang et al. 2018), population
density (Chi et al. 2015, Jin et al. 2017), built-up regions (Xu 2007), road networks (Long
2016), points of interest (POIs) (Jin et al. 2017) and geotagged social media data (Shelton
et al. 2015, Chua et al. 2016). In most of these studies, city boundary setting is universally
default as administrative unit to explore the clustered regions with dense human activities
and investigate active urban central areas (Long et al. 2016). As a result, since urban forms
which correspond to the constitution of reality may cover a part of administrative unit or
many administrative cities, it is not appropriate to address issues of real urban forms.

In addition, it is still a debatable problem that urban forms tend to be diverse or similar
due to continuous and dramatic changes during rapid urbanisation, especially in devel-
oping nations such as China. From the perspective of urban planning, urbanisation usually
leads to similar urban forms especially in developing and active urban regions. This
phenomenon is commonly caused by the habits of city planning, similar policies for city
development, living and cognitive habits of residents (Stoyanov and Frantz 2006). Small
area-based analysis of urban form demonstrates that urban structure tended to be stable
over a decade due to a job-housing balance, although this area was continuously growing
(Horner 2007). However, from the perspective of human’s movement, urbanisation also
may lead to diﬀerent urban structures due to various needs of residents (Doxiadis 1968).
The histories of city forming and development are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, which means
that the urban forms are diverse, since the changes of urban forms are bound to have
various historical reasons. Further, global climate change and its related events such as sea
level rise and extreme weather also urge new living environment and city planning
(Hamin and Gurran 2009). Thus, the interaction between urban development and climate
change enables sustainability to become a key issue of new approaches for the develop-
ment of urban form, the size, scale and shape of cities (Landsberg 1970, Batty 2008, Grimm
et al. 2008). It is noted that with the integrated impacts of historical trajectories in urban

development and socio-economic factors, urban forms of European cities, especially those
located in the western and northern regions, are more like Unites States, Australian and
New Zealand cities, but signiﬁcantly diﬀerent with Asian cities (Huang et al. 2007). While,
other researchers still believe that sprawl urban forms in the United States are distinct with
compact cities in Europe (Brueckner 2000, Johnson 2001).

Urban patterns can be measured from the geographical, geometric, topological,
typological and morphological perspectives (Marshall 2004). The geographical measures
are usually the administrative boundaries, which describe urban patterns by the territor-
ial jurisdiction (Cai et al. 2017). The geometric measures primarily describe the shape and
structure of road network pattern to estimate traﬃc ﬂows and assess road designs
(Marshall 2004). The topological measures can depict the spatial contiguity among
road network, or between road network and land use (Jiang and Claramunt 2004). The
topological analysis has broad applications, such as transport geography, built environ-
ment and infrastructure management (Marshall 2004, Jiang 2007). The typological
analysis exams urban road network from a typological space which includes various
road types and classiﬁcation systems (Louf and Barthelemy 2014).

A popular method of sprawling urban forms is to quantify spatial morphology of
urban outlines or boundaries (Zhou and Ye 2013). Urban spatial morphology is
aﬀected by city planning and construction, and conversely, urban development
also has inﬂuence on the spatial morphology. The commonly used indicators for
capturing urban spatial morphology include fractal dimension (Niemeyer et al. 1984,
Shen 2002, Frankhauser 2015), compact ratio (Liu et al. 2003) and shape factor
(Haggett et al. 1977). Compared with the basic measures of urban forms, such as
length, area and density, fractal dimension is used to diﬀerentiate shapes of cities
which tend to be circle or striped, and it is more eﬃcient in describing space ﬁlling
of urban evolution (Shen 2002, Zhou and Ye 2013). Compact ratio can describe the
closeness of various parts of cities, and it reveals the conditions of energy consump-
tion, transport convenience and the distributions of urban district functions (Zhou
and Ye 2013). Shape factor tends to reveal a city with single centre for development
or diverse distributions of urban district functions with multiple functional centres
(Haggett et al. 1977). While, urban forms are not only presented by the boundaries of
the whole cities, but also reﬂected from the forms and distributions of blocks inside
cities (Louf and Barthelemy 2014). Urban boundary represents the characteristics of
urban spatial morphology, but it is limited in capturing the spatial structure inside
cities. A common block distribution pattern is that the blocks with identical or similar
functions are clustered (Yuan et al. 2012). Road networks are a simple view of cities
to depict the spatial structure and organisation inside cities, helping to understand of
urban forming mechanisms (Southworth and Ben-Joseph 2013, Song et al. 2018c).
From the perspective of human eye, road networks-based blocks are detailed and
practical for the description of urban inside structure instead of road networks itself,
which are equivalent
issue (Louf and Barthelemy 2014,
Taubenböck et al. 2016). Thus, blocks in each city can be recognised based on the
road networks. Most of previous studies quantify urban forms with merely one
aspect of spatial morphologies of cities, whole cities or blocks inside cities, but few
of them consider both spatial scales simultaneously. This paper assesses urban forms
involving both city-level and block-level spatial morphologies, and the integrated

measures can characterise urban forms to reﬂect both overall and local distributions
of human and socio-economic activities.

In this paper, to quantitatively and reasonably reveal whether all cities are of
similar urban forms or not, cities are redeﬁned to reﬂect their real and natural central
regions, and spatial morphology is computed with both city-level and block-level
indicators. The natural cities are the naturally and objectively delineated urban extent
in terms of the density of human settlements and activities (Jiang and Jia 2011, Jiang
and Liu 2012, Jiang and Miao 2015, Jiang et al. 2015, Bergs 2018), which are usually
quantiﬁed by population data and the proxy variables of human activities, such as
nightlight images and web-based geospatial big data (Jiang and Ren 2018, Song
et al. 2018a). The redeﬁned cities present the urban central regions with relatively
high density of human activities in the natural cities. Spatial morphologies at both
city and block levels are evaluated with the variables ‘fractal dimension’,
‘compact
ratio’ and ‘shape factor’. Spatial patterns of both morphologies are explored using a
spatial autocorrelation method, respectively. Then cities are classiﬁed using clustering
methods according to both the city-level and block-level spatial morphologies infor-
mation. Further, the spatial diﬀerences among cities are explored based on the
spatial dimensional indicators of urbanisation, including POI density, area, population
density, road junction density and distance to the nearest city.

This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes study area and data and
Section 3 elaborates methods of redeﬁning and assessing city systems. In Section 4,
analysis results in each step are presented. Sections 5 and 6 propose discussion and
conclusion of this study, respectively.

2. Study area and data

2.1. City system in China

City system in China is spatially deﬁned as administrative city boundaries for the
management and statistics, which is diﬀerent with the metropolitan statistical areas
in the United States and Australia, and the functional urban areas in European Union
countries (Long 2016, Jin et al. 2017). Under the deﬁnition of a city system, there are
657 cities with three hierarchies in 2011 in China, including four national municipa-
lities, 284 prefecture-level cities and 369 county-level cities (Ministry of Housing and
Urban-rural Development of the People’s Republic of China (MOHURD) 2011b). This
system lists cities with relative large urban areas, dense population and high socio-
economic status, but this system can’t reﬂect all the real urban central extent.
In
2011, total built-up area of 657 cities is 43 603 km2, accounting for 23.75% of the
whole areas of cities (Ministry of Housing and Urban-rural Development of the
People’s Republic of China (MOHURD) 2011b).
In addition to these urban areas,
there are still built-up regions of 17 376 km2 in other 1 627 counties and 33
860 km2 in towns (Ministry of Housing and Urban-rural Development of
the
People’s Republic of China (MOHURD) 2011a). This means that the city system in
China includes sub-urban and rural areas within the administrative cities, but doesn’t
cover all prefecture-level and county-level urban regions. In this paper, the cities are
redeﬁned as the real spatially closely connected urban central
regions where

population is dense, human activities are abundant and active, and built environ-
ment and infrastructure conditions are relatively complete. Thus, the redeﬁned cities
will cover all the central urban extent across China, which might vary in diﬀerent
hierarchies in the administrative city system.

2.2. Points of interest (POIs) and road networks

POIs and road networks are utilised to deﬁne urban regions and blocks inside cities. POIs
are the accurate locations of important and hotspot urban infrastructures, such as hotels,
schools, hospitals and industries, so they are usually regarded as useful and self-deﬁned
components in the urban management systems (Man et al. 2012). Thus, in this paper,
POIs are a proper proxy variable for capturing active human activities and residential
development (Chi et al. 2015), and it is used to outline boundaries of redeﬁned cities.
POIs across China in 2011 are collected and geo-coded by business cataloguing websites
to recognise the boundaries of urban regions in China. The quality of POIs is secured
through random manual checks. There are totally 2,581,382 POIs in China, and the
average POI density is 0.269 points per square kilometres. POIs present the locations
of urban functions such as shopping, public administration, education, government
buildings, etc. Road networks data include highways, national roads, provincial roads,
county roads and urban expressways. Figure 1 shows the spatial distributions of POIs

example region surrounding Xinxiang, a prefectural level city in Henan province (c and d).

and road networks in China and within an example region surrounding Xinxiang, a
prefectural level city in Henan province.

2.3. Data for quantifying urbanisation

Urbanisation is quantiﬁed by considering the city size, active level of human activities, urban
infrastructure conditions and the relationships with surrounding cities. City size is computed
as area (km2) of a redeﬁned city. Human activities are depicted with POI density (points/km2)
and population density (persons/km2). Population data is sourced from China Temporal
Datasets in 2010 with the spatial resolution of 100 m (Gaughan 2015). Urban infrastructure
conditions are described with a proxy variable of road junction density (junction/km2). There
are 2,728,143 road junctions across China in 2011, which is provided by Beijing City Lab
(Long 2014). Road junction density of a city is computed with the total number of road
junctions within the city divided by the city area. The spatial relationship between a
redeﬁned city and its surrounding cities is quantiﬁed with the Euclidean distance from the
geometric centre of this city to the centre of nearest city (km).

3. Methods of redeﬁning and assessing city systems

3.1. Method outline

This paper aims to answer the question that whether urban forms are all identical in
China. To study the similarities and diﬀerences of the urban forms, city systems are
redeﬁned to outline the natural central urban regions, the spatial morphology is char-
acterised, and the cities are classiﬁed based on the morphology of urban forms. There
are primarily three stages of this research as shown in Figure 2. First, city systems are
redeﬁned with POIs to depict the central urban regions whose boundaries are develop-
ing naturally instead of outlined by administrative necessities. Then, spatial morpholo-
gies of cities are characterised by both city-level and block-level morphological
indicators. Finally, redeﬁned cities are classiﬁed according to the city and block two-
level morphology to investigate whether urban forms tend to be similar or not. To
validate the hierarchy result, the spatial diﬀerences among various hierarchies of cities
are explored considering the relationships between the integrated spatial morphology
and corresponding spatial dimensional indicators of urbanisation.

3.2. Redeﬁning cities

The process of redeﬁning cities is to generate boundaries of urban central regions of
natural cities using POIs. Figure 3 shows the process of redeﬁning cities with the
example region around Xinxiang, which consists of the following ﬁve steps. The ﬁrst
step is to calculate POI density and generate POI density map with Kernel density
functions with the spatial resolution of 500 m. The resolution around 500 m can
statistically summarise points and it is proper and commonly used for generating raster
products across China, e.g. land surface temperature, forest coverage (Li et al. 2017), land
cover (Gong et al. 2013), gross domestic product (GDP) (Liu et al. 2005) and population
estimations (Fu et al. 2014).

Second, before classifying the central urban regions and other areas, the classiﬁ-
cation threshold should be determined for the density-based classiﬁcation. A cumu-
lative distribution function (CDF) of POI density is utilised to describe and
diﬀerentiate the spatial variations of POI density from the central urban regions to
the outer areas. A larger CDF value indicates a more central urban region, and the
diﬀerence between urban central regions and outer areas are presented by the
changes of CDF of POI density. When the change of CDF tends to be small enough,
which is set as 0.5% in the study, the classiﬁcation threshold is determined. If the
change is too large, some urban central regions will not be included. If the change is
too small, many outer areas will be treated as urban central regions. In the study,
based on the 500-m grid POI density map, the frequency and CDF are computed
with the interval of 10 points/km2 from 0 to the maximum density 1199.58 points/
km2, which are summarised in Table 1. In Figure 3 and Table 1, the change of CDF of
POI density is signiﬁcantly reduced at the beginning intervals, but it gets small when
the POI density is higher than 50 points/km2. The changes of the CDF of POI density
lower than 50 points/km2 are all larger than 0.5%, where the change from 30; 40
(cid:2) to
(cid:2) is 0.64%, but the changes of the CDF of POI density higher than 50 points/
40; 50
ð
km2 are smaller than 0.5%, where the change from 40; 50
(cid:2) is 0.47%. The
grids with POI density lower than 50 points/km2 account for 96.9% of all density
grids, and that higher than 50 points/km2 account for 3.1%. As a result, when the
classiﬁcation threshold is 50 points/km2, the percentage of urban central region areas
is 3.1%. On one hand, if the threshold is higher than 50 points/km2, the grids with
POI density will cover fewer urban central regions and some areas that should be
urban central regions are not included. For instance, when the threshold is 60 points/
Þ=3:11%) that should be urban central
km2, 15.0% of the areas ( 3:11% (cid:3) 2:65%
regions are removed. On the other hand, if the threshold is lower than 50 points/
km2 (e.g. 40 points/km2), the urban central regions will include at least 17.1% of the
areas ( 3:75% (cid:3) 3:11%
Þ=3:75%) that should be outer areas. Thus, the boundary of the
central urban regions is deﬁned and determined by the conditions that local POI
density is set as at least 50 points/km2. This POI density threshold diﬀerentiates the
urban central regions where POIs are grid distributed and other areas where POIs are
linearly or sparse distributed.

The third step is to classify the central urban regions and other areas with the POI
density map and the selected classiﬁcation threshold. The fourth step is converting raster
map to polygons to derive the initial city boundaries. Finally, cities with areas smaller than
2 km2 are removed, which means the redeﬁned cities contain at least a main street of
2 km in the urban central regions. Thus, the POI density-based boundaries of redeﬁned
cities are determined, which presents the urban central regions of natural cities.

3.3. Characterising cities and blocks

Three indicators are used to capture the spatial morphology of redeﬁned cities, includ-
ing fractal dimension, compact ratio and shape factor. Analysing fractal dimension of
urban space is a focus of depicting urban morphology (Niemeyer et al. 1984, Shen 2002,
Frankhauser 2015). In this research, a variable-sized grid method is used to estimate
fractal dimension within the city boundary. The urban extent is covered by grids with
varying sizes. When the grid side length l varies, the number of grids covering urban
boundary N lð Þ and number of grids covering the whole urban extent B lð Þ have to be
changed. According to fractal theory, lnN lð Þ ¼ C þ DlnB lð Þ1=2, where C is constant and D
is the dimension of city boundary. The varying side lengths enable a series of point pairs
(cid:1)
lnN lð Þ; lnB lð Þ1=2
point pairs. A large D value means the urban form is more fractal, and urban develop-
ment tends to be more diverse (Figure 4).

. Thus the estimation of D is the slope of linear regression for these

(cid:3)

Compact ratio is another indicator for depicting urban spatial morphology (Liu et al.
2003). Compact ratio r of urban boundary is calculated as r ¼ 2
=P, where A is urban
area and P is perimeter of boundary. A high r value represents the compact urban form

that tends to be a circle, while a low one means the urban form is narrow and long.
Actually, both high and low compact ratios have their respective advantages. High
compact ratios enable the close connection among various parts of cities, which could
reduce energy consumption and improve transport convenience (Newman and
Kenworthy 1999, Shim et al. 2006) (Figure 4). For low compact ratios, urban district
functions are more apparent.

A third characterisation of urban form is its shape factor s, which is calculated as the ratio
between urban area A and the area of the circumscribed circle M, s ¼ A=AM (Haggett et al.
1977). Usually the shape factor is smaller than one, and a smaller one means the more
anisotropic the urban form is (Figure 4). An anisotropic urban form may be characterised as
diverse distribution of urban district functions and multiple centres of development.

Further, three spatial morphology indicators, including fractal dimension, compact ratio
and shape factor, are also used for characterising blocks. In this research, both city-level and
block-level spatial morphologies are integrated to capture urban forms. The relations of
both kinds of indicators are shown in Figure 4. A larger city-level spatial morphology is
composed by larger fractal dimension (Cfd), reciprocal compact ratio (1/Ccr) and reciprocal
shape factor (1/Csf), which indicates that the form of central urban region is more fractal,
less compact and more unevenly distributed due to more ﬁxed district functions.
Meanwhile, a larger block-level spatial morphology, consisting of reciprocal fractal dimen-
sion (1/Bfd), compact ratio (Bcr) and shape factor (Bsf), reveals more spatially clustered and
compact spatial structures and block organisations with identical functional blocks.

3.4. Hierarchy of cities and validation

To investigate whether urban forms are all similar or not, the redeﬁned cities are
classiﬁed using cluster analysis for the city and block two-level spatial morphologies.
The city clusters represent the similarities or diﬀerences of spatial morphologies among
cities. Cities within the same hierarchy are of similar urban forms, and cities in diﬀerent
hierarchies are of distinct urban forms. Two primary methods of clustering are hierarch-
ical clustering and k-means clustering. There are a lot of assumptions in k-means
clustering. For instance, number of clusters is a pre-speciﬁed and ﬁxed value k, compu-
tation objective is minimising the sum of squared errors (SSE), variables should be of
spherical distribution, all variables have the same variance or importance for clustering,
and all k clusters have the same prior probability (Hartigan and Wong 1979, Kanungo
et al. 2002). Compared with k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering is ﬂexible in
choosing the number of clusters and has weaker assumptions, so it is commonly used
in urban planning ﬁeld. Unlike k-means runs clustering process with a single step,
hierarchical clustering runs a series of partitions ranging from N clusters each involving
one object to a single cluster with all objects. Thus, the hierarchical clustering method is
used to classify redeﬁned cities with the variables of city-level and block-level spatial
morphological
indicators. The multicollinearity of variables is tested using condition
numbers before hierarchical clustering analysis.

In addition, to understand the potential reasons of the similarities or diﬀerences of
urban forms, the contributions of urbanisation on central urban forms are computed,
which includes the following three steps. First, an integrated spatial morphology indi-
cator is calculated by a sum of weighted city-level and block-level spatial morphologies

for describing the overall forms of the redeﬁned cities. During the calculation, both city-
level and block-level spatial morphologies are normalised to variables raging from 0 to
1, and the weights of variables are computed using an entropy weighting method. The
entropy weighting method based on entropy information theory is eﬃcient in inferring
the useful information of variables (Chen et al. 2018, Xie et al. 2018). Thus, the entropy
weights indicate the relative amount of useful information and relative importance of
variables. Next, urbanisation of redeﬁned cities is quantiﬁed with the city size, active
level of human activities, urban infrastructure conditions and the relationships with
surrounding cities. Finally, a generalised additive model (GAM) is utilised to calculate
the deviance explained by each urbanisation variable. It could depict both linear and
nonlinear relationships between independent variables and responses through non-
parametric smoothing functions (Hastie and Tibshirani 1990, Strawa et al. 2011, Li
et al. 2013, Song et al. 2016, Wu et al. 2017). GAM is a reliable and ﬂexible approach
for exploring statistical relationships, computing contributions of potential variables and
making predictions (Song et al. 2015, 2017).

4. Results

4.1. Redeﬁned cities and their characteristics

In this study, 2005 redeﬁned cities in China (see Figure 5(a)) are derived from POI density
map with the Kernel density functions. As a result, each city covers at least 170 POIs and
areas of 2 km2, and the minimum mean POI density of redeﬁned cities is 78.66 points per
square kilometres. Correspondingly, the averaged POI densities in cities are mapped in
Figure 5(b), showing that high POI densities appear in south-eastern China along the
ocean and western China, while low-density cities are primarily located in northern
China. To explain the process of this study, four cities are selected as examples, including
the redeﬁned cities around Beijing, Hohhot, Xinxiang and Jiujiang. These four cities are
used as exemplars since they are of distinct city sizes, varied patterns of road networks,
and distributed in diﬀerent regions in China. Their locations are shown in Figure 5(a).
Beijing is a typical large city in China. The urban central area of the redeﬁned city is
503.21 km2 covering 4.94 million inhabitants, 89 101 POIs and 46 872 road junctions.
Hohhot is a provincial capital located in northern China. Area, population and number of
POIs in Hohhot are nearly one-tenth of those in Beijing, and number of road junctions is
about one-twentieth of that in Beijing. Xinxiang and Jiujiang are both prefecture-level
cities. Xinxiang is in plain area and the middle part of China, so its road networks are grid
distributed. Jiujiang locates on the southern shores of the Yangtze River in southern
China, and its road networks are irregularly distributed due to dense river net. The
relationships between city boundaries and POI density are mapped in Figure 5(c-f).

The redeﬁned cities reﬂect the urban central regions with dense human and socio-
economic activities. Their boundaries are very likely inconsistent with the administrative
boundaries. To illustrate this concern, the spatial relative relations of urban central regions
presented by the concept of the spatial redeﬁned city extents are compared with the
administrative county boundaries and primary cities locations, including capital, provincial
capitals, prefecture-level cities and districts/countries (Figure 6). For the four example
cities, the central urban regions are generally composed by multiple nearby cities instead

of a single one. While surrounding the four example cities, there are still many cities that
their geographic locations are consistent with administrative cities. In addition, the incon-
sistency between redeﬁned city boundaries and administrative boundaries or locations
also appears in two kinds of cases. One is that the places are recognised as redeﬁned cities
but they are not administrative cities shown in Figure 6(a), the other one is the contrary
case that the places are not redeﬁned cities but practically they are administrative cities as
shown in Figure 6(b-d). This inconsistency demonstrates the redeﬁned cities represent the
central, active and continuously developing urban regions.

The city-level spatial morphology indicators of redeﬁned cities, including fractal dimen-
sion, compact ratio and shape factor, are mapped in Figure 7(a,c,e). To learn the spatial

diﬀerence of spatial morphology in redeﬁned cities, local spatial autocorrelation of each
indicator is tested by a local indicator of spatial association (LISA) (Anselin 1995), which are
mapped in Figure 7(b,d,f). The maps of LISA show the hot-spot clusters (high-high, H-H) and
cold-spot clusters (low-low, L-L) of redeﬁned cities, where hot-spot clusters mean the value
of a spatial morphology indicator of a city is high and the indicator values of its adjacent
cities are also high, and cold-spot clusters have the contrary meaning (Ge et al. 2017). In
general, hotspot cities are located in southern part of China and cold-spot cities are in
northern part of China, but the distributions of three indicators are distinct. The forms of
cites in southern part of China are more fractal, disperse and banded compared with those
in northern part of China. A direct reason of this phenomenon is the topographical
diﬀerence. Northern China Plain and North-eastern China Plain are two primary plains
distributed in northern part of China, leading to free radial development of cities. On the
contrary, the topography of southern part of China is characterised as dense river networks
and hilly areas. Thus, the central cities would expand along rivers and hills, causing their
complex fractal, disperse and banded forms.

4.2. Blocks and their characteristics

With the help of road networks data, 154 871 blocks are generated within all 2005 redeﬁned
cities in China. Similarly, four example urban regions are used to explain the block-level
analysis. The blocks in the four example cities are illustrated in Figure 8. The total number of

blocks of four example redeﬁned cities of Beijing, Hohhot, Xinxiang and Jiujiang are 3536,

the integrated performance of block-level spatial morphology, the indicators are sum-
marised with mean values for each city. As shown in Figure 9(m-o), the statistical
summaries by boxplots reﬂect the statistical diﬀerence of the indicators in various cities
besides the spatial diﬀerence shown in the maps. According to the urban forms deﬁned
by block-level morphology illustrated in Figure 4, a larger mean or median block-level
spatial morphology indicator demonstrates a more clustered urban inside structure and
organisation, and a more compact form of urban functional areas. The urban inside
structure in Xinxiang is more compact than that in other cities, and the land resources
with similar functions are more clustered organised. The inside structure in Beijing is
continuously changing, parts of functional areas are still moving and central regions are
expanding with diﬀerent magnitudes and speeds especially in newly developing regions
(Chen and Wang 2013, Long et al. 2013, Wu et al. 2015), even though the inside structure
in some regions are mature and robust. Both topology and the development of func-
tional areas have inﬂuence on the inside structure of Jiujiang. All four example cities are
in river network, but Jiujiang is located near Yangtze River and its river network is much
denser than others.

Correspondingly, block-level spatial morphology indicators are summarised within
each redeﬁned city, and the spatial autocorrelations of mean morphological indicators
are tested by LISA (Figure 10). Results demonstrate that hotspot cities of reciprocal of
fractal dimension and compact ratio of blocks locate in northern and north-eastern

China, while cold-spot clusters locate in the western part especially south-western China.
Hotspot cities of shape factor are distributed in northern China, and cold-spot ones are
north-eastern and south-western China. Diﬀerent from the spatial clustering patterns of
city-level morphology indicators, clustering patterns of block-level morphology indica-
tors are caused by various reasons such as histories, local culture, recent fast urbanisa-
tion, urban renewal, etc.

4.3. Hierarchies of redeﬁned cities

4.3.1. Similarities and diﬀerences among hierarchies
With the above analysis and results, urban forms of redeﬁned cities are sprawled by
three city-level and three block-level spatial morphology indicators, which are sum-
marised in Table 2. The condition number-based multicollinearity test shows that
there is no harmful multicollinearity between pairs of indicators. Based on these spatial
morphology indicators, redeﬁned cities are classiﬁed into four hierarches to investigate
the diﬀerences of forms of urban central extent in China. The four hierarches are

selected in terms of the four combinations of city-level and block-level morphology
indicators, including (1) high city-level and high block-level, (2) high city-level and low
block-level, (3) low city-level and high block-level and (4) low city-level and low block-
level morphology indicators. Results show that the characteristics of the cities within
four hierarchies are generally consistent with the four combinations. Figure 11 shows
the spatial morphology-based hierarchies and their distributions. Among four hierar-
chies, 26.8% of cities belong to hierarchy 1. Hierarchy 1 represents the active and
function diversiﬁed cities,
including capital, provincial capitals and primary cities in
China. Hierarchy 2 and 3 are two kinds of primary cities, accounting for 33.9% and
23.2% of all 2005 redeﬁned cities. Among them, hierarchy 2 is the cities with relatively

high city-level values of spatial morphology indicators but relatively low block-level
values, and hierarchy 3 has the contrary conditions. They both have developing poten-
tial from the perspective of city planning and construction. Hierarchy 4 accounts for
16.1% and is relatively undeveloped cities or cities at an early development stage.
Relatively undeveloped cities are located far from other cities, and the cities at an
early development stage are located near previous three kinds of cities, especially the
cities belong to hierarchy 1 as shown in Figure 11(c–f).

Integrated spatial morphology

4.3.2.
With the aim to understand the urban forms of redeﬁned cities, an integrated spatial
morphology (ISM) indicator is computed by entropy weighting method. The entropy weights
of Cfd, 1/Ccr, 1/Csf, 1/Bfd, Bcr and Bsf are 0.129, 0.440, 0.360, 0.009, 0.009 and 0.053. Thus, the
city-level and block-level spatial morphology indicators contribute 92.9% and 7.1% to ISM,
respectively. The summarised ISM indicator is mapped in Figure 12, which indicates the
diﬀerences of ISM among four hierarchies. In general, ISM in hierarchy 1 is the highest and
that in hierarchy 3 is the lowest. The cities with higher ISM tend to be mega cities in China. This
result is consistent with the descriptions for four hierarchies. Additionally, ISMs of cities in the
southern part are generally higher than those in northern China.

Urban forms of the redeﬁned cities that quantiﬁed by the ISM also reﬂect the

functional areas are relatively more comprehensive and industrial structures are more
diversiﬁed, and the high block-level ISM reveals that the regions of certain industries
and functions are more clustered. Figure 13(a) shows the relationship between city-
level and block-level ISMs. The large cities are primarily distributed in hierarchy 1, and
their city-level ISMs are relatively higher than other cities. For these cities, block-level
ISM is negatively associated with city-level ISM, which means that the high diversity
of functions and industrial structures might lead to the loss of developing locally
clustered regions of certain functions. In addition, cities in hierarchy 2 have moderate
block-level ISM, and the block-level and city-level ISMs are positively correlated. In
these cities, the overall and local developments are promoted by each other.

Further, the ISM is compared with the city size, which is a more general and straight
forward indicator that reﬂects the scale of a city and the commuting structure inside city
(Louail et al. 2015). Figure 13(b) shows the signiﬁcantly positive relationships between
POI densities and areas of the redeﬁned cities in all four hierarchies. Figure 13(c-f) show
the relationships between city size and ISMs. City-level, block-level and overall ISMs are
all increased with the growing of city size, except for the block-level ISM of cities in
hierarchy 3. For most of cities, the enlarged city size is associated with the urban
development or rapid urbanisation, where the functional areas and industrial structures

22

become more diverse. However, the cities in hierarchy 3 are characterised with high
block-level ISM and low city-level ISM, so they have advantages over one or several
clustered functional areas, but are limited in various industrial structures. Thus, for these
cities, the increase of city size is not beneﬁt for the development of locally clustered
functional areas.

4.4.

Impacts of urbanisation on urban forms

Spatial dimensional variables of urbanisation include POI density, area, population
density, road junction density within each redeﬁned city and distance to the nearest
cities, which are listed and summarised in Table 3. The impact of each urbanisation
variable on the integrated indicator is determined by GAM, and the deviance explained
by each variable is listed in Table 4. Urbanisation can explain 41.0% of the diﬀerences of
spatial morphology among redeﬁned cities. The area of one city reﬂects its spatial scale,
which is signiﬁcantly related to the spatial morphology with the deviance explained of
30.37%. POI density and the distance to the nearest city contribute 9.62% to spatial
morphology together. The deviances explained by urbanisation in four hierarchies are
diﬀerent, ranging from 15.6% to 44.6%, due to the various stages of urban development.
For hierarchy 1, 3 and 4, area is still the most important contributor of spatial morphol-
ogy to diﬀerentiate cities, but the key factor of the spatial morphology in cities of
hierarchy 2 is the distance with the nearest city. Thus, the development of cities of
hierarchy 2 signiﬁcantly relies on the surrounding fast developing or developed cities.
POIs are a primary contributor to the urban forms besides the variable of area for the
cities of hierarchy 1. POI presents the distributions of the primary functional areas and
the regions with active human activities, so the cities of hierarchy 1 are at fast growing
stage. Results also show that cities of hierarchy 3 and 4 are at initially signiﬁcant
developing stage. In these cities, expanding land use is still the primary approach for
the development. For cities of hierarchy 3, urbanisation variables are limited in explain-
ing urban forms. Considering the descriptions of hierarchy 3, the block-level spatial
morphology performs well but city-level one is weak. This means the inside structure

and distribution is relatively good but urban development is slow. For cities of hierarchy
4, all urbanisation variables besides area play important roles in the total deviance,
which demonstrates that both human activities and infrastructure construction have
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the early development stage of urbanisation process.

5. Discussion

5.1. Are urban forms all identical?

Compared with traditional deﬁnition of city systems whose spatial scales are outlined by
administrative boundaries, the concept of the spatially redeﬁned city systems draws city
boundaries using POIs in terms of the naturally developed spatial structures of cities, e.g.
urban function agglomeration pattern. Urban forms are quantiﬁed with two-level spatial
morphology indicators from the perspectives of both cities and blocks. Results of spatial
autocorrelations of single indicators show signiﬁcant local clustering of cities in China,
which means that the forms of cities within the same spatial clusters are similar, but the
forms of cities in diﬀerent clusters are varied. Further, the integration of both levels of
spatial morphologies helps classify the cities into four signiﬁcantly diﬀerentiated hier-
archies. Within each hierarchy, urban forms are similar or identical, but they are distinct
at city level, block level or both levels in diﬀerent hierarchies.

The similarities of cities in the same hierarchy, or the diﬀerences of cities in diﬀerent
hierarchies, are correlated with human activities and corresponding built and natural
environment, which usually reﬂect the level of urbanisation process. Thus, the relation-
ships between urban forms together with their similarities or diﬀerences and the level of
urbanisation are assessed using nonparametric models. The level of urbanisation is
considered with proxy variables from the aspects of spatial scale of central urban
regions, human density, active human activities, infrastructure construction conditions
and inter-city spatial relations. The two-level spatial morphology analysis for all rede-
ﬁned cities and each hierarchy of cities demonstrate that urbanisation could explain 41%
of the variations of urban forms. The variations of urban forms that cannot be explained
by urbanisation might relate to the habits of city planning, policies for city development,
living and cognitive habits of residents, the histories of city forming and development,
global climate change and its related events such as sea level rise and extreme weather
(Doxiadis 1968, Stoyanov and Frantz 2006, Hamin and Gurran 2009).

Among urbanisation variables of the urban forms, the spatial scale of cities is a primary
factor at the developed stage and early development stage, but it is not the main driver at fast
developing stage, especially for the cities that the development closely relies on surrounding
developed and fast-growing cities. In addition, the performance of human activities is a key
factor for the urban form and urbanisation relationships of developed and fast-growing cities.
For the cities at an early stage of development, infrastructure construction conditions are of
signiﬁcance for the development of urban forms together with human activities.

tion of urban structure and distributions of functional areas inside cities. The contribu-
tions of this study are listed as follows.

First, cities are redeﬁned with widespread popular data using simple and direct
methods. Compared with traditional deﬁnition of city systems, the redeﬁned cities reveal
the real spatially closely connected urban central regions. This redeﬁnition of cities is
particularly essential in China due to the apparent inconsistency between administrative
cities and the real extent of cities. China is a fast-developing nation, and it is undergoing
the extensive and profound urbanisation. Urban forms are signiﬁcantly varied during the
past decades, and they are still greatly changing now. Data-driven methods for redeﬁn-
ing cities are practical and essential for understanding the rapid urbanisation in China.
Second, spatial morphology of urban forms is quantiﬁed using two-level urban form
indicators (city level and block level). The two-level methodology considers both the spatial
morphology at city scale and that of blocks within cities. Compared with previous studies that
consider urban morphology from one perspective of morphologies, the integration of city-
level and block-level morphologies is critical in investigating conditions of urban develop-
ment and distributions of functional regions. The integration is also beneﬁt for more com-
prehensive understanding of both overall and local development of industrial structure.

Third, this study tries to answer the question that whether all cities are with similar
urban form or not. To answer this question, redeﬁned cities are classiﬁed based on their
city-level and block-level spatial morphologies, an integrated indicator of spatial mor-
phology (ISM) is computed, and the diﬀerence of ISMs among cities is explained by
urbanisation. Results show that urban forms tend to be similar for cities within the same
hierarchy, but they are signiﬁcantly distinct for cities in diﬀerent hierarchies, i.e. diﬀerent
development stages, industrial structures, and distributions of functional areas.

Finally, these ﬁndings have potentially practical applications on nation-wide understand-
ing of characteristics of urban forms, the development of city systems, and the distributions
of diﬀerent functional regions inside cities. Especially, city development and level of
urbanisation are unbalanced in China. The issues of urban forms, the distributions inside
cities and their factors are complex and aﬀected mutually. The two-level methodology
enables the integration of diﬀerent spatial scale considerations and provides a solution for
addressing these complex and interactively aﬀected problems. The spatial morphology
analysis of the redeﬁned cities also reveals the characteristics of urbanisation at the spatial
dimension of diﬀerent Chinese cities. For the cities at diﬀerent development stages, the
conditions, opportunities and challenges of the urbanisation are varied and diverse, but
they tend to be similar for the cities at the identical urbanisation stages.

5.3. Limitations and future work

There are still some limitations in this research. In this research, there is an assumption
that a higher city-level spatial morphology indicator reveals the more fractal,
less
compact and more diverse distributed form of central urban region due to more
determined district functions, and that a higher block-level indicator indicates a more
clustered and compact spatial structure and distribution of blocks with identical func-
tions. This assumption is based on the fact that most of cities have been fast developing
in China. However, in diﬀerent cities, especially the central regions, both dispersed and

clustered urban forms have their advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, future
studies might exam urban forms with the assumption that the whole or parts of a
certain nation are not at the fast-developing stage.

6. Conclusion

This research proposes the concept of redeﬁned city systems, featuring agglomerated urban
functions, to answer the question that whether urban forms are all identical in China. A POI
density-based data-driven method is utilised to redeﬁne cities to outline the natural central
urban regions. The redeﬁned cities are the places where population is dense, human activities
are abundant and active, and built environment and infrastructure conditions are relatively
complete. For the identiﬁed 2005 redeﬁned cities in China, urban forms are quantitatively
evaluated using two-level spatial morphology indicators at both city and block levels. As such,
the urban forms are not only evaluated by the urban developing conditions from the
perspective of the geometry of city boundaries, but also related to morphology of functional
regions inside cities. Diﬀerent spatial morphologies could be explained by the conditions of
topography, urban development, local history and culture, and city design strategies. To
understand the similarities and diﬀerences of urban forms, the redeﬁned cities are classiﬁed
into four hierarchies, the spatial morphology indicators are summarised to an integrated
morphology indicator, and the contribution of urbanisation on the urban forms is assessed.
Results show that the urban forms are similar within a hierarchy, but they are signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent among diﬀerent hierarchies, due to the various development stages, structures and
distributions of functional areas within cities, and the levels of urbanisation. In the study, the
optimisation levels of functional areas within cities are assessed with the spatial morphology
of redeﬁned cities. The integrated morphology reveals the characteristics of functional areas
distributions of a city, where a higher city-level morphology indicates more comprehensive
functional areas with diversiﬁed industrial structure, and a higher block-level morphology
reveals more concentrated region for a certain industry or function. Results show that the
North-eastern and Northern China have a higher city-level morphology than south-western
regions, southern areas have a higher block-level morphology than northern parts, and the
capital, provincial capitals and cities with high level of urbanisation usually have relatively high
integrated spatial morphology. For the redeﬁned cities, spatial dimensional indicators of
urbanisation could explain 41% of the spatial morphology of cities, where with the increase
of city size, distributions of functional areas within urban central regions tend to be more
optimised. Among four hierarchies of cities, the city area is a key contributor to the spatial
morphology for actively developed and cities at an early development stage. The develop-
ment of cities with limited intra-urban spatial structure signiﬁcantly relies on surrounding fast
developing and developed cities. The development of cities with weak city-level spatial
morphology has weak relationship with urbanisation process.

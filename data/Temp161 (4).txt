Special section in honor of Andrew U. Frank

EDITORIAL

1. Introduction

Andrew Frank, who retired in September 2016 from the chair of geoinformation position
at the Vienna University of Technology that he had held for a quarter century, has had
anextraordinary inﬂuence on our ﬁeld. His curiosity and wide spanning intellectual
interests enriched the ﬁeld’s foundations and propelled it in many ways. To name just
one example, he conceived and shaped the Conference on Spatial Information Theory,
COSIT (Frank et al. 1992, Frank and Campari 1993, Frank and Kuhn 1995), inspired by the
success of the NATO Advanced Study Institute on Cognitive and Linguistic Aspects of
Geographic Space that David Mark and Andrew Frank convened in 1991 (Mark and Frank
1991). This special section of IJGIS in his honor provides a multidisciplinary reﬂection on
his career, including views from computer science, ontology, economics, law, cognitive
indicating the breadth of Andrew Frank’s interests and
science and linguistics,
contributions.

2. Areas of contributions

Andrew Frank’s research interests are exceptionally broad and his contributions to
our ﬁeld fall
into many distinct areas, ranging from spatial databases (including
access methods) and spatial data models through cognitive and linguistic aspects
to ontology and economics of geographic information. Moreover, he has
pioneered new research directions that subsequently became mainstream. While
we cannot do justice to the breadth and depth of his work in a special section,
much less in the editorial for it, we attempt to highlight the main areas in the
following paragraphs, giving more weight to his earlier work, as it may be less
familiar today.

During his doctoral studies, Andrew Frank already had a paper on Database
land information) systems (Frank
Management Systems (DBMS) for cadastral (a.k.a.
1981) application accepted at the Conference on Very Large Data Bases, as well as a
paper on spatial query languages (Frank 1982) at the ACM Computer Graphics
Conference (SIGGRAPH). During that period, Frank was the intellectual primus inter
pares in the research group of the late Rudolf Conzett, a visionary who shaped the
scientiﬁc style and rigor of his students and had major
impact on Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) research and development in Europe and beyond. He
entrusted Andrew Frank with the research design and with the prototypical implemen-
tation of a radically new information system architecture for parcel-based geographic
data. With the help of his team colleagues, Andrew Frank designed and implemented a
network DBMS to handle cadastral data and support legal, administrative, and planning
processes based on them. This database system (Pascal Network Database) came with

higher-level graph-based data models (one of the ﬁrst formalizations of graph models
for spatial data and their semantics), a graphical query language (MapQuery) and a
sketch-based construction language (Human Interface to Least Squares), as well as an
access method (FieldTree). Many of these innovative developments inﬂuenced other
research groups and key industries worldwide. Frank ended up playing no small role in
making spatial data models (and object-oriented design) widely acknowledged specia-
lizations of non-standard database systems. He continued to push for research on spatial
for Geographic
databases in the successful bid for NCGIA (the National Center
Information and Analysis) a few years later and, together with Terry Smith,
led an
NCGIA Research Initiative on the Architecture of Very Large Spatial Databases.
Although not formally a co-editor of the proceedings of the ﬁrst Symposium on Large
Spatial Databases, he was the mastermind behind the creation of that conference series.
A driver of Andrew Frank’s early research agenda was his recognition that GIS require
alternative models to those based on standard coordinate geometry, emphasizing, for
example, the need for explicit topology. His seminal paper on cell complexes became a
critical precursor of the early standards on simple features in OGC and ISO.

Through a series of advanced research meetings and projects at the end of the
1980s and into the early 1990s, Andrew Frank expanded the scope of his research
(and that of many colleagues) from spatial to spatio-temporal data modeling. With
this expansion, he then became interested in the broader ontological questions
underlying GIS: what sorts of things and events in the world do the spatial and
temporal data represent?

On the geometry side, as a complement to the formalization of binary topolo-
gical relations, Andrew Frank saw that a formalization of cardinal direction relations
could play an important role in spatial query languages and spatial reasoning. The
development of the calculi for point-to-point directions that follow a half-plane or a
cone model brought together a series of his skills. The concise speciﬁcation in an
algebraic form in combination with a prototype implementation that demonstrated
that speciﬁcations were correct and enabled immediate automated inferences
blended themes from Artiﬁcial Intelligence and software engineering to address a
fundamental spatial problem. The integration of qualitative distances into the
direction speciﬁcations established both more interesting and complex inferences,
but also highlighted the diﬀerence in reasoning when a single spatial concept is
employed vs. multiple spatial concepts in concert.

Andrew Frank’s interest in diﬀerent kinds of errors, their causes, and how to live with
errors has its roots in the measurement sciences, error propagation, and adjustment
computations. Under the umbrella of indeterminate boundaries, Andrew Frank inte-
grated also his interests in economic aspects with the topic of spatial uncertainty
modeling. His interest in databases and query languages naturally evolved into a
focus on cognitive aspects of space and spatial information.

on land administration and cadastral systems,
in particular the Austrian cadaster,
has been inspired by an original interest in data quality. His interest is in the formal
instruments of a cadastral system but behind may be the search for accurate
land rights, restrictions, and responsibilities. Accordingly, his

review of Frank’s work in this area focuses on Frank’s approach by algebraic
modeling that was not only fundamental, but also inspiring for many, since it
allowed a formal and testable speciﬁcation.

The second paper, ‘Formal representation of qualitative direction’, is written by Jasper
van de Veen, Christian Freksa, and Diedrich Wolter. Freksa and Frank are connected by a
common interest in formal spatial reasoning methods, in particular on directions, where
both have published landmark research on complementary topics – Freksa on temporal
reasoning as well as relative directions (Freksa 1992a, 1992b), and Frank on cardinal
directions (Frank 1996). They have then collaborated in the International Quality
Network on Spatial Cognition and introduced generations of researchers in artiﬁcial
intelligence to cognitively motivated formal thinking about qualitative spatial relation-
ships and reasoning. The paper proposes a taxonomy of spatial direction representations
from diﬀerent research strands in the ﬁeld.

The third paper,

‘The world, the computer, and the mind: how Andrew Frank
helped make human language and cognition cornerstones of geographic information
science’, is written by Daniel Montello and David Mark. Montello is a psychologist
working in a geography department and interested in behavioral and cognitive
geography (e.g. Montello 1993, Lovelace et al. 1999). Mark is a human geographer
with roots in physical geography and a strong interest in language and ontology
(e.g. Mark and Frank 1991, Egenhofer and Mark 1995, Smith and Mark 2001). Two
NCGIA research initiatives were led jointly by David Mark and Andrew Frank: one on
user interfaces (Mark 1995), and the other one on languages of spatial relations (Mark
and Frank 1992). This collaboration also led to the Las Navas workshops cited above,
which have recently been revisited (Frank et al. 2013). The paper in this section, by
Montello and Mark, looks at Frank’s fundamental contributions to a cognitive geo-
graphic information science.

Abstract. Systems for landscape visualization and geographical data handling
require methods for e(cid:141) cient data access. Retrieval of data from large geographical
databases, ten to thousands of Gbytes, is usually optimized with spatial indexing
mechanisms. The simplest form of spatial indexing is achieved by dividing the
database into congruent grid cells. The subsequent subdivision of the grid cells
can be based on so-called quadtrees. Quadtrees for two-dimensional division and
subdivision are appropriate for cartographical data. A geographical database,
with objects stored in geocentric or geodetic (geographical ) co-ordinates, requires
indexing mechanisms that take into account the shape of the Earth. In this paper,
we present a method for indexing of geographical data, named Ellipsoidal
Quadtrees (EQT). In contrast to other global indexing methods, EQT is based
on the Earth ellipsoid and not a spherical approximation. EQT division and
subdivision make it possible to divide the Earth surface into a mesh of quadrangles
with equal areas. We will demonstrate that EQT is (cid:143) exible. It can be used for
indexing databases of various sizes, including national and global databases. Tests
on real data show that the performance of EQT is good.

Introduction
Systems for three-dimensional geographical visualization are based on either
stereographic or perspective visualization techniques. Many visualization systems
present geographical data very much like traditional maps, but computers can do
much more. So, why is the world still (cid:143) at in computers? The surface of the terrain
is often presented in three-dimensional visualization systems, but normally the curva-
ture of the earth is not considered. The curvature of the Earth gives rise to elevation
diŒerences of 8 cm over 1 km and 8 m over 10 km. The elevation diŒerence increases
with the square of the distance, depending on the Gaussian radius of curvature, i.e.
the curvature at each latitude and longitude. In scenes with dimensions smaller than
a few tens of kilometres, the eŒect of the curvature is hardly recognizable.

In general, geographical databases contain large complex data sets. For visualiza-
tion, data can be structured in an arbitrary way. To obtain fast access to geographical
data and to be able to vary level of detail, geographical area, and data set, a proper
database structure has to be implemented. Simultaneous handling of (cid:142) ne and coarse

data and the curvature of the Earth requires an adaptive database structure that
handles geocentric data. Such an adaptive database structure can only be imple-
mented using spatial or geographical indexing.

A number of methods for spatial data indexing has been reported in the literature.
Some methods are based on dividing data into equal-sized grid cells (raster), while
others use adaptive sized cells (quadtree subdivision) . Quadtrees, introduced by
Klinger and Dyer (1976) and further developed by Samet (1984), can be explained
as a tree-like representation of data that forks into four nodes for each level. The
nodes of the tree represent spatial indices, see (cid:142) gure 1(a), such that an index area is
recursively subdivided into smaller quadrants. Each node represents an index cell
where data or pointers to data are stored. Within an index cell, data are usually
stored sequentially. The e(cid:141) ciency of data retrieval using spatial indices depends on
the number of nodes in the tree and the area size of the quadrant. The area of the
quadrants should be large enough to keep the number of indices small; so small that
sequential search remains e(cid:141) cient. A three-dimensional extension of quadtrees is
called octrees; see (cid:142) gure 1(b). Here, the quadrant is replaced by an octant. This
technique is useful for three-dimensional geographical data for mining, earth and
space science and oil drilling.

A number of methods for indexing and addressing the whole or parts of the
surface of the earth (global indexing) has been suggested. These approaches originate
from map projections techniques, polyhedral tessellation, and adaptive subdivision:

1. In the map projection approach, the indices are de(cid:142) ned using a projection as
the base for the quadtree construction. The Lambert cylindrical equal-area
projection (Tobler and Chen 1989) is based on a regular hierarchical data
structure, with direct relation to latitude and longitude. It has an equal-area
subdivision. The UTM subdivision of the Earth (Mark and Lauzon 1985) is
performed by dividing the UTM-zones or sub-zones into a regular grid of
patches. Each patch can be indexed with quadtree techniques.

2 Polyhedral tessellation has its origin from representing the sphere with a
tetrahedron, a hexahedron, an octahedron, a dodecahedron or an icosahedron;
see (cid:142) gure 2. Quaternary Triangular Mesh (QTM) is a mesh covering the Earth.
It originates from an octahedron (Dutton 1996). Each of the eight triangular
facets is subdivided by connecting the midpoints of its sides, yielding four
triangles (Dutton 1990). The indexing of the triangles is carried out with
Spherical Quadtree (SQT). The hierarchical tessellation of the triangular facets
goes on into smaller and smaller regular facets until suitable sizes are obtained.
Otoo and Zhu (1993) developed a method called Semi-Quadcode (SQC). SQC
provides a labelling method for the triangular patches, which is regarded to

oŒer a more e(cid:141) cient operation and indexing on a spherical surface than SQT
and QTM. Wickman et al. (1974) developed a method based on a dodecahed-
ron. Their method divides each pentagon into (cid:142) ve triangles. Each of these
triangles is further subdivided into four sub-triangles. The icosahedron model
suggested by Fekete (1990a, b) is based on triangles projected on the sphere.
Subdivision and indexing can be carried in a similar way as for SQT.

3. Adaptive subdivision systems tessellate the surface of the Earth based on some
property. The mesh can for instance be a Dirichlet network on the spheroid
(Lukatela 1987).

The UTM subdivision model (Mark and Lauzon 1985) considers the ellipsoidal
shape of the Earth. Unfortunately, the model is not suitable for e(cid:141) cient indexing.
The indexing method presented in this paper has the Earth ellipsoid as a geometric
base. The index cells are constructed in such a way that they have equal areas at a
certain level in the quadtree. The index mesh created on this level is called the base
level. Subsequent subdivisions can be created having equal areas at each level. Under
the criterion of equal area, each index cell will contain approximatel y the same
amount of geographical data, which will improve the implementation of an e(cid:141) cient
and stable indexing mechanism. The size of the base-level index cells can be chosen
arbitrarily. The paper will describe the fundamental mathematics of the approach
and explain the details of the indexing mechanism. The mechanism can be used for
both indexing databases and addressing data in the visualization process. Many
authors discuss the equal-area criterion; Goodchild and Shiren (1992) project the
Earth onto an octohedron in order to get equilateral cells.

2. Earth ellipsoid and geodetic co-ordinate s

Geodetic co-ordinates are de(cid:142) ned by longitude, l, latitude, Q, and ellipsoidal
height, h (Ussisoo 1977). The longitude of a point is the angle between the meridian
plane containing the x-axis and the meridian plane through the point. The latitude
of a point is the angle between a line perpendicular to the surface of the ellipsoid at
the given point and the plane of the equator (Snyder 1987); see (cid:142) gure 3.

The ellipsoid in (cid:142) gure 3 is de(cid:142) ned by the semi-major axis, a, and the semi-minor

axis, b. Instead of b it is common to use the (cid:142) rst eccentricity squared

mechanisms that can be derived from this division are discussed.

3.1. Ellipsoidal quadtree division

The surface of the ellipsoid can be divided into a mesh of quadrangular facets.
The surface of a facet can be de(cid:142) ned as the surface that spans between four vectors
normal to the ellipsoid; see (cid:142) gure 4(a). The sides of each facet are parallel to the
meridians (north/south) and the parallels (east/west); see (cid:142) gure 4(b).

The facets can be used as a basis for indexing and addressing geographi c data.
A possible base-level scheme is shown in (cid:142) gure 4(b). The indexing mechanism has
been named Ellipsoidal Quadtree (EQT). EQT has a hierarchical structure similar
to ordinary quadtrees, compare (cid:142) gure 1(a). The surfaces subject to subdivision in
ordinary quadtrees are planar surfaces, while the facets used in the EQT follow the
curvature of the ellipsoid. These facets can be constructed in such a way that they
have equal areas on the same level in the quadtree. One of the advantage s with EQT
is that the Earth is treated as an ellipsoid. When calculating the area of surfaces on
the ellipsoid these areas correspond to the actual area on the Earth. The surface
area of each quadrangle can be evaluated exactly.

An area on the ellipsoid can be written as dS 5 MN cos Q dQ dl. By integrating
with respect to Q and l, and by using (4) and (5) the area of a facet, S, can be
obtained (Ekman 1991)

3.2. EQT division using constant

In this case, the Earth’s surface is divided into bands of facets parallel to the
parallels. The corners of adjacent facets in adjacent bands do not necessarily coincide
(see (cid:142) gure 5). Facets in a band around the earth are congruent. Facets in adjacent
bands are similar, but not congruent. The number of facets in a band and the number
of bands in the north/south direction are not necessarily integer values.

Computation of the index key requires several parameters: the parameters describ-

ing the ellipsoid, the latitude diŒerence, Dl, and the area of each facet, Sf.

The index key, k, can be expressed as

3.3. EQT division using constant Dl

In this case, the Earth’s surface is divided into bands of facets parallel to the
meridians as well as to the parallels. The bands in the north/south direction have
the shape of slices because of the shape of the Earth. The facets are arranged in a
regular pattern. The corners of adjacent facets in adjacent bands coincide (see
(cid:142) gure 6). Facets in a band around the Earth are congruent. Facets in adjacent bands
are similar, but not congruent. The number of facets in a band and the number of
bands in the north/south direction are not necessarily integer values.

The shape of the facets can be chosen arbitrarily. Preferably, Dl and DQ should

have the same dimensions, in metres, at a principal latitude. At the latitude of central
Sweden, for example, one degree in longitude has approximately the same length, in
metres, as one half degree in latitude. We use equations (13 ) and (14 ) to obtain
suitable values for Dl.

Computation of the index key requires several parameters: the parameters describ-
ing the ellipsoid, the longitude diŒerence, Dl, the principal latitude, Qp, the area of
each facet, Sf, and the total area of a slice, S. S is estimated from equation (10),

3.4. Ellipsoidal quadtree subdivision

EQT subdivision can be achieved in two ways. Adaptive subdivision can be
applied to database s where data are unevenly distributed in space, i.e. databases
where the number of objects per unit area can vary signi(cid:142) cantly between regions. A
simple example—the number of road objects per unit area diŒers much between
urban and rural areas. In the adaptive subdivision case quadrangles with high data
density are subdivided further, while quadrangle s with low data density are not
subdivided. Only the terminal nodes in the tree contain data. Non-adaptive sub-
division can be applied to, for example, databases speci(cid:142) cally constructed for visual-
ization, where each level of the tree is used to store one level of detail. This subdivision
is carried out for all quadrangles. It is possible for any node in the tree to contain data.
In both cases, EQT subdivision can be carried out using quadtree decomposition.

P. Ottoson and H. Hauska

Equations (11) or (15) can be used to compute base-level indices. Indices of the
subdivisions can be retrieved by searching the quadtree. Alternatively, indices can
be computed for all subdivisions. The same function to compute the indices is used
to retrieve data. This is practical in the non-adaptive case because all nodes at any
level are decomposed. Thus, the structure becomes (cid:142) xed and predictable, which
makes it possible to use prede(cid:142) ned ranges of indices. Subdivision of the quadrangle s
into four equally large parts is a prerequisite for quadtree decomposition.

The most obvious way to subdivide the quadrangles into four equally large parts
is to divide DQ and Dl by 2. When DQ is kept constant the width of quadrangle, Dl,
varies from band to band. This implies that it is impossible to (cid:142) nd a regular
subdivision where each sub-quadrangl e has an area of one quarter of the original
quadrangle and where the sub-bands follow the original structure. When Dl is kept
constant the quadrangles can easily be subdivided into four equally large parts (see
(cid:142) gure 7(b)). If necessary, it is possible to achieve a subdivision with constant if the
quadrangles are subdivided as in (cid:142) gure 7(a). This complicates the situation because
two separate index mechanisms have to be implemented, one for the base level and
one for each lower level. We have shown that the method based on constant Dl is
preferable, and therefore we will only present the calculation of the indices for
this case.

The index key, k, used for multiple quadtree levels, can now be expressed as

k 5

int(l/(Dl/a))1

int(S/(Sf/b)) ´ql ´a1

ktotali

(16)

where a 5 2level, b 5 4level, level 5 1, 2, ..., n and ktotali
is the number of possible indices
at level i. The base level in the quadtree has level 5 0. The parameters of equation
(16 ) are computed in the same manner as for equation (15).

3.5. Recursive computation of the dimension of the quadrangles

In the previous sections, we have discussed how to calculate the index keys from
a known position. It is necessary to be able to compute the position from a known
index key as well. This is important because minimum and maximum co-ordinates
of the quadrangles are needed for both the construction and the search of the tree.
In equations (15 ) or (16 ) the longitude can be explicitly solved, but the latitudes, Qn
(minimum) and Qn+1 (maximum), can only be solved implicitly using equation (10).
Using Newton-Raphson’s method, Qn+1 and Qn can be computed iteratively. The
f (Qn) in Newton-Raphson’s method should approach zero. The

numerator, here,

area of a slice from the South Pole to Qn can be computed in two diŒerent ways:
(a) by setting Q1 in equation (10) to Õ p/2 and Q2 to Qn, and (b) using the inverse of
equation (15) and the index keys. The function f (Qn ) can express the diŒerence
between the two values for the area of a slice. This can be expressed by the following

A performance test was also carried out. A test database was created, which

three-dimensional points. The database contains approximately 145 000 links, 130 000
nodes, and 2.8 millions points.

only used to enhance the visibility of the EQT division.

EQT was implemented using C and OpenGL. The quadrangles cannot be
visualized as ellipsoidal quadrangles because common graphic APIs (Application

Programming Interface), like OpenGL, only support coplanar surfaces. If necessary,
the ellipsoidal shape of the quadrangles can be approximate d using NURBS (Non-
Uniform Rational B-splines), but this is very time consuming and not practical. The
quadrangles can be rendered seamlessly all around the Earth because neighbouring
quadrangles share common corners.

In (cid:142) gure 8(a), the quadrangle s are approximately squared at the principal latitude
62ß N using equation (14 ). Choosing principal latitude in the centre of a country
can be practical for national databases. From experience, we know that the number
of objects per index cell may vary from a few hundred to a few thousand objects,
depending on the capacity of the computer and the DBMS (Database Management
System). In the implementation phase, a benchmark test has to be carried out to
estimate this range. In the example shown in (cid:142) gure 8(a), the area of each quadrangle
is very large, about 1900 km2. Allowing some hundred to some thousand objects per
index means that, for example in the Swedish economic map database (printed scale
1:10 000), the area of a quadrangle should not exceed a few square kilometres.

E(cid:141) cient visualization requires optimized retrieval of data, which can be achieved
by using either multiple levels of detail, LOD, or data reduction. In this particular
implementation, the quadtree decomposition is performed to support multiple levels
of detail. This means that all nodes in the quadtree hold data, not only the terminal
ones. The LOD mechanism is implemented such that we obtain higher resolution
around a midpoint (nadir point; see (cid:142) gure 8(b)). The resolution is reduced stepwise
from the nadir point. The base-level division shown in (cid:142) gure 8(a) is further subdivided
using quadtree decomposition.

4.2. EQT division of a national road database

The test database was constructed using the relational database management
system MySQL (MySQL 2001). Both the client and the server run on a SGI Onyx
with two 195 MHz processors. The EQT mechanism was implemented using C and
the C API for MySQL.

The principal latitude is set to 62ß N, which corresponds to the centre of the
database area and Sweden as well. The database that indexes the road objects is

divided into 1128 index cells (see (cid:142) gure 9(a)). The retrieval of objects is performed
using tree-search, in order to test a more (cid:143) exible solution instead of using equations
(15 ) and (16). In the quadtree, only the terminal nodes hold data.

Normally, a quadtree is built in a top-down order, but here the base-level division
is created (cid:142) rst. The lower levels to the root of the tree are created thereafter. For
this particular implementation, the EQT was used to subdivide areas with many
objects. Index cells with more than 500 objects were divided into four new cells. It
was necessary to make three consecutive subdivisions of the base-level division (see
(cid:142) gure 9(b)). For each new level in the quadtree, the numbers of subdivided index
cells were 108, 35, and 6, respectively. Figures 9(b) and (c) show that the subdivided
cells correspond to densely populated areas (marked on the map).

A test was carried out to estimate approximate retrieval times. Two test areas
were chosen close to Falun, one with many road objects and one with fewer (called
A and B). The areas have the same size (25 km3 25 km). The number of objects is
287 and 1127, respectively (see (cid:142) gure 10). The test was carried out for the base level
and for one subdivision level. The test areas were covered by a combination of larger
and smaller index cells.

The results show that 287 objects can be retrieved in 7 seconds and 1127 objects
in 13 seconds if no subdivision is carried out (see table 1). When applying subdivision
the performances are 6 and 9 seconds, respectively. The performance depends mainly
on the number of objects and points to be retrieved, but also on the number of index
cells. For each index cell, a sequential search is performed to decide if the objects
are inside the search area or not, because the index cells can contain data outside
the search area. For test area B, 3143 objects were retrieved without subdivision.
After subdivision, 1540 objects were retrieved. This means that 2000 respectively 400
objects were discarded in each case. Subdivision of index cells results in fewer accesses

5. Discussion and conclusion

In this paper, we have introduced a decomposition technique named Ellipsoidal
Quadtrees (EQT), which can be used as an indexing mechanism for three-dimensional
geographical data. EQT is similar to ordinary quadtrees but, instead of a plane, an
ellipsoid is used as the geometric base. This geometric representation allows us to
let the index cells be based on ellipsoidal quadrangles. Thereby, data represented
with geocentric or geographical co-ordinates can be indexed.

Modern geographical databases are normally seamless, i.e. any traditional divi-
sion into map sheets has been eliminated. Using EQT or other global indexing
methods implies that geographical boundaries do not exist in a database, implicating
that the database is seamless as well as borderless. A borderless database is seamless
in the sense that, when approaching what should be the end of data, it is automaticall y
connected to the beginning.

Of all global indexing methods, QTM and its variants are most common in the

literature. QTM is a powerful method, but our proposed EQT has some nice
properties:

1. The base-level EQT facets can be of arbitrary size, depending on the speci(cid:142) cs
of the database. In QTM, every level is deduced from the base level of the
basic octahedron. This implies that the facets of each level always have the
same sizes.

2. EQT results in a quadrangula r regular subdivision. QTM on the other hand
gives rise to a subdivision consisting of congruent triangles. Generally, quad-
rangular subdivisions are easier to manage in computers than other geometric
shapes. Nobody would imagine making a two-dimensional tessellation from
triangles. A weakness of EQT is that the quadrangles approach triangles close
to the poles.

3. EQT incorporates the curvature of the Earth in the construction of the
quadrangles. The quadrangles follow the surface of the Earth, which means
that the area of surfaces on the ellipsoid is equal to the actual area on the
Earth. Explicitly, the area size of the ellipsoidal quadrangles can be set equal.
Dutton (1996a) points out one unpleasant eŒect of QTM, namely that a
triangle projected onto the spherical surface of the Earth will not have the
same size as before. The largest diŒerence is up to 28%. The diŒerence is even
greater if the true shape of the Earth would have been considered. This implies
that QTM can not ful(cid:142) l the criterion of equal areas.

4. Because EQT is based on the quadtree technique, a LOD mechanism can be
integrated and coupled to the indexing mechanism. Data of a speci(cid:142) c resolution
can be associated to a level in the EQT.

We have shown that EQT can be used as an indexing tool for a national road
database containing 2.8 millions points. The performance is good and we can expect
reduced access times with faster computers. Potential retrieval times with a high-
end PC, for retrieving road data over an area of 25 km3 25 km (about 1000 objects),
would be less than one second. We have also shown that subdivision is important
in order to decrease retrieval times.

Ottoson (1999a,b) fuses land-use data and elevation data into a terrain model,
simultaneously reducing data. Up to now, EQT indexing has only been applied to
land classi(cid:142) cation and road data. In the near future it will be interesting to study
the performance of EQT and its potential for fusing data, when applied to larger
geographic databases containing, for example, roads, buildings, hydrography, land-
use data, and elevation data.

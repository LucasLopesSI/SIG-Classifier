Reducing  domestic  abuse  has  become  a  priority  for  both 

local and national governments in the UK, with its substan‐

tial human, social, and economic costs. It is an interdiscipli‐

nary  issue,  but  to  date  there  has  been  no  research  in  the 

UK  that  has  focused  on  neighborhood‐level  predictors  of 

domestic abuse and their variation across space. This article 

uses geographically weighted regression to model the pre‐

dictors of police‐reported domestic abuse in Essex. Readily 

available  structural  and  cultural  variables  were  found  to 

predict  the  domestic  abuse  rate  and  the  repeat  victimiza‐

tion rate at the lower super output area level and the model 

coefficients were all found to be non‐stationary, indicating 

varying  relationships  across  space.  This  research  not  only 

has important implications for victims' well being, but also 

enables policy makers to gain a better understanding of the 

geography  of  victimization,  allowing  targeted  policy  inter‐

ventions and efficiently allocated resources.

The human and economic cost of domestic abuse is extensive. In the UK, two women a week die as a result of their 

abuse and the cost to society is estimated to be around £15.7 billion per year (Walby, 2009). Having the ability 

to identify those at higher risk of victimization and being able to target resources and services to the appropriate 

areas is fundamental for reducing its impact.

The definition of domestic abuse used in this research is the one used by the Home Office since April 2013. 

This recently revised definition recognizes that abuse does not always involve physical violence and that abuse 

can occur in relationships under the age of 18. The definition is used by all police forces in England and Wales.

Any incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour, violence or 

abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members 

regardless of gender or sexuality. This can encompass but is not limited to the following types of 

abuse: psychological, physical, sexual, financial and emotional. (Home Office, 2013)

To date, the focus of research in the UK has been on individual‐level risk factors of abuse, where variables such as age, 

gender, ethnicity, and repeat victimization have been considered. There have been substantially fewer studies that 

have considered the geographic variation of abuse and predictors at the neighborhood level. A recent systemic review 

of neighborhood studies of interpersonal violence found most research was carried out in urban areas in the U.S., with 

no research from the UK (Beyer, Wallis, & Hamberger, 2015) and the only study from Europe focused on Spain (Gracia, 

López‐Quílez, Marco, Lladosa, & Lila, 2014). This article starts to address this deficit in the literature, by predicting the 

rate of domestic abuse at the neighborhood level and the variation in the relationship between predictors over space. 

Having this knowledge not only has academic benefits, but in a time of austerity the police and other agencies need 

more than ever to understand the geographical demand for their services, the varying needs of the population, and 

the interventions that will have the most impact in reducing the harm of domestic abuse.

1.1 | Neighborhood‐level theory

Over the last 20 years the use of GIS to explore the spatial patterns of crime has expanded dramtically, both in 

academic research and by researchers working for the police and other agencies (Boba Santos, 2013; Bottoms, 

2007; Chainey & Ratcliffe, 2005; Chainey & Tompson, 2008; Hirschfield & Bowers, 2003; Johnson, 2017; Newton 

& Felson, 2015; Weir & Bangs, 2007; Weisburd, 2015).

As might be expected, crime is not distributed randomly across neighborhoods (Bottoms, 2007; Brantingham & 

Brantingham, 1981; Brunton‐Smith, Sutherland, & Jackson, 2013; Sampson, 2012; Shaw & McKay, 1942; Sherman, 

Gartin, & Buerger, 1989). As with crime more generally, the Crime Survey in England and Wales (CSEW) [formerly 

the British Crime Survey (BCS)] suggests that the distribution of abuse victims is not even, with those living in the 

most deprived 20% of areas more likely to be victims of domestic abuse than those in the least deprived areas 

(11.1% of women and 4.8% of men compared to 5.6% of women and 3.0% of men, respectively) (Flatley, 2016).

Of the studies conducted at the neighborhood level, the majority have used social disorganization theory to 

explore the sociological influences of domestic abuse (Ackerson & Subramanian, 2008; Browning, 2002; Cunradi, 

2007; Dekeseredy, Schwartz, Alvi, & Tomaszewski, 2003; Frye et al., 2008; Koenig, Ahmed, Hossain, & Khorshed 

Alam Mozumder, 2003; Raghavan, Mennerich, Sexton, & James, 2006). Social disorganization theory, originally 

coined by Shaw and McKay (1942), studies the relationship between crime and neighborhood structural and cul‐

tural factors. Crime was found to increase in an area when there was a lack of social cohesion, with three key vari‐

ables—population exodus, ethnic heterogeneity, and low economic status—found to be the strongest predictors 

(Shaw & McKay, 1942).

A major criticism of Shaw and McKay's theory was the lack of testing of the measures they theorized (Sampson 

& Groves, 1989), and it was probable that this was a factor in the decline in support for the theory over the next 

30 years. One of the first academics to openly criticize the lack of clear discussion on the causal mechanisms of the 

theory was Ruth Kornhauser in her book Social Sources of Deliquency (Bursik Jr., 1988; Kornhauser, 1978).

Central to Kornhauser's research was the notion of informal social control. It was theorized that disorganiza‐

tion resulted in a lack of trust and cohesion in a neighborhood, which reduced the ability for informal control to 

be exercised over disorderly youths and criminal behavior, resulting in a higher rate of crime (Kornhauser, 1978; 

WEIR    |  3

Wilcox, Cullen, & Feldmeyer, 2017). It was through Kornhauser's work that an interest in neighborhood's influence 

on rates of crime was reignited. Her work inspired a number of scholars to attempt to revive social disorganization 

theory under the new branding of the “systemic model” (Bursik Jr. & Grasmick, 1993; Hunter, 1985; Sampson & 

Groves, 1989).

Using the systemic model, Sampson and Groves (1989) were the first to test the causal mechanisms between 

structural characteristics and crime that had been set out in social disorganization theory. They found that the 

theory successfully predicted self‐reported crime, using data from the BCS (Andresen, 2010; Sampson & Groves, 

1989). The research also expanded Shaw and McKay's model, finding that communities that had sparse friendship 

networks, unsupervised teenage groups, and low participation in organizations had disproportionately high levels 

of crime, which they believed mediated the effects of neighborhood‐level structural characteristics (Sampson & 

Groves, 1989). The systemic model took a fundamental shift away from those perpetrating the crime to the posi‐

tive influence of good people in the community (Wilcox et al., 2017).

Social disorganization theory was first conceived for crimes that take place in public spaces, such as burglary 

and  robbery.  Concern  was  expressed  that  the  theory  would  not  convert  to  domestic  abuse  as  its  private  na‐

ture means it may be difficult for a community to recognize violence between partners as deviant and intervene 

(Browning, 2002). However, others have suggested that factors such as higher levels of disadvantage could impact 

levels of abuse as they may intensify stress between partners (Ross & Mirowsky, 2009) and increase the likelihood 

of violence (Pinchevsky & Wright, 2012; Wright & Benson, 2011). Variation in neighborhood‐level domestic abuse 

has been attributed to between‐neighborhood differences in cultures of violence, access to services, neighbor‐

hood environment, quality of housing, and social isolation (Beyer et al., 2015).

There is conflicting historic research on the influence of population density on levels of crime within a com‐

munity. Shaw and McKay (1942) hypothesized that urban areas were less likely to have social control compared 

to rural and suburban areas, and therefore weaker social ties and friendship networks, resulting in lower levels of 

participation in local activities (Fischer, 1982) and community attachment (Tönnies, 1887; Wirth, 1938). This, in 

turn, is argued to have a significant effect on the ability of the community to control young people, which leads 

to crime and anti‐social behavior (ASB) (Sampson & Groves, 1989). Other studies have found little support for the 

influence of population density, but rather argue that length of residency in an area is a far more appropriate mea‐

sure (Kasarda & Janowitz, 1974). There has been little research on the influence of population density specifically 

on domestic abuse; the CSEW found little difference between the numbers experiencing abuse in urban and rural 

areas (Flatley, 2016), whereas another study from the U.S. found the prevalence was higher in rural areas (Peek‐

Asa et al., 2011). Population density could influence the amout of abuse that is reported, with those having close 

neighbors less likely to be able to keep their abuse hidden, compared to those living in more sparsely populated 

rural areas. The influence of population density on the amount of abuse in an area is therefore something that 

should be explored further and modeled.

Previous research has focused on relationships between variables at the macro level using traditional regres‐

sion methods including logistic and multivariate regression (Benson, Fox, DeMaris, & van Wyk, 2003; Lauritsen 

& Schaum, 2004; Raghavan et al., 2006; Reed et al., 2009; Stueve & O'Donnell, 2008; van Wyk, Benson, Fox, & 

DeMaris, 2003; Waller et al., 2011). What has been absent is a methodology that accounts for the variation in 

the strength of coefficients across the area. Tobler's first law of geography states that “everything is related to 

everything else, but near things are more related than distant things” (Tobler, 1970, p. 234). Sampson, Morenoff, 

and Gannon‐Rowley (2002) echo this sentiment with a call for new analytical techniques that display the connec‐

tion between social and spatial processes, a method that factors in the premise that social behavior is influenced 

not  only  by  what  happens  in  the  immediate  neighborhood,  but  also  in  the  surrounding  areas.  Understanding 

how relationships vary across space has clear policy implications, with the possibility of a far more targeted and 

appropriate response at the local level, rather than a blanket response for a whole jurisdiction. Geographically 

weighted regression (GWR) offers a methodology in which to explore this variation, and this is the approach taken 

in the present research. GWR has been used to explore a wide range of phenomena, ranging from mosquitos (Ge 

WEIR4  |    

et al., 2016; Lin & Wen, 2011) to obesity (Chalkias et al., 2013; Wen, Chen, & Tsai, 2010), participation in higher 

education (Harris, Singleton, Grose, Brunsdon, & Longley, 2010), and school attainment (Fotheringham, Charlton, 

& Brunsdon, 2001). There have only been a small number of studies where GWR has been used to understand 

crime. When used as a method to study urban violence in Oregon, it was found that the coefficient values for sin‐

gle explanatory variables varied locally, with both positive and negative values (Cahill & Mulligan, 2007). Patterns 

of spatial heterogeneity and non‐stationarity were also found in three studies of burglary, with GWR finding local 

variation in socio‐demographic and ecological explanatory variables (Chen et al., 2017; Malczewski & Poetz, 2005; 

Zhang & Song, 2014). For predicting the rate of theft, GWR improved the explanatory power of the model, using 

population density, road network, and distance to police stations as predictors (Yan, Shu, & Yuan, 2010). Finally, 

in a study of all crime in Korea, the pattern was primarily spatial and a mixed GWR model was found to have the 

best fit, with a combination of global and local predictors (Lee, Kang, & Kim, 2009). All of these studies found that 

using GWR improved the explanatory power of the model.

1.2 | Geographically weighted regression

In a standard regression model, it is assumed that the value of the coefficient is the same everywhere in the study 

area and that the relationship between variables is spatially homogenous. In reality this is not always the case, and 

attributes of spatial units closer together are often more similar than those which are further apart; this phenom‐

enon is known as spatial heterogeneity (Fotheringham, 2009). In an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression this 

causes problems because one of the assumptions made when using a global model is that the observations being 

used are independent. A measure of this is spatial autocorrelation, with positive spatial autocorrelation showing 

neighboring spatial units to have similar values. It is not only the variables that might exhibit spatial dependence, 

but also the model's residuals, which might result in inefficient estimates of parameters with the standard errors 

being too large (Charlton & Fotheringham, 2009). Whilst econometric models such as a spatial lag or spatial error 

model will overcome the issues of spatial dependence, they do not address spatial heterogeneity (Fotheringham, 

2009). Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton (2002) suggest that it is possible that much of the spatial autocor‐

relation found in the residuals of global models applied to spatial data is a result of trying to fit a global model to a 

process that is non‐stationary. GWR, in contrast, allows for spatially varying coefficients by producting estimates 

of the parameter at each data location, factoring in spatial heterogeneity.

In this article I employ structural and cultural variables, to see whether domestic abuse can be predicted at 

the neighborhood level. Using social disorganization theory as a framework, variables from the Index of Multiple 

Deprivation will be used to test ecomomic factors; variables from the Vulnerable Localities Index and the rate of 

ASB will test social cohesion; the proportion of the population that is from a Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic 

(BAME)  population  will  be  used  as  a  measure  of  ethnic  hetrogeniety;  and  population  density  will  be  used  as  a 

measure or rurality. The only measure that I am unable to test is population turnover, with census information only 

collected every 10 years. By using GWR, I am able to explore the geographical variation in the effects of these 

predictors and the implications these findings could have on the design of relevant and targeted early intervention 

policy.

2.1 | Data and study area

The data used in this analysis came from the Essex Police Protect domestic abuse database. This is a separate 

database recording only domestic abuse—both incidents of domestic abuse that were recorded but not classified 

as crimes and those that were converted to crimes. The dataset recorded details of the incident location, the date 

and time, details about the age, gender, ethnicity, and address of both the victim and the perpetrator, and the 

WEIR    |  5

relationship between the victim and the perpetrator. The data were acquired independently as part of a broader 

research project. This project required a data‐sharing protocol and ethnical approval. If replicating this work, the 

data could be requested aggregated to the lower super output area (LSOA) level.

The  dataset  recorded  three  addresses:  the  incident  location  and  the  address  of  both  the  victim  and  the 

perpetrator. In this analysis, the address where the incident took place has been used. Whilst the focus of this 

article is on the risk factors associated with victimization, so arguably the victim address should be used, the 

police force acknowledge that the victim and the perpetrator addresses are not as reliable as the incident loca‐

tion. Reliability issues include not having up‐to‐date address information for those involved in the incident and 

also the fields not being completed as regularly as for the incident location. Only 75% of incidents had usable 

victim address coordinates, compared to 96% of incident locations. Where both incident and victim coordinates 

were available, 81% were recorded at the same location. The period of this analysis was from November 2011 

to  December  2014,  which  was  the  time  from  which  a  new  database  was  introduced.  It  should  be  noted  that 

domestic abuse is thought to be one of the most under‐reported crimes. The CSEW estimates that only 21% of 

victims report their abuse to the police (Flatley, 2016). The data are therefore thought to estimate only around 

one‐fifth of all incidents.

Essex is a large single police force in the east of England, covering a population of 1.725 million. It is one of the 

largest non‐metropolitan forces in the UK. It has a mixture of rural, urban, and coastal areas, with concentrated 

deprivation but also some very affluent areas. In 2016 it had a total recorded crime rate of 66.0 per 1,000 popula‐

tion (compared to the England and Wales average of 71.9), and ranked 23rd out of the 43 police forces in England 

and Wales (Flatley, 2017).

Before the analysis was conducted, the address data was coded. There were two sources of geographic refer‐

ence in the data, the postcode or a police‐recorded grid reference. Every postcode was assigned a grid reference 

(based on the postcode centroid); if the field was missing, the police‐assigned grid reference was used and if this 

was blank, the address provided in the incident record was matched to a postcode and a grid reference. If the 

address information was insufficient, then the record was disregarded from this analysis. Where the police‐as‐

signed grid reference was used, location accuracy was checked by a random sample of 100 incidents. All of the 

incidents were plotted and manually checked against the address or location information given. The LSOA layer 

was overlaid and all the points that were checked had been recorded in the correct LSOA. There were 91,396 

records in total, of which 3.6% had no usable geographic reference or the address was outside the force, leaving 

88,135 records for this analysis.

A problem with neighborhood‐level analysis is defining the geographic areas that are to be analysed. One of 

the issues with aggregating data is the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), where changing the boundaries can 

alter  the  observed  patterns  and  relationships  (O'Sullivan  &  Unwin,  2003).  The  analysis  used  census  LSOAs,  as 

this is the lowest level of granularity available for the deprivation data. LSOAs are census geographies and have a 

population of around 1,500. Using administrative boundaries does have implications for research and policy, as it 

is unlikely that this is the way that residents will define their neighborhood (Sampson et al., 2002), but whilst using 

GWR does not solve the MAUP, it removes the issues of trying to model continuous spatial processes without 

acknowledging the connection between areas and making assumptions that the relationships between variables 

are non‐stationary by using global models (Fotheringham et al., 2002).

Two issues have been found in using crime rate data based on aggregating small counts of crime data. Firstly, 

as the precision of the crime rate depends on the size of the population in the area of aggegation, varying popula‐

tion sizes will violate the assumption that the error variance is homogenous. Secondly, when crime rates are small 

or zero, normally distributed errors cannot be assumed. In non‐spatial analysis, Poisson and negative bionomial 

models have been used to address these problems (Osgood, 2000). In this analysis the issue of varying population 

sizes has been addressed by using LSOAs, which have very similar population sizes. The second issue of small or 

low counts is not a problem for this model, as domestic abuse is a relatively prevalent crime and there were only 

four LSOAs with a crime count of under 10 (the lowest count value was 5).

WEIR6  |    

All of the spatial analysis was carried out in ArcGIS Desktop 10.3.1 and the spatial statistics calculated in the 

Spatial Analyst extension. Logarithmic transformations were also calculated in ArcGIS. The ArcGIS software pro‐

vides a user‐friendly environment in which to carry out the GWR analysis, but the interface does not offer all the 

functionality that can be found in open source software such as R. This research therefore not only explores the 

methodology in terms of its application in understanding domestic abuse, but also tests whether the functionality 

available in ArcGIS is suitable for understanding non‐stationarity in crime predictors at low levels of geography.

2.2 | Model variables

The model variables are listed in Table 1.

2.2.1 | Dependent variables

The dependent variable for the first model was the domestic abuse rate per 1,000 population by LSOA (using 

2011 LSOA boundaries). The rate per 1,000 population is the measure that the Home Office uses to compare po‐

lice force areas. This was calculated by aggregating incident data into LSOAs using ArcGIS and converting to a rate 

per 1,000 population using mid‐year 2013 population estimates (to standardize the data). The rate of incidents, 

rather than the rate of victimization, has been used to factor in the repeated nature of domestic abuse as it meas‐

ures the increasing threat of harm (Walby, Towers, & Francis, 2015) and the response required from the police.

In spatial analysis, a linear GWR, which allows non‐stationarity to be considered, requires that the dependent 

variable,  independent  variables,  and  error  terms  have  a  Gaussian  distribution  (Fotheringham  et  al.,  2002).  The 

domestic abuse rate data showed a skewed distribution, so a logarithmic transformation was carried out, which

normalized the data. As there were no zero values, a natural logarithmic transformation was possible. As both the 

dependent and independent variables were transformed, it should be noted that the interpretation of the model 

will be multiplicative.

The second model brings in repeat victimization and measures the number of repeat individual victims per 

1,000 population by LSOA, rather than the number of incidents. Studying repeat victimization will factor in po‐

tential interjurisdiction difference in crime rates caused by one victim reporting multiple incidents (Mukherjee & 

Carcach, 1998). Brimicombe (2016) found that the repeat victimization flags used by the police are unreliable, with 

inadvertent errors and a lack of consistency. Essex Police also reported that this field is not reliable and not always 

completed. Therefore, a methodology similar to the rolling month approach that Brimicombe used was adopted. 

The only marked difference was that a six‐month time window was used, rather than a year. This was to optimize 

the amount of data that could be used in the analysis (to ensure that counts were not too low at the LSOA level) 

and was informed by research from the BCS suggesting that domestic abuse victims experience on average 20 in‐

cidents a year (Walby & Allen, 2004), therefore suggesting six months should be sufficient. The data were divided 

into three time periods: December 2011–April 2012 was the pre‐analysis period; May 2012–June 2014 was the 

analysis period; and July–December 2014 was the post‐analysis period. The number of incidents across the whole 

time period, including the pre‐ and post‐analysis period, was calculated for each victim (using the unique victim 

identifier) who reported an incident during the analysis period. This allowed a six‐month window either side for 

a repeat to occur. If more than one incident was reported, the incident was classified as a repeat. The number of 

repeat incidents was then calculated for each LSOA and converted to a rate per 1,000 population. As there were 

a small number of LSOAs that did not experience any repeat victimization, it was not appropriate to use a natural 

log transformation to normalize the data, so an inverse hyperbolic sine function was used in Stata instead. The 

number of incidents that each victim experienced is shown in Table 2. One victim had experienced 128 incidents 

within the time frame. The median number of incidents was two.

2.2.2 | Independent variables

The rate of domestic abuse in an area was estimated using explanatory variables based on social disorganization 

theory, measures of community cohesion, and population density. All variables were log transformed to normalize 

the distribution and aid interpretation.

Measures of community cohesion included the level of ASB. This was measured using Essex Police ASB data 

for 2014. The data were aggregated and converted to a rate per 1,000 population at the LSOA level. Another mea‐

sure of cohesion is the Vulnerable Localities Index (VLI). The VLI is used to identify residential neighborhoods that 

require prioritized attention for community safety and has been used to understand issues such as riots. Analysis 

of reporting for other crime types has shown there to be a slight increase in reporting in areas where there is in‐

creased social cohesion and lower levels of reporting in areas where there is the highest level of socio‐economic

disadvantage (Tompson, 2011). The VLI is a composite measure that is calculated using six variables, and can be 

applied in any country where access to accurate data on these variables exists. The six variables are: counts of 

burglary at a dwelling, counts of criminal damage to a dwelling, income deprivation score, employment deprivation 

score, count of 15–24 year olds, and educational attainment. Data for 2013 was used to calculate the VLI score 

and for the purposes of the analysis, the data were disaggregated into the separate variables. Population density 

(persons per hectare) was calculated by dividing the population in each LSOA, using 2011 census data by area 

(creating a new field and using the calculate geometry option).

Social disorganization theory was included in the analysis using deprivation and ethnicity data. The English Indices 

of Deprivation 2015 provide a relative measure of deprivation at small area level across England (Gov.uk, 2016). Areas 

are ranked from least deprived to most deprived on seven different dimensions of deprivation and an overall compos‐

ite measure of multiple deprivation. The domains used in the Indices of Deprivation 2015 are: (1) income deprivation, 

(2)  employment  deprivation,  (3)  health  deprivation  and  disability,  (4)  education  deprivation,  (5)  crime  deprivation, 

(6) barriers to housing and services deprivation, and (7) living environment deprivation. The crime domain was ex‐

cluded from this analysis as crime data was another variable in the VLI. The proportion of the population from BAME 

populations (as a measure of ethnic heterogeneity) in each LSOA was calculated using 2011 census data.

2.3 | Geographically weighted regression

As a linear GWR is to be used in this analysis, the starting point for each model was to run an OLS regression so 

that a single equation can be generated for the global model:

Y = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝜒1 + 𝛽2𝜒2 + ⋯ + 𝛽k𝜒k + 𝜀

The GWR extends this equation by generating a separate regression equation for every LSOA in the study 

area. The GWR equation is

Y = 𝛽0 (ui, vi) + 𝛽1 (ui, vi) 𝜒i1 + 𝛽2 (ui, vi) 𝜒i2 + … + 𝛽k (ui, vi) 𝜒ik + 𝜀i

(1)

(2)

where (ui, vi) represents the coordinates of the ith point in space. The weight assigned is based on a distance decay 
function centered at location i and observations nearer to i are given greater weight than observations further 

away. The distance decay function is modified by the bandwidth setting, which is the distance at which the weight 

rapidly approaches zero (Charlton & Fotheringham, 2009; Fotheringham et al., 2002; Gilbert & Chakraborty, 2011;

Several models were run using OLS and GWR to explore the predictors of the domestic abuse rate at the LSOA level. 

The initial models looked at individual predictors, to see the value that they had on their own (see Table 3 for the 

variables that offered the greatest explanation for the rate of domestic abuse), then more variables were added (and 
removed if they reduced the fit of the model). Although the R2 values were relatively high just using one variable, 

the Moran's I test indicated that the ASB rate and the population density standardized residuals showed negative 

autocorrelation, indicating a dispersed pattern, with less than a 10% likelihood that the pattern could be a result of 

random chance. This therefore meant that the models for these variables violate the basic assumption of independ‐

ence of data that is needed by GWR. The income score, employment score, and proportion of BAME, however, had 

Moran's I results that were not statistically significant, indicating a random distribution of the standardized residuals.

The Exploratory Regression tool was used in the Spatial Statistics toolbox to add more variables to the mod‐

els. This data‐mining tool tries all possible explanatory variables to see which models pass all of the OLS diag‐
nostic tests. The tool not only identifies the highest R2 values, but reports on all the potential model violations.

The goodness of fit of each model was assessed with the Akaike information criterion (AIC); the smaller the value 

of the AIC, the better the fit of the model to the observed data (Harris, 2016). When considering the same indepen‐
dent values, the AIC value was higher for all OLS models compared to the GWR models. Furthermore, the R2 value 
either improved or stayed the same in the GWR models. The GWR model with the best fit had an R2 value of 0.82 

with independent variables of the ASB rate, proportion of BAME, population density, and income score. Including the 
employment score did lead to an R2 value in the OLS model, but the GWR model failed because of multicollinearity, 

the result of a high variance inflation factor (VIF) caused by adding the employment score variable.

Table 4 gives the coefficient values for the model that demonstrated the best fit. For the global OLS model, the 

coefficients are all statistically significant and income is the biggest predictor of the domestic abuse rate, followed 

by the ASB rate, with a 1% increase in the income score seeing a 0.52 and 0.32% increase in the rate of domestic 

abuse, respectively, when holding all other variables constant.

The proportion of BAME population and the population density was also a statistically significant predictor, 

with higher rates of abuse taking place in more densely populated areas. What is not clear is whether this is be‐

cause abuse is less likely to take place in rural areas or whether people are less likely to report it due to geographic 

isolation, which might hide violence and prevent interaction to stop it (Beyer et al., 2015).

The  Moran's  I  score  indicates  that  the  OLS  model  residuals  suffer  from  significant  spatial  autocorrelation. 

However, using GWR overcomes this issue, with the Moran's I score in the GWR model residuals suggesting that 

the pattern does not appear to be significantly different from random. The GWR outputs for this model had a con‐

dition number that was less than 30, meaning the results are reliable without strong collinearity. Models were run 

with smaller bandwidths, but these reduced the model fit, which increased the AIC value and the model condition 

numbers. Using just single variables in the model, such as the income score, reduced the bandwith (the number of 

neighbors) but there then has to be a tradeoff with the model fit. The VIF for each coefficient was small and therefore 

did not suggest multicollinearity.

The coefficients of the GWR model in Table 4 were mapped (Figure 1). The relationship between the domestic 

abuse rate and all of the independent variables was not consistent (stationary) across Essex, suggesting that there 

are other spatial processes at work, something that is supressed in a global model. All of the GWR coefficient values 

were positive, so the relationship is always in the same direction as the global model, but with significant variation 

on the coefficient values. The potential process influencing this result could include particular localized policies, 

variations in police reporting, reporting to other services, other characteristics of the neighborhood, or variations in 

wellbeing and community engagement. Further research is needed to investigate these possibilities.

The influence of ASB is stronger in the east and north of the county. When holding all other variables con‐

stant, a 1% increase in the ASB rate would see a 0.43% increase in the domestic abuse rate in the areas shaded 

the darkest on the maps, compared to a 0.14% increase in the lightest shaded areas. This suggests that further 

investigation is needed into the underlying causes of ASB in an area (as this is not a causal model), to see whether 

these offer further explanation of the variation in the relationship with domestic abuse across space.

A 1% increase in the proportion of the BAME population saw between a 0.05 and 0.37% increase in the do‐

mestic abuse rate, with highest coefficient values in the Chelmsford, Brentwood, and Basildon areas. Perhaps this 

is indicative of reporting patterns by different ethnicities, with previous research finding that the recognition of 

abuse and propensity to report varies by ethnicity, with the Black Caribbean population having the highest level of 

recognition and Black African the lowest (Mooney, 2001). Further exploration of this relationship could be useful 

in designing and targeting campaigns to increase the recognition of abuse and the understanding about where to 

report it amongst particular ethnic groups.

Overall income is the most influential variable in the model, but it is also the variable that shows the greatest 

range in coefficient values. Holding all other variables constant, a 1% unit change in the income score sees an increase 

of between 0.29 and 0.72% in the domestic abuse rate, with the influence of income highest in the south and south 

east and lowest in Uttlesford and the south east of Chelmsford. The areas with the lowest coefficient values are some 

of the most affluent parts of Essex, which suggests that the effect of income on the domestic abuse rate is not as 

pronounced in the more affluent areas and that other variables have more influence in these areas.

The overall influence of population density is small, with a 1% rise seeing an increase of between 0.02 and 

0.15% in the domestic abuse rate. The coefficient values are higher in the north east of the county. These are areas 

that are predominantly rural.

Mapping  the  standard  residuals  from  the  GWR  models  enables  the  model  performance  to  be  viewed  geo‐

graphically. The pink areas are those where the model underestimates the amount of domestic abuse in an area, 

and the green where it overpredicts (Figure 2).

The second model had the best fit when using the same predictors as the first model (Table 5), although the 
overall explanatory power of the variables was lower than the first model, with an R2 of 0.70 for the GWR model 

(compared  with  0.82  for  the  first  model).  This  indicates  that  some  other  factors  need  to  be  considered  when

focusing on repeat victimization. Like the first model, all the OLS variables were significant. Again, the income 

score  was  the  strongest  predictor,  followed  by  the  rate  of  ASB,  population  density,  and  proportion  of  BAME 

population.  The  coefficients  were  all  non‐stationary  and  exhibited  very  similar  distributions  to  the  first  model 

(see Appendix for the coefficient maps), although unlike the first model some of the coefficient values for the pro‐

portion of BAME exhibited small negative values, with the proportion of BAME population decreasing the repeat 

victimization rate in a small number of areas.

of abuse in both the overall domestic abuse rate and the rate of repeat victimization. The GWR model provides 

a powerful predictor of the domestic abuse rate, explaining on average 82% of the variability in the dataset; the 

repeat victimization rate is weaker, but still explains 70% of the variability. The model results echo the findings 

of the CSEW that reported domestic abuse is more prevalent in deprived areas. These findings support the view 

that a social policy response to domestic abuse is needed to tackle broader issues that lead to deprivation and 

a breakdown in community cohesion, rather than just using the criminal justice system to react to incidents of 

domestic abuse.

The ASB rate in an area explains a staggering 70% of the overall domestic abuse rate and is consistent with 

the modest to strong interdependence that Sampson (2012) found between perceived disorder and other neigh‐

borhood factors. A previous link has been identified between reports of ASB and domestic abuse in housing re‐

search, with 40% of tenants who have suffered domestic abuse having had complaints made against them for ASB 

(Brunton‐Smith et al., 2013). This is an important finding, with several policy implications. Firstly, domestic abuse 

is one of the most under‐reported crimes, with only around 21% thought to be reported to the police (Flatley, 

WEIR    |  13

2016), and therefore the ASB rate in an area could act as a proxy for the amount of domestic abuse. Secondly, 

ASB is also a top priority for Essex Police, so it is possible that a policy intervention that looks at both issues and 

explores the root causes, rather than treating them separately, could be more successful.

The analysis has shown how much value a GWR model can add to understanding the relationship between the 

dependent and independent variables. Although a prediction and set of coefficients is available for each LSOA, 

the most value in policy terms is from the sub‐regional coefficient clusters. For instance, ASB has a much higher 

coefficient value in the east of Essex. In policy terms, the analysis would suggest that this is where you would 

focus further research and design a relevant response to ASB and domestic abuse. If resources are limited, then 

a more targeted focus on ASB in the east may have more impact than a more diluted county‐wide initiative. The 

initiative does not have to fit rigidly to district or borough boundaries, but could follow the cluster boundaries 

instead. Using GWR will offer a clear way in which to evaluate the impact of any localized policies.

A limitation to this analysis is that domestic abuse is one of the most under‐reported crimes and assumptions 

have  been  made  that  the  level  of  under‐reporting  is  consistent  across  neighborhoods.  Targeting  resources  to 

these hotspots assumes that the unknown cases of domestic abuse share the same geographical distribution and 

characteristics. Further analysis is therefore needed as it could be that this analysis is accentuating the issue in de‐

prived areas and under‐reporting is concentrated more in more affluent areas or in areas where there is a variation 

in access to services. One way in which this could be accomplished would be to replicate the model with data from 

other agencies where abuse could be reported. This could include health data, charities such as Victim Support, 

and  court  data.  Other  neighborhood  studies  have  used  survey  data,  but  unfortunately  the  sample  size  for  the 

LSOA at the neighborhood level is too small. Access to services could be modeled using points‐of‐interest data.

Sampson et al. (2002) question whether disorder is an explanatory mechanism or an outcome of the issues 

of simultaneity bias; this research is unable to answer this question, as GWR does not produce a causal model. 

Previous research has found neighborhood‐level concentrated socio‐economic disadvantage to be a precursor to 

violence and the cause of other behaviors that influence violence, including physical and social disorder (Beyer et 

al., 2015; Browning, 2002; van Wyk et al., 2003). Whilst exogenous characteristics, such as income, are known to 

affect an individual's risk of domestic abuse (Koenig, Ahmed, & Haaga, 1999; O'Campo et al., 1995), clustering was 

still found to be present when controlling for household and individual risk factors (Counts, Brown, & Campbell, 

1999), which suggests that endogenous social effects must be at work (McQuestion, 2003). The broken windows 

thesis (Wilson & Kelling, 1982) supports the notion that ASB and violent crime are linked (Boggess & Maskaly, 

2014); however, it has been argued that such theories fail to capture a causal link between crime and ASB, and that 

crime and disorder manifest themselves when neighborhoods lack collective efficacy (Sampson & Raudenbush, 

1999). This warrants further research so that a policy response aimed at the root causes can be designed.

The method employed in this research only considers the concentration at the LSOA level; of course, the dis‐

tribution within the LSOA may not be spatially homogenous. Making assumptions that everyone shares the same 

risk could create an ecological fallacy (Robinson, 2006). The methodology does not factor in the varying nature of 

abuse and the risk assigned to the different incidents, although the second model that focuses on repeat victim‐

ization recognizes those areas where domestic abuse is more than a one‐off incident for the victim (in terms of 

reporting). In an aspatial application, a multilevel model could be used to separate the individual and contextual ef‐

fects, but this method implies the nature of the relationship is discontinuous, and therefore would not identify the 

non‐stationary relationships that GWR does (Fotheringham et al., 2002). A more recent methodology, hierarchical 

spatial  autoregressive  modeling,  has  been  used  to  investigate  the  spatial  dependence  of  land  prices,  so  future 

work could explore the application of this methodology to personal and contextual characteristics as predictors 

of domestic abuse (Dong & Harris, 2015).

The use of ArcGIS placed some constraints on the scope and available approaches for this analysis. Crime data 

tends to have a skewed distribution and whilst transforming the data overcame this issue, it would be interesting 

to compare the results with those from models that are preferred for non‐Gaussian distributions such as geo‐

graphically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) (Nakaya, Fotheringham, Brunsdon, & Charlton, 2005), which has 

WEIR14  |    

been used with count data. Another method developed by Silva and Rodrigues (2014) is geographically weighted 

negative binomial regression (GWNBR). This methodology has been used to overcome issues of overdispersion 

that have been found in Poisson regression models. Unfortunately, ArcGIS currently only offers the basic linear 

GWR. Using the GWPR or GWNBR could overcome the issues created by having zero values in the repeat victim‐

ization model, where the logarithmic transformation offered in ArcGIS was not possible and Stata therefore had 

to be used to transform the data using an inverse hyperbolic sine function.

Whilst there are some limitations, this analysis has important findings and implications for social policy. It has 

been possible to predict the rate of domestic abuse in an area to a high degree of accuracy using data that is readily 

available online. A significant finding has been the variability in the coefficient values over space. In terms of social 

policy and criminal justice interventions, this means that localized policy interventions can be designed, rather 

than using blanket regional or national approaches, which in a time of austerity will aid the allocation of resources 

to the most appropriate policies. There are real operational benefits to this methodology and a recommendation 

would be to explore its application with other social issues and to test it in other areas.

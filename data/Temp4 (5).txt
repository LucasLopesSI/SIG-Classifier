Abstract. To assess the implications of sea level rise along the English east coast,
the Arc-Info GIS package was used to determine coastal vulnerability to (cid:143) ooding.
Results from oceanographic and climatic research were combined with data on
sea defences, elevation values, and patterns of landuse. A risk assessment model
was developed to estimate (cid:143) ood return periods according to di(cid:128) erent climate
change scenarios for the years 2050 and 2100. Flood risks were modelled as a
function of the height and condition of sea defences, land elevations, and subsid-
ence rates. The ‘house equivalent’ concept was used to estimate damage costs of
(cid:143) ood events in a future climate-changed environment. For the year 2100 the
model predicts signi(cid:142) cant increases in (cid:143) ood damage costs. However, the results
indicate the considerable uncertainty associated with sea level rise predictions.
Our (cid:142) ndings may potentially be of both academic and practical interest, but will
be of little practical signi(cid:142) cance to coastal managers and planners if they cannot
use them. To illustrate how this might be facilitated, their incorporation into an
easy to use prototype Decision Support System (DSS) is outlined. The develop-
ment of such systems is possibly the next major challenge for the application of
GIS technologies to the coastal zone.

Introduction
One of the UK’s principal geographical

features is its extensive coastline
(12 429 km), created by a multitude of land and ocean processes, subjected to anthro-
pogenic in(cid:143) uences, and characterised by a variety of environments. The coast is
increasingly valued by society for the market and non-marke t goods and services it
provides (Turner et al. 1998). However, the potential for coastal developments to
have wide ranging, and often indirect, impacts is increasingly recognised, and even
development work with clearly recognised local objectives may have adverse impacts
elsewhere along the cost (Thiaeng 1997). Such con(cid:143) icts, coupled with an escalating
demand for coastal resources, the restricted geographical extent of the coastal zone,
and the fragile nature of many coastal environments means that the UK shoreline
is an area that requires careful management.

It is increasingly recognised that successful coastal management strategies must
be supported by the implementation of rational, integrated, and sustainable interven-
tions that are centred around the principles of long-term planning (Bartlett 1994 ).
The term Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is nowadays often used to
address this type of process (Bower and Turner 1998). Whilst there are many
potential bene(cid:142) ts to adopting an integrated approach, ICZM requires that environ-
mental managers and planners have access to a diverse range of high quality spatially
referenced data on the physical, biological, and socio-economic processes operating
within the coastal zone (Lucas 1996 ). Hence, it is unsurprising that there is a growing
interest in the development of coastal zone information systems based on GIS
technologies (Bartlett 1994).

On the face of it, GIS certainly appear to be attractive tools to facilitate the
execution of ICZM related programmes. Their ability to accommodate and integrate
large databases means that they may play an important role in the decision-making
process. These attributes, coupled with their provision of advanced mapping and
spatial analysis facilities are reasons why they are increasingly being implemented
by those charged with the task of administering stretches of coast (Bartlett 1994).

There is little doubt that GIS have the potential to seriously contribute to the
adoption of an integrated approach towards coastal management problems, initiating
information integration and exchange between the involved parties and stakeholders.
However, whilst the use of the technology as a tool for land-based resource manage-
ment and planning is well established, GIS applications in coastal and aquatic
environments are less frequent and are often rather poorly de(cid:142) ned (Ricketts 1992 ).
At least in part, this may be due to the fact that o(cid:128) -the-shelf GIS are generally
lacking the basic functionality required to tackle many coastal management issues
(Maslen et al., 1996 ).

A particular limitation stems from the restricted ability of many systems to handle
temporal data. This means that the dynamic nature of the coastal environment, both
in space and time, cannot be well represented (Hamre et al. 1997). Furthermore, the
linear nature of the coastline means that it can be di(cid:129) cult to undertake analytical
operations which are typically developed for use with point or polygon topology
(Bartlett et al. 1997). These limitations are compounded by the fact that coastal
decision-makers are often overwhelmed by the complexity of many GIS applications
(Green 1995, Raal et al. 1995). Consequently, the GIS based coastal management
systems that have been developed are often simply employed to produce thematic
maps of coastal areas and much of the potential of the technology remains unrealised.
One area for which GIS holds particular possibilities is the modelling and evaluation
of coastal (cid:143) ood risks associated with climate change (Zeidler 1997). The use of GIS
for the assessment of coastal (cid:143) ooding is not new (for examples see Shennan 1993 )
but previous work has often not fully exploited the technology.

In 1996, the second assessment report of the Intergovernmenta l Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) concluded that the human in(cid:143) uence on the global climate attribut-
able to the emission of greenhouse gases is now discernible (Houghton et al. 1996 ).
Since the Industrial Revolution (about A.D 1750 ) the global-mean surface air temper-
ature has risen by 0.6ß C and all the signs are that this warming trend is set to
continue. Future climatic changes of this nature will have two important impacts
within the coastal zone. The (cid:142) rst is a rise in mean sea-level due to the thermal
expansion of the oceans, ablation of the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice sheets
and snow melt from mountain glaciers and other ice caps (Gornitz 1995). The second
is a possible change in storm surge activity (Roberts and Kay 1990).

Assessing the potential future in(cid:143) uence of climate change on a stretch of coastline
is an extremely complex task. Important parameters include the location of storm
tracks, estimates of local sea-level rise, measures of isostatic adjustment, variations
in mean high water level, and information on wave characteristics (Bateman et al.
1991 ). The (cid:143) ood hazard posed by these physical systems will in turn be mediated
by anthropogenic in(cid:143) uences such as the location of coastal towns and villages and
the construction and maintenance of sea-defences. As all of these factors have a
strong spatial element, GIS can play a potentially valuable role in assessing the
vulnerability of coastal lowlands (Shennan 1993).

This paper reports on the development of a GIS based model to evaluate (cid:143) ooding
hazards for future sea level rise and storm surge activity along a section of the east
coast of the UK. All the GIS work was undertaken on Arc-Info 7.1 running on a
DEC Alpha workstation. The paper discusses how some of the limitations of tradi-
tional GIS packages may be overcome so that the output of this model can be
incorporated into a coastal management system. As part of this, the development of
a prototype GIS-based Decision Support System (DSS) for coastal (cid:143) ooding that is
both simple to use and of real practical value to coastal managers is outlined.

2. Modelling (cid:143) ood risk along the east coast

With a length of 1240 km, the study area stretches along the east coast of the
UK between the Humber and the Thames estuaries ((cid:142) gure 1 ). It crosses the counties
of Humberside, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Su(cid:128) olk, and Essex. This length of the coast
is at particular risk of inundation by the sea; much of the land is low-lying and the
coastline is especially vulnerable to storm surges as water is channelled from the
North Sea through the narrow English Channel. Parts of the east coast are also
su(cid:128) ering from serious erosion, and many sea defences built after the great (cid:143) oods of
1953 are becoming increasingly exposed. Unsurprisingly, there is a long history of
coastal (cid:143) ooding combated by sea defences dating back through the Middle Ages to
Roman times (MAFF 1996). Medieval maps show relative distributions of land and
water di(cid:128) ering signi(cid:142) cantly from the present situation, and the coastal lowlands
within the study area have been subjected to a number of major (cid:143) ood incidents
resulting in considerable loss of life and property (table 1).

The vulnerability of the east coast means that careful management of the shoreline
is particularly important. At present, management practices in the UK are governed
by the Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs)
(MAFF 1998, Diment 1994). The
smallest spatial unit delineated by each SMP is the ‘management unit’. These are
areas of the coast within which relatively homogeneous sedimentation processes
operate, and they form the basic compartments within which management regimes
are operative. The study area contains approximatel y 140 units. The maintenance
of sea defences within each unit is central to the SMP. However, improving or
maintaining all sea walls in their current condition is not a viable policy option.
Conventional sea walls are extremely expensive, costing on average more than £1000
per metre. Their construction or strengthening can also cause damage elsewhere
along the coast by restricting the supply of sediment (Pearce 1996 ). Because of these
limitations, it is vital that long term planning e(cid:128) orts and resources for the eastern
coastal zone are speci(cid:142) cally targeted at areas that will be most vulnerable to (cid:143) ooding
in the future.

The (cid:142) rst stage in this assessment of the implications of climate change for coastal
(cid:143) ood risks on the east coast was the development of a GIS-based risk assessment

model. Of course, a model is simply a simulation and a simpli(cid:142) cation of reality and
hence the quality of its output depends strongly on its ability to depict real world
processes. In practice, it is usually necessary to simplify the multitude of interacting
real world systems so as to be able to depict the most important driving mechanisms.
In line with this, vulnerability was modelled as being a function of three main coastal
processes; tidal and storm surge activities, sea-level rise, and isostatic adjustment.

2.1. Storm surge activities

There is considerable uncertainty associated with the quanti(cid:142) cation of e(cid:128) ects of
climate change on storm surges at a regional scale. Despite this, recent results from
the coupled atmosphere-ocean model produced by the Hadley Centre (HADCM2)
show that the total number of storms in the Northern Hemisphere would decrease
over the next century in a CO
enhanced atmosphere. However, the number of deep
2
low pressure centres representing more severe storms are predicted to increase over
the same time period (Carnell and Senior 1997). Information was provided by the
Proudman Oceanographi c Laboratory on high water predictions for a period of up
to 10000 years at various locations along the coast (Dixon and Tawn, 1997). An
estimate of high water return periods for each management unit was then calculated
in Arc-Info using linear interpolation; values for each unit were estimated as a
function of the return periods for the nearest two adjacent data points and the
distance from the those points to the mid-point of the unit ((cid:142) gure 2).

2.2. Sea level rise

Sea level rise predictions were made using data supplied by the Climatic Research
Unit of the University of East Anglia. Values for projected sea level rise under
di(cid:128) erent climate change scenarios were derived from the Model for the Assessment
of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC). MAGICC is a suite of
coupled computer programs designed to assess the global-mean temperature and sea
level changes that might arise from future emissions of greenhouse gases and of non-
greenhouse gases that a(cid:128) ect the lifetime of methane and of sulphur dioxide. Further
details of the model can be found in Hulme et al. (1995 ). Based on the output of
MAGICC, the estimated sea level (relative to the base year 1990 ) was derived for
all years up to 2100. For each management unit, the sea level rise estimates associated
with three di(cid:128) erent model scenarios (corresponding to a mean warming of 1.5ß C,
2.5ß C, and 4.5ß C respectively) were computed and stored in Arc-Info.

estimates along the coastline.

2.3. Isostatic adjustment

During the last glaciation, the ice sheets that covered the UK compressed the
landmass below. This caused a north-south tilt, where the pressure of thick ice over
Scotland and Northern England pushed the land surface downwards and caused the
landmass of southern England to rise. Since the end of the glaciation the land has
been re-adjusting to equilibrium, and the level of most of South-East England has
been subsiding. This process is still on-going, and has obvious implications for
determining vulnerability of the coast to sea level rise. Estimates of yearly mean
isostatic adjustment rates for each management unit were derived in Arc-Info based
on a linear interpolation of point predictions made for eastern England by
Shennan (1989).

3. The risk assessment model

The basic steps of the methodology developed to assess climate-change associated

(cid:143) ooding risk for each management unit are outlined in (cid:142) gure 3.

An important issue is the determination of how each management unit was to
be represented within the GIS. Most SMPs simply delineate management units
according to start and end points along the coastline and hence they provide no
topological structure. As paper maps usually treat the coast as a linear entity, this
issue is a common problem when representing coastal features in a GIS; although it
may be cartographicall y convenient, the linear representation of sections of the
coastline belies the fact that many processes (in particular (cid:143) ooding) have an import-
ant and varied landward component. However, determining the maximum landward
extent of the coastal zone can be problematic, as land-ocean interactions take place
at a variety of spatial scales and over considerable distances. Because of this, the

zone is characterised by a ‘fuzzy’ landward boundary that has no sharp delimiting
threshold, and is hence not easy to represent.

For the purposes of this analysis, a polygon topology was generated for manage-
ment units where the back of the unit was created using the 5 m elevation contour.
In cases where the 5 m contour lay more than 5 km from the coast, a 5 km coastal
bu(cid:128) er was used to back the management unit ((cid:142) gure 4). As areas of land below 5m
elevation are particularly vulnerable to coastal (cid:143) ooding, this hybrid distance-
elevation approach to constructing polygonal data structures was felt to be a good
compromise between the need for area-based calculations and the requirement for
the analysis to be focused on the coastal domain. However, it is important to note
that this solution would not be applicable for the analysis of all coastal processes.

The next stage of the modelling process involved the quanti(cid:142) cation of the level
of (cid:143) ood protection provided within each management unit. For this purpose, data
on sea defences heights and backshore elevation values was taken from the National
Sea Defence Survey (SDS) held by the UK Environment Agency (EA). The SDS is
based on (cid:142) eldwork undertaken by Sir William Halcrow and Partners in 1990. It
forms part of the Shoreline Management System; the Environment Agency coastal

GIS database. The Shoreline Management System is described in detail by Leggett
and Jones (1996). The SDS was constructed using the Intergraph GIS and Oracle
database packages, but was converted into Arc-Info format for this analysis.

Within the SDS, sea defences are represented as linear vector features. Each
vector is linked to database (cid:142) elds that contain information on the characteristics
and condition of the structure. Of particular importance for this application were
details of the height of the crest of the defence above the mean water level datum.
Arc-Info was used to query SDS to determine the lowest defence height in each
management unit, and this was stored as an Info attribute. Flood hazard was then
modelled as a function of two mechanisms; overtopping and structural defence failure
(Meadowcroft et al. 1996). In order to derive the annual frequency of an overtopping
event under baseline conditions (year 1990), the return level frequencies for extreme
water heights were compared with the corresponding lowest defence heights in each
(cid:143) ood unit. It was assumed that if a given water level would exceed the lowest defence
height, the whole unit would be (cid:143) ooded. For every (cid:143) ood unit, the data in Dixon
and Tawn (1997) provided the predicted water height (in cm) of surges with return
periods ranging between 1 and 10 000 years. By comparing this information with
lowest defence heights, the return period for a surge that would overtop the units
defences was estimated. The formula;

P =1/R

(where P represents an annual probability, and R represents the return period in
years) was then used to convert this measure into annual (cid:143) ood frequencies. In order
to calculate these annual frequencies under the various sea level rise scenarios, the
same methodology was applied, but the heights of the sea defences within the model
were arti(cid:142) cially reduced by the predicted rise in sea level, plus with the estimated
amount of subsidence associated with isostatic adjustment. In this manner, changes
in mean sea level and storm surge activities were modelled as additive rather than
interactive e(cid:128) ects.

The details of the structural condition of each defence were extracted from records
held in the SDS database. Three criteria were used to estimate structural integrity;

273

the condition of the defence (good to bad), the condition of the beach (accreting to
eroding rapidly), and the material with which the defence was constructed. These
factors were weighted according to their relative importance (see Thumerer 1998 ),
and each structure was classi(cid:142) ed as being in a good, average, or poor state. As
information was not available to allow a full quantitative assessment to be made of
the impact of defence deterioration on future (cid:143) ood risk, this data was used to inform
the decision-making process, rather than quantitatively alter the risk estimates.

For the assessment of future (cid:143) ood frequencies under di(cid:128) erent climate change
scenarios, a loose coupling approach was adopted where the Info database was
linked to a scenario-modelling routine in Microsoft Excel. The results from the
scenario models were, in turn, linked back into Arc-Info to provide cartographic
output. The numerical modelling capabilities of Excel allowed (cid:143) ood risks to be
promptly calculated for each management unit for any point in the future by
computing predicted extreme water levels, adjusting them for isostatic adjustment,
comparing these values with the level of protection a(cid:128) orded by coastal defences, and
estimating (cid:143) ood probabilities.

3.1. T he development of property damage risk scenarios

The application of this methodology is illustrated by two scenarios that were
developed to estimate (cid:143) ood damage risks based on property values. The scenarios
were constructed for two time periods (years to 2050, and years to 2100), and
incorporated three estimates of sea-level rise (table 2). For the design of these scen-
arios, it was assumed that the future provision of sea defences along the east coast
would be the same as the level of provision at present, although it would be a
relatively simple matter to alter these assumptions.

In order to predict the damage costs of a (cid:143) ood event, it was necessary to estimate
the (cid:142) nancial values of the assets in each management unit. For this purpose, landuse-
classi(cid:142) ed 25 m resolution Landsat TM data provided by the Environment Agency
was used. The Landsat data were overlaid with the management unit boundaries to
estimate the area of di(cid:128) erent land uses within each management unit. Financial
values were then attributed to the land uses using the ‘House equivalent’ (HE)
concept (Posford Duvivier 1995, Dunderdale and Morris 1998).

The HE is a unit of measurement representing the annual average monetary
damage costs of an average residential property (cid:143) ooded by a single representative
event. The HE concept may be applied to many di(cid:128) erent land uses so as to provide
a common unit of measurement for damage comparisons. The potential damage
costs for important land uses identi(cid:142) ed from the Landsat TM image were calculated
based on the HE estimates shown in table 3, and the resulting values were aggregated
for each management unit.

Damage value calculated based on estimated number of residential units with cell; C = Damage
calculated for entire spatial entity, irrespective of size.

In a technical context, (cid:143) ood risk is simply the combination of the frequency of
current and the magnitude of consequences of an event (Meadowcroft et al. 1995 )
Hence, in order to derive the annual damage risk in the study area, the HE values
for each management unit were multiplied with the (cid:143) ood frequencies according to
the baseline situation and the di(cid:128) erent climate change scenarios using the formula;

R = FÖ C

where R represents the calculated (cid:143) ood risk within the unit, F equals the probability
of a (cid:143) ood occurring within a given year, and C depicts the consequences of the
event, in this case the estimated damage values. To illustrate this, (cid:142) gure 5 shows the

distribution of calculated annual (cid:143) ood risks for a non-climate change baseline
scenario for a representative section of the coastline between the Humber estuary
and North Norfolk. These show a strong contrast with the extreme climate change
associated predictions for scenario E and the year 2100 ((cid:142) gure 6).

study region and each scenario. The baseline situation can be judged as relatively

manageable with an annual risk of £25 m. With regard to the projections for the
year 2050, only a sea level rise equivalent to that under scenario E would be likely
to give signi(cid:142) cant reasons for concern with an estimated tenfold increase of the (cid:143) ood
damage costs up to £248 m per year relative to the baseline scenario. When the
model was run through to the year 2100, the di(cid:128) erent estimates of sea level rise
showed a much greater in(cid:143) uence on damage values. Based on the climate-change
assumptions of scenario A, the total (cid:143) ood risk would increase by a factor of twelve
relative to the value of 1990 to £309 m per year. In the extremes of scenario E, the
total annual (cid:143) ood risk in the study area would reach the exceptional value of £1632 m
per year, the result of the signi(cid:142) cant increase in (cid:143) ood frequencies for almost every
(cid:143) ood unit.

A comparison of the damage estimates associated with the di(cid:128) erent estimates of
sea level rise shows the considerable uncertainties inherent in the model that are
associated with the predictions of future sea level rise. This is especially true for the
long-term projections, which reveal a range of two orders of magnitude within their
risk values.

4.

Integration of the model into a coastal management system
The risk assessment models developed during this project may potentially be of
both academic and practical interest, but they will be of little practical use to coastal
managers and planners if they cannot use them. Green (1995) suggests that the
development of system with a more intelligent and intuitive user interface than is
available from an o(cid:128) the shelf GIS may be one way to facilitate this. To illustrate
how this process might be implemented here, a prototype DSS has been developed
that consists of a simple front end and a coastal process modelling application, both
written in V isual Basic. These are close coupled to a mapping applet, Microsoft
Datamap, produced by the Mapinfo Corporation.

The package is structured in such a way so as to provide coastal managers with
a link between potentially useful GIS technology and data and understanding of the
processes operating within the coastal zone. Signi(cid:142) cantly, it has been designed for
users with little or no GIS experience, and it can run on almost any PC equipped
with Microsoft Windows. So that the prototype DSS may run totally independently
of Arc-Info, the results from the various (cid:143) ood risk scenarios are stored in columns
in Excel worksheets where they are retrieved, as required, dependent upon the
selections made by the user.

The prototype system combines the coastal (cid:143) ood risk models with information
on projected population growth for each management unit derived from 1981 and
1991 UK census of population statistics (Openshaw 1995). In its present from, the
package allows users to estimate (cid:143) ood risks in each management unit for any year
up to 2100 based on the IPCC sea level risk predictions. The user is able to
incorporate population growth estimates, and then estimate the population at risk
(in terms of both households and persons) from (cid:143) ooding at any point in the future.
These calculations are performed by V isual Basic code. Cartographic output is
provided in the form of predicted risk and population maps for management units.
The maps are dynamic, and automatically update when the assumptions of the
scenarios change. Statistical functionality is also provided in the form of Excel
generated tables and three dimensional charts.

The use of the system to estimate the population at risk in the year 2100 under
IPCC sea level rise scenario C is illustrated in (cid:142) gure 8. The user is presented with

System.

an initial front end (a) which provides access to screens for altering the sea level rise
and population growth (b) assumptions. The model is then run and maps of (cid:143) ood
risk (c) or population growth can be displayed. The user is also able to use the front
end to access statistical output, in this case a graphical representation of the estimated
at risk population (d).

It is hoped that the prototype will be further developed into a fully operational
system. It is intended that the implementation will utilise the Arcview GIS package
for the storage of spatially referenced data and the production of on-screen carto-
graphic output, whilst the main modelling engine of the software will be written
using a combination of the Avenue scripting language for Arcview and Microsoft
Visual Basic code.

The use of a bespoke engine such as this holds the potential to provide far greater
functionality for coastal process modelling than would be possible with a traditional
GIS alone. This is important as any coastal DSS should be able to store the spatial
and non-spatial attributes of each segment of the coastline, and then symbolically

link the segment to all others, representing and modelling the inherent connectivity
of coastal sections. For example, the potential impact of sea level rise in one manage-
ment unit might in(cid:143) uence its suitability for housing development. This in turn may
be e(cid:128) ected by sediment accretion or erosion from changes in levels of shoreline
protection elsewhere along the coast. In this manner, the coastline is depicted as
being subject to a complex network of both spatial and temporal in(cid:143) uences and
feedback mechanisms.

5. Discussion

This paper has illustrated the development of GIS-based models for the assess-
ment of climate change associated coastal (cid:143) ood risks along the east coast of England.
Although the volume of GIS associated coastal literature is increasing, the application
of this technology within the coastal zone has been rather slow (Jones, 1995 ).
Undoubtedly, a number of issues need to be addressed if GIS are to realise their full
potential for the management of coastal environments.

For GIS to assist in ICZM programmes, they require current, accurate data from
a large range of sources (Maslen et al. 1996). At present, technical limitations such
as the lack of a de(cid:142) nitive map-base to integrate OS maps with Admiralty Charts,
coupled with the de(cid:142) ciencies of data exchange formats for organisations charged
with the task of surveying the coast, means that much of the information that is
being collected is relatively specialised and not freely available.

The analysis of (cid:143) ood risks presented here could be re(cid:142) ned by the availability of
higher quality elevation data. These models were based on the assumption that all
areas of each management unit below the 5 m contour would be inundated in a
(cid:143) ood event. Whilst this is a simpli(cid:142) cation of reality, detailed data on the internal
topography of each management would be a pre-requisite for any attempt to under-
take a more elaborate analysis. Obtaining such information is di(cid:129) cult, as even Land-
Form PROFILE[
produced by the UK Ordnance Survey, only provides contours
at 5 m intervals. In the near future it may be possible to make more spatially resolved
estimates of the extent of (cid:143) ooding via the use of LIDAR (Laser Induced Direction
and Range) derived digital elevation models. LIDAR provides high quality elevation
information by the use of a laser sensor attached to a survey aircraft (Irish and
White 1998).

A restricted analysis of within-unit (cid:143) ooding along a section of the Humberside
coastline between New Holland and Grimsby has been undertaken via the use of
one metre resolution LIDAR raster images provided by the UK National Centre
for Environmental Data and Surveillance. The results of this work are presented
elsewhere (Thumerer, 1998). However, the extent of national LIDAR coverage is
currently limited to stretches of the Cornish coast and some trial sites in Humberside
and the Wash. Furthermore, even if LIDAR data can be obtained, its use can be
problematic; this dataset covered an area of coastline just 22 km in length, yet still
required a storage space of over 600 megabytes in its unprocessed form.

This paper has discussed how the results of a traditional workstation-base d GIS
analysis may be incorporated into a desktop DSS for use by interested stakeholders
and coastal managers. The general transition of GIS from the workstation environ-
ment to mainstream desktop PCs is welcome news, and innovations like Microsof t
Data Map are blurring the distinction between specialised GIS packages and widely
used database and spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel. The development
of coastal Decision Support packages such as that outlined here may well be a major

279

step towards the more widespread day-to-day application of GIS technologies for
the management of coastal resources (Raal et al. 1995 ).

The increasing need for ICZM is a logical consequence of the rapid environmental
and socio-economic changes occurring around the worlds coastlines. For concerns
such as coastal (cid:143) ood risk assessment, it is easy to see how GIS-based Decision
Support Systems may help to assist in the mitigation of property damage for existing
structures, guide future development, and minimise resource degradation, thus saving
money and possibly even lives (Hickey et al. 1997 ).

Within the coverall context of ICZM, GIS clearly has the potential to act as one
important tool in the evaluation of not just (cid:143) ood risk, but a wide range of interactions
within the broader range of services (both market and non-market ) provided by the
coastal zone. It also has considerable capabilities to be used as a tool to assist in
the reconciliation of potential resource con(cid:143) icts. Despite this, it is generally true that
there is still some way to go before the gap can be bridged between the evolution of
an academic understanding of how such systems might work, and the provision of
functional packages that may be widely used. However, time and resources invested
in development today may pay rich rewards in the future.

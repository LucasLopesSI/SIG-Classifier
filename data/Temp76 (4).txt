Abstract. Land cover class composition of remotely sensed image pixels can be
estimated using soft classiﬁcation techniques increasingly available in many GIS
packages. However, their output provides no indication of how such classes are
distributed spatially within the instantaneous ﬁeld of view represented by the
pixel. Techniques that attempt to provide an improved spatial representation of
land cover have been developed, but not tested on the diﬃcult task of mapping
from real satellite imagery. The authors investigated the use of a Hopﬁeld neural
network technique to map the spatial distributions of classes reliably using
information of pixel composition determined from soft classiﬁcation previously.
The approach involved designing the energy function to produce a ‘best guess’
prediction of the spatial distribution of class components in each pixel. In previous
studies, the authors described the application of the technique to target identiﬁca-
tion, pattern prediction and land cover mapping at the sub-pixel scale, but only
for simulated imagery. We now show how the approach can be applied to Landsat
Thematic Mapper (TM) agriculture imagery to derive accurate estimates of land
cover and reduce the uncertainty inherent in such imagery. The technique was
applied to Landsat TM imagery of small-scale agriculture in Greece and large-
scale agriculture near Leicester, UK. The resultant maps provided an accurate
and improved representation of the land covers studied, with RMS errors for the
Landsat imagery of the order of 0.1 in the new ﬁne resolution map recorded. The
results showed that the neural network represents a simple eﬃcient tool for

mapping land cover from operational satellite sensor imagery and can deliver
requisite results and improvements over traditional techniques for the GIS analysis
of practical remotely sensed imagery at the sub pixel scale.

1.

Introduction
Accurate information on land cover is required for both scientiﬁc research (e.g.
climate change modelling, ﬂood prediction) and management (e.g. city planning,
disaster mitigation). Remote sensing has the potential to provide this information
and has long been used to map land cover within agricultural areas. The ability of
geographical information systems (GIS) to be able to incorporate such satellite-
sensor derived maps in combination with other data sets has opened the door to
GIS-based agricultural management. However, there exist several practical limita-
tions to the remote sensing of such land cover. The particular problem that provides
the impetus for the emerging ﬁeld of super-resolution land cover mapping is that
within remotely sensed imagery a large proportion of pixels may be of mixed class
composition (Fisher 1997). For example, a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image
(with a spatial resolution of 30 m by 30 m) of an agricultural scene may contain
many pixels that represent more than one land cover class, especially at ﬁeld borders.
This causes a mixing of spectral signatures, which occurs as a function of:

(i ) Frequency of land cover

The physical continuum that exists in many cases between discrete category
land
labels, combined with the spatially mixed nature of most natural
cover classes.

(ii ) Frequency of sampling

The spatial integration within the pixel of land cover classes due to factors
such as the sensor spatial resolution, point spread function (PSF) and
resampling for geometric rectiﬁcation.

Traditionally, hard classiﬁcation has been used within GIS packages to assign
each pixel in a remotely sensed image to a single, most likely, class. However, where
mixed pixels are present, hard classiﬁcation is inappropriate: it does not make sense
to allocate a single pixel to, say, woodland when the pixel actually represents 50%
woodland, 30% heathland and 20% water. Fisher (1997) identiﬁed four causes of
mixed pixels, examples of which are shown in ﬁgure 1. The solution to the mixed
pixel problem typically centres on soft classiﬁcation, which may be used to predict
the proportion of each class within each pixel using, for example, spectral mixture
models (Settle and Drake 1993), nearest neighbour classiﬁers (Schowengerdt 1997),
multi-layer perceptrons (Atkinson et al. 1997) or support vector machines (Brown
et al. 1999). Soft classiﬁcation methods are becoming popular, and are now available
in several GIS packages (e.g. IdrisiA, Erdas Imagine A).

In most cases, soft classiﬁcation results in a more informative and appropriate
representation of land cover than that produced using hard classiﬁcation. Such
classiﬁers attempt to reduce the error and uncertainty inherent within maps produced
using traditional hard classiﬁcation by accounting for mixed pixels. A hard classiﬁca-
tion fails to recognize or represent the existence of classes and objects which grade
into one another and class boundaries at sub-pixel scales, leaving the classiﬁcation
user uncertain of the accuracy of the prediction. Such simpliﬁcation can be seen as
a waste of the available multispectral information, which could be interpreted more

eﬃciently (Wang 1990, Foody 1995). However, while the class composition of every
pixel is predicted using soft classiﬁcation, the spatial distribution of these class
components within each pixel remains unknown. Therefore, while soft classiﬁcation
conveys more information than hard classiﬁcation, the resultant predictions still
contain a large degree of uncertainty. In addition, the complexity of the data sets
produced puts many novice and expert GIS users oﬀ using soft classiﬁcation tech-
niques. The challenge exists to map within each pixel the location of these class
components to produce super-resolution land cover maps that retain the single
thematic map format familiar to all GIS users. The development of a robust, eﬃcient
approach, applicable to all types of satellite imagery has many potential beneﬁts
worldwide, for example:

1.1. Spatial-spectral trade-oV

Even with recent advances in satellite technology, there still exists a substantial
trade-oﬀ between sensor spatial and spectral resolution. New high spatial resolution
sensors, such as IKONOS MSS, may provide multispectral
imagery at spatial
resolutions of up to 4 m, but the four spectral bands are often insuﬃcient to produce
accurate land cover maps. In contrast, medium spatial resolution sensors, such as
Landsat TM (30 m spatial resolution) and SPOT HRV (20 m spatial resolution) have
a long history of use for land cover mapping, due to their larger ranges of spectral
bands and spatial coverage, but the imagery generally (dependent upon class deﬁni-
tions) contains large numbers of mixed pixels. An approach that was able to produce
land cover maps of the spatial resolution of IKONOS imagery, using the spectral

A. J. T atem et al.

resolution and range of Landsat TM/SPOT HRV to achieve classiﬁcation accuracy
would, therefore, be very attractive.

1.2. Spatial resolution limit

The recent launch of satellites such as IKONOS has lead to many new areas of
research being examined. The unprecedented availability of multi-spectral satellite
sensor imagery with spatial resolution of around 4 m potentially leads to new
advances in the ﬁeld of land cover mapping from remotely sensed data. One obvious
usage of such detailed imagery is in urban land cover mapping. However, when
examining multi-spectral urban IKONOS MSS imagery, it is clear that a large
amount of class mixing still occurs. This indicates that a traditional ‘hard’ classiﬁca-
tion is not appropriate for accurate mapping of urban scenes from such imagery.
Therefore, application of a super-resolution algorithm may demonstrate that the 4 m
spatial resolution of IKONOS MSS imagery does not represent a limit to the spatial
detail obtainable in classiﬁcation of such data (Tatem et al. 2001a).

1.3. Imagery cost

Land cover mapping studies undertaken by large companies or developed world
governments often have suﬃcient funds to purchase imagery of the spatial resolution
that matches the features of interest. Despite the recent explosion in numbers of
Earth observation satellites, the majority of imagery still comes at a substantial cost,
and the imagery that does not is often of coarse spatial resolution e.g. NOAA
AVHRR, MODIS. This represents a signiﬁcant barrier to developing countries and
other cash-strapped organisations in terms of the accuracy of land cover studies
available. An approach enabling the production of high spatial resolution land cover
maps from cheaply-available coarse spatial resolution imagery could help remove
this barrier.

In the modern world, increasing emphasis is being put on the monitoring of
agricultural practices, yields and land cover. This is especially true within the
European Union, where ﬁeld size varies greatly and subsidies depend upon crop
types, yields and amount of land owned. Increasingly, farmers, consultants and
governments are using moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery, in combination
with other external information, within a GIS for monitoring of these features.
However, as described previously, the use of such satellite sensors in combination
with GIS processing tools, such as hard classiﬁcation, can result in information loss,
uncertainty and inaccurate cover maps. This paper, therefore, attempts the ﬁrst
application to real Landsat TM agriculture imagery of a super-resolution land cover
mapping technique, previously applied successfully to simulated imagery. Super-
resolution land cover mapping has been attempted in very few previous papers and
very rarely has a developed approach been applied to real satellite imagery. A full
review of recent super-resolution work is given in Tatem et al. (2002a).

We describe an approach that uses the output from a soft classiﬁcation to
constrain a Hopﬁeld neural network, formulated as an energy minimisation tool.
The technique aims to predict the spatial distribution of land cover within each pixel.
By utilizing information contained in surrounding pixels, the land cover within each
pixel is mapped using a simple spatial clustering function coded into a Hopﬁeld
neural network. The approach was introduced by Tatem et al. (2001b) for super-
resolution target identiﬁcation, and extended to cope with multiple land cover classes

and sub-pixel scale features in Tatem et al. (2002b and 2002c). Whereas such work
showed how accurate maps of ﬁner spatial resolution than the input imagery could
be produced for use in a GIS, the technique was solely applied to synthetic and
simulated remotely sensed imagery. This work demonstrated the potential of such
an approach within the ﬁeld of land cover mapping and GIS, but unless its application
can be successfully shown when applied to real satellite sensor imagery with its
inherent error and uncertainty (Lewis et al. 2000), it remains obsolete. Consequently,
this paper aims to demonstrate the applicability of the Hopﬁeld neural network
super-resolution technique to real Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. This repres-
ents a unique and signiﬁcantly more complex task for a super-resolution algorithm
than has been undertaken elsewhere. For the ﬁrst time this enables assessment of a
super-resolution algorithm and, in particular, the Hopﬁeld neural network to cope
with uncertainty in the form of:

(i ) Uncertainty in image representation (e.g. point spread function, atmospheric

eﬀects, noise, geometric eﬀects)

(ii ) Uncertainty of classiﬁcation (e.g. spectral confusion, class choices, classiﬁer

(iii ) Uncertainty in veriﬁcation data (e.g. registration error, class identiﬁcation,

choice, classiﬁer error)

generalisation)

Section 2 provides details of the imagery and two study areas used in this paper.
Section 3 describes the methodology, including a brief description of Hopﬁeld neural
networks and the design of the super-resolution approach. The hard classiﬁer used
to provide a comparison map is then described, followed by the soft classiﬁcation
algorithm used to produce the class proportions for super-resolution input. Finally,
accuracy assessment statistics are outlined, along with speciﬁc Hopﬁeld neural net-
work settings to deal with the inherent uncertainty in the imagery. Section 4 describes
the results produced, and discussion and conclusions are provided in Sections 5
and 6, respectively.

2. Data

Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and corresponding validation data
were acquired from two agricultural areas. Both the satellite sensor imagery and
validation data were acquired as part of the European Union ‘Fuzzy Land
Information for Environmental Remote Sensing’ (FLIERS) project (contract number:
ENV4-CT96). The techniques used to obtain and process these data are described
in the FLIERS ﬁnal report (Fisher 2000).

2.1. Sindos, Greece (small-scale agriculture)

The area under study in Greece consists of many small regular ﬁelds of between
0.009 km2 and 0.07 km2 in area. An area of 2.04 km by 2.13 km was selected, and in
August 1997, TM imagery was acquired in seven wavebands, six with a spatial
resolution of 30 m, and one in the thermal-infrared band with a spatial resolution of
120 m. Figure 2 shows band 3 (0.63–0.69 mm) of the imagery. To provide coincident
validation data, a ﬁeld survey was conducted in August 1997. This ﬁeld survey was
used with farm records to identify land covers within a digitised cadastral map, and
subsequently, to produce a validation map, shown in ﬁgure 3. A detailed description
of the validation data production process is provided in Fisher (2000). By degrading
these validation data to the spatial resolution of Landsat TM imagery, target class

proportions were produced for use in regression-based classiﬁcation models, and
these are shown in ﬁgure 4.

2.2. Stoughton, UK (large-scale agriculture)

The area of Stoughton is east of Leicester, UK, and consists mainly of agricultural
ﬁelds of between 0.1 km2 and 0.12 km2 in area. An area of 3 km by 2.73 km was
selected, and in 1998, Landsat TM imagery of 30 m spatial resolution was acquired
in six wavebands, and 120 m in the thermal-infrared band. Figure 5 shows band 4
(0.76–0.90 mm) of the imagery. To provide coincident validation data, a ﬁeld survey
was undertaken in June and July 1998, and semi-orthorectiﬁed digital aerial photo-
graphs were obtained. This photography was used with ﬁeld survey and farm records
to identify land cover types and produce a validation map, shown in ﬁgure 6. A
detailed description of the validation data production process is provided in Fisher
(2000). By degrading these validation data to the spatial resolution of Landsat TM
imagery, target class proportions were produced for use in regression-based classi-
ﬁcation models, and these are shown in ﬁgure 7. The large number of land cover
classes represents a complex classiﬁcation situation that could have been simpliﬁed
by the merging of certain similar classes. However, this was not undertaken, so as
to test fully the abilities of the Hopﬁeld neural network technique at dealing with
real satellite imagery.

3. Using the Hopﬁeld network for land cover mapping at the sub-pixel scale
3.1. Hopﬁeld neural networks

The Hopﬁeld neural network is a fully connected recurrent network. Like the
popular, feed-forward neural networks, each neuron is modelled using an input
function and (typically) a sigmoidal activation function (Cichocki and Unbehauen
1993). However, in the Hopﬁeld network, neuron inputs are the outputs of all other
neurons in the network. Thus, from a set of initial neuron activations, the state of
the network varies with time until convergence to a stable state, where neuron
activations stop varying with time. Weights and biases determine the activations at
this stable state. The Hopﬁeld network can therefore be used for energy minimization

problems, if the weights and biases are arranged such that they describe an energy
function, and the minimum of energy occurs at the stable state (Hopﬁeld and Tank
1985). An energy function can be deﬁned as a goal and several constraints. The

Hopﬁeld network will converge to a solution oﬀering a compromise between the
goal and constraints. Mapping the spatial distribution of class components within
each pixel is therefore formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem with an
optimal solution determined by the minimum of the energy function. A detailed
description of the workings of a Hopﬁeld neural network and its architecture for
sub-pixel mapping is provided in Tatem et al. (2001b).

3.2. Hopﬁeld network design for super-resolution land cover mapping

The architecture of the Hopﬁeld network represents an image of ﬁner spatial
resolution than the original satellite sensor image. In previous work on the use of
Hopﬁeld neural networks for optimization, the spatial relations between neurons are
considered irrelevant (Aiyer et al. 1990, Cote and Tatnall 1997). However, for this
paper, the nature of the problem and the proposed solution required the network
neurons in each layer to be considered as being arranged in a regular grid with
positioning within this grid being of signiﬁcance to the network design for this task.
In this paper, only a brief description of the Hopﬁeld neural network design for
multiple land cover class mapping is provided. For more detail, readers should refer
to Tatem et al. (2002b).

The h class proportion images were represented by h inter-connected layers in
the network, with each neuron of high output value within these layers corresponding
to a pixel
in the ﬁner spatial resolution map produced after the network has
converged. The zoom factor, z, determined the increase in spatial resolution from the
original satellite sensor image to the new ﬁne spatial resolution image. After conver-
gence to a stable state, the output values of all neurons were either 0 or 1, representing
a binary classiﬁcation of the land cover at the ﬁner spatial resolution. The speciﬁc
goals and constraints of the Hopﬁeld neural network energy function determined
the ﬁnal distribution of neuron output values.

Many real world problems can be formulated as the minimisation of an energy
function, and this was central to the design of a Hopﬁeld neural network formulated
as an optimisation tool. Tatem et al. (2002b) detailed the design of an energy function
capable of producing super-resolution maps from simulated satellite sensor imagery
containing any number of land cover classes. For this paper, the same design was
used to attempt super-resolution mapping from real Landsat TM agriculture imagery.
The energy function was constructed from a goal
function and two constraint
functions:

where C was a clustering function (the goal), P was a proportion-retaining constraint,

M was a multiple class constraint and k

The spatial clustering (goal) function, C, was based upon an assumption of spatial
dependence, i.e. values close together should be more alike than those further apart
(Matheron 1965). By focussing within this research on agricultural ﬁelds that all
exhibit spatial dependence to some degree, this assumption became particularly
relevant. In this case, the aim of the function was to make the output of a neuron
similar to that of its neighbouring neurons, thus providing a simple method of
increasing spatial dependence, to model this real world phenomenon. The proportion
constraint, P, aimed to retain the pixel class proportions output from the soft
classiﬁcation. This was achieved by adding in the constraint that for each land cover
class layer, h, the total output from each pixel should be equal to the predicted class

657

proportion for that pixel. The multiple class constraint, M, aimed to ensure that the
activations from each class layer ﬁtted together with no gaps or overlap between
land cover classes in the ﬁnal prediction map. This was achieved by ensuring that
the sum of the activations of each set of neurons with position (i, j ) equalled one.

3.3. Hard classiﬁcation

To evaluate the success of the Hopﬁeld neural network technique, a traditional
hard classiﬁcation of land cover was carried out for comparison. This involved
undertaking a maximum likelihood classiﬁcation of the imagery, as described in
Campbell (1996) and commonly available in many GIS packages. The validation
data were used to identify representative, homogeneous areas for training data.
Where possible, several individual training areas for each class were deﬁned, each
containing a total of at least 100 pixels (Campbell 1996). For the area of the
Stoughton imagery under study, several classes were made up entirely of sub-pixel
scale features, meaning that no training pixels could be obtained. In these cases,
training pixels from homogeneous areas of each class found elsewhere in the imagery
were used.

3.4. Soft classiﬁcation

In general, two diﬀerent types of soft classiﬁcation techniques exist. The most
commonly used methods estimate posterior probabilities of class membership using
statistical pattern recognition methods, and correlate these with area proportions.
However, as Lewis et al. (1999) state, posterior probabilities are measures of statistical
uncertainty, and there is no causal relationship with proportions of pixels containing
the class, despite their correlation. Thus, as a consequence, posterior probabilities
cannot represent optimum estimates of area (Manslow and Nixon 2002). The second
type of soft classiﬁcation technique estimates directly class area proportions using
regression models. Lewis et al. (1999) demonstrate that posterior probabilities do
not represent optimum area estimates, and direct area proportion models achieve
more accurate estimates of true land cover proportions.

A soft classiﬁcation of the Landsat TM imagery for both Sindos and Stoughton
was undertaken using a regression based soft k-nearest neighbour (knn) classiﬁer.
The knn classiﬁcation scheme assigns labels to unknown pixels according to the
labels of neighbouring training vectors in feature space (Schowengerdt 1997). The
majority label of the knn training pixels is chosen as the assigned label for the
unknown pixel. Selection from more than one point introduces a form of feature
space smoothing, allowing the classiﬁcation decision not to be aﬀected by noisy
outlier points. For sub-pixel area estimation, a kernel-based smoothing algorithm is
used to estimate the proportions in test data, then real (soft nearest neighbour) data.
The k number of neighbours modiﬁes the size of this kernel (Lewis and Brown 1998).
Each exemplar, corresponding to a single pixel, consists of an input vector of digital
counts (representing the spectral signal) and a target vector of class proportions.
The knn model then assigns an area proportion for class c to a new pixel by ﬁrstly
identifying the k exemplar input vectors having the k lowest Euclidean distances, D
,
i
from the new pixel’s input vector and secondly, by calculating a weighted average,
y

, of the nearest k exemplar class area proportions, such that:

where D
is the Euclidean distance from the ith exemplar to the new pixel’s input
is the area proportion of the ith exemplar in class c. When k=1 the
vector, and mi

outputs are simply the proportions of the nearest target exemplar. When k>1, the
knn model outputs, y={y
, represent a prediction of the expected (mean) values
of the target area proportions (Lewis and Brown 1998). If k exemplars have the
same spectral signal, then the outputs become

which is the average of the target exemplar proportions. If more than k exemplars
have the same spectral signal, then the algorithm selects only k of them from the
fewer than k
distribution and computes the average as equation (3) shows. If
exemplars have the same spectral signal, then the average is modiﬁed to include
contributions from the next nearest exemplars in such a way as to generate a smooth
prediction of the mixing proportions. Application of this area estimation model to
remotely sensed image classiﬁcation is shown in Lewis et al. (1999).

Research undertaken for the FLIERS project found the knn regression classiﬁer
to be a robust area estimation model with good generalisation abilities. In all cases,
the results from the knn model were found to be either comparable to or more
accurate than those produced by various linear and non-linear neural network
regression models.

The number of k nearest neighbours was determined by carrying out a classiﬁca-
tion of the Landsat TM imagery of both areas using k values of 2, 3, 4 and 5. The
resultant area proportion predictions were then compared to class proportions
derived from the validation data (ﬁgures 4 and 7), and accuracy statistics were
calculated. These were area error proportion, closeness and root mean square error.

3.5. Accuracy assessment

Four measures of accuracy were estimated to assess the diﬀerence between each
network prediction and the validation images. For detailed descriptions of each
statistic, readers should refer to Tatem et al. (2001b). The statistics used were:

(i ) Area Error Proportion (AEP)

A simple measure of agreement between a set of known class proportions
and a set of estimated proportions. This statistic informs about bias in the
prediction image.

(ii ) Correlation CoeYcient (CC)

The correlation coeﬃcient measures the amount of association between a
target and estimated set of proportions. This statistic informs about the
prediction variance.

(iii ) Closeness (S)

Foody (1996) suggests a measure related to the Euclidean distance between
the land cover proportions predicted by the classiﬁcation and those of the
reference data. This measures the separation of the two data sets, based on
the relative proportion of each class in the pixel

(iv) Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

The root mean square error (RMSE ) per class informs about the accuracy
of the prediction (bias and variance).

The uncertainty and error inherent within the data after soft classiﬁcation poten-
tially meant that a change from equally weighting the constraints, as used in Tatem
et al. (2002b), could increase the accuracy of the Hopﬁeld network prediction. The
eﬀects of the sensor point-spread function (PSF), noise, classiﬁer error and validation
data error, can result in over- or under-estimation, for each pixel, of the predicted
class area proportions output from the soft classiﬁcation. Distinguishing the sources
of this error and uncertainty, and quantifying them, is only possible in controlled
and limited situations (Schowengerdt 1996). Therefore, any possible approach to
reduce this uncertainty should be welcomed. Use of the constraint weightings of
=150, would lead to the Hopﬁeld neural network attempting to maintain

3.6.2. Other network settings

To undertake a thorough investigation and assessment of the super-resolution
mapping approach applied to Landsat TM imagery, the network was run using a
zoom factor of z=7 (shown to be the ideal trade-oﬀ between accuracy and computing
time by Tatem (2002)). The network was initialised using a proportion constrained
initialisation (Tatem et al. 2001b), and left to run for 10 000 iterations or until
convergence, whichever came ﬁrst.

4.1. Sindos

A soft knn classiﬁcation of the Sindos imagery was undertaken using k values of
2, 3, 4 and 5. The results of the accuracy assessment of each classiﬁcation are shown
in table 1, and indicate that k=3 produced the most accurate result, with the smallest
closeness and RMS error values shown. This classiﬁcation therefore provided the
input class area proportions to the Hopﬁeld neural network. Figure 8 shows the
resultant proportion images, and comparison with those proportion images derived
from the validation data in ﬁgure 4 suggests that the classiﬁcation process has
introduced error.

The knn-derived proportions shown in ﬁgure 8 were input to the Hopﬁeld neural
network. After 10 000 iterations of the network with a zoom factor of z=7 (approxi-

Soft classiﬁcation of the Stoughton imagery was undertaken using the knn area

smallest closeness and RMS error values shown. The classiﬁcation produced with

neural network. Figure 11 shows the resultant proportion images, and comparison

with the validation data-derived proportions in ﬁgure 7 suggests that the classiﬁcation
process has introduced a degree of error. The introduction of this error, combined
with the complexity of the Stoughton imagery, makes for a stern test of the Hopﬁeld
neural network technique and, consequently, results are expected to be inaccurate.
The class proportions derived from the knn classiﬁcation shown in ﬁgure 11 were
input to the Hopﬁeld neural network. After 10 000 iterations of the network with
z=7 (approximately 510 minutes running time on a P2-350 computer), a prediction
map, shown in ﬁgure 12, was produced with spatial resolution seven times ﬁner than
that of the input class proportions in ﬁgure 11. The new map shown in ﬁgure 12,
therefore, displays a spatial resolution of 4.3 m. Accuracy statistics for each class,
and the whole image, were calculated by comparing the map produced (ﬁgure 12)
to the validation data (ﬁgure 6). These are shown in table 6. In addition, ﬁgure 13
shows the map produced from maximum likelihood hard classiﬁcation (spatial
resolution of 30 m), with accuracy statistics shown in table 7. Also, the proportions
output from the knn classiﬁcation (ﬁgure 11) were compared to the validation data
(ﬁgure 6) using accuracy statistics, shown in table 8. This provided a benchmark to
assess the accuracy of the Hopﬁeld neural network in locating the class proportions
correctly compared to the original proportions.

5. Discussion
5.1. Sindos

Results produced for the Landsat TM imagery of Sindos suggest that the Hopﬁeld
neural network super-resolution technique provides greater mapping accuracy than
traditional approaches, in addition to producing ﬁner spatial resolution land cover
maps. Comparison with the soft classiﬁcation used to derive the Hopﬁeld neural
network prediction also provides evidence that the Hopﬁeld neural network is
correctly locating class proportions within pixels.

Figure 10 shows some of the problems commonly associated with traditional
supervised hard classiﬁcation. Although training pixels were chosen carefully to
represent homogeneous areas, using the validation data as a guide, a large number
of pixels were still mis-classiﬁed. The problem mainly lies in the assumption that
each pixel contains one ‘pure’ land cover class with a homogeneous reﬂectance across
it. This is, of course, a false assumption since, within every 30 m×30 m instantaneous
ﬁeld-of-view, either a mixture of classes will occur, or if the area does contain one
class, within-class variation may make it spectrally diﬀerent from the training data
for that class. The majority of mis-classiﬁcation within ﬁgure 10 occurred at the
boundaries between classes where large numbers of mixed pixels existed, demonstrat-
ing that between-ﬁeld variation is a larger factor in producing error than within-
ﬁeld variation. Because the Sindos scene is made up of a patchwork of small ﬁelds,
the majority of pixels in the imagery were boundary pixels, resulting in a large
overall RMS error of 0.24, and closeness of 0.57. Table 3 shows that the most accurate
predictions in the maximum likelihood classiﬁcation were for the larger classes (e.g.

Rice, Sugarbeet, Bare), with correlation coeﬃcients of greater than 0.5 due to these
classes having a larger number of ‘pure’ pixels compared to boundary pixels of mixed
composition.

Whereas ﬁgure 10 and table 3 highlight the problems of attempting to assign
each pixel to a single land cover class, particularly in imagery of a similar nature to
that of Sindos, table 8 shows that accounting for mixed pixels increases accuracy
greatly. The result of classifying the Landsat TM imagery using a soft knn regression
model, and comparing to the validation data, is an overall RMS error of 0.13, that
is a decrease of 0.11 compared to the hard classiﬁcation. The overall AEP value of
0.004 also shows how land cover class proportions have been predicted with increased
accuracy, compared to the maximum likelihood prediction of 0.042. Table 8 can now
be used as a benchmark to assess how eﬀectively the Hopﬁeld neural network
approach can actually map the class proportions within pixels.

Figure 9 shows the results of the Hopﬁeld neural network prediction. Visual
comparison with the validation map in ﬁgure 3, clearly suggests the Hopﬁeld neural
network approach produces more accurate results and the accuracy statistics in table
2 conﬁrm this. Comparison of table 4 with table 2 shows that the use of the Hopﬁeld
neural network technique provides an increase in mapping accuracy over the class
proportions used to initialise it. This indicates that the Hopﬁeld neural network is
actually locating the class proportions in the correct places within pixels. A compar-
ison of table 4 with the Hopﬁeld neural network prediction (table 2), shows that in
all classes except ‘unclassiﬁed’, the network provides a decrease in RMS error, and
overall, a decrease of 0.008. Although this is only a small increase in overall accuracy,

it should be noted that the soft class proportions assessed in table 4 can only be
viewed as 11 separate maps, whereas the Hopﬁeld neural network prediction provides
a single thematic map. This is more familiar, useful and acceptable for decision-
makers, GIS input, and industry as a whole. Traditional techniques of single thematic
map production from satellite sensor imagery involve hard classiﬁcation, and exam-
ination of ﬁgures 9 and 10 suggests that the Hopﬁeld neural network provides a
more accurate approach. Tables 2 and 3 conﬁrm this, as the network prediction
shows overall closeness and RMS error values of 0.015 and 0.123, respectively,
compared to 0.057 and 0.24 for the maximum likelihood result. In addition to this,
the AEP results conﬁrm how accurate class proportion estimates from the knn
classiﬁer have been maintained within the network prediction (0.0038 in table 2). In
contrast, by forcing each 30 m×30 m pixel to represent a single land cover class, the
hard classiﬁcation produced an overall AEP value of just 0.0418.

5.2. Stoughton

Results produced for the Landsat TM imagery of Stoughton suggest that the
Hopﬁeld neural network super-resolution technique produces increased mapping
accuracy over traditional approaches but, as expected, suﬀers from problems when
presented with complex data. Throughout the various classiﬁcation procedures it
was clear that the nature of the imagery provided a stern test of the capabilities of
the classiﬁers and Hopﬁeld neural network. Figure 7 shows that over half of the
land cover classes identiﬁed through ﬁeld survey and aerial photograph interpretation
consisted of partly or entirely sub-pixel scale features. Matters were complicated

further by the fact that many of these classes were located in close proximity to one
another (e.g. the Asphalt, Concrete and Tall Herb classes), producing many pixels
at ﬁeld borders representing mixtures of up to six classes. For certain purposes it
may have been sensible to merge some classes to simplify the image processing task,
but as this paper focuses on an exploration of the capabilities of the Hopﬁeld neural
network approach, it was decided to leave the situation unchanged.

Figure 13 shows how the hard classiﬁcation map appears to accurately map the
relatively ‘pure’ pixels in the large ﬁelds, but suﬀers at ﬁeld boundaries. This is an
expected result as, for example, when attempting to assign a pixel containing a
mixture of six diﬀerent land cover classes to a single class, error will inevitably occur.
This mapping error is reﬂected in the accuracy statistics in table 7. The ﬁrst point
to note is that nine of the classes made up of mainly sub-pixel scale features have
not been identiﬁed in the maximum likelihood classiﬁcation. This is due to the fact
that within the Stoughton imagery under study, none of the features from these
classes covered a large enough area of a pixel to warrant assigning a whole pixel.
Elsewhere in ﬁgure 13 the maximum likelihood classiﬁer mapped the larger classes
more precisely, with correlation coeﬃcients of above 0.6 for the Maize and Re-seeded
Grass classes. However, the complex nature of the imagery meant that the majority
of pixels represented a mixed response. As described in Section 5.1 for the Sindos
image, this is not ideal for obtaining accurate maps via hard classiﬁcation, producing
high overall closeness and RMS error values of 0.039 and 0.198, respectively, for the
hard classiﬁcation of the Stoughton imagery.

Whereas ﬁgure 13 and table 7 highlight the problems of attempting to assign
mixed pixels to a single land cover class, table 8 shows again that accounting for
mixed pixels produces an increase in classiﬁcation accuracy. By classifying the same
Landsat TM image of Stoughton using a soft knn classiﬁer, an overall decrease in
RMS error of 0.105 compared to the hard classiﬁcation was produced. Table 8 shows
that the knn classiﬁer mapped precisely the larger classes with a correlation coeﬃcient
of over 0.8 in most cases. Also, whereas the maximum likelihood classiﬁer failed to
identify the classes made up of sub-pixel features, the knn classiﬁer identiﬁed them.
In the case of these sub-pixel classes, the high precision measures should not be
looked upon too seriously, as table 8 represents the results of a comparison of soft
class proportions with the hard validation map shown in ﬁgure 6. The function of
the Hopﬁeld neural network technique is to process these proportions to predict
their locations within each pixel, thereby increasing mapping accuracy.

Figure 12 shows the results of the Hopﬁeld neural network prediction. Visual
comparison, as with the Sindos results, appears to show the ﬁelds being mapped
accurately, with lower accuracy for the classes at the ﬁeld boundaries, and this is
conﬁrmed by the accuracy statistics in table 6. Comparison of the overall image
statistics of table 8 with table 6 shows that the Hopﬁeld neural network prediction
has produced lower accuracy predictions than the soft class proportions that were
processed. Examination of the per-class statistics shows that for the large ﬁeld classes,
the Hopﬁeld neural network approach has produced an increase in mapping accuracy
over the class area proportions. This shows that for these classes, the network has
accurately predicted where, within each pixel, the classes are located. However, for
those classes with sub-pixel dimensions, the network was not accurate, which is
understandable due to the nature of the goal functions. As described in Section 3.2,
the goal functions rely on utilising information from surrounding pixels to infer the
location of class proportions at the ﬁner spatial resolution and maximise spatial

dependence. The classes made up of sub-pixel scale features in the Stoughton imagery
have no such information available, leaving the Hopﬁeld neural network to cluster
the proportions in the centre of each pixel, a kind of ‘blind guess’, which has been
shown to be inaccurate. A merging of such sub-pixel classes would have produced
a much more manageable problem with features mostly larger than the size of a
pixel. This should have meant the network would then have produced a map of
increased accuracy over the soft proportions, but as described before, this section
was aimed at testing the network’s capabilities as a GIS tool. As it is, a single
thematic map has been produced of very similar accuracy levels to the class area
proportions it was derived from. Such thematic maps, as described previously, are
more acceptable and familiar to those in the world of decision-making and GIS.

Finally, comparison of the Hopﬁeld neural network prediction map in ﬁgure 12
with the hard classiﬁcation in ﬁgure 13 shows that, despite suﬀering from problems
due to the complex class make-up of the area, the network has produced a more
accurate map. By comparing table 6 with table 7, the statistics show a large increase
in accuracy for all classes, in addition to the overall ﬁgures. The AEP results also
conﬁrm how the accurate knn-derived area proportion estimates have been main-
tained through the network processing, with an overall value of 0.0037. This compares
favourably to the same statistics for the hard classiﬁcation where forcing each
30×30 m pixel to represent a single land cover class resulted in a value of just 0.0181.

6. Conclusions

The research described in this paper has shown that a Hopﬁeld neural network
can be used to predict the location of class proportions within each pixel, to produce
a sub-pixel scale map of land cover in agricultural areas. The Hopﬁeld neural
network presented here represents a novel, robust and simple technique, and this
paper has, for the ﬁrst time, demonstrated that the approach can be adapted and
applied to produce accurate super-resolution land cover maps from operational
satellite sensor imagery. Results from Landsat TM remotely sensed data show
accurate prediction, suggesting that the spatial resolution of satellite sensor imagery
need not necessarily represent a limit to the spatial detail obtainable within land
cover maps derived from such imagery.

The technique proposed here has the potential to be used as a GIS land cover
mapping tool on imagery that has been derived from any remote sensing system. In
addition, it should not be considered applicable exclusively in the ﬁeld of land cover
mapping. The technique has potential application in any area of GIS research where
observations or measurements are spatially aggregated. Examples of GIS research
ﬁelds where the Hopﬁeld neural network could be applied are:

$ Increasing the spatial resolution of radar, or lidar imagery for target mapping

and change detection.

$ Increasing the accuracy of area rainfall estimates
$ Dis-aggregation of spatially aggregated sociological data, for example, health

or crime statistics within enumeration districts or wards.

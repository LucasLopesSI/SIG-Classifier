The  Greater  Toronto  Area  is  the  most  vital  economic  centre  in  Canada  and  has  experienced  rapid 
urban expansion in the past 40 years. This research uses Landsat images to detect the spatial and temporal
dynamics of urban expansion in the Greater Toronto Area from 1974 to 2014. We quantitatively analyzed
the  extent  of  urban  expansion  and  spatial  patterns  of  growth  from  classified  Landsat  images.  We  then 
integrated our expansion findings with population data to observe the relationships between urban growth
and population. We found that the Greater Toronto Area had significant growth of 1115 km2, expanding
mainly  in  radiated  and  ribbon  expansion  modes.  There  was  substantial  correlation  between  urban 
extent and population in the period of study. These results demonstrate the efficacy of combining statistical
population data with remote sensing imagery for the analysis of urban expansion.

La région du Grand Toronto est le centre économique le plus important au Canada et a connu une
expansion urbaine accélérée au cours des 40 dernières années. Cette recherche utilise des images Landsat
pour détecter les dynamiques spatiale et temporelle de l’expansion urbaine de la région du Grand Toronto
entre  1974  et  2014.  Nous  avons  analysé,  sur  le  plan  quantitatif,  l’expansion  urbaine  et  les  tendances 
spatiales de croissance à partir des images Landsat classifiées. Ensuite, nous avons intégré nos résultats
aux données de population afin d’observer les liens entre la croissance urbaine et la population. Nous avons
déterminé que la région du Grand Toronto avait connu une importante croissance de 1 115 km2 de même
qu’une  expansion  principalement  dans  les  modes  en  rayonnement  et  en  ruban.  Il  y  a  eu  une  importante 
corrélation entre l’étendue urbaine et la population pendant la période étudiée. Ces résultats démontrent à
quel point il est efficace de combiner les données statistiques de population et les images de télédétection
pour analyser l’expansion urbaine.

1. Introduction

Yuan et al

Urbanization represents the absorption of less
developed  areas,  such  as  agricultural  and  forest
land,  by  built-up  areas,  such  as  residential  and 
commercial  land.  Some  researchers  suggest  that
urban  expansion  is  an  indicator  of  a  region’s 
economic vitality [
. 2005]. Urban expan-
sion  is  typically  a  product  of  the  development  of
suburban areas into high-density built-up areas and
the  replacement  of  rural  areas  with  low-density
built-up  areas.  Urban  expansion  not  only  affects 
the  economics  in  the  region,  but  also  influences
ecosystem  balances,  as  reflected  in  changes  in
water  quality  and  receding  agricultural  and  forest
areas  [
2002]. As  a  result,  studies  of  urban
expansion are quite important for local or regional
planners, as well as policy makers in helping them
                                                                                              dx.doi.org/10.5623/cig2015-203

Decision-makers  require  the  latest  geographi-
cal information  on  urban  sprawl  patterns  in  both 
quantitative  and  qualitative  ways;  therefore,  it  is
important to keep geospatial information of urban
expansion  up  to  date.  In  recent  years,  remotely-
sensed  images  have  become  a  great  data  source 
for urban expansion research. There are an increas-
ing  number  of  studies  that  focus  on  using  remote
sensing  technology  to  monitor  urban  dynamic
changes.  Some  studies  have  shown  that  remote
sensing  can  provide  an  accurate  measure  of  land
use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  changes,  which  are

able  to  represent  urban  expansion,  especially  at
medium  scales  [
2012;
Bagan and Yamagata
2012]. Compared to traditional
LULC monitoring methods, such as field surveys,
remote  sensing  offers  a  more  efficient,  cost
-effective,  and  less  labor-intensive  technique  in
detecting LULC changes. Mapping LULC changes
at various spatial and temporal scales is facilitated
Elvidge  et  al
using  remote  sensing  techniques  [
.
2004]. For instance, at small scales, the Moderate
Imaging  Spectroradiometer  (MODIS)  sensors  can
provide daily image products at 250 m and 500 m
spatial  resolution,  and  the  Advanced  Very  High
Resolution  Radiometer  (AVHRR)  sensors  can 
supply  1.1  km  resolution  images  every  12  hours.
Since  the  first  Landsat  satellite  was  launched  in
1972  (initially  as  ERTS-1),  the  Landsat  series  of
satellites  have  been  collecting  multi-spectral  data 
at  80  m  (1972–1982)  and  30  m  (1982–present) 
spatial  resolution  and  at  16  or  18  days  temporal
resolution. Since they are easily accessible through
the  United  States  Geological  Survey  (USGS)
Landsat  Data  Archive,  and  have  relatively  high
spatial resolution and long historical data archive,
Landsat images have been commonly used to detect
Manandhar et al
LULC changes at different scales [
.
2009].  Images  of  Landsat  Multispectral  Scanner
(MSS), Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-7
Enhanced  Thematic  Mapper  Plus  (ETM+),  and
Landsat-8  Operational  Land  Imager  (OLI),  were
used  in  this  study  for  collecting  LULC  change
information for the study area.

Singh

Change detection is “the process of identifying
differences in the state of an object or phenomenon
by  observing  it  at  different  times”  [
1989].
Change  detection  methods  that  have  been  used 
for  analyzing  dynamic  LULC  changes  include
Principal  Component  Analysis,  Write  Function
Singh 
Memory,  and  Change  Vector  Analysis  [
1989].  All  these  methods  can  be  classified  into 
pre-classification and post-classification techniques
Yuan  et  al
[
.  1998],  wherein  the  pre-classification
methods produce change/non-change maps. Although
they  are  effective  at  documenting  overall  change,
they  cannot  demonstrate  the  nature  of  the  infor-
mation change [
1989]. The post-classification
algorithm  requires  the  user  to  classify  images
before  generating  the  “from-to”  change  maps.
Although  the  accuracy  of  post-classification
change  detection  methods  rely  heavily  on  the 
accuracy  of  classification  results,  thematic  maps
and  valuable  “from-to”  change  maps  can  be 
generated  by  the  whole  procedure  of  the  post-
2014]. As a result, many

In this study, the post-classification comparison
change detection approach was used, necessitating
the  selection  of  an  appropriate  classification 
algorithm.  Since  unsupervised  classifiers  need  a
large amount of work during the post-classification
period,  various  supervised  classification  methods
have  been  developed,  such  as  Minimum  Distance
Wacker and Landgrebe
1972], Maximum Likelihood
[
2010],  and  Artificial
(MLC)  [
Erbek  et al
Neural  Network  (ANN)  [
. 2004]. 
Compared  with  traditional  statistical  classifiers
(e.g.  MLC),  the  Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM) 
classifier  is  a  different  type  of  classification 
algorithm. SVM is a method based on the statistical
learning theory and the structural risk minimization
method  and  has  had  an  excellent  track  record  of
Huang  et  al
.
image  classification  [
2002; 
2011].  Based  on  the  previous  studies,
the  SVM,  MLC,  and  ANN  classifiers  were 
tested,  and  their  relative  performances  were 
evaluated.

Satellite-based  LULC  changes  in  the  Greater
Toronto  Area  (GTA)  have  been  the  focus  of 
Martin and
several  previous  studies.  For  example, 
Howarth

[1989]  used  SPOT  multispectral  imagery
to  detect  the  landscape’s  change  in  the  City  of
Scarborough, a small part of the GTA. An object-
oriented  classification  of  IKONOS  images  of  the
City of Mississauga within the GTA, was reported

Lackner  and  Conway

[2013]  compared  classification  results
from  Earth  Observing-1  Hyperion  hyperspectral
data with Landsat and SPOT data through iterative 
self-organizing  data  analysis.  Although  they 
validated  the  relative  information  content  of  each
of the satellite data sources, they only used one year
for  classifying  the  land  use,  thereby  limiting  their
ability  to  provide  a  dynamic  change  analysis  of 
the study area. 
[2008] used Landsat and
RADARSAT  images  to  monitor  urban  changes  in
Li and
the GTA between 1988 and 2002. Similarly, 
Zhao

tion  study  using  Landsat  TM  images,  which  only
focused  on  the  City  of  Mississauga.  Though  they
were able to successfully show changes, their study

urban  sprawl. 
[2007]  used
the  Normalized  Difference  Vegetation  Index
(NDVI)  to  detect  the  urban  land  cover  variation
through  Landsat  images  in  the  GTA  with  an  over
90% overall classification accuracy. However, only
two  or  three  images  were  used  to  represent  the
urban expansion trend of decades. Overall, most of
these studies used few images and only one classi-
fication  algorithm  to  carry  out  an  assessment  of
long period dynamic change that did not cover the
entire GTA.

This  research  expands  on  these  studies  by
examining  the  dynamic  changes  in  the  processes 
of urban expansion of the GTA over a period of 40
years.  We  applied  multiple  classification  methods
and  evaluated  LULC  changes  of  bi-temporally 
(i.e.  between  years)  and  multi-temporally  (i.e.
across  all  years)  from  Landsat  data  sets  at  5-year
intervals from 1974 to 2014. Our study focused on
the quantitative and qualitative analysis of regional
urban  expansion.  Another  objective  of  the  study
was  to  analyze  the  relationship  between  popu-
lation  and  urban  expansion.  Population  as  one  of
the  driving  factors  for  urban  expansion  analysis 
has  been  playing  an  important  role  of  urban 
development monitoring. 
[2010] pointed
out that population growth would lead to increased
demand  by  urban  residents  on  land  resources  and
urban space such as residence ad traffic and public
facilities. 
[2010]  used  fine  spatial
resolution  images  for  population  estimation  in
small  areas  and  proposed  that  population  estima-
tion  using  remotely-sensed  images  is  receiving
more attention. Thus, we examine the relationship
between  population  and  urban  expansion  over 
the last 40 years.

2. Study Area and Data

2.1 Study Area

Statistics  Canada

The  study  area  (see  Figure  1)  is  located  in
Southern  Ontario,  Canada,  including  the  City  of
Toronto, and Regions of Durham, Halton, Peel, and
2011].  This  area  covers 
York  [
7752  km2,  and  is  located  between  Lake  Ontario 
and  Georgian  Bay  of  Lake  Huron.  The  GTA  is 
the economic centre of Canada and is an important
metropolitan  area  for  foreign  investment,  trade
flows, and a hub for exchanges of culture, religion,

and technology. It is also the biggest city in Canada
due  to  a  large  net  migration  involving  immigra-
tion,  non-permanent  residents,  interprovincial  and
intra-provincial  migration  that  has  occurred  over
the  past  several  decades. This  study  area  includes 
various types of land cover types: lakes and rivers,
high  and  low  density  urban  areas,  and  rural  area 
(agriculture  land,  forest  landscapes,  grassland).
According  to 
[1976;  2011],  the
population  of  the  GTA  in  2011  was  6  054 191,  a
90% increase from 1976.

2.1 Data Description

Images from the Landsat-1 and -2 Multispectral
Scanner (MSS), Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM),
Landsat-7  Enhanced  Thematic  Mapper  Plus
(ETM+),  and  Landsat-8  Operational  Land  Imager
(OLI)  were  the  main  data  sets  used  in  this  study
(Table  1).  All  these  images  were  acquired  from 
the  Landsat  Data  Archive  held  by  the  USGS, 
and  most  were  cloud  free.  We  obtained  these
images  in  level-one  product  format.  In  order  to
obtain  high-quality  results  of  analysis,  most  of
these  data  were  acquired  in  the  summer  season
from June to September. All images were projected 
in  the  World  Geodetic  System  of  1984  (WGS84)
and  Universal  Transverse  Mercator  (UTM) 
coordinates.  Image  pre-processing  was  performed
using  the  software  Environment  for  Visualizing
Images  (ENVI)  version 4.8,  PCI  Geomatica  2013,
and  ArcMap  version  10.1. During  the  image 
pre-processing, layer stacking for each image was
performed  first,  followed  by  overlapping  images
registration.  The  PCI  Geomatica ATCOR  module
was  used  to  carry  out  atmospheric  correction  for
each  image,  based  on  unique  features  of  data 
acquisition,  including  date  and  time,  sensor  type,
coordinates  of  the  image  centre,  atmospheric 
definition area, and atmospheric condition. Finally,
images  from  each  year  were  mosaicked  by  geo-
referenced  based  mosaicking  tool  in  ENVI,  with
colour  balance  using  and  clipped  to  the  bounds 
of the study area. The GTA boundary and region’s

expansion. A set of full-colour 10–20 cm resolution
digital  orthoimages  in  2009  were  acquired  from 
the Geospatial Centre, University of Waterloo as a
reference map for accuracy assessment in 2009.

3. Methods

The analysis methods can be divided into three
parts:  image  classification,  change  detection  and
analysis, and urban expansion analysis as shown in
Figure  2.  All  image  processing  was  performed
using ENVI 4.8 and ArcMap 10.1.

3.1. Image Classification

Selecting  an  appropriate  algorithm  to  classify
the  imagery  during  the  initial  stages  of  this 
analysis  was  vital,  as  the  quality  of  the  classified
images directly  impacted  the  performance  of  the
change  detection.  To  generate  consistent  classi-
fication  results,  an  appropriate  classification
method  was  determined  first.  In  this  paper,  the
supervised  MLC,  SVM,  and  ANN  algorithms 
were applied to the 2009 mosaic. Training samples
were  selected  for  the  six  Level-2  classes  in  the 
classification  scheme  listed  in  Table  2.  A  false

Table 2: Image classification categories.

colour combination (near infrared band as red, red
band  as  green,  and  green  band  as  blue)  of  the
reflective spectral band dataset for 2009 was used
to  choose  training  samples  for  those  three  class-
ification  algorithms.  A  Jeffries-Matusita  (JM) 
distance  report  was  automatically  generated  to
illustrate  the  spectral  separability  of  the  training
samples. JM distance is a separability function that
detects  the  average  distance  between  a  pair  of
classes  that  directly  relates  to  the  probability  of
how  accurate  a  resultant  classification  will  be
Schmidt  and  Skidmore
2003].  Values  range  from 
[
0  to  2,  and  the  value  is  asymptotic  to  2,  meaning
that the training samples selected are more separa-
ble.  After  applying  classification  algorithms,  a 
3 x 3 majority filter was applied in order to remove
the  salt-and-pepper  noise,  as  a  larger  size  filter
would decrease the accuracy of the final results.

After  classification,  a  statistical  accuracy
assessment  was  built  to  assess  the  accuracy  of 
classification maps. In order to reduce the cost and
time,  and  to  ensure  it  is  large  enough  to  generate 
an appropriate error matrix, a general guideline to
collect  sample  size  is  a  minimum  of  50  samples 
Congalton  and  Green
1999].  Based 
for  each  class  [
on the 2009 orthoimagery, 600 pixels (100 samples
for each Level-2 category) were randomly selected

were manually validated against the orthoimagery.
The  overall  accuracy,  the  user’s  accuracy  (the 
probability  that  a  classified  pixel  is  really  in  that
category) and the producer’s accuracy (the proba-
bility an area is correctly classified) were calculat-
1991]. An
ed  through  the  error  matrix  [

Kappa coefficient, was also calculated. The Kappa
coefficient  provides  a  better  interclass  discrimi-
nation  than  the  overall  accuracy  statistic  alone

[

Congalton

1994]. 

3.2 Change Detection

In  the  change  detection  analysis  process,  the
post-classification  comparison  change  detection
method  was  applied  to  detect  land  use  and  land
cover  changes.  Post-classification  comparison 
separately  classifies  multi-temporal  images  into
thematic maps, and then implements a comparison
of  the  classified  images  on  a  per-pixel  basis 
Alphan  et  al
.  2009].  This  approach  can  produce
[
change maps that show a complete matrix of changes
by  properly  coding  the  classification  results  of 
two  dates.  Before  applying  the  change  detection,
the  LULC  classes  were  combined  into  Level-1 
categories  (as  shown  in  Table  2):  the  urban  area 
and  the  non-urban  area,  since  we  only  wanted  to
examine  which  area  was  developed  into  urban 
area  (the  built-up  area),  and  this  step  can  help
decrease  the  impact  of  classification  errors. 
Bi-temporal and multi-temporal change maps were

generated  to  analyze  the  spatial  patterns  of  the
urban expansion.

3.3 Statistical Urban Expansion
Analysis

Both  the  rate  and  spatial  structure  of  urban
Bagan  and  Yamagata

expansion  vary  across  time  [
2012].  We  calculated  the  rate  of  urban  expansion
using  the  Land  Use  Change  Index  (LUCI),  as
shown  in  equation  (1)  [
2012].  This 
has  been  shown  to  be  a  significant  index  for 
Bagan  and  Yamagata
assessing  urban  expansion  [
2012].

where  Ua  and  Ub  indicate  the  area  of  a  land  use
class  at  Time  a  and  Time  b,  respectively. 
T indicates the time period from Time a to Time b.
If  T’s  unit  is  in  years,  then  LUCI  will  be  the
annual  rate  of  change  in  the  area  for  this  class. 
In  our  case,  the  LULC  class  was  the  overall 
urban  class.  At  the  same  time,  we  carried  out  a
Pearson correlation coefficient analysis to analyze
the  correlations  between  the  urban  areas  and  the
population. 

4. Results and Discussion

4.1 Classification Accuracy

An error matrix was built to assess the accura-
cy  of  the  classification  results  before  choosing  an
appropriate  classifier  across  all  time  periods.  As
shown in Table 3, the overall accuracy of the SVM
classifier  was  92.63%,  and  the  Kappa  coefficient
was  0.90.  In  comparison,  the  MLC  algorithm 
had an overall accuracy of 85.34%, with a Kappa
coefficient  of  0.83,  and  the  ANN  algorithm  had 
an  overall  accuracy  of  91.48%,  with  a  Kappa 
coefficient  of  0.89.  Both  the  MLC  algorithm  and
ANN  algorithm  were  inferior  compared  to  the
SVM.  The  user’s  and  producer’s  accuracies  of
commercial  areas  and  barren  cropland  in  SVM
were  much  better  than  the  results  from  the ANN
and  MLC.  Therefore,  we  proceeded  to  classify

SVM  classifier.  During  the  classification  process,
we  combined  the  Level  2  categories  together  into
either urban area or non-urban areas. This process
reduced misclassification.

4.2 Map Changes and Analysis

By  counting  the  number  of  pixels  of  each
image,  the  bi-temporal  change  detection  results
indicated  an  increase  in  the  GTA’s  urban  area  of
1115 km2 (from 1122 km2 in 1974 to 2237 km2 in
2014,  as  shown  in  Figure  3).  By  extracting  and
overlaying  the  urban  area  of  the  multitemporal
classification  results,  the  urban  expansion  map 
was  compiled,  including  10-year  intervals  from
1974 to 2014 (Figure 4). Based on Figures 3 and 4,

some important spatial patterns could be observed.
The  spatial  urban  expansion  in  the  GTA  mainly 
followed  two  types:  radiated  expansion  mode,
which  is  a  typical  tendency  of  urban  growth  that
from  urban  centres  to  adjoining  non-urban  areas 
by  a  series  of  concentric  circles  [
2008]; 
ribbon  expansion  mode,  which  is  a  combination

and only 4 bands were available for the classifica-
tion  process.  The  period  between  2004  and  2009
had a lower annual growth rate of 0.1%. This may
be due to two main factors: the low urban growth
rate  in  2004–2009  and  the  lower  classification
accuracy of the 2004 image. 

Stan

According  to 

[2010],  urban  expansion
can be caused by a variety of reasons such as pop-
ulation growth, economic growth, independence of
decision,  industrialisation  and  etc. As 
[2013]
pointed  out,  the  three  main  forces  that  result  in
urban expansion are “a growing population, rising
incomes,  and  falling  commuting  costs.”  Thus,
when  we  explored  deeper  into  the  population
changes during these 40 years, we discovered that
the  two  significant  periods  of  urban  growth  mir-
rored  the  population  growth  over  the  same  time.
The  mean  annual  population  growth  rate  over  the
40 years was 1.9%, however during the two 5 year
periods between 1986–1991 and 1996–2001, more
substantial  increases  were  observed  of  2.6%  and
2.0%  were  observed  respectively.  From  1976  to
2011,  the  annual  population  growth  rate  ranged
between 1.5% and 2.6%. The lowest annual popu-
lation  growth  rate  was  found  in  the  period  of 
1976–1981 at 1.5%. It is obvious that urban expan-
sion is typically delayed by a few years following a
large  increase  in  population,  as  the  city  requires
time  to  respond.  The  fluctuations  in  the  annual
growth rate of the urban area and the annual popu-
lation growth rate were relatively consistent. 

The GTA expanded outward from the City of
Toronto,  as  well  as  laterally  along  Lake  Ontario’s
lakeshore.  In  addition,  regional  centres  of  Peel,
Durham,  and York  also  expanded.  In  1974,  many 
of  the  regional  centres  within  the  GTA  existed  in
isolation, as shown in Figure 4, and the cities could
be  clearly  identified  individually.  From  1974  to
1991, regions around the City of Toronto witnessed
a  significant  growth  along  their  boundaries  with
Toronto.  In  the  1990’s,  the  regions  of  Peel, York,
and  Durham  developed  rapidly. All  these  regions
expanded  outward  from  their  regional  centres.
After 2004, York Region’s urban expansion began
to slow down, while the outside regions (Durham,
Peel  and  Halton)  had  a  considerable  growth  of 
urban  areas.  From  2009  to  2014,  the  largest 
expansion  occurred  in  the  southwest  part  of  the
GTA.  For  instance,  Brampton  expanded  northeast 
toward  the  City  of  Vaughan.  After  40  years  of
development,  some  smaller  urban  centres  had 
connected with each other, such as Richmond Hill
and  Markham.  Furthermore,  some  cities  located
along Lake Ontario, such as Burlington, Oakville,
and  Ajax,  experienced  significant  development.
Regions of Peel and Halton had the largest increase
in  urban  area  in  the  GTA.  Overall,  the  urban 
development in the GTA takes the form of outward
extension and expansion from these urban centres,
especially from the City of Toronto.

4.3 Statistical Analysis of Urban
Expansion and Population

To explore the long-term population and urban
growth  of  the  GTA,  we  calculated  the  urbanized
extent  for  each  5-year  period  from  our  classified
imagery  and  graphed  them  with  population  data
(Figure  5). As  seen  on  this  chart,  both  population
and  urban  areas  experienced  constant  growth  in 
this  time  period.  Correlation  analysis  shows  that
urban expansion is directly correlated to population
increase.  The  Pearson  correlation  coefficient  (r)
between  the  population  and  the  urban  area  was
0.979 (p<0.01), which identifies strong correlation
between  the  population  and  the  urban  area  in  the
GTA. 

The mean annual growth rate of the urban area
over  the  40  years  was  1.6%  (Table  4). There  was
significant  urban  expansion  during  two  periods.
The  periods  between  1984–1989  and  1999–2004
saw increases of 4.3% and 3.6% in annual growth
rate of the urban area, respectively. A slightly neg-
ative  trend  of  1.1%  in  1974–1979  may  have  been
the  result  of  misclassification,  as  these  images 
were acquired by Landsat-1 at 60 metres pixel size

2014.

5. Conclusion

In  this  paper,  dynamic  changes  of  the  urban
growth trend of the GTA were successfully detected
using  a  series  Landsat  images  acquired  over time.
The selection of an accurate classification process

was an important part of this study, as it determined
the reliability of the final change detection results.
In our tests, we found that the SVM classification
method performed better than the MLC and ANN
approaches. We  noted  that  urban  growth  occurred
mainly in a radiated expansion mode, in which the
city  expanded  outward  from  the  City  of  Toronto.
The  GTA  also  expanded  in  a  ribbon  expansion 
mode  along  Lake  Ontario.  Furthermore,  the  urban
expansion  was  strongly  correlated  to  increases  in
population.  There  are  some  limitations  in  this 
study.  Firstly,  because  images  were  acquired  from
different  sensors,  during  the  classification  period, 
a  different  number  of  bands  were  used.  Secondly,
the training samples and classification results were
only  validated  in  2009  due  to  lack  of  reference
images.

In conclusion, Landsat images can be used to
examine  the  LULC  changes  of  the  metropolitan
area  in  long  time  series.  The  extent  and  spatial 
patterns  of  the  GTA’s  urban  expansion  were  both
analyzed  quantitatively  and  qualitatively  in  the
study.  It  is  feasible  to  integrate  Landsat  imagery
and  census  data  to  study  urban  expansion  of 
metropolitan  areas  or  even  of  a  global  scale 
study  over  time.  Since  urban  development  policy
making  or  urban  planning  usually  need  modeling 
of  the  urban  growth  tendency,  knowing  the  urban 
historical development patterns and present devel-
oping  situation  are  meaningful.  Therefore,  these
results  can  be  used  for  the  regional  governments 
or  planners  to  make  decisions  regarding  GTA’s
development in the future.

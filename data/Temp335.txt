Abstract. The GIS literature abounds with strategies to guide the development
of a corporate GIS as a single project but lacks discussion on the long term
management of the GIS. This paper documents a recent study into GIS develop-
ment in a state department over an 18-year period. It applies the productional
perspective of GIS to model long term GIS development diagrammatically and
identi(cid:142) es (cid:142) ve patterns of GIS development. The outcomes reveal some long term
characteristics of a corporate GIS, based on which a three-stage approach is
developed to guide the long term development of an ideal corporate GIS.

Introduction
Managers are considered to be one of the key drivers in GIS development. Their
characteristics and their management activities are important factors in the successful
implementation of GIS in an organisation (Croswell 1989, Koller 1993, Engelken
1994 as quoted in Ferrari and Onsrud 1995 ). Successful GIS projects often require
a shared understanding or vision of how the GIS will be used (Huxhold and
Levinsohn 1995 ). Chan and Williamson (1996 ) further suggest that the visions held
by members of an organisation have to be aligned to the dominant GIS vision of
the organisation to drive the di(cid:128) usion of GIS successfully.

In addition to the e(cid:128) ort of managers, support from politicians, senior management
and sta(cid:128) are also considered important in the process (Croswell 1989, Azad and
Wiggins 1993, Budic 1994, Bundock 1996, Ventura et al. 1992 and DiSera 1993, both
as quoted in Ferrari and Onsrud 1995 ). Campbell and Masser (1992 ) refer to this
concerted support from managers and other members of an organisation as the
organisational commitment. They also highlight the problem of sustaining the com-
mitment for the whole life cycle of a GIS project, which could last from a few months
to a few years depending on the scale of the project.

If sustaining commitment within such a short time span is a problem, imagine
the problem faced by the managers who have to sustain the development of a
corporate GIS at the end of the GIS project. There is virtually no investigation into
this post-implementation aspect of the management of a corporate GIS in the
literature apart from some discussions on the strategic placement of the GIS project
in an organisation, and the routines of managing GIS personnel and operations
(Huxhold and Levinsohn 1995 ).

This paper addresses the long term management of a corporate GIS by drawing
on the results of a study of GIS development over an 18-year period in the

(DNRE) of

Department of Natural Resources and Environment
the State
Government of Victoria in Australia. The chronological development of DNRE’s
corporate GIS is modelled by the productional perspective of a corporate GIS (see
§2 below) (Chan and Williamson 1999 ) according to a set of pre-de(cid:142) ned rules. From
the resulting model, (cid:142) ve patterns of development are identi(cid:142) ed. These patterns are
then related to the nature of GIS visions, organisational commitment in terms of
support from senior, middle and junior (line) managers, and the extent of integration
of the GIS. Close examination of the model of DNRE’s corporate GIS and the
patterns of GIS development reveals some characteristics of a corporate GIS that
enables a set of long term GIS management strategies to be developed.

In this paper a corporate GIS refers to a collection of all GIS capabilities in an
organisation. Initially these capabilities may or may not be integrated, but ideally,
in a mature working corporate GIS, they should be fully integrated serving all users.

2. Field study of GIS development
2.1. Background

In their discussion on the identities of a GIS, Chan and Williamson (1999 )
develop a productional perspective that views a corporate GIS as an integral part of
the production process of an organisation. In such a corporate GIS, certain collec-
tions of GIS capabilities (GIS modules) have the function of directly generating the
products and/or services required of the organisation. These modules are called
business process GIS. The remaining GIS modules in the corporate GIS have a role
of supporting the development and functioning of the business process GIS and
are called infrastructure GIS. Both groups of GIS modules include the (cid:142) ve gen-
eric elements of GIS, that is, data, standards, people, information technology and
organisational setting (Chan and Williamson 1995 ).

Based on the productional perspective of GIS, Chan and Williamson (1999 )
developed a model to describe di(cid:128) usion of a corporate GIS. They also tested their
model by examining the development of DNRE’s GIS over an 18-year period from
1979–1997. Not being the sta(cid:128) of DNRE, the authors were able to examine the case
of DNRE objectively. The (cid:142) eld study itself was conducted from February to July,
1997. In the six months, 34 managers of DNRE, past and present, were interviewed
in 38 sessions. Some managers were identi(cid:142) ed beforehand but many were identi(cid:142) ed
in the course of the interviews. The study focused on the development of GIS
capabilities in DNRE in general and not the uptake of the technology by individuals.
DNRE is an end product of successive government restructuring in 1979– 1997
to amalgamate departments with responsibilities for related business functions into
larger, more cost-e(cid:128) ective departments. The very dynamic organisational setting,
experienced by DNRE and its precursor departments in the period, epitomises that
of many modern organisations deeply a(cid:128) ected by economic rationalism. Therefore
the (cid:142) eld study can help to shed light on the issues of sustaining the long term
development of corporate GIS in a typical dynamic organisational setting. This is
begun in the next section by documenting some key observations made in the study.

2.2. Modelling development of DNRE’s corporate GIS

Using the productional perspective of GIS it is possible to model the dynamics
of development of DNRE’s GIS in 1979– 1997 diagrammatically. This is achieved by
grouping the GIS capabilities developed by DNRE and its precursor departments
over the years into modules of infrastructure GIS and business process GIS. The

L ong term management of a corporate GIS

285

chronological order of these modules and their relationships in the development
process are modelled according to a set of pre-de(cid:142) ned rules described below. Figure 1
illustrates the outcome of the modelling exercise. It provides a high level view of the
evolving structures of the corporate GIS of DNRE and its precursor departments
in terms of the two types of GIS modules. It also reveals several patterns of GIS
that may have implications for the long term management of a corporate GIS.

2.3. T he rules for modelling

In (cid:142) gure 1 the thick black arrow at the x-axis indicates the direction of the
passage of time. Anything developed earlier is located to the left of those developed
later. White rectangular boxes mark the periods of existence and the temporal
relationships between DNRE and its precursor departments. These departments are
named in Italics. The key business functions of the departments or their business
units are shown in alternating light and dark grey bands and labelled in bold
in (cid:142) gure 1.

A clear horizontal and a clear vertical oval represent the basic modules of
infrastructure and business process GIS respectively. A vertical oval with dots in it
represents a set of specialised GIS products or services that an infrastructure GIS
provides to other GIS modules, infrastructure and/or business process. In case a
horizontal oval has one or more vertical ovals resting on it, this represents an
infrastructure GIS that supports one or more business process GIS. When a horizontal
oval originating from a vertical oval on its left, this indicates that a business process
GIS has acquired an additional role of an infrastructure GIS. A horizontal oval that
links end-to-end with others represents a signi(cid:142) cant change in the way the infra-
structure GIS concerned is managed. A hatched horizontal strip stands for a period
of no physical GIS development, which may be due to non-supportive managers or
the fact that GIS awareness is being cultivated in the organisation.

Only those business process GIS that are essential in demonstrating the structure
of the corporate GIS and the patterns of GIS development are included. Others
have been left out to simplify (cid:142) gure 1.

3. Patterns of GIS development

Examination of the evolving structure of the corporate GIS of DNRE and its
precursor departments in (cid:142) gure 1 reveals that the development of a corporate GIS
starts in individual business functions of an organisation. In the early stage, develop-
ment of GIS modules tends to be independent among business functions residing in
the same or di(cid:128) erent organisations. Over time, as the organisations amalgamate,
closer interactions among business functions lead to the development of links between
GIS modules in di(cid:128) erent business functions. This results in some integration in the
corporate GIS. In the process new business units are formed to manage and make
better use of the technology. The technology and the organisation are moulded to
match each other.

Closer examination of (cid:142) gure 1 also reveals (cid:142) ve patterns of GIS development,
namely, dormant, opportunistic, systematic , opportunistic-infrastructure and opportun-
istic-business process. Dormant indicates no physical GIS development. Opportunistic
indicates development of GIS modules that is ad hoc and uncoordinated, and
systematic , structured and well planned. A module of infrastructure GIS is developed

prior to the development of modules of business process GIS in the opportunistic-
infrastructure pattern, and vice versa in the opportunistic-business process pattern.
Each pattern is described in detail below with examples from DNRE.

3.1. T he dormant pattern

The dormant pattern is a pattern in which there is no obvious development of
GIS despite stakeholders’ awareness of the value of GIS. This is to be distinguished
from the normal gestation period in which GIS advocates prepare the organisation
for GIS introduction by educating the stakeholders about the value of GIS and
lobbying for their support.

A good example is the exceptionally long period that precedes GIS development
in the Parks and Reserves Branch of DNRE (the horizontal oval at the upper right
corner in (cid:142) gure 2). This period lasted for about ten years in the precursor organisation
of the National Parks Services (NPS) in the Department of Conservation, Forests
and Lands and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The period
is represented by a very long hatched horizontal strip that overlaps with a period
intense GIS development activities in other agencies in the same precursor
of
departments.

For many years since 1985 the Director of NPS had a vision of realising the
national parks objectives by investing in the physical improvement of parks and
their services, and was generally against investing in computer or information man-
agement systems. This became the dominant GIS vision (Chan and Williamson
1996 ) adopted by managers throughout the organisation. Despite the strong demand
for recreation plans and maps, NPS had resisted investing in GIS-based mapping
technology. Any GIS capabilities introduced by innovative members of sta(cid:128) had
limited impact on the overall business processes and were quickly forgotten when
the sta(cid:128) member moved on. It was not until 1995, after the appointment of a new
Director who was aware of the value of GIS, that NPS/Parks and Reserves Branch
started to consider investing in GIS seriously. For more than a decade, the old
Director’s vision sti(cid:143) ed any supportive GIS vision among the middle and junior
managers. As a result there was no grass-root leadership and GIS development was
delayed in NPS/the Parks and Research Branch.

3.2. T he opportunistic pattern

In the opportunistic pattern the managers concentrate on developing independent
modules of infrastructure GIS and/or business process GIS for their respective business
units. They are not concerned with the uptake of the technology elsewhere in the
organisation. This pattern is typically found in the early phase of GIS development
in an organisation or when senior management holds a laissez faire attitude towards
GIS development. If unchecked, this pattern would eventually create a corporate
GIS that is made up of islands of GIS technology.

A good example of the independent development of GIS capabilities in 1979–86
in the wildlife conservation and (cid:143) ora conservation programs in the Department of
Conservation. The middle and line managers in charge of the two conservation
programs recognised the need to develop a computer system to manage the distribu-
tion data of the plants and animals in Victoria. This resulted in two independent
modules of business process GIS (labelled as ‘Wildlife Atlas’ and ‘Simple GIS to
manage Floral Database’ respectively in (cid:142) gure 2). These business process GIS eventu-
ally developed into two modules of PC-based infrastructure GIS that supported

other GIS activities in the two conservation programs. After the amalgamation of
Department of Conservation and the Forests Commission into the Department of
Conservation, Forests and Lands, the managers continued to develop the GIS
modules independently of the corporate GIS unit.

3.3. T he systematic pattern

In the systematic pattern managers develop modules of infrastructure GIS and
business process GIS in a well-planned and integrated manner to serve a wider
community of users. To achieve the objective these managers are prepared to promote
the uptake of GIS elsewhere in the organisation outside their business units. This
pattern is typically found in an organisation where senior management recognises
the importance of GIS and is leading and supporting the process of GIS development.
One example involves an information technology (IT) manager of the Department
of Energy and Minerals ((cid:142) gure 3), another precursor department of DNRE. In
1983–1986 a series of studies and trial projects were conducted with limited success
to automate service delivery in the department. Based on these experiences the IT
manager advocated the development of an integrated department wide GIS called
the Geological Exploration and Development Information System (GEDIS) in 1986.
This system aimed at integrating data from di(cid:128) erent business functions in the
department to allow potential local and overseas investors easy access to mining
and exploration information.

As the system was seen as an integral part of the core business of the department
and matched the business vision of the chief executive o(cid:129) cer, it gained support from
managers at all levels and in all divisions of the department. The State Government
also provided (cid:142) nancial support to the system in 1987 because of the system’s value
in facilitating mining investment from overseas and interstate.

As a result, the IT manager hired a project manager and sta(cid:128) with computer
and GIS expertise, acquired GIS hardware and software, and drew data from di(cid:128) erent
divisions in the department. A module of infrastructure GIS (labelled as ‘GIS unit
in Department of Energy and Minerals— GEDIS’ in (cid:142) gure 3) was established simul-
taneously with the development of the (cid:142) rst module of business process GIS, namely,
the Tenement Management System, which was completed in 1990. By 1993, four
more integrated core modules of business process GIS were added to GEDIS as
planned.

As GEDIS was being developed, the department was restructured a number of
times. Each time, the middle and line managers were able to convince the new senior
management to support the project, keeping GEDIS as an integrated corporate GIS
of the department. In 1995 the department amalgamated with the Department of
Agriculture, another precursor department of DNRE. The new corporate GIS then
comprised the fully integrated GENAMAPâ based GEDIS, and the incompatible,
loosely integrated ARC/INFOâ
based GIS capabilities of the Department of
Agriculture. Rather than integrating the two systems using a set of arbitrarily chosen
standards, a working arrangement was made, in which the original GIS unit of the
Department of Agriculture looked after strategic development of GIS in the new
organisation while GEDIS provided general technical GIS support. The outcome
was a new corporate GIS that was no longer fully integrated.

3.4. T he opportunistic-inf rastructure pattern

In the opportunistic-infrastructure pattern managers, unlike those in the systematic
pattern, can only secure short term support from senior management to develop an

integrated GIS for the organisation. Long term support from senior management is
uncertain. However these managers are prepared to lobby for additional support
and resources from users both within and without the organisation to sustain the
development of the corporate GIS.

There is only one example of the opportunistic-infrastructure pattern in DNRE,
which involves the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (DCFL, centre
of (cid:142) gure 2). With the help of a group of middle and line managers in the Forests
Service Division in DCFL, the Director of Conservation who was a member of the
senior management team and a pioneer in GIS and remote sensing, convinced senior
management to create a module of infrastructure GIS (labelled as ‘Departmental
GIS Unit’) in 1985. The module, which would be located in the Conservation Division
and overseen by a special GIS steering committee, was initially sta(cid:128) ed by a GIS
manager employed in the same year.

The GIS manager had a vision of developing a department wide and state wide
GIS. The support of senior management only provided a set of basic GIS software
and hardware. There was no regular funding for the continual development of the
one-person infrastructure GIS. In order to get the funding required, the GIS manager
undertook to provide mapping products and services to the managers of the eighteen
regions of the department, secured two-years funding, and started recruiting computer
and application scientists. The module of infrastructure GIS in DCFL started to grow.
In 1986 the Director of Conservation retired. The infrastructure GIS was put
under the charge of a middle manager in the Forests Service Division. The forestry
manager, who recognised the value of digital data and had assisted the Director of
Conservation in the creation of the GIS module, provided resources for the GIS
manager to pursue his vision of developing both a department wide and a state
wide GIS.

In 1987 the forestry manager also prompted the application of GIS to preparing
forests management plans (see business process GIS entitled ‘GIS in preparation of
forest management plan’ in (cid:142) gure 2). This provided a regular income to support the
growth of the infrastructure GIS. In the same year, the GIS unit started to help
regional o(cid:129) ces to acquire their own GIS hardware and software, and to train their
own GIS technicians (see business process GIS entitled ‘Training of GIS specialists
for regional o(cid:129) ces’ in (cid:142) gure 2). Based on the standards laid down in the depart-
mental infrastructure GIS, these regional GIS technicians helped to develop regional
infrastructure GIS that continued to use the data and services provided by the
departmental one.

However senior management of DCFL still did not recognise the full potential
of GIS and provided limited funding and policy guidance. At that time, the Drafting
Services Branch in the department had also acquired its GIS-based mapping capabil-
ities. To realise the vision of developing a department wide GIS, the GIS manager
continued to expand the departmental infrastructure GIS. This was achieved by a
strategy of undertaking projects from both inside and outside the department. While
the infrastructure GIS supported the development of these projects (business process
GIS), the GIS capabilities developed for the business process GIS were fed back to
support the development of the infrastructure GIS in return. Though the GIS manager
left the department in 1990 to pursue his vision of a state wide GIS, the successor
continued with this symbiotic strategy to develop the departmental infrastructure
GIS.

DCFL was restructured into the Department of Conservation and Natural

292

T . O. Chan and I. P. W illiamson

Resources in early 1993. Senior management recognised the duplication of GIS
services between the departmental
infrastructure GIS and the Drafting Services
Branch, and merged the two to form a new business unit called Natural Resource
Systems Branch. As a result, DCFL’s infrastructure GIS grew in 8-years time from
a 1-person unit to a major business unit that housed ten to twelve GIS specialists,
six remote sensing sta(cid:128) and a 25-member cartographic output group in 1993.
However policy guidance from senior management was still lacking. It was due to
the persistence of a professional sta(cid:128) in the Natural Resource Systems Branch, which
led the development of a central Corporate Geospatial Data Library. The Library
was to standardise, warehouse and distribute compliant geospatial data and serve
as a (cid:142) rst step to integrate the diverse GIS data resources in the department.

As more business units developed their own modules of infrastructure GIS, the
National Resource Systems Branch adapted by providing specialised GIS products
and services (vertical ovals with dots in (cid:142) gure 2) to these infrastructure GIS. The
products and services, which ranged from simple consultations,
through data
capture/analysis/management or map production to the development of an entire
system, form the links between the departmental infrastructure GIS and other GIS
modules in the organisation. These links gave the corporate GIS a signi(cid:142) cant degree
of integration.

3.3. T he opportunistic-business process pattern

The opportunistic-business process pattern is similar to the opportunistic-infra-
structure pattern and is driven by managers of similar characteristics. However,
unlike the latter pattern, these managers cannot secure initial support from senior
management. Long term senior guidance and funding are also uncertain. As a result,
the managers have to initiate the GIS development process by (cid:142) rst developing a
module of business process GIS using whatever resources they can use. Later GIS
modules are then built on this initial module.

Sixteen out of the nineteen cases of GIS development in DNRE illustrated in
(cid:142) gure 1 conform to this pattern which is by far the most common pattern. Examples
include the ‘GIS unit
in the
Department of Conservation and Natural Resources ((cid:142) gure 2), and the ‘GIS unit in
the Department of Agriculture’ ((cid:142) gure 3). The following paragraphs describe the
latter example in detail.

in the research institute of Victorian Fisheries’

To ensure its continued survival the manager of Environmental Science Unit
(ESU) had a vision of re-engineering the management of the state’s soil data with
GIS to better serve the agriculture community. With the support of the immediate
supervisor, the manager acquired the necessary hardware and software and built a
module of business process GIS to manage soil data/maps in ESU in 1986 ((cid:142) gure 3).
The manager then marketed the GIS technology to regional colleagues in the
department to promote the use of the digital soil data.

In 1987 using Federal funding that encouraged the use of soil data to improve
agricultural practices, the manager undertook joint GIS projects, that is, modules of
business process GIS, with regional sta(cid:128) . This cooperation led the module of business
process GIS in ESU to acquire an additional role of an infrastructure GIS. Unlike
infrastructure GIS in DCFL (§3.4), the manager kept the GIS
the departmental
module in ESU small, transferring the data and technology back to the clients in
the regions on completion of the projects. There was virtually no control on how
the clients should develop their GIS capabilities.

L ong term management of a corporate GIS

293

Senior management’s involvement had been minimal until 1992 when a new head
of department (Secretary) took over. The Secretary was conscious of the value of
information in general, and GIS in particular. The GIS module in ESU was restruc-
tured to a departmental infrastructure GIS to give it a more strategic and state wide
focus. A department wide GIS strategy was introduced in 1993– 4. With the introduc-
tion of a Wide Area Network in 1994, the departmental infrastructure GIS introduced
PC-based GIS to the regional o(cid:129) ces together with some basic data to promote the
use of the technology. In this way modules of infrastructure and business process GIS
were gradually developed in the regions based on the standards set by departmental
module. By 1995 there was some integration in the corporate GIS of the Department
of Agriculture.

4. Characteristics of GIS development patterns

The last section describes (cid:142) ve patterns of GIS development identi(cid:142) ed from the
case of GIS development in DNRE in 1979–1997. Each pattern represents one
approach of GIS development adopted by the managers driving the process. Based
on the context of GIS development described, each pattern can be characterised by
a unique combination of the extent of integration of the corporate GIS, the nature
of the GIS visions of these managers and the organisational commitment.

In this paper the extent of

integration of the corporate GIS varies along a
continuum between no integration and full integration. The extent of integration
between the two extremes is referred to as varying.

The GIS visions of managers in an organisation vary (Chan and Williamson
1996 ) and can be classi(cid:142) ed as supportive and non-supportive in the case of DNRE.
A non-supportive vision suggests that there is no business need for GIS. A supportive
GIS vision can be further sub-divided into two types, namely, restricted and broad,
depending on whether the managers aim at developing a GIS that serves a speci(cid:142) c
business unit or a wider community such as a division, a department, or the entire
state/nation.

Organisational commitment in the case of DNRE refers to the managerial support
from each of the three basic levels of administrations in the organisation— senior,
middle and junior/line. The support includes inputs of resources, leadership, policy,
and lobbying/marketing e(cid:128) ort. In the course of the interview some respondents in
DNRE reported that it took at least the concerted e(cid:128) ort of managers in both the
middle and junior levels to sustain the development of GIS. While the junior/line
managers knew the business processes and the technology, they need the resources
controlled by the middle managers to secure and develop the technology. Resources,
though acknowledged as important in GIS development (Budic 1993, Arnaud et al.
1996 ), do not stand out as crucial as the support from senior or middle management,
or both. The experience of DNRE described in §3.3–3.5 suggests that junior managers,
motivated by their GIS visions and supported by their supervisors, can mobilise
resources from both inside and outside the organisation to sustain GIS development.
The characteristics of each of the (cid:142) ve patterns in terms of the three attributes
discussed above are summarised in table 1 and described in detail in the next two

4.1. T he dormant, systematic, and opportunistic patterns

In the dormant pattern there is neither supportive GIS vision nor managerial
support for GIS development in an organisation. As a result there is no corporate

moves on.

In the four remaining patterns, there are both supportive GIS visions and mana-
gerial support that result in a corporate GIS that is integrated to a di(cid:128) erent extent
in each case. One common condition for these four patterns is the concerted support
from middle and line managers. This matches the experience of some respondents
in DNRE as described above.

In the systematic pattern the GIS development process is structured and well
planned, with a common broad GIS vision for a department wide GIS and concerted
managerial support from all administrative levels, resulting in a fully integrated
corporate GIS. Apart from the crucial bottom-up support of the middle and line
managers, the senior managers provide the all-important policy guidance to integrate
the development of GIS capabilities. This condition for the systematic pattern
matches that of the process model of internal corporate venturing (Burgelman 1988 )
which prescribes that the overall success of a new internal venture in a company
relies on complementary activities of managers at di(cid:128) erent levels in the company.

The opportunistic pattern is opposite to the systematic pattern in several ways.
Typically the former is driven by the restricted visions of middle and line managers
and lacks any kind of senior management support or guidance. The corporate GIS
which is developed in an uncoordinated manner, is not integrated.

All three patterns of GIS development discussed so far assume a consistent set
of GIS visions and managerial support. However classic organisation theories view
an organisation as a means of achieving some common goals through people (Rogers
and Agarwala-Rogers 1976, Schein 1980 ). In the long term, as sta(cid:128) move on or as
the organisation is restructured, the goals of the organisation and the GIS vision of
managers will change. This makes long term concerted managerial support (or the
lack of it) for GIS, particularly that of senior management, uncertain in any organis-
ation. Therefore, in the long term, the dormant, systematic and opportunistic patterns
of GIS development are not sustainable.

For example, if GIS is the technology that business units in an organisation
require to improve their products, services and productivity, any responsible senior
management will eventually have to pull the organisation out of the dormant pattern
and invest in GIS. This will happen somehow in due course as in the example of

L ong term management of a corporate GIS

295

the delayed GIS adoption by the Parks and Reserves Branch of DNRE mentioned
previously.

In the case of the opportunistic pattern of GIS development, it will result in so
much duplication and ine(cid:129) ciency that in the current trend of economic rationalism,
senior management will demand better coordination and integration in due course.
A good example is the merging of the GIS unit with the Drafting Services Branch
of DCFL.

Though the systematic pattern of GIS development has the merits of more sharing
and less duplication, it may not remain as the standard approach of GIS development
for very long. It has its limitations, such as, disagreement among stakeholders and
decreased organisational e(cid:129) ciency (Campbell and Masser 1995 ). Further, on comple-
tion of the project as initially planned, rather than funding the continual development
of the GIS, senior management may opt to deploy resources to tackle more urgent
organisational issues or to undertake other projects that have a higher priority. As
a result, the corporate GIS may only be left with a recurrent maintenance budget,
or even be required to charge for its products and services to earn its keep. In any
information needs of the
case,
organisation. This will force business units to develop their own GIS capabilities
and the corporate GIS will no longer be developed in a systematic manner. The
reluctance/inability to fully integrate GEDIS of the Department of Energy with
Mineral and the GIS unit of the Department of Agriculture as the two departments
amalgamated (§3.3) shows that the systematic pattern is not sustainable in a dynamic
organisational setting.

it will be unable to cater for the full range of

4.2. T he opportunistic-inf rastructure and opportunistic-business process patterns

Unlike the previous three patterns, the opportunistic-infrastructure and the oppor-
tunistic-business process patterns do not assume consistent support from senior
management. The latter two patterns take place when the middle and line managers
work in a concerted manner to achieve a broad GIS vision, but with uncertain
support from senior management—the typical organisational setting in the long
term. Irrespective of the support from senior management, the middle and line
managers secure the resources to realise their broad GIS vision by engaging in
continuous proactive ‘scavenging’ activities (Burgelman 1988: 588 )
to obtain
resources and to promote the technology, both inside and outside the organisation.
In the process, if they get some early input from senior management, they may
develop a module of infrastructure GIS which is used to facilitate the development
of other modules of business process GIS in the rest of the organisation. This early
development of an infrastructure GIS forms the opportunistic-infrastructure pattern
of GIS development.

If there is little or no initial support from senior management, the middle and
line managers may make use of the limited resources from one or more business
units to develop a small module of business process GIS, initially to satisfy the
business needs of these units. The GIS module is also used to demonstrate the value
of the technology to other stakeholders. As more managers or professional sta(cid:128) ,
particularly senior managers, recognise the value of GIS and become more support-
ive, the initial GIS capabilities are then used to support the development of other
business process GIS, and thus assume an additional role/identity of an infrastructure
GIS. This gives rise to the opportunistic-business process pattern of GIS development.
Irrespective of which one of the two patterns the managers are in, they would

296

T . O. Chan and I. P. W illiamson

develop the corporate GIS in a symbiotic manner in which infrastructure GIS and
business process GIS support the development of one another. In theory, by having
all the business process GIS in an organisation developed from a common infra-
structure GIS, it would ensure that the GIS capabilities in the organisation are inter-
operable. In this way, it would seem that middle and line managers could still create
a de facto integrated GIS without the sustained support from senior management.
In practice this scenario seldom happens.

Medium to large organisations such as DNRE which has over 5000 people
working in over 200 locations, have very diverse information needs. Each business
unit will require a di(cid:128) erent combination of GIS capabilities that include data,
standards, people with appropriate skills, and information technology. In terms of
data and standards, di(cid:128) erent business units may require data of di(cid:128) erent themes and
qualities. It will be di(cid:129) cult for a central infrastructure GIS to cater for the full range
of data needs in a medium to large organisation such as DNRE. For example, in
DNRE and its precursor, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources
((cid:142) gure 2), the forestry sta(cid:128) needed forestry data while the (cid:142) sheries sta(cid:128) needed (cid:142) shery
statistics to carry out their business functions. In DNRE’s agricultural program, the
departmental GIS unit (‘Restructured GIS unit’ in (cid:142) gure 3) normally worked with
general data of state wide coverage for strategic management purposes, while the
regional o(cid:129) ces required more detailed operational data of a local coverage.

Even when a speci(cid:142) c business function is well served by a central module of
infrastructure GIS, that module still may not be able to provide the full range of
GIS expertises needed in the business function. This is because, on the one hand,
the perceived GIS needs of the business function change with time and the experience
of using the technology. On the other hand, as the bureaucracy of the GIS unit
grows, it may become less responsive to the GIS needs of business units. Either the
projects proposed by business units are too small to arouse its interest, or the projects
are beyond its expertise or the scope of the established data management policy. If
GIS acquisition is tightly controlled, the business units may not get the GIS informa-
tion products that they need. Otherwise, they will make use of the GIS capabilities
of the central infrastructure GIS to develop their GIS expertise. The outcome is the
creation of specialised multi-levelled infrastructure GIS within an organisation. Each
business function develops its own module of infrastructure GIS to complement the
capabilities of the central module and to meet long term business needs. This
phenomenon of specialisation was (cid:142) rst reported for IT infrastructure development
in private companies (Weill and Broadbent 1994 ). Evidence from DNRE con(cid:142) rms
that the same is applicable to GIS.

A good example is the Departmental GIS unit in DCFL ((cid:142) gure 2) that originally
catered for all the GIS needs of the Forests Service Division in 1986– 7. As the
forestry sta(cid:128) gradually recognised the value of GIS in the core business of forest
management, they found that DCFL’s GIS unit was not providing the level of
expertise and service the forestry sta(cid:128) needed. Therefore in 1992–3 the senior manage-
ment of the Division decided to invest in its own GIS capabilities and created the
Forest Information Section and the Forest Resource Inventory Section.

The Forest Information Section specialised in the business process of timber
harvest modelling. Over the years, the Section evolved into a separate module of
infrastructure GIS that provided specialised services, such as, purchasing specialist
linear programming software (an example was the American timber yield fore-
casting software, FORPLAN) for forestry applications, providing timber harvest

L ong term management of a corporate GIS

297

analysis and modelling services in support of forest planning activities, and producing
sustainable timber yield forecast for forest management.

The Forest Resource Inventory Section focused on capturing forest resource data
to serve the entire Division. Like the Forest Information Section, it also evolved into
a separate module of infrastructure GIS. It provided specialised services, such as,
purchasing of hardware and software best suited for data capture and recti(cid:142) cation,
capturing, maintaining and providing state wide hardwood forest resource data,
specifying, negotiating and implementing data capture and compilation contracts,
and providing advice and services of accessing and utilising the forest resource
database.

At the same time, the two Sections still used data that were stored in the
departmental spatial databases maintained by the departmental GIS unit. The
Departmental GIS unit of DCFL still provided general GIS products and services
that complemented the specialised GIS capabilities of the two Sections in Forests
Service Division. The GIS products and services included purchasing of general GIS
software and hardware, specifying, negotiating and implementing maintenance and
system implementation contracts, collecting, purchasing and maintaining department
wide core spatial datasets, developing standards for spatial data, and for hardware,
software and communication, providing high quality maps, providing DIS help desk,
and spatial database and information system development and maintenance services.
Table 2 summarises the specialised services provided by infrastructure GIS developed
at three di(cid:128) erent administrative levels in DNRE.

The specialised GIS products and services not only give rise to multi-levelled
infrastructure GIS, but also serve as links among key GIS modules of a corporate
GIS. Some links are tight as in the case when the central infrastructure GIS uses its

own system as a blue-print, designs and implements entire GIS modules, business
process or infrastructure, on behalf of its clients. This implies that data, applications
and expertise are transferable between the central GIS module and the GIS modules
that its helps to create, and that the resulting corporate GIS is in e(cid:128) ect fully
integrated.

Other links are loose, meaning that individual GIS modules may adopt standards
di(cid:128) erent from those of the central infrastructure GIS. In this case, the central infra-
structure GIS provides only general services and products such as data capturing,
certain data analysis procedures and production of specialist maps. Loose links
imply little integration between the resulting corporate GIS.

Irrespective of whether it is the opportunistic -infrastructure or the opportunistic -
business process pattern, it is the overall nature of these links that determines the
extent of integration between the GIS modules. The tighter these linkages are in
relation to a common set of standards, such as that provided by the infrastructure
GIS, the better integrated is the corporate GIS, and vice versa. Neither one of the
two patterns can guarantee full integration.

In short, by de(cid:142) nition, there are few links, if any, in the dormant and opportunistic
patterns of GIS development. Therefore these patterns do not generate integrated
corporate GIS. The links in the systematic pattern are tight by design giving rise to
a fully integrated corporate GIS. The uncertain nature of the links created by the
opportunistic-infrastructure and the opportunistic-business process patterns suggests
that a fully integrated corporate GIS is possible but not guaranteed.

5. Long term characteristics of a corporate GIS

Section 3 examines how DNRE’s corporate GIS and its dynamics of development
are modelled over an 18-year period using the productional perspective. Section 4
further examines the (cid:142) ve patterns of GIS development in their respective organis-
ational context in this extended period of time. Each pattern is then characterised
by a set of attributes identi(cid:142) ed within the organisational context, which include the
nature of the GIS vision, organisational commitment and the degree of integration
of the GIS. The examinations have revealed some important long term characteristics
of a corporate GIS that are described as follows.

Firstly, a corporate GIS is a dynamic and modular entity that is made up of
basic modules termed infrastructure and business process GIS. Inf rastructure GIS
serve business functions in an organisation indirectly by facilitating the development
of existing and new business process GIS. It is the business process GIS that deliver
direct bene(cid:142) ts to an organisation. This relationship is illustrated by the lack of stand-
alone infrastructure GIS as in the case of DNRE and the very common occurrence
of the opportunistic-business process pattern of GIS development in which business
process GIS are developed (cid:142) rst.

Secondly, in a medium to large enterprise, the corporate GIS tends to be a multi-
levelled entity. The business units are supported by a number of infrastructure GIS
that progressively specialise to serve speci(cid:142) c needs of the business units. The varied
and changing information needs of the business units make it almost impossible to
clearly de(cid:142) ne the long term composition or capabilities of a corporate GIS and its
GIS modules and to develop such a corporate GIS systematically. The dynamic
organisational setting only adds to the complexity of the process.

Thirdly, the GIS services and products provided by one infrastructure GIS to
other GIS modules help to link the GIS capabilities in di(cid:128) erent business functions

L ong term management of a corporate GIS

299

of an organisation together. The links can be tight or loose. Tight links in the form
of common data model, format and sources, compatible/interoperable hardware and
software produce a better-integrated corporate GIS. The best integration is achieved
in a systematic pattern of GIS development in which all GIS capabilities are centrally
determined. Integration is signi(cid:142) cantly weaker when one infrastructure GIS provides
other GIS modules with products or services that do not conform to a common set
of standards.

Fourthly, none of the (cid:142) ve patterns of GIS development can guarantee successful
development of that ideal integrated corporate GIS in the long term. By their nature,
the dormant and opportunistic patterns are not conducive to integration. While the
systematic pattern can ensure the development of such a GIS in the short term, it
has been argued in §4.1 that it is not sustainable in the long term.

In the typical dynamic setting of an organisation in which sustained support
from senior management is uncertain, the more sustainable patterns are the opportun-
istic-infrastructure and opportunistic-business process patterns, which involve middle
and line managers ‘scavenging’ for resources to develop the corporate GIS. However,
the variable nature of the links developed among di(cid:128) erent GIS modules suggests
that while full integration of the corporate GIS is possible, it is not guaranteed.

6.

Implications for management of GIS
The relationship between the two basic modules of a corporate GIS suggests
that developing one central infrastructure GIS is not the Holy Grail. It is the business
process GIS that directly deliver bene(cid:142) ts. Development of both infrastructure and
business process GIS should proceed in a complementary manner to realise the
bene(cid:142) ts as early as possible and to ensure that the technology stays relevant. This
serves to meet the users’ expectations and to sustain their support (Bundock 1996 ).
It is the concerted e(cid:128) ort of managers with a broad GIS vision from di(cid:128) erent
administrative levels in an organisation that drives the development of the ideal
integrated corporate GIS. However in the long term, the normal dynamics in an
organisation is such that the organisational commitment in terms of support of other
managers, particularly that of senior management will (cid:143) uctuate. Therefore to ensure
that a corporate GIS will continue to develop in an integrated manner, the strategies
adopted by managers driving the process should be (cid:143) exible enough to adapt to the
changing organisational commitment.

To be (cid:143) exible, managers should recognise that it is the nature of the links among
GIS modules that determines the extent of integration of the corporate GIS. Links
are created primarily through strategies adopted in the systematic , opportunistic-
infrastructure and opportunistic-business process patterns of GIS development, which
capitalise on di(cid:128) erent extent of organisational commitment. Developing an integrated
corporate GIS requires the creation of tight links among GIS modules by drawing
on the strategies of the three patterns that match the prevailing organisational
commitment. Based on the productional perspective of GIS and the experience of
GIS development over an 18-year period in DNRE, (cid:142) gure 4 describes a three-stage
approach to the long term development of a corporate GIS.

In the (cid:142) rst stage a module of business process GIS is developed to generate direct
and immediate business bene(cid:142) ts to the organisation. This stage serves to raise the
awareness of GIS in the organisation, and to demonstrate the value of GIS. This
module may be developed through one or more pilot studies. In the process the GIS

of GIS.

advocating managers lobby for funding and policy support from top management
for a centralised integrated corporate GIS.

In the second stage, top management funding and policy guidance are secured.
The detailed capabilities of the GIS modules of the corporate GIS are identi(cid:142) ed and
de(cid:142) ned as far as practical and implemented. Development of infrastructure GIS is
tightly coupled to that of the business process GIS to ensure early delivery of bene(cid:142) ts.
For these two stages, there are many strategies in the literature to guide implementa-
tion (Azad and Wiggins 1993, Onsrud and Pinto 1993, Engelkan 1994, Vastag et al.
1994, Ferrari and Onsrud 1995, Somers 1996 ). The objective of this stage is to build
a robust over-arching framework to guide GIS development in the organisation
later on.

In the third stage, the emphasis of development of the corporate GIS is shifted
from building the centralised entity to building GIS capabilities in business units.
With the support from the centralised GIS, business units are encouraged to use
GIS, and subsequently, to develop their own GIS modules ( both infrastructure and
business process) based on an over-arching framework. The process of GIS develop-
ment in the business units may follow any one of the three patterns of GIS
development, namely, systematic , opportunistic-infrastructure, and opportunistic-
business process. The haphazard opportunistic pattern of development should be
avoided.

In the process, links between the centralised GIS and the multi-levelled GIS
capabilities in the business units are created ensuring that the latter are developed
according to standard practices and communication architecture. In this way,

L ong term management of a corporate GIS

301

integration of the growing corporate GIS is assured, while the users are catering for
their own needs by driving the GIS development themselves.

The management of this stage is easier said than done. Special change agents
(managers or business analysts) are required. Their duties are to liaise with business
units, cultivate GIS advocates in business units, explain the corporate GIS strategy,
help the units to identify their GIS needs and develop GIS modules using whatever
capabilities that are available in the centralised GIS and in the rest of the organis-
ation. These change agents would encourage business units to use resources from
both inside and outside the organisation to meet their GIS needs. All these activities
are to ensure that users are driving the development of the GIS capabilities they
need and thus have ownership of the technology. In return the change agents will
require the business units to adopt the corporate standard practices in the GIS
modules so that whatever GIS capabilities developed are accessible to all users in
the organisation. If this is proven impractical, new arrangement should be explored
to ensure that proposed new capabilities are interoperable with that of
the
organisation.

In order to carry out their duties e(cid:128) ectively, the change agents must have good
general knowledge of the GIS technology and the GIS resources available both
within and without the organisation. They must also be good communicators who
understand or are prepared to learn how the organisational units do their businesses.
Last but not least, they must also be conversant with the corporate IT/GIS/
information management strategy, and the approaches that can be followed to meet
the corporate standard practices. This would mean keeping abreast with the
development of the technology.

7. Conclusions

This paper reports the outcomes of a study of the development of GIS in the
Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) over a period of 18
years. Based on the productional perspective of GIS, which disaggregates a corporate
GIS into models of infrastructure and business process GIS, this paper models the
chronological development of DNRE’s corporate GIS and documented (cid:142) ve patterns
of GIS development. The patterns are called dormant, opportunistic, opportunistic-
business process, opportunistic-infrastructure and systematic . Each pattern is then
characterised by a set of attributes identi(cid:142) ed within the respective organisational
context, which include the nature of the GIS vision, organisational commitment and
the degree of integration of the GIS.

Some important long term characteristics of a corporate GIS are identi(cid:142) ed

as follows:

E A corporate GIS is a dynamic and modular entity with infrastructure GIS
supporting business process GIS. It is the business process GIS that deliver
direct bene(cid:142) ts to an organisation.

E The corporate GIS tends to be a multi-levelled entity with modules of infra-
structure GIS relying on one another for specialised products and services.
Therefore it is di(cid:129) cult to de(cid:142) ne the detailed composition of the corporate GIS
beforehand.

E The specialised products and services provided by infrastructure GIS serve as
links between GIS modules. These links can be tight or loose, giving the
corporate GIS di(cid:128) erent degrees of integration.

302

T . O. Chan and I. P. W illiamson

E None of the (cid:142) ve patterns of GIS development identi(cid:142) ed can guarantee success-

ful development of an ideal integrated GIS in the long term.

In view of the (cid:143) uctuating organisational commitment to GIS over time, it is
argued that GIS managers should adopt a (cid:143) exible approach towards GIS develop-
ment, focusing on the management of tight links between GIS modules to ensure
the development of an integrated corporate GIS. A three-stage approach to long
term development of a corporate GIS is proposed.

In the (cid:142) rst stage, a module of business process GIS is developed to gain support
from the rest of the organisation, particularly senior management, for GIS develop-
ment. In the second stage, with support from senior management, a central corporate
GIS is developed to build an over-arching framework to guide GIS development in
the organisation in future. In the third stage, GIS development is encouraged in
business units through any one of the three patterns of GIS development, namely,
systematic , opportunistic-business process, and opportunistic-infrastructure, while
ensuring that the GIS capabilities in the business units conform to the organisational
standards. The duties and qualities required of the change agents to manage the
process of GIS development in accordance with the three-stage approach is brie(cid:143) y
discussed.

GIS and Multicriteria Decision-making

Abstract
This article develops a methodology using a Geographical Information System (GIS) to evaluate the best
location to stop a high speed passenger train when faced with an undesired event. The proposed method is
based on multicriteria decision-making where different stretches of line which could be chosen as the stop-
ping point are ranked depending on the characteristics of the line, the surrounding area and its accessibility
for equipment. The method was integrated into the GIS to develop an expert support system for decision
makers faced with different kinds of undesired events. It has been applied to a case study on the high speed
line between Valladolid and Madrid (Spain). The proposed method is new and has not previously been
applied to high speed railway networks and could be adapted to other case studies. The speed of the algo-
rithm provides an almost instantaneous reply within seconds of an emergency situation occurring. The
method can therefore be part of an overall support system for decision making in undesired rail events.

1 Introduction

European railways are one of the safest modes of transport in Europe with 0.13 fatalities
per billion passenger kilometers versus 48.94 fatalities in powered two–wheelers (European
Railway Agency 2014a). Even so, it is essential to maintain and improve the current level of
safety for the beneﬁt of all. Railway networks are constantly improving their safety systems
and procedures to avoid any harm coming to people, rolling stock, the track and other installa-
tions during an undesired situation.

The intention of this research is to further improve the safety and comfort of high speed
trains under undesired situations proposing a unique criterion for stop area selection. A meth-
odology has been designed based on a Geographical Information System (GIS) and multicrite-
ria decision making (MCDM) to rank different stretches of line which could be chosen as the
best stopping point in case of an incident or accident. This system has been integrated into a
computer programme enabling it to be used as an expert support system for decision-makers
during undesired events (Webb and Yadav 2003). These decisions increase in importance as the
response time becomes more critical. If an accident or incident occurs, the reaction and
response times are important variables which need to be considered.

The general objective of this research can be divided into three speciﬁc goals: (1) establish
a GIS with structured information for managing railway events; (2) establish a ranking system
for calculating the stopping point of a train during an undesired event; and (3) create a unique
management tool which informs the Trafﬁc Control Centre (TCC) about the most suitable
stopping location for the train, using the implemented method with the lowest computational

cost. This system is similar to an extension of a GIS (Keenan 2001) and should be able to be
integrated into a spatial decision system for use in the management of evacuations during emer-
gency situations on high speed passenger trains.

Each stretch of line in the study area (technically known as a canton) has information
about it stored in the geographical database related to the railway infrastructure, equip-
ment accessibility and local environmental characteristics. The geographical storage system
used with MCDM establishes a system for ranking the cantons according to the relevant
characteristics for stopping the train during an undesired event. The evaluation of the cri-
teria is based on railway safety protocols and on consulting a group of experts such as
drivers and safety technicians. The methodology is therefore designed to differentiate types
of events as well as other relevant characteristics such as the speed of the train, its charac-
teristics and the braking systems. The spatial factor relevant to accessibility (Canudas
Porti and Arnedo Pena 2005) is a crucial element when determining the most suitable
place to stop a train (Escudero 2009). Minimum distances and time-scales also play an
important role when deciding on evacuation routes, as do the type of event and any con-
sequences it may have. All the above factors have been taken into account in designing
the criteria.

The methodology has been applied to a real case, the high speed line between Valladolid
and Madrid (Spain). This line has been divided into a total of 72 cantons for which all the
required information has been collected. The system has been designed to differentiate three
kinds of evacuation and the software was run on a commercial GIS with an almost instantane-
ous response time.

The article is structured in the following way. Section 2 analyses the state-of-the-art in the
ﬁeld of GIS and MCDM applied to planning and management of transport and railway trans-
port. A description of the methodology used is provided in Section 3, consisting of the analysis
and evaluation of railway and territorial information. Section 4 assesses the study case where
the developed method was implemented and, ﬁnally, the conclusions drawn from this work are
presented in Section 5.

2 State-of-the-Art

GIS have proven to provide very versatile tools with a multitude of applications in the ﬁeld of
spatial analysis (Goodchild 2009; Longley et al. 2005). In addition, the integration of GIS
and multicriteria decision making (GIS-MCDM) have been growing since 1990 (Carver
1991; Jankowski 1995) using the combination of geographical data, spatial analysis and
expert preferences to obtain relevant information for decision making. Malczewski (2006)
has classiﬁed the literature about GIS-MCDM; more than 300 articles appeared between
1990 and 2004, according to the geoinformation and the multicriteria decision making com-
ponents applied by the researchers. This line of research has showed the usefulness of GIS-
MCDM for developing spatial decision support systems and its important contribution to
GIScience.

GIS and MCDM has been used in several application areas including land use planning
(Coutinho-Rodrigues et al. 2011; Chang et al. 2008; Joerin et al. 2001), transport studies
(Church et al. 1992; Jha et al. 2001; Su(cid:2)arez-Vega et al. 2011) and transport infrastructure loca-
tion and management. Guler and Jovanovic (2004), for example, used a GIS for the mainte-
nance and conservation of the Turkish railway network and for the analysis of railway

accidents. However, Guler and Jovanovic did not use the GIS as a preventive measure for rail-
way emergencies, only as a system for storing and managing spatial data.

Horner and Grubesic (2001) elaborated a GIS-based methodology to evaluate the pre-
ferred locations for park-and-ride car parks at metropolitan railway stations. The authors took
into account demand characteristics and accessibility as well as competition between different
locations. The methodology was applied to a speciﬁc case study using the railway network in
Columbus (Ohio).

Celebi et al. (2008) used a methodology involving MCDM to improve the classiﬁcation
and recording of railway networks. Cordera et al. (2009) applied GIS-MCDM to the location
of the most appropriate zones for introducing bike lanes in the Spanish region of Cantabria.
They divided the existing road network into segments and considered diverse location criteria,
including accessibility for the population, as relevant factors for introducing bike lanes. Along
similar lines, Rybarczyk and Wu (2010) applied GIS-MCDM for locating bike lanes on two
scales: on a macro level, covering the entire network and on a micro neighborhood level, con-
sidering both supply and demand criteria. Their methodology was applied in the City of Mil-
waukee in Wisconsin and the authors showed its viability and that it could be an alternative to
other methodologies based purely on supply criteria.

Other research has concentrated on the design of spatial decision-making systems, an
example being Forgionne (2003), who designed an emergency evacuation system based on
accessibility indicators and route optimization, mainly along conventional roads. Similarly,
Carine et al. (2012) developed a methodology for supporting the evacuation of passengers dur-
ing emergencies using GIS tools and network analysis. The authors applied the methodology to
a study area in San Diego, California, and showed that evacuation routes could be ranked auto-
matically using a model.

The spatial decision-making systems can be combined with MCDM to develop multicriteria
Decision Support Systems based on GIS (MCDSS). An example is the research of De Luca et al.
(2012) whom applied GIS-MCDM to select the corridor location of a high speed rail. The
authors applied the method to a real-world case study in the south of Italy, in order to evaluate
the economic, social and environmental impacts of every alternative. The results showed that
every corridor had its positive and negative outcomes with an important trade-off between the
environmental/social factors and the economic factors. Levy et al. (2007) used MCDSS to man-
age ﬂood risk problems by combining value judgments and technical information in a structured
decision framework. MCDSS for ﬂood management facilitated knowledge transfer, increased
decision-making transparency, and improved communication among emergency management
stakeholders. These last capabilities are very important in emergency situations. In Oxendine
et al. (2012) a multiobjective, multicriteria approach to determine optimum evacuation routes in
an urban setting was introduced. The present research uses similar criteria although without con-
sidering congestion, given the interurban character of the area under study.

Accessibility indicators are important in the evaluation of evacuation alternatives in order
to decrease time of intervention and facilitate the job of external rescue-teams. The number of
available indicators is currently high meaning it becomes necessary to select the most suitable
depending on the required objectives (Bruinsma and Rietveld 1998; Gutierrez et al. 1996; Vick-
erman 1974). Geurs and van Wee (2004) classiﬁed the indicators into four main kinds: based
on infrastructure, location, the individual, and utility. In the case of locating the stopping place,
the line’s accessibility to towns and hospitals played an important role in valuing each canton
as possibly the most suitable place to stop. In the present research case each canton would be
so much more suitable depending on its greater accessibility based on infrastructure-related
measurements.

3 Methodology

The proposed methodology is based on the use of a GIS to create an inventory and to store
the characteristics of the high speed railway network being studied. The method proposed
for choosing the stopping point during an undesired event is based on the method of multi-
criteria evaluation summarized by Cascetta (2009). The three main phases are summarized
below:

1.

Identiﬁcation of alternatives: The identiﬁcation of the available alternatives will depend
on the location of the train, the speed at which it is travelling and the required reaction
time to come to a halt.

2. Modeling criteria: Identify the criteria, score the options and assign weights for each of
the options. Combine the weights and scores for each of the options to derive an evalua-
tion value. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) developed by Saaty (Saaty 1980; Saaty
and Vargas 2012) has been selected as the methodology to be used in this research.
3. Examine the results and selection of the place to stop the train. Each of the above steps

will be described in greater detail below.

With this method it is possible to compare all criteria and alternatives and rank them from
best to worst deﬁning a complete ranking and a global score for each alternative. This approach
assumes compensable scores where a bad score in one criterion can be compensated by a good
one in another (Ishizaka and Nemery 2013). The AHP methodology requires the use of ratio
scale data, pairwise comparison (PWC) for weights calculation and an aggregation rule, usually
Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) in a distributive or ideal mode. In the present research,
this approach has been selected in preference to other techniques (outranking approach or goal
approach) because calculating a full ranking allows not only the choice of the best alternative for
stopping the train but also has secondary options if the best alternative is not available. In addi-
tion, the use of PWC is cognitively less demanding than expressing the preferences in all the crite-
ria at the same time, especially if the comparison is made by a focus group and a consensus
among their members has to be reached. Moreover, PWC allows estimating the consistence index
of the preferences speciﬁed. PWC had been criticized by authors like Malczewski (2000) given
that this method does not consider the units of measurement. However, as Saaty (1994) points
out, the use of a ratio scale avoids the problem of considering the measurement units in PWC, a
problem that would be present if an interval scale were used (Ishizaka and Nemery 2013). In
order to apply AHP it is also important to take into account the following cautions:

(cid:2) The use of WLC as a decision rule (a common practice in AHP), implies the data stand-
ardization using techniques like local scaling that assumes a linear transformation. How-
ever, it can be considered that linear transformation is a good approximation of the
“true value” if the criterion has a behavior close to linear. In other cases, methods such
as the value function approach can be used (Malczewski 2000).
It is important that all the selected criteria can be considered comparable with each other
because it is a requirement for using a compensatory methodology such as AHP. Addi-
tionally, all the criteria selected should be preference-independent because otherwise the
use of other multicriteria techniques like Analytic Network Process (ANP) that allow
dependencies among criteria would be mandatory.

(cid:2)

(cid:2) The introduction ex–post of new alternatives in the decision problem should be avoided.
Otherwise, situations of rank reversal could arise. The preferences aggregation should be
done using another methodology such as the ideal mode (Millet and Saaty 2000).

3.1 Identiﬁcation of Alternatives

The ﬁrst step involved in the proposed methodology consists of dividing the line being studied
into cantons of a predeﬁned length. Each of these cantons represents a possible stopping point
for the train after an undesired event and will provide all the required alphanumerical informa-
tion to the GIS to calculate its ranking in the decision hierarchy.

The length of the cantons as minimal units of information should be chosen according to
the amount of detail required by the application. Two further factors also need to be consid-
ered: the braking distance required by a high speed train under varied conditions and the reac-
tion time of the driver:

Lcanton5dbraking1dreaction

(1)

where Lcanton is the length of the canton, dbraking is the braking distance, and dreaction is the dis-
tance derived from the reaction time. The braking distance of a high speed train depends on its
speed at the point the stopping procedure started, its braking system and the weather. Table 1
shows the braking distances for different maximum speeds according to the prevailing atmos-
pheric conditions and the minimum braking required by European Standards (European Rail-
way Agency 2014b).

Under less favorable climatic conditions (B) at a speed of 300 km/h a maximum braking
distance of 4,690 m is required. During an emergency situation the train will also alert the
TCC about the problem; the period from the advice time to the time the driver activates the
brake and the train slows down and stops should also be considered in the distance required by
the cantons. For example, if a driver’s reaction time of one second is considered after receiving
the alert, with the train travelling at 300 km/h, it would travel a further 83.3 more meters
which need to be added to the stopping distance. Therefore, under these assumptions the dis-
tance required to stop would be at least 4,773.3 m and the distance being evaluated should be
in or around this length.

Given that at the moment of the emergency the train would be located in a particular can-
ton, it is assumed that the train cannot possibly stop in that canton due to the reaction times.
Therefore, all the cantons that need to be evaluated are always located ahead of the circulating
train.

3.2 Modeling Criteria

The evaluation criteria for each of the alternatives (cantons) stored in the GIS are as follows:

A. Built up area: whether or not there is a built-up area nearby.
B. Land Use: land use around the canton: open land, farm land, bush, woodland or water

C.

body.
Junctions: whether or not there is a junction with other railway lines or crossings with
other transport modes.

D. Stations: distance to the nearest station.
E. Tracks: whether the canton contains only one line or not.
F. Tunnel: whether there is a tunnel in the canton.
G. Viaduct: whether there is a viaduct or bridge in the canton.
H. Emergency centers: closeness to emergency centers.
I. Hospitals: closeness to hospitals or health centers.

These criteria were chosen from a focus group (Ritchie et al. 2013) with experts in railway
safety, train drivers and safety operators. Basically these criteria involve the most important
variables to take into account in railway safety according to the experts. The mutual preference
independence can be tested in the focus group by asking the experts whether they consider each
criterion dependent on others. In addition, these factors were selected based on the available
data, their comparability and the desire to cover three kinds of characteristics for each canton:
(2) environmental characteristics; and (3) accessibility for
(1) structural characteristics;
equipment.

The local alternative priorities of each canton can be directly introduced using their meas-
ured characteristics. This option is preferred to using PWC because in the present study context
it is considered difﬁcult for an expert group to know all the alternatives and the required num-
ber of pair comparisons would be very large.

The factors: A built up area, C junctions, E tracks, F tunnel and G viaduct are always
dummy variables, in other words they will be zeros or ones depending on the absence or pres-
ence of these factors in the canton being considered.

Factor B Land Use is of the ordinal kind and considers the suitability of the type of land
use for making the stop, the most favorable being open land such as a ﬁeld and the least favor-
able being water bodies (rivers or lakes). There may also be a certain correlation between land
use and relief, as open and cultivated land are more common in ﬂatter areas closer to settle-
ments, whereas bush and woodland are present in steeper, hillier areas. Finally, areas which
include water bodies were considered to be the most problematic for stopping and evacuating a
train. To transform the land use ordinal scale on a ratio scale required by AHP, the PWC can
be used taking the different categories of land uses as subcriteria.

Factor D Stations, factor H Emergency centers and factor I Hospitals, are accessibility indi-
cators based on infrastructure. Factor D was measured as the distance to the next station, while
factors H and I are measured by the minimum travel times on the network from each canton to
the closest hospital or emergency centre. Location accessibility indicators were not considered
for this application because distance or travel time were thought to be the most relevant varia-
bles, where the number of opportunities present in each centre was a secondary factor when
faced with an evacuation.

The information referring to criteria D, H and I have been standardized so it can be intro-
duced in a WLC decision rule. In the case of criterion D, the accumulated values of the distan-
ces were calculated from the middle point of each canton to the nearest station. The process of
standardization was carried out using local scaling (Cascetta 2009), where a score of 0 is given
to the furthest distance and a score of 1 to the nearest canton to the station:

xLOC
mj 512

(cid:2) xmj2min xmj

(cid:3)

max xmj2min xmj

(2)

where xmj is the score for criterion m for alternative j.

Similarly to Equation (2), for criteria H and I, standardizing the information so that the
canton with the lowest journey time to a hospital or an emergency support centre has a value
of 1 for this factor and a value of zero for the longest time. The standardization using local scal-
ing (also known as the score range procedure) is based on the assumption of linearity regarding
the value of evaluation. To approximate as much as possible the behavior of the time and dis-
tance variables to the linearity, a restriction on a predeﬁned distance can be applied. In

addition, it is important to highlight that the standardization procedure should be performed
only on the set of feasible alternatives because in other cases the global scores can vary substan-
tially (Malczewski 2000).

After standardizing, the data are weighted to evaluate their importance in choosing the
stop location. The weighting of the criteria may be variable according to the kind of event
occurring to the train so these possibilities have been classiﬁed. Incidents must ﬁrst be distin-
guished from accidents. The former may be deﬁned as those abnormal events which could
cause material or personal harm. Accidents on the other hand are considered to be those events
which effectively cause harm to people or damage to material goods, in accordance with cur-
rent Spanish regulations (RENFE 1997).

Table 2 shows the possible incidents and accidents recognized in this work along with the
associated level of evacuation required and the range the train can travel after such an event
(RENFE 1997). The 17 identiﬁed types of event have been placed into three groups according
to the type of evacuation required for the emergency situation, which will condition the weight-
ing of the criteria.

(cid:2) Emergency evacuation: this happens when, for whatever reason, (seriously injured people,
imminent risk of explosion, etc.) the train needs to be evacuated immediately in case the
situation worsens.

(cid:2) Normal evacuation: no immediate urgency required, no immediate danger and the evacu-

ation can take place in an orderly and safe manner.

(cid:2) No evacuation: due to the shortness of the incident and scarce or non-existent conse-
quences there is no reason to evacuate the train. In this case the train continues on its
way once the incident has passed.

Accidents resulting from derailment, pantograph connection and collision are always
assumed to require an evacuation and there is no possibility of stopping the train in another
place. In contrast all the alternatives are available in typologies 6, 12, 13, 14 and 15.

The criteria can be weighted using PWC. In this method a matrix is created where the rows
and columns represent the chosen criteria. Each pair of criteria can be compared by a group of
experts (railway safety managers and drivers) to see the importance of each factor as a function
of the type of incident, using the PWC measurement scale presented in Table 3.

For each pair of criteria, the group of experts will use the measuring scale to score the row

factor from extremely less important to extremely more important than the column factor.

The group of experts assesses three evacuation matrices as a function of the incident classi-
ﬁcation presented in Table 2. The ﬁnal weighting for each criterion is calculated for each type
of evacuation by ﬁnding the normalized eigenvector of each one of the pair comparison matri-
ces (Saaty 1980).

Finally, by using a combination of the weightings and the normalized scores for each of the
criteria, the score for each alternative can be obtained by applying a decision rule. The present
application uses a weighted linear sum of the following kind:

xij are the criteria values-these represent the factors about the surroundings chosen for
study in each canton and correspond to a standardization of the variables (without consider-
ing the unfeasible alternatives), enabling their comparison; and the kij value represents the
constraint assigned to each variable in each canton - zero value can be assigned to all the
cantons containing a special characteristic (e.g. a long viaduct or tunnel) as well as to those

where the distance or time to hospitals and stations is higher than a value given by the
analyst.

The authors preferred to use a weighted linear sum with compensation between the factors
rather than other decision rules such as the ideal point because they consider that there is a
trade-off in the present application between the factors where the absence of certain character-
istics can be compensated by the presence of others (Eastman 1990).

3.3 Examine the Results and Selection of the Train Stop Location

All the available information and the scores obtained from the decision rule can be used to
design an algorithm to determine the stop location for each of the cantons. The evolution of
events after the occurrence of an undesired event is as follows:

(cid:2) A train suffers an undesired event.
(cid:2) The driver communicates the location and the type of event to the TCC.
(cid:2) The TCC operator, knowing the current position of the train, the type of event and the
type of evacuation required can engage the developed methodology to choose the best
location to stop the train. The methodology is able to analyze the suitability of as many
cantons ahead of the train as required by the TCC. This number should be speciﬁed by
the TCC based on a trade-off: (1) the number of cantons analyzed cannot be too long in
order to stop the train as fast as possible; and (2) the number of cantons cannot be too
short in order to have time and length to stop the train under safety conditions. In addi-
tion, railway administrators can change this number of cantons depending on their cur-
rent safety regulations.

4 Application Case

The methodology presented in the previous section has been applied to a real-world study case,
the high-speed line between Madrid and Valladolid, stretching 180 km from terminal to termi-
nal (see Figure 1). The Madrid–Valladolid line started commercial service on 23rd December,
2007 and represented the ﬁrst working stretch of the North and Northeastern Spanish high-
speed train network.

In accordance with the proposed methodology, the line was divided into 72 cantons, 36 in
each direction. The length of the cantons was calculated in accordance with the methodology
proposed in Section 3.1, taking into account the braking distance of the train plus the reaction
time of the driver (4,733 m). The present application has rounded up this distance to 5,000 m
to also consider that the driver’s reaction time could be higher, allowing for a margin of up to
three seconds.

The data referring to the stop selection criteria has been collected for each canton: built up
area, land use, junctions with other transport infrastructure, distance to the nearest station,
existence of more than one line and the presence of a tunnel or viaduct. Accessibility variables
were also analyzed and measured as network travelling times from each canton to hospitals
and emergency centers. A constraint of 30 minutes was applied in these cases to approximate
as much as possible a linear relationship with the value function. It was considered that more
of that time to hospitals and emergency centers implies a non-linear decrease in the utility if an
evacuation is required. Therefore the alternatives located more than 30 minutes to hospitals
and emergency centers had a value of 0 in the kij variables.

The variables were standardized considering only the available alternatives and then
weighted using the PWC. A group of eight experts (train drivers and safety technicians with
more than 10 years of experience in managing emergency situations) were called to participate
in a Focus Group arranged by RENFE – train operator (Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles
Espa~noles) and the Infrastructure administration company ADIF (Administrador de Infraes-
tructuras Ferroviarias). The experts’ knowledge and experience is an important factor to take
into account and has never been used in this type of application until now.

The group of experts was presented with three matrices, one for each kind of evacuation
(see Table 2), and they were asked to compare each pair of criteria considering also the prefer-
ence independence. The ﬁnal ranking vectors with the normalized weights provided by the prin-
cipal eigenvector are presented in Table 4. In the case of an emergency evacuation, the greatest
weights corresponded to accessibility to hospitals and emergency centers as well as the canton
being located in an urban area. On the other hand, when an emergency evacuation is not
required, the weight on the distance to the nearest stations, the presence of an urban area and
connections with other infrastructure were higher. The consistency ratio (CR) of the matrices
was in all cases less than 10%, which satisﬁed the recommended value to assure the consistency
of the judgments (Ishizaka and Nemery 2013).

In addition, the experts also compared the land uses types in order to transform the ordinal
scale of the criterion in a ratio scale, taking into account the suitability of every land use for
making the stop. Then, the comparison matrix and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues were cal-
culated (see Table 5). The CR of the matrix was 8.5%.

An example of the weighted value for each criterion is presented below along with the ﬁnal

total score provided by the decision rule for cantons 1, 18 and 36 (see Tables 6 and 7).

Figure 2 shows the scores obtained for cantons on the high speed line in the direction
Madrid–Valladolid (up to canton 36) and Valladolid–Madrid (up to canton 72). It can be seen
how land use, in turn highly related to the relief of the area, is highly inﬂuential on the score
given to each canton.

The highest values represent the best place to stop a train, taking into account the selected
criteria. The smallest values represent the areas where train must avoid stopping. Zero values

show areas more than 30 minutes from a hospital/emergency center or with structures such as
tunnels or viaducts where a train cannot stop.

Finally, the methodology has been run on well-known GIS software using Visual Basic pro-
gramming. The GIS software provides the storage and analysis of the information from the can-
tons located along the high speed line being studied, while the tool that was designed serves as
a support for comfortable and rapid decision making.

The user will be able to see on a screen where the train will stop depending on the follow-

(cid:2) Number of stopping cantons: the user will decide on the number of potential stopping

If the train needs to be stopped the software proceeds to analyze the most suitable available
canton where this can happen, depending on the characteristics of the surroundings and the
type of evacuation required.

The TCC can use the software to manage the stopping of a high speed train suffering an
emergency situation in a relatively short period of time. The TCC receives the warnings from

the drivers and the control center needs to take the decision to stop the train for whatever rea-
son (signs of blockage on the line, derailment, people or fallen objects on the line, danger on
other nearby lines, etc.). If the TCC operator wishes to know more about the canton and its
characteristics, these can be visualized through the GIS application to support the planning of
any intervention that may be necessary (see Figure 3).

4.1 Study Cases and Sensitivity Analysis

In order to check the robustness of the methodology, a sensitivity analysis was performed. The
sensitivity analysis allows testing to see if changes in the weights can cause changes in the ﬁnal
ranking (Chang et al. 2007; Ishizaka and Nemery 2013). Three cases were selected to perform
the sensitivity analysis with the initial canton where the event was produced, the type of event,
the evacuation procedure required and the stopping canton selected with its global score using
the weights calculated and the aggregation rule (see Table 8). In the cases in which a normal or
emergency evacuation was required, the number of stopping cantons to analyze was limited to
ﬁve, whereas if no evacuation was required, all cantons were introduced in the analysis. The
limit of ﬁve cantons ensures that the trail will stop quickly in the case of an event that requires
applying evacuation procedures.

The results of the sensitivity analysis can be seen in Table 9. In each criterion, the weight
has been increased by 50% to test the robustness of the results. The best alternative selected
was the same in all the cases except in the study case 3 (emergency evacuation) when the weight
of criterion B, Land Use, was increased by 50%. In this scenario the best alternative previously

Figure 4 Ranking of alternatives when criterion B, Land Use priority, is changed (Case 3)

selected (canton 28) was changed by the canton 30 (marked in bold in Table 9). This case is
also considered in Figure 4, which shows how the best alternative changes from 28 to 30 if the
Land Use weight is increase above 0.22 (see vertical dotted line). The remainder of the rankings
were not changed except in the cases of alternatives 27 and 29 when the weight of the criterion
is increased above 0.9. These results show the robustness of the analysis performed. Only very
signiﬁcant increases in the weight of the Land Use criterion caused a change in the ﬁnal solution
and only in the case of an emergency evacuation.

In all the cases, the software was not time-consuming, taking only few seconds (less than ﬁve
seconds) to select the best alternative. The system is therefore prepared to assist safety managers
in a short period of time when an emergency occurs. In this way, rescue teams and emergency
centers near the high speed line can be mobilized as fast as possible before the train stops.

5 Conclusions

This article has proposed a methodology to improve decision-making in the management of a
high speed railway network by quickly ﬁnding the most suitable place to stop a high speed train
in the case of an undesired event occurring. This research has aimed at improving the reliability
and safety of high speed rail transport, a mode of transport which has already been widely
introduced throughout Europe and continues to grow in various countries (e.g. Spain).

The developed methodology is based on using a GIS to evaluate the most suitable place to
stop a high speed passenger train faced with an undesired situation. The system allows the user
to visualize the physical characteristics of the stopping area, depending on the type of event.
The implementation of the multicriteria evaluation method in a GIS provides great support to
TCC operators in their decision-making. Given that the computational cost is minimal, the
decision on where to stop the train comes very quickly and, thanks to that, the response can
start almost immediately, thereby reducing the risks associated with incidents or accidents.

The proposed methodology is new and has not been previously applied to high speed railway
networks, although it could also be applied to other case studies on conventional lines or freight
lines by speciﬁcally studying the most inﬂuential criteria in each case (technical variables, vehicle

type, etc.). The alternatives are made up of pre-determined stretches, or cantons, of a railway line
and the criteria are established depending on the available data and the event that occurred. This
research introduces a methodology for providing support for responding to incidents on high
speed railway networks which can be applied in other areas of study.

The results obtained allow emergency stops to be made in the most “useful” zone accord-
ing to the possible consequences of the type of situation. The use of accessibility data and other
relevant network factors combined with the division of the line into segments provide the alter-
native stop locations.

The main advantages of this methodology are:

1. No time consumed during calculation. All calculations take a few seconds.
2.
3. System is really easy to deal with, so users do not need special preparation in railway

safety to use it.

4. The methodology helps safety operators (TCC, emergency services and train drivers) to

work together (improve communication).

The software supports train-drivers’ decisions and shares information with safety opera-
tors at the same time, so the evacuation process can be quick. Input data are minimum and do

not need safety destinations on the evacuation corridors, only the time position at the moment
of the incident and the type of event and evacuation. Emergency centers only need the last train
location and the type of accident and evacuation to mobilize rescue teams as fast as possible. In
addition, this planning tool can improve the access for cantons because now the best stop can-
tons are known before train stops, so rescue teams and safety measures can be planned in
advance.

The proposed system may also complement scheduling methods. Current spatial decision
making systems in reaction to emergency situations concentrate exclusively on route optimiza-
tion and timetable management to try to reduce the effect of the event on the transport network
circulation (Adenso-Diaz et al. 2002). The proposed methodology could become part of future
integrated decision-making systems for, in this case, the management of railways (Forgionne
2003) and with the inclusion of ATP (Automatic Train Protection) the driver could also have
ﬁrst-hand information about the railway network and the best possible place to stop.

Abstract. Traditionally, the classes in thematic maps have been treated as crisp
sets, using classical set theory. In this formulation, map classes are assumed to
be mutually exclusive and exhaustive. This approach limits the ability of thematic
maps to represent
landscapes.
Substitution of fuzzy sets allows more (cid:143) exibility for treatment of map classes in
the areas of accuracy assessment and area estimation. Accuracy assessment
methods based on fuzzy sets allow consideration of the magnitude of errors and
assessment of the frequency of ambiguity in map classes. An example of an
accuracy assessment from a vegetation map of the Plumas National Forest illus-
trates the implementation of these methods. Area estimation based on fuzzy sets
and using accuracy assessment data allows estimation of the area of classes as a
function of levels of class membership. The fuzzy area estimation methods are an
extension of previous methods presented by Card (1982) . One interesting result
is that the sum of the areas of the classes in a map need not be unity. This
approach allows a wider range of queries within a GIS.

1. Introduction

Historically, thematic maps have been a common (arguably the most common)
method for displaying spatially organized data. Currently, their use continues to be
common and pervades geographical information systems both in the form of inputs
to a GIS and as a common result of analysis within a GIS. Their role and importance
is unquestioned. However, thematic maps are an inherently limited way to represent
landscapes. The limitation of thematic maps results from their use of categories to
characterize the continuum of variation found in landscapes. Traditionally, the use
of categories in thematic maps has followed classical set theory, in which each
location in the landscape is assumed to belong to a single map category. Additionally,
the map categories are assumed to be mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Categories,
or sets, that meet these conditions are often termed crisp sets.

The use of thematic maps based on crisp sets results in several implications with
regard to two issues of importance to GIS: map accuracy and area estimation. For
map accuracy assessment, if each map location is a member of a single class, then
all other map categories are equally and completely wrong. Experience in making
thematic maps indicates this assumption is not always appropriate, as many locations
occur near the de® nitional boundaries between map categories. Such a situation
frequently arises in thematic maps of landcover, vegetation or soil classes, where the
map classes represent a continuum of variation in the landscape. Thus, while there
is usually a best map category for each site, there are clearly some categories that
are more wrong than others.

Similarly, the use of crisp sets has profound implications for estimation of the
areas of the map categories. As the categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive,
each location must be a member of exactly one map category. Thus the sum of the
areas of all map categories must be unity. The purpose of this paper is to pursue
methods of reducing the inherent weakness of thematic maps based on crisp sets in
the related areas of accuracy assessment and area estimation. The intent is to use
fuzzy set theory in place of classical set theory. More speci® cally, this paper includes:
(1 ) an example of the use of fuzzy set theory in map accuracy assessment based on
previously published methods (Gopal and Woodcock 1994 ); (2 ) development of
methods for area estimation based on fuzzy sets; and (3 ) an example of the application
of the fuzzy area estimation methods. The last two topics are new extensions to our
previously published work.

The concept of a fuzzy set was introduced by Zadeh (1965 ) to describe imprecision
that is characteristic of much of human reasoning. Fuzzy sets provide a quantitative
approach for dealing with vagueness in complex systems. A primary di(cid:128) erence
between fuzzy set theory and classical set theory concerns membership functions. In
classical set theory, each object or element is either a member of a set or it is not.
Fuzzy set theory allows for grades of membership, providing considerable ¯ exibility
beyond that available using classical set theory. Fuzzy set theory has found use in
many applications, ranging from pattern recognition, control engineering to model-
ling human decision making. Fuzzy sets are increasingly being used in GIS. A spatial
decision support system based on fuzzy logic has been built for ¯ ood simulation and
damage assessment (Leung et al. 1996 ). Fuzzy relational databases, like FRSIS
(Kollias and Voliotis 1991 ), can handle imprecision in data representation and
manipulation and allow for individualization of data. Fuzzy sets have been applied
in land evaluation and suitability analysis (Burrough 1989, Banai 1993, Altman 1994 ).
In making thematic maps from remotely sensed data, three stages can be identi® ed
in the classi® cation process (Foody 1999 ). The ® rst stage is one of class de® nition,
in which class descriptors are generated. In the second stage, class assignment,
assuming crisp logic, each pixel is assigned to the class with which it has the greatest
similarity. The third stage is one of accuracy assessment. Fuzzy sets have been
applied in the second and third stages of classi® cation of remotely sensed data in
making thematic maps. Foody (1999 ) notes that the degree to which fuzziness is
accommodated will be a function of the nature of data sets as well as practical
constraints faced by the analyst.

In conventional classi® cation, a pixel displays full and complete membership in
a single class. This approach is suitable for mapping of classes that are discrete and
mutually exclusive. But many land cover classes are continuous in nature. In addition,

155

the pixel is rarely `pure’ and often contains mixtures of land-cover classes. The
inability of `hard’ classi® cation to represent data containing a signi® cant proportion
of mixed pixels has been a motivating factor for the development of alternative
approaches, including fuzzy classi® cation techniques. In fuzzy classi® cation, a pixel
can display any possible membership level, from full membership in one class to
having varying membership amongst all classes.

Fuzzy classi® cations may be obtained in a number of ways: (i ) fuzzy classi® ers
(Wang 1990, Foody 1992 ), (ii) softening the output of hard classi® cation, such as
from the maximum likelihood technique, (iii) neural networks (Carpenter et al. 1997 ).
These three methods provide fuzzy membership values at each pixel for each class.
Thus, one can easily generate fuzzy maps using these membership values which are
useful in mapping continuous phenomena (Wang 1990, Foody 1992 ). Thus thematic
maps are no longer constrained to only crisp sets.

Conventional measures of accuracy assessment are designed for application with
the results from `hard’ classi® cation and are not suitable for fuzzy classi® cation.
There is a need to accommodate fuzziness in the ground truth data and accuracy
assessment. The present research focuses on this issue. From the perspective of
thematic maps and the topics of accuracy assessment and area estimation, the idea
of varying degrees of membership in map classes for a single map polygon is central.
Consider, for example, possible gradations between two simple classes in a map of
forest and residential . At their extremes, the classes are easily di(cid:128) erentiated. However,
in rural areas housing density can vary considerably, with forest having houses
interspersed. For high densities of houses, the class residential
is unambiguousl y
correct. Similarly, for a site with all trees and no houses the label of forest is correct
and residential
is wrong. However, for intermediate cases map polygons would have
varying degrees of membership in both classes. Similar gradations and transitions
between classes occur in many kinds of thematic maps. The use of fuzzy set theory
provides the framework for acknowledging these varying levels of membership.

2. Map accuracy assessment

The accuracy assessment presented here uses the methods published by Gopal
and Woodcock (1994 ). This example illustrates the utility of the methods and
addresses issues involved in their implementation. The accuracy assessment data
also play a critical role in the following section of fuzzy area estimation.

2.1. Data and methods

The vegetation map for the Plumas National Forest in California is used in both
accuracy assessment and area estimation. This map was produced using Landsat TM
imagery and digital terrain data for use in the management of National Forests for
such purposes as timber inventory and wildlife habitat studies.

In the vegetation map are six main categories, or growth forms: conifer forest,
hardwood forest, brush, meadow, water, and barren/dry grass. The conifer, hardwood,
and brush growth forms were further divided into species associations loosely follow-
ing a vegetation classi® cation system called CALVEG (Matyas and Parker 1980 ).
In addition, conifer polygons received labels for crown cover and tree size, which
were derived from the inversion of a forest canopy re¯ ectance model (Woodcock
et al. 1994a). In this paper, only the most general level of the map is considered for
accuracy assessment and area estimation. A complete set of accuracy assessment

tables for species associations and conifer cover can be found in Woodcock et al.
(1994b).

To assess the accuracy of the vegetation maps, locations assigned to each map
category were visited. The sample sites were randomly selected within each of the
six growth forms and transferred to air photos for ® eld visits. More sites were
allocated to the conifer growth form as it covers a large proportion of the area and
had tree size, cover and species association labels that required assessment.

A larger number of sample sites were selected and transferred to air photos than
could be visited in the 14 days available for ® eldwork. The strategy was adopted to
select daily routes that maximized the number of sites visited. This approach resulted
in 160 sites being visited in the ® eld. This strategy worked well except for the
hardwood class. The reason is that hardwood trees frequently grow in the steep and
inaccessible canyons and as a result hardwood sites were more frequently omitted
than other map categories due to inaccessibility. Since the map categories of the
sites were not known when selecting routes, this problem was not discovered until
after the ® eld data collection was completed. Thus, there are fewer sites than would
be desirable in the hardwood class.

The accuracy assessment is based on comparing the map label assigned to each
sample site with the evaluations given by the expert. At each site the expert assigns
a rating for each possible map label. The rating system uses a linguistic scale, based
on the premise that experts most often use linguistic constructs to describe map
accuracy. The linguistic values and the descriptions used by the experts to evaluate
a map class at a site are:

(5 ) Absolutely right: No doubt about the match. Perfect.
(4 ) Good answer : Would be happy to ® nd this answer given on the map.
(3 ) Reasonable or acceptable answer : Maybe not the best possible answer but it
is acceptable; this answer does not pose a problem to the user if it is seen on
the map.

(2 ) Understandable but wrong : Not a good answer. There is something about the
site that makes the answer understandable but there is clearly a better answer.
This answer is a problem.

(1 ) Absolutely wrong : This answer is absolutely unacceptable and completely

wrong.

The use of discrete levels of class membership is a practical solution to the
di(cid:129) cult problem of determining levels of class memberships for accuracy assessment
sites. One limitation of this approach is that it does not make full use of fuzzy sets,
as fuzzy membership values are usually continuously varying between 0 and 1. One
issue that merits further attention concerns methods for assigning levels of class
membership to sites on a map. One possibility is to use quantitative ® eld measure-
ments which can be translated into levels of class membership. While we have made
some e(cid:128) orts in this direction (Milliken and Woodcock 1996 ) there is a de® nite need
for further work.

A few of the di(cid:128) erences between traditional map accuracy assessment methods
and the procedures used here are worth noting. First, each expert uses the above
® ve linguistic values for assessing sample sites. These ratings or scores are used to
estimate the membership value of each map class at each sample site. This allows
the experts to acknowledge any existing heterogeneity in the vegetation cover in the
site or ambiguity regarding map classes. The expert is not limited to a single match

157

for a site or bound to the existence of a perfect match for each site. Second, a blind
testing procedure is used, meaning the expert has no knowledge of the map data
while assessing a site. The expert has to evaluate all map categories at each test site
using the linguistic membership scale, so there is no need or temptation to provide
the expert with the actual mapped category for each test site.

The analysis of the data for the sample sites using fuzzy functions results in a set
of three tables. The nature of the tables have been described in detail by Gopal and
Woodcock (1994 ), and are explained here brie¯ y when used.

2.2. Results

Table 1 reports the results of two fuzzy measures called `MAX’ and `RIGHT’,
which measure accuracy in terms of the frequency of matches and mismatches. MAX
uses the highest rating given to a category for a given site to measure a match and
provides a conservative estimate of accuracy. Thus, the matches in the MAX column
indicate sites where the highest rating was given to the class assigned in the map.
The second measure, RIGHT, accepts matches using any degree of right, which in
the linguistic scale used here is any score greater than or equal to 3. The use of the
MAX and RIGHT functions separates the traditional question of `how accurate is
the map?’ into the following two more precise questions:

How frequently is the class assigned in the map the best choice for the site?
How frequently is the class assigned in the map acceptable?

The overall accuracy of the map is shown in two ways. First, the row labeled
`Total’ in table 1 gives the number and percent of the accuracy assessment sites that
are matches using the MAX function (83%) and the RIGHT function (94%). These
numbers translate literally as the map label having been given the highest rating at
83% of the sites, and at least a RIGHT rating at 94% of the sites. Second, the
bottom row of table 1 shows the weighted accuracy, where the accuracies of the
individual classes are weighted by their areas. This measure of accuracy is the best
overall assessment and shows 85% for the MAX function and 94% for the RIGHT
function. Table 3 shows the water and conifer classes to be extremely accurate, with
little room for improvement between the MAX and RIGHT results. The results for

the meadow and barren/grass categories are also high but show de® nite improvement
between the MAX and RIGHT functions. Hardwood and brush are the most trouble-
some categories. Both have low accuracies for the MAX function, and both improve
using the RIGHT function, with brush accuracies becoming high. Hardwood accuracy
is still undesirably low using the RIGHT function (60%), indicating it is the least
reliable category in the map.

The DIFFERENCE function is designed to measure the magnitude of errors,
and is calculated as the score for the class assigned in the map minus the highest
score given to any other class. For the ideal case, where the mapped category is
perfectly right (score = 5) and all other categories are absolutely wrong (score = 1 ),
the DIFFERENCE function yields a 4. All sites that are matches using the MAX
function have DIFFERENCE values greater than or equal to 0 and all mismatches

matches for the meadow and barren/grass classes are small in magnitude, which is
not surprising given the signi® cant increase in accuracy of the RIGHT function
compared to the MAX function.

One important kind of information is the categorical nature of the errors, or
between which categories confusion occurs. In a traditional analysis, this information
is contained in the o(cid:128) -diagonal elements of an error or confusion matrix (Congalton
1991 ). Similar tables can be constructed using the CONFUSION and AMBIGUITY
functions based on fuzzy sets. The CONFUSION function identi® es classes with a
rating greater than the mapped class and is identical to a traditional confusion
matrix except that more than one map category can have a rating higher than the
mapped class at a single site. The values from the CONFUSION function are the
® rst values given in the columns headed with symbol f below the expert evaluations
in table 3. The AMBIGUITY function identi® es categories with the same rating as
the mapped category. The values for the AMBIGUITY function are given in the
same table in the column headed by the symbol g. The information on the equally

rated categories is particularly interesting for users of the maps when the matrix is
not symmetric.

The most striking result in table 3 is that there are many brush sites (10 ) that
received higher ratings for the conifer class than for the brush class. This result is
undoubtedly related to the class de® nitions, which require polygons with greater
than 10% cover of conifer trees to be assigned to the conifer class. Given that there
may be extensive brush under such a sparse conifer canopy, it is often di(cid:129) cult to
detect the conifer component of these sites using satellite remote sensing. A similar

problem exists with the hardwood class, where three sites received higher ratings for
the conifer class. There is also signi® cant confusion between the hardwood and brush
classes. Four sites labelled hardwood had higher ratings from the expert for the brush
class. Additionally, the AMBIGUITY function shows that two sites where hardwood
and brush received equal ratings were assigned to the hardwood class in the map.

3. Area estimation based on fuzzy sets

One question frequently asked in relation to thematic maps is the areal extent
of the various map categories. The area of a category as it appears in a map is one
estimate of its true area. This estimate is accurate under either of the following two
conditions: (1 ) the map is perfectly accurate, or (2 ) when the errors of omission
match the errors of commission for each map category. Both these conditions are
unlikely, and a variety of methods have been published to improve area estimates
from maps using the data collected for a conventional accuracy assessment based
on a set of samples from the map. The approach of Card (1982 ) is the most direct
and easily implemented, and amounts to distributing the area associated with each
accuracy assessment sample from a map category into its true category. Hay (1988 )
and Jupp (1989 ) also published methods which involve normalizing the confusion
matrix and estimating conditional probabilities. All of these approaches are based
on the use of crisp sets and result in the sum of the areas for the map categories
being equal to unity. By substituting fuzzy sets for crisp sets, the conditions resulting
in the sum of the areas being equal to unity do not frequently occur, and it is possible
to consider the areas of map categories as a function of levels of class membership.
Critical to the problem of area estimation using fuzzy sets is an understanding
of the distribution of
levels of class membership. For the Plumas dataset, this
distribution if illustrated in ® gure 1(a± d ). Figure 1(a) shows the frequencies for di(cid:128) er-
ent numbers of classes having received fuzzy set memberships of at least 5. This
® gure indicates that in 73 sites, no classes were assigned membership ratings of 5,
and in the remaining 87 sites, only a single class received a rating of 5. This result
is not surprising, as clearly all sites in a map are not perfect matches with one of
the map classes. Similarly, it is hard to imagine a site that is a perfect match with
more than one class, and ® gure 1(a) shows that no sites were given a rating of 5 for
more than one class. Figure 1(b) shows the distribution of sites with respect to
numbers of classes with ratings greater than or equal to 4. Interestingly, there were
6 sites which did not receive a rating of 4 or more for any map class. The over-
whelming majority of sites received a rating of 4 or more for only a single map class.
There were also three sites where 3 classes were deemed a good match. This trend
of increasing numbers of classes being deemed a match as the level of class member-
ship is decreased continues in ® gure 1(c), which uses a cut-o(cid:128) of class membership
values greater or equal to 3. Figure 1(d ) shows the frequency of class membership
for the very weak level of membership of 2. As indicated, often there are sites where
as many as three or four map classes meet this weak level of membership. Given
that a 1 is the lowest level of class membership using the linguistic scale presented,
all classes would meet this level of class membership for all sites, and thus plotting
the distribution is meaningless.

3.1. Methodology for fuzzy area estimation

Background on Card ’s Method. The approach adopted here for estimating the
area of map categories as a function of fuzzy membership levels is an extension of

the methods used by Card (1982 ) for crisp sets. Card’s method for estimating true
map proportions (pÃ i) requires a contingency table containing sample points selected
either randomly or by random strati® ed sampling. Sampling points are assigned to
cells in the contingency table depending on the map class (j) of the sample point,
and the true class (i), as determined by some independent means. The values in the
cells of the contingency table are counts, n ij , of accuracy assessment samples and r
refers to number of map classes. Also required are the map marginal proportions,
pj , which are readily available in most remote sensing and GIS applications
(see ® gure 2(a)). Marginal proportions refer to relative areas of each map category.
Row and column totals are calculated respectively as:

j = 1
Estimates of the true map proportions (pÃ i) are the sum of the cell probabilities for
the row for each class, which are calculated as follows:

n i. = (cid:158)

n ij

r

i= 1

n.j = (cid:158)

Figure 2(b) is an example of the matrix of cell probabilities, pÃ ij . Card’s work is
presented in terms of proportions of map classes, which can be easily converted to
areas using the areas for the map classes and the total area of the map, both of
which are usually readily available. Conceptually, Card’s approach weighs each
sample from a map class according to the number of samples from that class and
the proportion of the map assigned to the class, or pj /nj . The distribution of the
samples from map class j among the true classes i, as contained in the n ij , determines
how the area in map class j is redistributed.

F uzzy Area Estimation. To use Card’s method for estimating true class propor-
tions together with our fuzzy set representation for class membership, a change is
required in the way sample points are assigned to the contingency table. For this
treatment, we have tried to continue and extend the notation used by Card and by
Gopal and Woodcock (1994 ). The intent is to estimate the area of a class as a
function of levels of fuzzy membership (m), or pÃ mi. This term corresponds to the
estimate of the map proportion of class i for fuzzy membership values greater than
or equal to m.

Each sample is evaluated for inclusion in each column (j) of the map class (i) to
which it belongs. A sample is counted toward the count nmij if it meets the following
conditions: the sample (x) is from map class i, and mj (x)> m, where m is a threshold
of class membership. In this way, a new contingency table can be calculated for each
value of m. For use in fuzzy area estimation these contingency tables carry with them
the original map marginal totals (pj ) and same column (or sample) totals (nj ), but
the row totals (nmi) are recalculated for each new contingency table (® gure 3(a)).
Thus the information on the original map proportions and numbers of samples
within each map class are preserved in order to weight appropriatel y the area
associated with each sample. This formulation results in several conditions which
di(cid:128) er signi® cantly from the formulation based on crisp sets. First, the row and
column totals may not match, i.e.

r

j = 1

nj Þ

r

i= 1

Figure 3(b). This ® gure shows cell probabilities calculated based on the contingency table
presented in ® gure 3(a).

For high values of m, some samples will not satisfy the conditions above for any
class. For the Plumas data this is illustrated for m= 5 in ® gure 1(a) by the 73 samples
for which a value greater than or equal to 5 was not observed. Alternatively, for low
values of m, one sample may be counted toward more than one class (j).

The calculation of the estimates of the true class proportions for any value of m

proceed in the same manner as Card:

pÃ mj = (cid:158)

pÃ mij = (cid:158)

r

j = 1

r

j = 1

Notice that to solve for pÃ mi as a function of m, the only variables that change are the
elements nmij of the contingency table. Figure 3(b) shows a matrix of
fuzzy cell
probabilities.

3.2. Application in the Plumas National Forest

The results of application of the fuzzy area estimation methods for the Plumas
National Forest are given in tables 4(a, b), 5(a, b), 6(a, b) and 7(a, b) for class member-
ship levels of 5, 4, 3, and 2 respectively. Table 4(a) shows that outside of the water

Table 4(a). This table shows the fuzzy contingency table for a class membership level of 5
for the Plumas vegetation map. The row marked `Total’ is the total number of sample
sites that received a 5, while the `Sample Total’ is all the sites visited. Note that all of
the water sites received a rating of 5, while very few of the brush, meadow, or hard-
wood sites received a 5. See ® gure 3(a) for a conceptual example of this table.

The area estimate for the conifer class at level 5 includes area initially assigned to
the conifer, meadow and brush classes, as indicated in tables 4(a) and (b). Notice that
the total area in the map estimated to be `perfect matches’ is only 60% of the
map area.

As the class membership level is relaxed to 4, several interesting patterns emerge
(table 5(a, b)). Many of the samples from the brush class meet this level of class
membership in other classes. This situation is particularly true for the conifer class,
where 11 of the brush samples become members of the conifer class. Signi® cant area
is contributed to the conifer class from that orginally mapped as brush. Also note
that the sum of the areas for the classes for this level of class membership exceeds
the area of the map. This situation is the direct result of sample sites receiving class
memberships of 4 or higher for more than one class, as illustrated in ® gure 1(b).

With the exception of water, as class membership levels are further relaxed the
area estimates for the classes continue to increase, and the total area estimates grow
well past unity (tables 6(b) and 7(b)). In particular, the brush class grows signi® cantly
at these more lenient levels of class membership. This result is due to the nature of
the landscape in this National Forest, where chaparral vegetation occurs in varying
degrees in many locations. Where conifer trees have only 10% cover, the area is best
mapped as conifer. However, in many of these sparse conifer stands, brush is a
common understorey, and so at lenient levels of class membership these sites become
part of the brush class. Notice at the class membership level of 3 (a reasonable answer
for the site, for which a better answer might exist ), the area estimate for the conifer
class is almost 76% (table 6 (b)) of the area of the National Forest. This ® gure is in
striking contrast to the 51% (table 4(b)) estimate of areas having the most conservat-
ive level of class membership (5, perfect match). This di(cid:128) erence indicates that roughly
one quarter of the area of the National Forest occurs with very sparse coverage of
conifer trees mixed extensively with brush and hardwoods. Also note that this
estimate di(cid:128) ers signi® cantly from the 63% of the area assigned to the conifer class
in the map (table 4(a)).

Figure 4 summarizes the results of tables 4± 7 by showing the ratio of the area
estimate to the area in the map for each class as a function of class membership.
The water class, which is easily de® ned using crisp sets, shows no change as a
function of class membership. However, the other classes go through di(cid:128) erent rates
of increase in areas estimates as levels of class membership are decreased.

Figure 4. This ® gure shows the ratio of the estimated area to the area shown in the map for
each class as a function of class membership levels. All the data for this graph is in
tables 3(b)± 6(b). Note how the area estimates for most classes increase signi® cantly as
levels of class membership decrease, with water being the notable exception.

Conventional Area Estimation. For comparison purposes, we provide a conven-
tional confusion matrix using boolean logic or crisp sets for the Plumas data set
(tables 8(a, b)). The accuracy of the map using conventional crisp sets is 80.625
(129/160). Note that in 21 (out of 160 ) sites, two or three classes got the same
membership rating and one class was randomly picked as the winning class. The
kappa value for this data set is 0.74. The total area estimate is 1.0 and the overall
probability correct using Card’s method is 0.85.

A comparison of the conventional contingency matrix using crisp sets (table 8 )
with those produced using the fuzzy sets (tables 4± 7 ) reveal that the fuzzy area
estimates vary with di(cid:128) erent membership values. The overall probability correct
(sum of diagonals) using fuzzy area estimation methods for the Plumas National
Forest for class membership levels of 5, 4, 3, and 2 are 0.58, 0.83, 0.94, 0.98 respectively.
Card’s method produces an overall probability correct of 0.85. Fuzzy sets are thus
able to show what happens to area estimation when fuzzy class membership values
are incorporated. There is very little di(cid:128) erence in the two methods for water and

conifers. But di(cid:128) erences emerge for other classes. Brush, for example, would result in
di(cid:128) erent estimates using the fuzzy set approach and may represent reality on the
ground better than the conventional approach.

4. Discussion and conclusions

The use of fuzzy set representations for classes in thematic maps relaxes some of
the restrictions imposed by classical set theory, and thus expands the kinds of
information than can be provided through accuracy assessment. In addition to
information on the frequency and categorical nature of errors in a thematic map,
methods based on fuzzy sets can provide a measure of the magnitude of errors in a
map, as well as assess ambiguity between map categories. The accuracy assessment
presented for the Plumas National Forest illustrates the use of these methods and
the kinds of information that can be provided.

Using crisp sets, the only query possible is the area of each class. Using fuzzy set
theory it is possible to make queries regarding areas meeting certain criteria, or
membership levels. Consider an example regarding wildlife habitat and vegetation
maps. A species of bird might require the presence of conifer trees for nesting to
make a site suitable habitat. Conifer trees would by de® nition occur in a class called
conifer forest, but many conifer trees might also occur in areas better mapped as
other classes, such as hardwood forest, or shrub woodland. Using the approaches
presented here it would be possible to query regarding levels of membership in the
conifer forest class which would be su(cid:129) ciently low to include areas where conifer
trees are only present, regardless of the fact that those areas had been mapped in
other classes.

In some ways, the slightly di(cid:128) erent view of the area estimation problem presented
in this paper is common to many problems involving GIS. Area estimation becomes
a speci® c case of the more general question of determining which locations meet
certain sets of conditions. This kind of problem is now common in GIS, where in a
map overlay procedure the intersection or union of various map categories is deter-
mined and their area measured. A simple example might be the area of a particular
vegetation type that occurs on a speci® c soil type. Given thematic maps of both soil
and vegetation types, this can be easily accomplished in a GIS. Similarly, the area
that is either the particular vegetation type or the speci® c soil type could be deter-
mined, with the area meeting the second set of conditions always being greater than
or equal to the area satisfying the ® rst set of conditions. For these kinds of questions

of determining areas meeting various conditions, questions of their sums equaling
unity are irrelevant. As the problem of area estimation is viewed from fuzzy set
theory, this assumption of unity for the sums of the areas of map categories also
becomes irrelevant.

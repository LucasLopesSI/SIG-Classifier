Abstract Sharing personal activities on social networks is very popular nowadays, where
the activities include updating status, uploading dining photos, sharing video clips, etc.
Finding travel interests hidden in these vast social activities is an interesting but challeng-
ing problem. In this work, we attempt to discover travel interests based on the spatial and
temporal information of geo-tagged photos. Obviously the visit sequence of a traveler can
be approximately captured by her shared photos based on the timestamps and geo-locations.
To extract underlying travel topics from abundant visit sequences, we study a novel mixture
model to estimate the visiting probability of regions of attractions (ROAs). Such travel top-
ics can be used in different applications, such as advertisements, promotion strategies, and
city planning. To enhance the estimation result, we propose a mutual reinforcement frame-
work to improve the quality of ROAs. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and demonstrate our
findings by the photo sharing activities collected from FlickrTM.

1 Introduction

With the popularity of GPS embedded devices, huge amount of geo-tagged data is gene-
rated in recent years and makes it possible to mine out travel related knowledge. This area
has seen a significant increase in attention over the past decade, where the mining prob-
lems include pointing the next visiting location [6, 25], planning a tour route [25, 38],
and suggesting interesting landmarks [23, 27, 33, 35, 43]. All these works aim to rec-
ommend trip knowledge for individuals, thus need to know users’ personal information,
such as their profiles [6, 23], historical locations [6, 25, 33, 35, 43], current location [25,
38, 43], or their preferences [27]. However, such personal information may not be avail-
able due to privacy concerns [5, 10] or cold-start issues (e.g., newly registered users). In
this work, instead of giving trip recommendations for each individual user, we study how
to summarize popular travel topics for a city by analyzing historical geo-tagged data of
travelers. In particular, such knowledge is important for travel agencies to plan their topic-
oriented tours, such as culture-oriented tours, shopping-oriented tours, or kids-oriented
tours. The topic tours are also important for the tourism department of a government to
learn its main travel topics, thus well deploy its facilities in order to promote its tourism
industry.

Typically there are two common approaches to summarize the main travel topics of a
city: (1) expert-based and (2) data-based. In the first approach, tourism experts are invited to
subjectively classify the landmarks of the city into several categories. However, this method
is not suitable to tour recommendations since a travel is not only decided by landmark
categories but also other constraints (e.g., spatial and temporal). Thus we tackle this problem
with the second approach (i.e., data-based) in this work. To our understanding, geo-tagged
data can reveal the ‘footprints’ and ‘behaviors’ of travelers, thus can well extract the travel
topics of a city.

We illustrate our idea by the following example. Suppose that we collect a set of
geo-tagged photos from three travelers ua, ub, and uc at NYC. Figure 1 plots their tour
sequences based on the taken time and geo-location of the photos, where a camera icon
represents a set of photos taken in a region of attraction and an arc represents a tran-
sit from one region to another region. For instance, traveler ua’s tour starts at Wall
Street and subsequently passes through Statue of Liberty, Roman Catholic
Church, and Empire State Building. Finally, ua ends her trip at Apple Store.
From the high co-occurrence of the visited regions (four common regions), travelers ua
and ub should have some common travel interests. On the other hand, the travel inter-
ests of uc should be different from the others since she only visits museums in her
trip.

In practice, the geo-tagged data can be extracted from traveler activities in several ways,
such as metro card records [29], mobile phone signals [2], etc. However, most of them are
not public available due to privacy concerns. Fortunately, there are an increasing number of
people sharing their geo-tagged data over public social network services, such as Flickr™,
Picasa™, and Photobucket™, which enables to analyze the user behaviors using their geo-
tagged data.

Intuitively, the trip (i.e., regions of attraction (ROAs)) of a traveler is often driven by
her interests. If a group of travelers visits similar ROAs, we simply conclude that they
have common interests (i.e., a travel topic). For example, a group of travelers may prefer
to visit natural landscapes such as forests, parks, mountains and rivers, while another group
of travelers may prefer to take photos at famous landmarks such as Times Square and
United Nations.

tional probability to visit an ROA ri under topic
extract a set of travel topics based on the information of geo-tagged data. We add a note that
our problem is different from trajectory mining work [1, 12, 17, 19, 26] where their anal-
ysis are mainly based on the visiting order of ROAs. However, travelers who share similar
travel interests may have completely different routes to visit the same set of ROAs so that
the trajectory based solutions are not applicable to our problem.

−→
θ is highly related to the quality of ROAs
(i.e., R = {r1, ..., rN }). However, the shape and size of ROAs cannot be defined easily.
For instance, the region of Apple Store may only be a small area while the Wall
Street is a large region since travelers often visit the entire district instead of any single
area of it. To define a good quality set of ROAs, a straightforward solution is to select R
from the landmarks of a city. However, this approach may omit some travel topics. As an
example, travelers may visit some regions out of landmarks. Another approach to define R
is to cluster the data [20, 21, 34, 39] based on their geographical locations and data density
using standard clustering approaches. Given the clustering result as an input, our second
mission in this work is to further enhance the identification of ROAs using a mutual rein-
forcement framework. This idea has the same intuition of [42, 43] where ROAs and travel
trajectories are mutually reinforced.

Geoinformatica

We summarize our main contributions in this manuscript as follows.

– We transform the travel topic discovery problem into a multinomial mixture probability
model such that the travel topics can be estimated by Expectation-Maximization. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first work to adopt this model for travel topic
analysis.

– We propose a mutual reinforcement framework that iteratively refines the travel topics
and regions of attraction. Our experiments demonstrate that the reinforcement process
improves the overall identification quality.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We provide the formal definitions and adopt
a probabilistic mixture model to estimate the travel topics in Section 2. The solution of
travel topics extraction is discussed thoroughly in Section 3. In Section 4, we experimentally
evaluate our methods using real data collected from Flickr™. Section 5 discusses related
work. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

2 Preliminaries

In this section, we formally define the fundamental elements of our travel topic discovery
problem, such as tour trajectory, region of attraction, and travel topic. Furthermore, we
discuss how the discovery problem can be viewed as an optimization problem such that the
best travel topics can be estimated by Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM).

We first define an ROA and a tour trajectory as follows, where these two concepts are

thoroughly used in our solution.

Definition 1 (Region of attraction, ROA) A region of attraction, r, is the convex polygon
of a set of geo-tagged photos.

Definition 2 (Tour trajectory) A trajectory, ti = {ti,1, ..., ti,n} ∈ T, is a bag of geo-locations
of photos taken by the same user with corresponding taken-time, where ti,j donates the j -th
geo-location in ti.

Given a geo-tagged photo dataset, a tour trajectory ti (see Definition 2) can be extracted
from the photos taken by a traveler. According to the taken time of the photos, we can
construct a tour trajectory ti = {ti,1, ..., ti,n} where ti,j indicates the geo-location of the j -th
taken photo in ti. Typically, a tour trajectory ti = {ti,1, ..., ti,n} should be decomposed into
{ti,1, ..., ti,j } and {ti,j +1, ..., ti,n} if the time interval between ti,j and ti,j +1 is too long (48
hours) since they are not likely in the same tour.

As introduced in Section 1, the set of regions of attraction (ROAs) (see Definition 1)
visited by a traveler is driven by her travel interests. Figure 2 illustrates 4 different tour
trajectories where these trajectories may reveal their travel interests. For example, the travel
interests of t4 are unlikely similar to t1 and t2 as they visit different sets of ROAs, {r3, r4}
vs {r1, r2, r4}.

Given the trajectories and ROAs, our mission is to summarize a group of travel topics
that reveal the travel interests of travelers. In this work, a travel topic is represented by the
probability of visiting each ROA. We formally define a travel topic

θ as follows.

Discussion Similar to other topic discovery problems [4, 15, 18, 41], the optimization (5)
can be solved by the EM algorithms. However, discovering travel topics is more challenging
since the set of ROAs R and the number of travel topics K are enormously varying from

distribution. Although R and
θ 1:K can be defined by clustering [39, 43] and incremental
topic discovery [3, 18] respectively, there is no prior work to study how to optimize the
quality of these two techniques in a unified framework. In this work, we propose a novel
solution, named Mutual Reinforcing Travel Topic Discovery (MRTD), that iteratively refines
−→
θ 1:K and R until their identification quality is converged.

3 Mutually reinforcing travel topic discovery

3.1 Incremental travel topic construction

In this section, we discuss how to construct travel topics incrementally based on a set of pre-
defined ROAs R. The motivation of this incremental process is providing an automatic way
to decide a suitable number of topics for different cities. When constructing a new travel
topic, we should consider 2 conditions, (1) if the new travel topic is a common interest
shared by a group of travelers (i.e., level of confidence) and (2) if the new travel topic is
different from the other travel topics in the result (i.e., level of duplication). Based on these
concerns, we propose a 3-steps framework to construct the travel topics.

Constructing a travel topic Given a trajectory ti, we can construct a new travel topic
−→
θ ti based on a set of similar trajectories, where the set of similar trajectories can be formed
by the following equation.

(7)

where pass(ti, tj , r) return 1 if both ti and tj pass through r, and 0 otherwise, e.g.,
pass(t1, t2, r1)=1 in the example of Fig. 2. While the numerator can be viewed as the com-
mon interest of two trajectories and the denominator is a normalization factor. According
to our experimental study, the definition of Tti
sim may be too strict in practice as the length
of the trajectories is largely varying. This turns out that very few trajectories can fulfill the
threshold due to the length variance. Thereby, we revise the definition of Tti
sim such that it
considers not only the trajectory in its entirety but also its subsequences of length larger than
4. If there are more than one subsequences fulfilling the threshold, we only pick the longest
subsequence into Tti
sim. For instance, given ti = {r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9} and λsim = 0.5, the
subsequences of tj (= {r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6}) of length larger than 4 are {r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6},
{r1, r2, r3, r4, r5}, and {r2, r3, r4, r5, r6}. We only pick {r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6} into Tti
sim since
it is the longest one fulfilling the threshold.

Given Tti

Smoothing In the above discussions, we have introduced how to discover travel topics with
an incremental mixture probability framework, where the quality of the travel topics highly
depends on the photo points of tour trajectories. In practice, those points (photos) are sparse
comparing with the footprint of travelers. In other words, they probably visit some areas that
are close to their photo locations. In order to take these areas into consideration, we perform
a smoothing technique which propagates the probability of a region to its nearby regions.

Figure 4 demonstrates an example to smooth a travel topic over 3 ROAs. In the original
−→
θ , travelers visit only r1; however, it may overlook surrounding areas (e.g., r2
travel topic
and r3). After smoothing, it propagates some probability to surrounding ROAs, r2 and r3.
Note that r1 propagates more probability to r2 than to r3 since r2 is closer to r1 than r3.

In this work, we use an 2D Gaussian smoothing technique. We assume latitude and lon-
gitude are independent, with the same variance (i.e., the covariance of latitude and longitude
is zero). In particular, the smoothing function for a travel topic

3.2 Regions of attraction refinement

Instead of manually defined ROAs, we recommend to identify ROAs by clustering
techniques [39, 43, 44] as the clustering result should better reflect the footprint of trav-
elers. However, these clustering techniques only take into account of distance and density
information in their processing. In this work we introduce a refinement approach which
polishes ROAs by additionally considering other closeness metrics.

Geoinformatica

Intuitively, two neighbor ROAs should be merged if they attract similar set of tourists.
The similarity can be assessed by the divergence closeness of their travel topic associations.
By pairing up with other closeness measures, we propose a novel refinement framework to
polish ROAs for travel topic analysis. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first work to
identify ROAs based on the result from a mixture model (i.e., travel topics). In the following,
we first introduce three closeness measures of ROAs and then introduce our refinement
algorithm.

Travel topic distribution closeness A travel topic is described as the probability dis-
tribution over different ROAs (as shown in Fig. 3b). By using Bayes’ formula, we

where π1:k are the weights of travel topics in the mixture model which can be derived from
Eq. 5 when

Accordingly, we can measure the closeness of two ROAs by computing the diver-
gence of their travel topic associations. In this work, the divergence is calculated by
JS-divergence (Jensen-Shannon divergence) [28]. For the sake of presentation, we simply

According to Eq. 14, an ROA is divergence close to another ROA if they are co-visited
by a large set of tour trajectories. For instance, in Fig. 3a, r1 and r2 are divergence close
−→
θ 2. Obviously, r1
since their distribution over different topics are resembling in
and r2 should be merged into one ROA since they are adjacent in spatial and co-visited by
many tour trajectories.

−→
θ 1 and

Spatial closeness In some cases, we should not merge two divergence close
instance, Empire State
ROAs since they are not close in spatial space. For
Building and Statue of Liberty are co-visited by a large amount of travel-
ers but we should not merge them into one ROA because they are geographically
apart.

Geoinformatica

In this work, we assess the spatial closeness of two ROAs using Voronoi diagram and
Euclidean distance. We call an ROA ri spatially close to another ROA rj if and only if ri
is a neighbor of rj in Voronoi diagram and their minimum Euclidean distance (see Eq. 11)
is smaller than a threshold λE. The set of ROAs fulfilling the above constraints with ri is
denoted as V (ri, λE). Figure 5 gives an example to explain the spatial closeness, where
the Voronoi diagram is constructed based on the objects of each ROA. We say that r3 is a
Voronoi neighbor of r2 since there is at least one Voronoi cell of r3 being a neighbor of r2.
However, they are not spatially close since their minimum distance DE(r2, r3) is larger than
the threshold λE.

Sequence closeness In some situations (e.g., two ROAs on the different sides of river
without a bridge nearby), we may merge two ROAs incorrectly based on only divergence
and spatial closeness. Therefore we use sequence closeness to address such problems. We
call r1 and r2 sequentially close, DS(r1, r2) = true, if r1 and r2 are consecutively visited
in at least one of the trajectories. Formally, DS(ri, rj ) = true if and only if ∃tm,n ∈ T,
R(tm,n) = ri ∧ R(tm,n+1) = rj .

Refinement algorithm We use a depth first approach to polish ROAs based on the
closeness metrics. At the beginning of an iteration, we pick the most popular ROA
ri from R, where the popularity is based on the number of tours passing it. Then,
into a candidate set C. For every ROA rj ∈ R − C, we add rj into
we assign ri
is close to some ROA ri ∈ C in terms of their divergence, spatial, and
C if rj
sequence closeness. We terminate a running iteration if there is no more rj
fulfill-
ing the closeness constraints. Finally, we construct a new ROA by merging all ri ∈
C and remove the elements in C from R. We iteratively execute the above proce-
dures until R becomes empty. We list the pseudocode for the regions refinement in
Algorithm 2.

Figure 6 shows an example of the merging. In this example, the solid line between two
ROAs ri and rj indicates that ri and rj fulfill the spatial and sequence constraints. The value
on the lines represents the JS-divergence of ri and rj . Suppose that λJ S is set to 0.3 and r1

is the first selected ROA. We add r2 and r4 into C since they are close to r1 in terms of all
closeness measures. Subsequently, r3 is added into C since r3 is close to r2. At the end of
this iteration, we construct a refined ROA by merging r1, r2, r3, and r4. In the next iteration,
we construct another refined ROA by merging r5 and r6.

3.3 Mutual reinforcement

As shown in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, the travel topics are constructed based on a set of ROAs
while the ROA refinement is done by giving a set of travel topics. It is obvious that we can
manage these two processes into an iterative framework. We first obtain a set of small ROAs,
R(0), by a standard clustering approach. Then, we perform Algorithm constructT opics to

metadata are came from 2 sources (4 of the datasets are crawled from Flickr™ and 4 of
them are provided by Yahoo! WebscopeTM Program [36]. Table 1 shows the detail statistic
of our datasets.

For the sake of identification quality, we keep a tour trajectory in the datasets only if it
contains 10 or more photos at different locations. We generate a set of initial ROAs R by
applying mean-shift algorithm [7] on the raw datasets. The ROAs who are visited by at least
2 users are used as the input of Algorithm 3.

In this work, we empirically determined the parameter values by investigating the first
few travel topics. As a note, the performances are not very sensitive to the similarity
ratio λsim (default 0.6), JS-divergence threshold λJ S (default 0.02), and Euclidean distance
threshold λE (default 50m). The effectiveness of the originality threshold λori (default 10)
is thoroughly evaluated in [18]. The effect of background coefficient b is used to leverage
the effect of those popular ROAs, which is set to a reasonable value (i.e., 0.4).

4.2 Identification of regions of attraction

Though the ROA identification is not the main concern in this work, the quality of ROAs,
however, is important to the travel topic extraction. In this section, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our refinement and reinforcement process (cf. Sections 3.2 and 3.3) on
different clustering techniques [25, 39].

Metric functions The evaluation is based on a set of ground truth ROAs M, that are
extracted from the meta-data of OpenStreetMap.2 In this work, we use a score function,
Score(R, M), to assess the identification quality, which aims to assess the uniqueness of
the identification. We claim that an ROA ri accurately identifies a ground truth region mj
if all photos in mj are contained in ri. Given a ground truth region mj , the most accurate
ROA r ∗

j that identifies mj can be defined as follows.

We use an example in Fig. 8 to demonstrate Score(R, M). In this example, there are three
ROAs R identified by our algorithm and two real ROAs M extracted from OpenStreetMap.
Suppose Score({r1, r2, r3}, M) is 0.95. If we merge r1 and r2, then Score({r1 ∪ r2, r3}, M)
becomes 1 since m2 is uniquely identified by the refined ROA r1 ∪ r2 (i.e., fP (r1 ∪ r2)=1).

Evaluation Our reinforcement framework, Mutual Reinforcing Travel Topic Discovery
(MRTD), requires a set of pre-defined ROAs as input. As reported by [39], mean-shift [25]
and self-tuning [39] are the best two methods to identify ROAs from geo-tagged data. Thus

Fig. 9 Evaluation of ROA identification

Geoinformatica

Fig. 10 Identification of Madison Square Garden

we demonstrate the effect of our ROA refinement process using the result of these methods
as input. For fairness, we tune the best parameters for [25].3

As shown in Fig. 9, our refinement process improves the ROA quality in terms of their
uniqueness (i.e., Score function). This demonstrates merging small ROAs based on their
closeness (i.e., travel topics, spatial, and sequence) is effective.

We illustrate a real ROA identification result in Fig. 10. In this example, Madison
Square Garden is divided into several small ROAs by Mean-shift, that obviously affects
the travel topic analysis. The ROAs returned by our iterative framework are more preferred
as our framework successfully refines a set of small ROAs into a large ROA (i.e., the cov-
erage area is very close to the ground truth ROA). The quality of ROAs is important to our
problem as each travel topic is extracted based on the ROAs (cf. Algorithm 1).

4.3 Travel topic analysis

In this section, we compare our topic discovery result with two recent works, RouteSimi-
larity [44] and Topic-Markov Model [25], and two baseline approaches, Frequent Pattern
tree-based pattern fragment Growth mining method (FP-Growth) [13] and Latent Dirich-
let Allocation (LDA) [4]. RouteSimilarity [44] uses longest common sub-sequence as the
similarity metric and applies hierarchical agglomerative clustering to group similar travel
trajectories as a travel topic. Topic-Markov Model [25] recommends ROAs based on proba-
bilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), where the result of PLSA is analogous to the result
of our mixture probability model. FP-Growth is an efficient method for mining frequent
patterns and LDA is another widely accepted method in topic discovery problems.

We randomly select 10 % trajectories as the testing data. Except the testing data, all
remaining trajectories are treated as the training data. Note that RouteSimilarity [44] does
not summarize the result where each travel topic simply consists of a group of trajecto-
ries instead of a summarization (cf., Definition 3). To fairly assess the performance of
−→
θ i by the number of
RouteSimilarity, we calculate the importance of an ROA rj of a topic
−→
θ i) passing rj . Moreover, every method uses the same set of ROAs (gen-
trajectories (in
erated by MRTD) as input since the quality is better than other clustering approaches (cf.,
Fig. 9).

3Yang et al. [39] is a parameter free technique.

internal tuning, the performance of RouteSimilarity is steadily worse than our method since
RouteSimilarity groups topics by visit order similarity but not by user interests. Thereby,
we only report the best performance of RouteSimilarity in Fig. 12. Interestingly, FP-Growth
has the lowest construction time but its coverage ratio is also the lowest since the extracted
topics contain too many popular ROAs (i.e., over-popular landmarks). Moreover, PLSA is
superior to LDA for travel topic discovery as PLSA can generate a trajectory with cer-
tain accuracy based on fewer topics.4 Our approach, ITC (cf. Algorithm 1), offers the best
coverage ratio in the majority cases since ITC aims at generating trajectories by limited
travel topics (based on the incremental construction and the originality assessment). PLSA
and LDA are better than ITC on the Tokyo dataset when their number of topics are prop-
erly set; however, it is time consuming to tune the best number of topics as shown in
Fig. 13.

Figure 14 shows the coverage ratio as a function of k (i.e., the number of k most sim-
ilar topics) on all datasets. Based on the tradeoff between the quality and the construction

4This is because the travel topics discovered by PLSA do not necessarily follow the Dirichlet distribution.

Geoinformatica

cost, we set the number of topics in PLSA and LDA as 50. ITC consistently outper-
forms other methods in terms of the coverage ratio (except Tokyo). This means that ITC
offers more informative travel topics to users when there are only k most similar topics
available.

4.4 Travel topic illustrations

In this section, we demonstrate our result by plotting the first two travel topics (in terms
of their coefficients πi) and the background (most popular) topic in Pairs, New York and
(cid:3)
Rome. In each travel topic, we report the best 5 ROAs based on their probability p
.
Background topic demonstrates the most common travel interests while a travel topic shows
a special travel interest. To illustrate the result more clearly, we highlight the areas in the
map of the cities and show the representative building of each area in tables.

algorithm. More specifically, the first travel topic visits the famous museums (Louvre
Palace, Great Palace and Tuileries Palace) and 2 historical stations (Gare

dom, will find it is very useful if we recommend this travel topic to them. The second travel
topic mainly recommends the public squares (Place Saint-Michel, Jardins du

des Arts and Pont Neuf). The 2nd topic lists the most awesome open places for tak-
ing photos in Paris, which could be a very good reference to those tourists who would like
to have a recreation trip in Paris. We plot their geographical locations in Fig. 15 for clarity.

Greffenstette [32] studied how to construct high quality trajectories from noise geo-tagged
photos. Jeung et al. [16] refine the trajectory clustering by decomposing large clusters which
helps to detect hidden trajectory patterns by Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Lee et al. [26]
proposed a problem that extracts similar sub-trajectories from a trajectory dataset. Mon-
reale et al. [30] studied a framework which recommends the next moving location based on
trajectory patterns. The development of trajectory mining problems is summarized in [17].
However, all these work focus on the visiting order of trajectories while our work ignores
the visiting order and concentrates on mining the latent interests of tourism. A travel topic
in this work is the interest of ROAs for a group of travelers instead of a single trajectory.

To the best of our knowledge, Zheng et al. [44] is the closest competitor to our work
which extracts travel topics from a set of user trajectories. Their framework first identifies
ROAs by DBSCAN algorithm based on a user trajectory database and then discover simi-
lar trajectories as a travel topic using hierarchical agglomerative clustering, where the the
similarity of two trajectories is measured by their longest common subsequence (LCSS).
The major weakness of their work is that LCSS treats two trajectories as similar when their
visiting orders are similar. As explained in Section 1, the visiting order of tours is not the
most critical factor to identify travel topics. Instead, our approach adopts a mixture model
to extract travel topics based on the visiting ROAs of trajectories. This setting overcomes
the weakness of LCSS such that our approach returns more meaningful result to travelers.
In addition, our solution identifies better ROAs using a mutual reinforcing method instead
of a simple clustering approach (e.g., DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering).

Our work is also related to other tour recommendation problems. Kodama et al. [23]
take user locations and preferences into account such that they can recommend surrounding
locations by a spatial skyline method. Park et al. [31] recommend the locations of the most
preferred items based on user profiles and their context information (i.e., weather informa-
tion, temperature, season, time of day, periods and user location). Shi et al. [35] propose
category-regularized matrix factorization for personalized recommendation system based
on user-to-landmark preferences. Zheng et al. [43] analyze the user-location relationship
and recommend locations based on a HITS framework [22]. Popescu and Grefenstette [33]
adopt collaborate filtering to recommend personalized tours. Hao et al. [14] propose a
Location-Topic model to extract location-representative knowledge from text. Xia et al. [38]
apply Markov chain to conduct travel analysis and provide recommendations. Levandoski
et al. [27] develop a local-aware recommendation system based on location-based rating.
Kurashima et al. [25] propose a Markov-Topic model that combines transition probability
and a spatial topic model based on a probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA). Their
work can be viewed as a competitor to ours as PLSA returns analogous probabilities to our
mixture probability model. To the best of our knowledge, these tour recommendation prob-
lems either recommend the next visiting location or offer a suggested tour route to their
users. Instead, our work aims at revealing travel topics based on user common interests
which helps travel agents, trip advisers and governments to predominate the entire picture
of the tour interests in a city.

Our travel topic extraction is based on topic discovery problems of documents [15,
18, 41] while the corpus words (i.e., regions of attraction) are updated over each itera-
tion in our work. The work [41] is a variant of [15], where [41] provides a study on the
background distribution. Recently, the work [18] derives an idea from [3] that builds a
dynamic model involving significance and novelty. Yin et al. [40] propose a geographi-
cal topic model for the documents with spatial information, which enriches the content
of topic in GPS-associated information such as tweets with location in microblogging.

All these models are adopted for text mining and discovering the topics of documents.
In this work, we extend their ideas to support travel topic extraction from geo-tagged
photoes.

6 Conclusion

In this manuscript, we studied a travel topic extraction problem in geo-tagged photo
datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough study for this problem
based on mixture models. We proposed a novel framework by mutually refining the travel
topics and regions of attraction. We demonstrated that our approach can further improve
the quality of ROAs that are generated by the state-of-the-art clustering techniques. More-
over, our travel topics are particularly helpful in trip recommendation especially when
there is no prior personal information from users. We believe our travel topic discov-
ery techniques are easily integrated into existing trip advisor systems. In the future, we
plan to revisit the iterative refinement procedure where the ROAs are refined by both
merging (i.e., generalizing tourist regions) and partitioning (i.e., specifying tourist spots)
techniques.

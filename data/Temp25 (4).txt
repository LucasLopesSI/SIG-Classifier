Integrating GIS-Based Geo-Atom Theory and Voxel
Automata to Simulate the Dispersal of Airborne
Pollutants

Abstract
Environmental processes are usually conceptualized as complex systems whose dynamics are best under-
stood by examining the relationships and interactions of their constituent parts. The cellular automata
paradigm, as a bottom-up modeling approach, has been widely used to study the macroscopic behavior of
these complex natural processes. However, the cellular automata models are largely restricted to the two-
dimensional spatial perspective even though the process dynamics they represent evolve in the three
spatial dimensions. The objective of this study is to develop a voxel-based automata approach for model-
ing the propagation of airborne pollutants in three-dimensional space over time. The GIS-based geo-atom
theory was used to manage the data within the automaton. The simulation results indicate the model has
the capability to generate effective four-dimensional (4D) simulations from simple transition rules that
describe the processes of particle advection and diffusion. The application of voxel-based automata and
the geo-atom concepts allows for a detailed 4D analysis and tracking of the changes in the voxel space at
every time-step. The proposed modeling approach provides new means to examine the relationships
between pattern and process in 4D.

1 Introduction

When modeling complex environmental systems, simulation models are particularly valuable
because they can be used to describe, analyze and reliably forecast the trajectories of environ-
mental processes using trends from historical data (Andretta et al. 2006; Heung et al. 2013).
Among the methods used to develop these simulation models is cellular automata (CA), which
is also the most commonly employed dynamic modeling method because of its straightforward
computational theory (Camazine et al. 2001; Bertelle et al. 2009; Rasmussen and Hamilton
2012). CA models are developed following a bottom-up approach where the system is
described in terms of its microscopic components. In fact, CA theory has been adopted in
deﬁning principles of geographic automata systems (Torrens and Benenson 2005), which can
be used to represent complex dynamic geographic processes. These CA models can generate
complex global patterns from simple local interactions and so they are used extensively to
study the macroscopic behavior of complex geographic processes (Batty 2005; Holland 2006;
Manson 2007). However, most of the automata models of environmental processes have been
limited to the two-dimensional (2D) spatial perspective. Extending these 2D models to a more

realistic three-dimensional (3D) spatial context provides the means by which the dynamics of
the environmental processes can be analyzed intuitively and more comprehensively. Even in the
few cases where 3D CA results have been generated and used in further environmental analysis
with geographic information systems (GIS) software applications (Ciolli et al. 2004), they are
limited to static spatial data queries, since modeling the time dimension in GIS is still a signiﬁ-
cant research challenge (Pultar et al. 2010).

The realistic simulation and analysis of the dynamics of many environmental phenomena,
such as the dispersal process of gaseous matter in the atmosphere, can be signiﬁcantly
improved by representing them as four-dimensional (4D) space-time models. In general, envi-
ronmental phenomena are dynamic processes driven by systems composed of multiple compo-
nent parts and are sometimes organized into different sub-systems characterized by geographic
complexity (Manson 2007). These systems evolve in 3D space and the interactions between
the component parts occur over the geographic space for extended periods of time (Manson
and O’Sullivan 2006). The nonlinear local relationships between the component parts tend to
produce global characteristics such as self-organization, adaptation, feedback loops, emergent
behavior and bifurcations (Holland 1995; Epstein and Axtell 1996; Lansing 2003; Miller and
Page 2007; Messina et al. 2008). It has been shown that these properties of complex systems
can be reproduced by designing dynamic models based on the idea that the emergent charac-
teristics of a system are best understood by examining the relationships of its component parts
(Auyang 1998; Macal and North 2005; Tang and Bennett 2010). However, the spatial data
models typically used in GIS applications rely on the raster and the vector spatial representa-
tions which are not capable of adequately representing the dynamics of changes of geographi-
cal entities. Instead, they describe spatial objects in terms of their respective singular location
and attribute values (Chrisman 1997). Coupling cellular automata and GIS applications has
therefore enabled dynamic model outputs to be represented as a series of the temporal snap-
shots of the simulated system at the macro scale (Couclelis 1985; Clarke and Gaydos 1998;
Batty et al. 1999; Schwarz et al. 2010).

Although the research on 3D CA has been undertaken in computational studies (Bays
1987; Imai et al. 2002; Jorg 2001), as well as in the physical sciences, these studies have been
focused on theoretical concepts that are not particularly related to geographical representa-
tion. 3D CA have been used to simulate gas transport (Frisch et al. 1986; Vanderhoef and
Frenkel 1991; Weimar 2002; Leonardi et al. 2012), and in the biological sciences to simulate
tissue growth (Kansal et al. 2000; Luebeck and deGunst 2001) and to study behavioral
dynamics (Jimenez-Morales 2000). In the geosciences, Narteau et al. (2009) have used the 3D
automata to simulate dune formation; the simpliﬁed concepts of 2.5D cellular automata,
however, were used in other efforts to simulate phenomena that propagate in 4D in order to
model, for example, snow avalanches (Avolio et al. 2010; Fonseca et al. 2011) or geological
formations (Baas 2007) by making the elevation an attribute in a two-dimensional automata
system. While these applications contribute to the understanding of possible 3D patterns and
formations over space and time, these studies are still at the level of initial research stages and
they do not yet contribute towards the development of a spatial data model that enables the
conceptualization of GIS for 4D querying and analysis.

Given the gaps in the way spatial phenomena are conceptualized and how their dynamics
are represented in a GIS, the main objective of this study is to develop a proof-of-concept
voxel-based automata model that can simulate environmental processes in 4D. Concepts from
the GIS based geo-atom theory (Goodchild et al. 2007) were used to conceptually and practi-
cally handle 3D entities in voxel space. In addition, a case study of pollutant dispersion from a
single point source is used to demonstrate the mechanics of the proposed model. The next

section provides the theoretical basis for the developed model and following that the practical
implementation of the dispersal model is presented and discussed.

2 Theoretical Background

The CA technique is a computational approach originally proposed by von Neumann (1966)
that has been widely used to develop models that generate complex spatial patterns from
locally interacting system elements. Formally, a cellular automaton can be described by a
mathematical function that represents the following key elements: a grid space (also termed a
lattice of cells), cell states, the neighborhood, transition rules to guide cell changes from one
state to another at each time-step, and the number of time-steps model completion (Wolfram
1983; Ilachinski 2001). The automaton operates such that each cell
in the grid space
computes its own state based on the current state of its neighboring cells. The CA model for-
malism is:

where C is the automaton representing the CA model, G is the grid space of one or more
spatial dimensions; S is the ﬁnite set of discrete states; N represents the cells in the neighbor-
hood; and f is the transition function.

The transition function that determines how the present state of a cell will change at the

next time-step can be represented as:

= (

,
C G S N f

,

,

)

(

f

where STi and STi +1 are the internal states of the cell at the current time Ti and at the subse-
quent time Ti+1, respectively; and N Ti is a neighborhood around a particular cell.

Even though the preceding formulation was designed for CA operating in a 2D cellular
space, it can be adapted for an automaton in 3D volumetric space because both 2D and 3D
models use the same underlying principle of relying on local neighborhood-based interactions
to generate complex global spatial patterns.

Observable changes in natural phenomena evolve in a temporally and spatially continuous
4D space-time domain. However, for the purposes of measurement, simpliﬁcation and even-
tual representation in GIS applications, both the temporal and spatial dimensions are
discretized into meaningful and well-deﬁned units (Lo and Yeung 2007). Moreover, the repre-
sentation of the spatial and the temporal dimensions in discrete terms, as they are conceptual-
ized in the CA paradigm, is attractive for spatial-temporal modeling in GIScience because it
enables the dynamic representation of a geographic process by using spatial data that would
otherwise provide static representations of spatial-temporal processes (Benenson and Torrens
2004; Batty 2005). Also as Bailey (1990) noted, the usefulness of the spatial data models is
rooted in their ability to provide a GIS with a consistent discretization mechanism that can be
applied to the geographic objects of interest.

Temporal changes in the geospatial datasets which are structured around the vector or the
raster geospatial data formats are presented as a series of snapshot data layers in order to
simulate changes over time (Peuquet 1994). For the purpose of mimicking the dynamic nature
of a phenomenon such as water ﬂow, spatial interpolation between the snapshots of the vector
data objects has been used to describe change between successive points on the temporal axis
(Raper and Livingstone 1995). In order to simulate changes in natural processes using

automata models, the temporal dimension is likewise discretized into a series of distinct tem-
intervals. Thus, due to the nature of the automata paradigm, the visualization of
poral
complex geographical processes is made possible in CA models because the outputs at every
time-step can be displayed as raster-based GIS outputs. For 3D modeling, the study area is rep-
resented in terms of the three dimensions of space and is decomposed into logical and consist-
ent volumetric elements referred to as voxels. Voxel as volumetric tessellation has been used in
the physical sciences literature when analyzing volumetric shapes (Arata et al. 1999; Fischer
et al. 2005), and within the ﬁeld of GIScience (Marschallinger 1996; Miller 1997; Grunwald
and Barak 2003; Ledoux and Gold 2008).

Although this study presents a uniform voxel-based automata model, the theoretical and
practical GIS concepts for modeling in 4D using cubes of different sizes have been presented by
Karssenberg and de Jong (2005) using the modeling language of PCRaster software (PCRaster
2013), which was specially designed to accommodate a range of models for representing envi-
ronmental dynamics (Wesseling et al. 1996; Burrough et al. 2005). The data inputs are of
various formats including DEMs, raster data and tabular representation of the multifaceted
attributes of the environmental phenomena. More particularly PCR-GLOBWB has been devel-
oped and used to model large scale hydrology (Karssenberg et al. 2010; Trambauer et al.
2014), soil erosion (Kamphorst et al. 2005) and various global processes related to climate
change modeling. The PCR-GLOBWB has been designed using an enhanced ‘leaky bucket’
model developed by Bergstrom (1976) combined with process equations and applied on a cell-
by-cell basis. In recent years, PCRaster BlockAnalyst has been in development for 3D voxel-
based modeling but it is yet to be documented in the literature. Moreover, the effects of
earthquake on dynamics of fracture and collapse of the discrete building objects represented in
an urban environment has been simulated in 4D by using three dimensional irregular object
tessellations (Torrens 2014).

The geographic automata modeling approach provides a mechanism for gathering
insights into the relationship between the micro-level interactions of the system’s compo-
nents and the macro-level manifestation of the geographically complex phenomenon. For
this to be achieved, CA models and GIS applications are coupled together when simulating
environmental phenomena. However, the existing GIS applications are known for being ill-
suited for temporal modeling querying (Langran 1992; Wachowicz and Healey 1994;
Dragicevic and Marceau 2000; Peuquet 2001; Worboys and Duckham 2004) since the tech-
nology was originally envisioned as a tool for reproducing the static spatial contents of
paper maps in a digital environment
(Goodchild 1992). Nevertheless, over the years
researchers have proposed various ways to handle time in GIS applications and the snapshot
method has been used to represent the spatio-temporal dynamics of geographic phenomena
under the assumption that the temporal interval in between snapshots is sufﬁciently small to
represent the continuity of the process. For automata modeling, perhaps the framework pro-
posed by Grenon and Smith (2004) lends itself more readily. They suggested a uniﬁed frame-
work where events taking place instantaneously can be represented as discrete marks on a
temporal scale, while those spatial objects whose identity is persistent through time are rep-
resented by continuous intervals.

In recent times, it has been proposed that spatial features as well as their persistence in
time can be represented in terms of the geo-atom GIS-based spatial data model (Goodchild
et al. 2007). Theoretically, a geo-atom describes a spatial feature as an atomic element with
a speciﬁc attribute value in a space-time domain. Using this fundamental concept, raster rep-
resentations of a geographic landscape can be described as geo-ﬁelds or collections of geo-
atoms, while geo-objects can be used to describe the vector-based models of spatial features.

In principle, the location and attribute value of a geo-atom can only describe a snapshot of
a geographic feature as it is measured at a particular point in time. However, since time is
explicitly recorded as a ﬁeld in the tuple that describes the structure of the geo-atom, it can
be extended temporally to dynamically show and query the spatial distribution of attribute
values at different times. Thus, in the context of a dynamic model output, records can be
kept of all the changes to the objects in the system along with their associated time of inci-
dence, a feature that allows for inferred explanations about the cause of the changes in the
system with more clarity and certainty than the existing dynamic models that use raster and
vector datasets. Besides this study, Pultar et al. (2010) have implemented the concepts of the
geo-atom theory to develop a data structure which they use to simulate wildﬁre propagation
and pedestrian movement limited to a 2D geographic space.

2.1 Modelling the Space-Time Domain

The structure of a geo-atom is described in terms of the location, attribute domain and the
temporal component of the spatial feature it represents. It is formalized as a tuple:

=

(

( )
,
p A a p

,

)

g

(3)

where g is a geo-atom that represents a spatial object being modeled, p is a vector that
describes the object in space-time coordinates (x, y, z, t), A is the attribute or variable of inter-
est such as carbon monoxide for example, and a(p) is the speciﬁc attribute value of A at that
location in space-time.

For the purpose of illustration, it is assumeed that the carbon monoxide concentration at
(123°W, 49°N) and 20 m above mean sea level on 1st June 2010 at 13:00 hours was 50 ppm.
From Equation (3), that spatial data point could be expressed in the form of a geo-atom as:

For 3D automata, a voxel, being the smallest spatial unit or tessellation in 3D space, can

be conceptualized as a geo-object having a state S. Using Equation (3) then:

where S′ = a(p) and p = (x, y, z, t); x, y, z are the coordinates for the centroid of the voxel and
t is the time stamp. From Equation (1), the ﬁnite set S with m possible voxel states can be rep-
resented as:

2.1.1 The geo-atom structure for a 3D voxel automaton

The development of a voxel automata model for the simulation of air pollution dynamics is
proposed based on the geo-atom data model and a bottom-up modeling approach. The
automata approach is used because CA models have been used effectively to simulate complex
and non-equilibrium physical processes such as pollutant dispersal.

A key aspect of the geo-atom theory is its ability to provide a description of a geographi-
cal entity in terms of the three dimensions of space and time. In the case of 3D CA, each voxel
is a spatial object that would be represented by a geo-atom structure. It is possible that at the

beginning of the simulation, the state of each voxel is recorded and whenever there is a change
in the state of the voxel as a result of the application of the transition rules, the value describ-
ing its state is recorded and is later used to analyse the simulation outcomes. With this
approach the automaton has memory encoded for each voxel that indicates when the changes
in each voxel took place. This approach differs from the one by Alonso-Sanz and Martin
(2003) that is used to remember the cumulative average value of past states, and is distinctly
different from reversible 2D CA. Although it may be possible to model each voxel as a geo-
dipole (Goodchild et al. 2007) linked in space and time to the other voxels in its neighbor-
hood, the representation in this study is limited to the elementary structure of the geo-atom for
simplicity reasons. Besides the difﬁculty of designing a database structure that maps each voxel
to its 26 neighbors, these relationships and interactions are sufﬁciently deﬁned and imple-
mented using the transition rules of the voxel automata.

2.2 Simulating the Dispersal of Airborne Pollutants in 4D

The dispersal of airborne gases and particles is one of the major causes of concern due to
climate change and global warming concerns. In the case of an air pollutant, the buoyancy
effects within the plume coupled with the transport mechanisms due to the surrounding
airﬂow system inﬂuence the dispersion of the particles from a given point source (Degrazia
et al. 2009). Gases that are either neutrally or positively buoyant will stay aﬂoat above the
ground surface and become mixed with the neighborhood’s airﬂow system (Britter 1979).
Dense negatively buoyant gases, on the other hand, are greatly inﬂuenced by the gravitational
force and tend to move towards the ground surface with less inﬂuence from the wind speed in
the neighborhood. The prevailing wind direction plays an important role in the transport
process because the pollutant’s movement is downwind and the greater the speed, the greater
the rate of dilution in the pollutant’s concentration. More speciﬁcally, the transportation of the
pollutant in the air is directed by the processes of advection and diffusion (Wark et al. 1997).
Advection is the movement of the pollutant’s particles with the ﬂow of the ﬂuid in which they
are contained. The effective speed of this movement, also termed the advective speed, depends
on the time-varying 3D wind ﬁeld and is responsible for the advective transportation of the
pollutant. Molecular diffusion, on the other hand is the spread of the pollutant from spaces of
higher concentration to those of lower concentration (Zang 1991). In addition, turbulence
causes additional diffusion as a result of high transport velocities and the dramatic concentra-
tion differences between the various points in the neighborhood.

Existing 3D models are typically based on complex mathematical formulations or use dif-
ferential equations to represent the propagation of airborne particles (Yeh and Huang 1975;
Tirabassi 1989). This study proposes a voxel automata model derived from complex systems
theory which takes a ‘bottom up’ approach by looking at processes in terms of locally deﬁned
discrete 3D spatial units and discrete temporal increments. With a central voxel and its sur-
rounding neighbors used as the primary spatial units at a local 3D scale, the processes of
advection and diffusion are modeled to mimic the relocation of airborne particles moving from
one voxel to another, thereby reproducing the process of propagation in 4D at a larger spatial
scale.

3 Methods

In developing the 3D voxel automata model for this study, several generalizations and assump-
tions regarding the spread of airborne pollutants were made. The effects of turbulence on the

movement of the pollutant’s molecular particles are not explicitly considered. Instead, it is
assumed the advective and diffusion processes are the major contributors to the movement of
the particles. Furthermore, the pollutants are transported under minimally ﬂuctuating environ-
mental conditions with only the wind velocity changing slightly. Other environmental factors
such as temperature, relative humidity and the chemical transformation of pollutants are not
considered. The molecules of the gaseous pollutants are assumed neutrally buoyant. Although
excluded from consideration here, it is also acknowledged that other processes involved in par-
ticle transport, such as microturbulence, may operate at ﬁne-grained resolutions in space and
time and can inﬂuence the dynamics of the environmental process over a large spatial extent
and over long periods of time (Perry and Enright 2006). Moreover, for the purposes of
improving computational efﬁciency, this simulation study was designed to use a relatively
coarse spatial resolution over a small study area and the simulations run for short computa-
tional durations.

The study area was divided into uniform volumetric cubes (voxels) in which the poll-
utant’s particles (molecules) are in motion due to the wind action. Each voxel is surrounded by
26 other contiguous neighbors to form a 3D Moore neighborhood. In the model, the poll-
utant’s concentration in a voxel is used to infer the amount of pollutant molecular particles
per unit volume. A concentration value of 0 refers to volumetric space that is devoid of pollu-
tants while a value of 1 is assigned to a voxel that is saturated; in other words, the voxel
volume is ﬁlled with the molecules of the pollutants. To simulate the process of pollutant dis-
persal, the mass of the pollutant particles in the system is conserved in the system. The magni-
tude of the wind speed and its direction will inﬂuence the spread of the pollutants due to
advection, while the differences in pollutant concentration for any two voxels and diffusivity
of the molecules will inﬂuence the spread due to the diffusion process.

3.1 Transport Due to Particle Advection

Advective transport is the movement of pollutants due to the magnitude of the wind velocity.
In general, as the wind speed increases, the advective ﬂow of the pollutants from any given
voxel to one or more of its neighboring voxels also increases. This process can be modeled by
using Equation (6) which deﬁnes the advective ﬂux when particles are carried by ﬂuid motion
(Logan 2001):

C

a =

vCk

(6)

where Ca is the pollutant concentration transported either out or into a voxel due to advection,
v is the magnitude of the wind speed in the voxel, and k is a porosity constant that deﬁnes the
amount that goes through the voxel’s boundaries.

Effectively, the pollutants are propagated from a neighboring voxel, located upwind, to
the central voxel in the neighborhood. During the same time-step, pollutants are moved
from the central voxel to the neighboring voxel located downwind relative to the central
voxel. The voxels are conceptualized as distinct entities adjoining one another via varying
surface area extents. For those that are connected to one another via the face sides, more
pollutants will ﬂow between them due to the large surface area that is exposed between
them. However, those that are connected by an edge (diagonal positions) will have lesser
pollutant quantities due to the limited surface area exposed. Likewise, even lesser pollutants
will be exchanged between those connected via the vertex positions (double diagonal) in the
3D neighborhood.

3.2 Transport Due to Particle Diffusion

Diffusion is the process by which airborne pollutants spread from a space with a higher
molecular concentration to a space with a lesser concentration. It differs from advection in
that the pollutant’s particles spread from one voxel to another without requiring a force for
this movement. The ﬂux into any given voxel as a result of diffusion can be described as:

C

d

= −

r

Δ
Δ

C
d

(7)

where Cd is the concentration lost or gained as a result of diffusion between a voxel
and its neighbor, r is the dispersion coefﬁcient, ΔC is the difference in concentration between a
voxel and its neighbor, and Δd is the distance between centroids of
the neighboring
voxels.

If the voxel at the center of the neighborhood has a higher pollutant concentration than
that in a neighboring voxel, it will result in a negative concentration difference and, conse-
quently, pollutant particles are lost from the voxel due to diffusion. Conversely, when the
difference in the concentration gradient is positive, that is to say, less concentration in the
central voxel than in its neighbor, then the pollutant particles are added to the central voxel.
Each of the 26 neighboring voxels is positioned in a speciﬁc direction from the one at the
center, and any one voxel can potentially gain and lose pollutants to the central voxel due to
diffusion.

3.3 The Elements in the 3D Voxel Automaton

These local dynamics of pollutant movement are primarily modeling the pollutant’s inﬂux to
and outﬂux from the central voxel due to diffusion and advective transport. By implication,
the transition rules governing this automata model replicate the process at the local level. The
concepts of the geo-atom theory are used to associate the identity of a voxel to its location and
the ongoing changes in its state as a result of the application of the neighborhood transition
rules.

The key voxel automata elements are described as follows:

Voxel Space: The approach in this study differs from the classical formalism that uses a
2D cellular grid, in that it uses a 3D lattice of voxels. These voxels are encoded with a
description for the spatial and temporal dimensions of the study site. Although the
voxel space matches what would be expected in a real study area situation, it is rep-
resentative and not based on an existing dataset.

Voxel State: The state of a voxel is considered to be a function of the pollutant’s concen-
tration characterised by the extent of dilution and the dispersion characteristics of the
gas. The pollutant itself is assumed to be uniformly distributed within the volumetric
space.

Voxel Neighborhood: A 3D Moore neighborhood is used to describe the processes of pol-
lutant advection and diffusion from any given voxel to its neighbors. It is comprised
of 26 neighbors – six face neighbors, 12 diagonal neighbors (edge connected) and
eight double diagonal neighbors (vertex connected) as notionally shown in Figure 1
below. All the voxels in the neighborhood are contiguous to the central voxel and so

they are all situated in unique positions and orientation with respect to the central
one.

Transition Rules: The concentration of the pollutant in a voxel at the subsequent time

interval t + 1 depends upon:

• The level of the pollutant concentration in the voxel at the time t

• The quantity of the pollutant transported to some or all of the 26 voxels in the

• The magnitude of the prevailing wind speed in a speciﬁed direction

Even though all the voxels are of the same size, the extent of their surface areas exposed
to the central voxel depends on their respective positions in the neighborhood. As a result,
three porosity constants were used to represent the extent of the exposed voxel membranes for
the face neighbors, diagonal neighbors and the double diagonal neighbors, respectively. By
combining the processes of advetion and dispersal of particles in a voxel, the pollutant concen-
tration Ct+1 at time t + 1 in is given by:

where Ct is the pollutant concentration that exits in the voxel at time t; Cd is the pollutant that
is either lost or gained through diffusion; Ca is for the pollutants drawn into or from the
central voxel as result of the action of advection.

Assuming the gaseous pollutants are neutrally buoyant and under steady conditions, it is
further assumed that the effective transport on the pollutant’s particles is solely a result of
advection and diffusion. Using a 3D Moore neighborhood structure, there are 26 directions
towards which the wind can blow from the central voxel. For every voxel in the neighbor-
hood, there is a direction point and all the directions point away from the central as notionally

presented in Figure 2. Furthermore, a unique identiﬁer is assigned to each voxel in the neigh-
borhood because each relates differently to the central voxel.

3.3.1 Transition rules for modeling the dispersal of pollutants

Advective transport, due to the force of the wind action, causes the pollutants to move from
one voxel to another. Thus, for any given voxel at any given time-step, the pollutant molecules
are entering and exiting through its boundaries as a result of advection. While conserving the
mass of the pollutant particles, Equation (6) is used to model the ﬂux Ca of pollutants into and
out of the central voxel due to advective transport as follows:

=

∑(

C

a

(
)
v C

where ki is the porosity constant representing the exposed surface area between the two
voxels; C is the concentration of the central voxel; and Cj and vj respectively represent the
magnitude of the pollutant concentration of a voxel and velocity in a given direction j. Thus,
vjCj represents the inﬂux into the central voxel while vjC models the outﬂux from the central
voxel.

Diffusion occurs when there are differences in pollutant concentrations between any two
neighboring voxels. This concentration gradient will result in the ﬂow of the pollutants from
the voxel with a higher concentration to one that has a lower concentration. The function in
Equation 7 describing a sigmoid curve that relates the pollutants lost or gained from a central
voxel due to the differences in the concentration with any one neighboring voxel can be rewrit-
ten as:

where Cd is the pollutants concentration lost or gained due to diffusion, r is the appropriate
diffusion coefﬁcient, ΔCj is the difference in the concentration between the voxels, and Δdj is a
constant representing the exposed surface area of neighboring voxel, j, to the central voxel.

The time-stepping scheme that is proposed to simulate advection and diffusion is monot-
onic in character and conserves the mass of the particles during the propagation. While
advanced methods of numerical analysis typically apply upwinding methods to the diffusion
and propagation processes, they are not considered here for simplicity reasons.

3.4 Model Implementation

The model presented in this study was developed in the MATLAB software (Mathworks 2012)
using an object-oriented design paradigm. The use of classes and objects ensured accurate trac-
tability and reliable integration of the model components.

4 Simulation Results and Discussion

The developed model operated on a small and abstract landscape of 40 × 40 × 40 voxels. This
strategy provided computational processing advantages and also allowed for a simpliﬁed
model design and a less rigorous parameter calibration and estimation procedure. The model
was conceptualized as a ﬁve state automaton. The pollutant particles are, ﬁrstly, categorized
into three distinct states to mark the level of pollutant concentration in them. Setting the
maximum concentration in a voxel at 1 and the minimum to be just above zero the Low state
(L, marked with light gray) ranges from 0.001 to 0.3, the Medium state (M, marked with a
darker gray) ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 and the High state (H, marked with black) ranges from
0.6 to 1. The fourth state of the automaton, which is consistently marked as empty space
(translucent) in the model, is used to represent the space that contains none or negligible pol-
lutant concentration values. Lastly, the ﬁfth state is one that represents the physical character-
istics of the landscape and is itself consistently marked with a brown color. In addition, the
values of 1, 1
membranes that are between face, diagonal and double diagonal neighbors, respectively. The
manual adjustment of the parameter values allowed for the checking of the model’s software
code to ensure that the automaton is logically consistent with the mathematical descriptions
underpinning it. In particular, 0.009 and 4.5 are used as the reasonable parameter values for
the diffusion coefﬁcient and the westerly wind speed, respectively.

are used as the estimates for the porosity constants for the voxel’s

The simulation results in Figure 3 were generated to represent the progression of the pol-
lutant dispersion from a non-continuous point source as inﬂuenced by westerly winds. At
every time-step, the values of the pollutant concentration at 10, 20 and 24 voxel units, down-
wind from the point source, are recorded. Figure 4a shows the locations of the voxel positions
for which the concentration values are recorded while Figure 4b depicts the concentration at
the three different locations. There is no change in concentration at the location that is 24
voxel units from the point source because the pollutants dissipate before the propagation
reaches that location. From these results, it is clear that the higher pollutant concentration
values are closer to the point source and that at these locations the values quickly rise and dis-
sipate as the simulation runs. These conclusions match what would be expected in reality
where, as the distance from the point source increases, the effects of dispersed pollutants are
only felt minimally.

Figure 4 Measuring pollutant concentration values: (a) the positions, located at 10, 20, 24 units from
the point source, at which voxel values are recorded; (b) the line graph of the concentration values
as recorded at the three positions for the scenario depicting the propagation of pollutants from a
single non- continuous point source

The results showing the propagation of pollutants were generated on a level landscape but
in this scenario the pollutants are emanating from a continuous point source (Figure 5). The
graph of the concentration values of the pollutants at 10, 20, 24 voxel units from the point
source is presented in Figure 6. In comparison to the results in Figure 4b, the concentration
values in Figure 6 increase steadily up to a maximum value. The locations closer to the point
source have higher concentration values than those further away. After making modiﬁcations
in the study area to create an uneven landscape, simulation results present the variation in con-
centration values for both non-continuous and continuous point sources.

Figure 7a presents the results of the model’s simulation of pollutant dispersion from a
non-continuous point source. The landscape has uniformly rising elevations on the end that is
downwind from the source of the pollutants. The pollutants propagate following a progression
similar to that shown in Figure 3. In this case, however, the particles take longer to dissipate in
the voxels that are right at the base of the rising ground. Similarly, in the scenario (Figure 7b)
that shows the propagation of particles from a continuous point source, the pollutants accu-
mulate on the sides of the rise as the force of the wind pushes them upwards. The concentra-
tion values at 10, 20, 24 voxel units from the point source are shown in Figure 8. The line
plots in Figure 8a correspond to the values recorded from the scenario where the pollutants
emanate from a non-continuous point source scenario (Figure 7a) while those plotted in
Figure 8b correspond to the simulation of pollutants from a continuous point source.

Furthermore, conditions that represent a non-homogenous wind-ﬁeld in the study area
were designed by adding stochasticity in the values assigned to the wind speed in the study
area. The semblance to randomly ﬂuctuating wind speeds was implemented by assuming that
the wind ﬂuctuates in the study area at every time-step but is consistent in all the voxels at that
time-step. The heterogeneity in the wind ﬁeld is achieved by assigning a velocity magnitude in
the range between 4.0 and 5.0 at every time-step throughout the course of the simulation. The
results from the simulations in which the wind speed changes at every time-step but is uniform
throughout the landscape are shown in Figure 9. For these simulations, the measurement
values at select distances from the source are plotted in the graph shown in Figure 10.

Figure 6 Concentration values measured at 10, 20, and 24 voxel units downwind from the point
source for the scenario depicting the simulation from a single continuous point source

The results indicate that there are ﬂuctuations in the values at the measured points but
they are not signiﬁcantly different from the scenarios that use constant wind speed. As in the
other cases the values rise and plateau around a constant value. The simulation scenarios are
presented to depict the rise of pollutants from a source on the ground, for example, a factory,
but the point source of the pollutants can be located anywhere in the 3D space.

The obtained results demonstrate that although only the fundamental functions are used
to model the process of advection and particle diffusion, the simulations realistically mimic the
process of pollutant propagation. For example, the plots in Figures 8a and 8b are similar to
those reported elsewhere for analytical models of pollutant dispersion (Tirabassi 1989; Costa
et al. 2012) and this comparison represents a degree of internal model validation.

Furthermore, the model was applied to a more heterogeneous landscape representing a
hypothetical urban setting. The simulation outcomes from this scenario are shown in
Figure 11. As the pollutants propagate eastwards from a raised continuous point source, they
envelop objects such as buildings while at the same time the concentration around the point
source increases steadily. This behavior is consistent with expectations from real-world
situations.

5 Conclusions

The use of the voxel-based automata approach in modeling geographic processes provided a
means where these processes can be presented and analyzed in a four-dimensional spatio-
temporal perspective. Furthermore, the voxel automata draw on the elements of the geo-atom
data model to record, for historical analysis, the changes that occur in each of the voxels in the
system. This is particularly advantageous when modeling complex systems because it allows
for further investigation of the attributes of the system’s components. This is unlike the models

units for: (a) non-continuous point source; and (b) for the continuous point source scenario

that use raster data with which it is not possible to record the attribute values of the systems
components at every time-step. As it is more generally the case, the raster and the vector
spatial representations describe the objects in terms of their respective singular location and
attribute values without the ability to explicitly record the temporal context. The model pre-
sented in this study can record the value representing the state of each of voxel as the simula-
tion runs.

The developed model has been used to generate results for various scenarios in 4D, all of
which are grounded in hypothetical landscapes with the main objective being to demonstrate
the potential of using the geo-automata theory in modeling environmental processes and with
real 3D datasets. The results indicate that the model is sensitive to the values of the constants
used in deﬁning the underlying functions, thus it would useful to apply these results to an
actual geographic landscape for the purpose of analyzing its potential to give reliable results.
Furthermore, the addition of stochastic elements to the wind magnitudes in the model also
inﬂuences the shape of the resulting plume although it is expected not to be adversely different
from one simulation to the next.

The next steps in further developing this model would be to undertake a thorough and
rigorous model testing, along with a validation procedure by using the real geospatial datasets.
Given the broad assumptions taken in this study, and the fact that the data used were not
taken from an actual ﬁeld sample, it is not yet possible to adequately validate the model. The
model has been internally veriﬁed and calibrated to check if it represents the process of 4D dis-
persion of pollution realistically, but there is a need to validate it against real data to make
sure that its outputs match the real-world. With the goal of showing that the model correctly
reproduces a process in the real-world data from similar modeling studies of 3D pollutant
spread could be used and the corresponding models and results could be compared to the
results generated from this study. It would be important to use a ﬁner grained voxel resolution
and to carefully consider the effects of turbulence and crosswind interaction within the study
site. However, the model has been applied to various scenarios in order to verify its logic and
the reliability of its outputs with respect to the input parameters. The efforts to prepare the
GIS data that will be used in the model for model testing is a topic of new research project.

Although not yet explored in this study, the proposed voxel automata model is a good
candidate for examining the dynamics of the voxel-states in order to describe pollutant con-

centrations in 4D around the raised objects in a non-homogenous landscape. Furthermore,
work needs to be conducted to translate geographic data from the raster and vector GIS data
formats to the format speciﬁed in the geo-atom theory. This change in data formats would
enable the application of 4D models to be linked to real datasets of environmental processes.
The work presented in this study complements the early efforts in the development of spatial
dynamics of voxel- and object-based representation in 3D. Its unique contribution is in the
implementation of the theoretical concepts related to the 4D geo-atom data structure linked to
geographical automata systems. Nevertheless, this developed model provides a proof-of-
concept and platform to extend theoretically and practically the use of voxel automata in the
analysis of more complex scenarios.

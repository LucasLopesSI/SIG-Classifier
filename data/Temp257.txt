The highly skewed sex ratio at birth (SRB) in China has stimulated numerous studies.
However, the geographic distribution of SRB is seldom investigated, particularly at the county
level. The need for an understanding at this level has increased since the Chinese government
initiated its ‘Care for Girls’ campaign to improve the survival rate of females. This campaign
has been initiated in a set of pilot counties. In this article we assess the effectiveness of the set
of pilot counties in Shandong province and propose two alternate configurations. To do this,
we first assess the spatial distribution of the SRB values by county in Shandong, expressed as a
z-score (zSRB) after correcting for the biologically expected SRB value and population size of
zero-aged children. A local Moran’s Ii analysis of the zSRB values indicates a significant
high–high cluster in the southwest of the province. The Ii, zSRB and female deficit (the
difference of the observed from biologically expected number of zero-aged females) were then
used to define two alternate configurations for the pilot counties. A comparison of the current
and alternate configurations against a Monte Carlo randomisation analysis shows that the
current configuration is significantly different from a random selection (p , 0.05) for the two
criteria of maximising the aggregate female deficit and maximising the zSRB. Although this is
a good result, both alternate configurations were more significant (p , 0.001), and therefore
represent potentially better configurations for the campaign given the criteria used. The spatial
analysis approach developed here could be used to improve the effectiveness of the Care-for-
Girls campaign in Shandong province, and elsewhere in China.

Introduction

1.
The aim of this research is to develop a spatially based approach for the selection of pilot
counties used in government efforts to correct the biased sex ratio at birth (SRB) in
Shandong province, China.

In the absence of social or behavioural interference, the true SRB is biologically stable,
falling between 105 and 107 male births per 100 female births (Hu and Zhang 1984, Coale
and Banister 1994, Banister 2004). However, according to census data, the SRB in China is
highly imbalanced and has shown a sharp upward trend: 108.5 in 1982, 111.3 in 1990, and
116.9 in 2000. The estimated number of females missing from the population because of this
imbalance has been estimated as approximately 9.2 million (Jiang et al. 2005).

The main reason for the skewed SRB in China is generally believed to be sex selective
abortion after prenatal sex identification by ultrasound (Coale and Banister 1994, Chu 2001),
with underreporting of female births and female infanticide as additional causes (Zeng et al.
1993). China’s family-planning policy is also thought to be a proximate cause (Hull 1990).
Hudson and Boer (2004) imputed the underlying cause of the skewed SRB to be Confucian
ideology, in which women are expected to be subordinate to men. Confucius, the founder of
Confucianism, said in his Analects ‘Only women and Petty Man are hard to have around the
house. If you become close to them, they turn non-compliant. If you keep them at a distance,
they turn resentful.’ (Ware 1955, p. 114). Mencius, a later influential Confucian, once said,
‘There are three ways of being a bad son. The most serious is to have no heir.’ (He and Cai
1999, p. 241), where a heir at that time was a son. Confucianism has long and strongly
dominated Chinese society since the Han dynasty (206 BCE to 220 CE), and its low social
status of women leads to a traditional preference for sons over daughters.

In response to the skewed SRB, the Chinese government initiated a ‘Care for Girls’
campaign in 2003 (China Daily 2006). The aim of the campaign is to correct gender
prejudice and improve the survival environment for girls. It involves policies that favour
daughter-only families, where these families will receive donations or rewards (China Daily
2004). Daughters of such families will be given bonus marks when they take college
entrance examinations and are promised preferential treatment when searching for employ-
ment. The reward system is accompanied by increased policing of illegal foetus gender
identification (Wei and Gao 2007).

The campaign is not yet at a national scale, and has been launched in a sample of pilot
counties across the Chinese provinces. Among these, some success has been reported in
Xuecheng Qu district where two-daughter families constituted 13.1% of two-child
families, an increase of 3% from 2002 (Yan 2005). Additionally, seven ultrasound
machines were confiscated and five private clinics were closed down. In Hubei province
in 2007, approximately 114,000 two-daughter families and 278,000 one-daughter families
were rewarded as part of the Care-for-Girls campaign, with 424 criminal cases reported
involving prenatal gender identification (Population & Family Planning Committee of
Hubei Province 2008).

One important question that arises from the campaign is whether these pilot counties are
located in the counties where they could have the greatest effect. It is comparatively easy to
identify those counties with the most biased SRB values (e.g. Banister 2004). However, the
causes of SRB bias in a county are likely to be influenced by, or interact with, those in the
neighbouring counties. For example, illegal prenatal sex identification has been very
common along the boundaries of the pilot counties (Zhang 2004, CHINAPOP 2006).
Additionally, the operation of the campaign requires interactions with adjacent adminis-
trative areas. Many government documents have explicit clauses encouraging cooperation
between the pilot counties and their surrounding regions (Family Planning Committee of
Jian County 2004, Population & Family Planning Plural Executive of Tonggu County 2007,
CHINAPOP 2008). Specific examples where this has occurred are in Lingchuan and
Qinshui counties in Shanxi province, both of which have signed agreements with Jiaozuo
and Jiyuan counties in neighbouring Henan province to deal with criminal cases of prenatal
sex identification (Population & Family Planning Committee of Shanxi 2007). In
Huanggang county, a pilot county in Hubei province, 31 cases have been dealt with in
cooperation with neighbouring Anhui and Jiangxi provinces (Population & Family Planning
Committee of Hubei Province 2008).

The application of the campaign and the assessment of its effectiveness is therefore a
spatial problem, for which Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) statistics

International Journal of Geographical Information Science

represent a useful approach. The results of any LISA analysis can be used to both identify
hotspots of high SRB values and as part of a prioritisation process for the allocation of
resources.

This article is divided into three parts: We first assess the SRB values for individual
counties in Shandong province, China. Second, we analyse the spatial variation of SRB
values by county in Shandong using a local Moran’s Ii analysis as the LISA statistic
(Anselin 1995). Third, we use the Ii results to generate two alternate pilot counties’
configurations, assessing all
three configurations against random selection using a
Monte Carlo analysis.

2. The distribution of SRB values and pilot counties in Shandong province

Shandong province is located on the east coast of China and contains 116 counties
(Figure 1). With a population of approximately 90 million, Shandong was the second
most populous province in China in 2000. It is also the cradle of Confucianism. Confucius
was born in the county of Qufu, whereas Mencius was born in Zoucheng, the southern
neighbour of Qufu (Figure 1).

The data used in this article were extracted from the 2000 census of the Chinese population

(National Bureau of Statistics of China 2003). The SRB is calculated as a binomial ratio

m0
f0

· 100

where m0 and f0 are the number of zero-aged males and females, respectively. This is an
approximation of the true SRB, as the data source does not account for deceased infants. GIS
data for county and province boundaries were downloaded from the Chinese National
Fundamental Geographic Information System database (http://nfgis.nsdi.gov.cn/nfgis/
english/default.htm). One modification was made to the boundaries. Xuecheng Qu district
is a part of Zaozhuang county, but is treated as a pilot county in the Care-for-Girls campaign.
Consequently, it was treated as a distinct spatial unit in these analyses with the population
values of Zaozhuang county adjusted accordingly.

Shandong province had an overall SRB of 112.17 in the year 2000, with considerable
variation at the county level. One factor that needs to be allowed for when interpreting the
SRB values is the sample size. In this data set, the number of zero-aged children ranges
between approximately 3000 and 20,000. To correct for this, we normalised the SRB values
as z-scores (zSRB) by subtracting the biologically expected SRB value (106 male births per
100 female births, being the mid-point of 105 and 107) from the observed SRB and dividing
by the expected standard deviation ((cid:2)R, Hull 1990) [Equations (2) and (3)]. The use of the
biologically expected SRB value and binomial expectations also means that the analysis
results will be directly comparable with analyses from other regions or for this region but for
different time periods.

where SRBi is the SRB for county i, p is the probability of a male birth, q is the probability of
a female birth (q = 1 - p), and N is the number of zero-aged children. For an expected SRB of
106, p = 106/206 = 0.51456 and q = 100/206 = 0.48544.

Only 19 of the 116 counties in Shandong province have negative zSRB values,
and therefore SRB values smaller than 106 males per 100 female births (Figure 1).
There are 35 counties with zSRB values higher than three standard deviations from the
expected value, the majority of which are located near the south and west boundaries
of the province.

There are three possible factors leading to the observed zSRB spatial patterns. First, the
southwest of Shandong province has rich coal deposits, and the coal industry requires mainly
male labourers. Second, dowries are common in the southwest areas, where the family of the
bride is required to provide a considerable dowry to the family of the bridegroom at the time
of a wedding (Wang 1989). The bride’s family thus lose not only a labourer but also a large
amount of money. Third, the southwest counties are neighbouring two provinces with higher
overall SRB values than Shandong, 118.46 in Henan province and 127.85 in Anhui
province. This suggests some cross-border interactions.

Figure 2. Pilot counties in the Care-for-Girls campaign, Shandong. SRB and zSRB values are given
below the county names.

The Care-for-Girls campaign began in Shandong province in 2004. The campaign is not
yet operational in all counties in the province, with eight counties with positively skewed
SRB values in the 2000 census chosen as pilot counties (Figure 2): Leling, Linqing,
Yuncheng, Weishan, Xuecheng Qu, Pingyi, Changle and Laiyang (Shandong Family
Planning Committee 2006). The eight pilot counties each have high SRB values and all
except Changle have zSRB values higher than three. Yuncheng county is the most biased,
with an SRB value of 150.29 and zSRB of 23.95.

The reasoning behind the selection of these eight counties is not known. They are not the
eight sites with the highest SRB values, but are distributed evenly across the province. From
this one might surmise that the policy makers were attempting to spread the influence of the
campaign as widely as possible. However, such a dispersed configuration might not be as
effective as possible for reasons including the operation of the campaign and also access to
illegal equipment in neighbouring counties. A more spatially compact distribution might
therefore be more effective.

As an alternative selection of the pilot counties, policy makers might consider the spatial
clusters of neighbouring counties, especially those with high zSRB values. The results in
Figure 1, however, do not reveal spatial associations because each county is considered
independently of its neighbours. The putative causes of the biased SRB in the southwest of
Shandong are all spatial processes, in that what occurs in one county is likely to occur in
neighbouring counties. Also, conditions in one county are likely to influence, and be
influenced by, those in neighbouring counties. A LISA analysis that allows for neighbouring
values is therefore appropriate. Importantly, such a quantitative analysis will also enable
comparisons with other study sites and over time.

3. The spatial association of zSRB values in Shandong

3.1. LISA analyses
Knowledge of the geographical structure of SRB patterns in Shandong county can help
prioritise governmental efforts in the Care-for-Girls campaign by identifying locations of
significant spatial associations of counties. LISA analyses are an established approach for
this problem. For this research, we use the local Moran’s I statistic (Ii) to identify positively
autocorrelated spatial clusters where counties with high zSRB values are surrounded by
other high zSRB values.

A local Moran’s value Ii [Equation (4)] was calculated for each location (county) i to
assess the spatial structure of the zSRB values using GeoDa version 0.9.5-i (Anselin 2003).

where xi is the value at location i, (cid:2)x is the data set mean, n is the number of locations
(counties) in the data set, wij is the spatial weight between locations i and j. S2 is the data set
variance, calculated as

Ii ¼

S2 ¼

(cid:3)

n
X

(cid:4)2

xj (cid:2) (cid:2)x

(5)

A positive Ii score indicates that the value of i and the average of its neighbours j are
similar (positively autocorrelated), both being either greater than or less than (cid:2)x. A negative Ii
indicates that the value at i is dissimilar from its neighbours j (negatively autocorrelated). If
the value at i is less than (cid:2)x then the average j is greater, or vice versa. The Ii values can be
classified into four types based on the values of the central location and the neighbours
relative to the mean (Anselin et al. 2007), high–high, low–low, high–low and low–high. The
first two are positively autocorrelated clusters, whereas the latter two are negatively auto-
correlated outliers. It should, however, be noted that the ‘low’ can be misleading because it is
relative to the mean of the data set. Although it is comparatively low for this data set, the
SRB value of a low–low county in Shandong may still be higher than the biologically normal
value of 105–107. Even so, the relative values mean that the counties with the highest SRB
values will always contribute highly to the Ii results.

A critical decision when calculating any spatial statistic is the definition of the neigh-
bours to use in the calculations (Laffan 2002). In this case, we define the neighbours of a
polygon based on contiguity such that wij = 1 when areal units i and j share a physical
boundary, and wij = 0 otherwise. There are no islands in our data set, so each county has at
least one adjacent neighbour. The counties in our data set are also relatively uniform in size
and compact in shape, which means there is a similar distance between adjacent counties.
The analysis can be extended to larger neighbourhoods by adding neighbours of increasing
order (e.g. neighbours of neighbours).

A second critical issue with spatial analyses, and particularly local analyses, is that of edge
effects where some results are biased by neighbours not being included in the analysis. This is
particularly common for analyses including administrative boundaries. There are clearly no
edge effects at the eastern edge of Shandong province, as it is adjacent to the Bohai and Yellow
Seas. However, the western boundary is essentially arbitrary in terms of the SRB. To allow for
this, a buffer zone of 109 counties from the adjacent provinces were included in the analyses.

International Journal of Geographical Information Science

409

The 109 were chosen such that any county in Shandong province would have its complete set
of neighbours when a third-order contiguity neighbourhood was considered.

The significance of Ii can be assessed by comparing the standardised z-value for Ii to its
probability in a standard normal table. However, the possible presence of global spatial
autocorrelation will influence the distribution of the values, with the most significant effect
appearing to be on the skewness of the distribution (Anselin 1995). The conditional
randomisation approach is suggested by Anselin (1995) to be a viable alternative in practice,
both in the absence and in the presence of global spatial autocorrelation. Such an approach is
implemented by fixing the value of interest at location i, and the remaining values are
randomly permuted over the space occupied by the data set. For each permutation, the value
of Ii is computed, thus yielding an empirical distribution instead of a hypothetical normal
distribution, with probability values (pi) for each location. For these analyses, we used 9999
permutations and set the significance level to 0.05.

To assess the robustness of our spatial analyses, we repeated the Moran’s Ii calculations
for second- and third-order neighbours, with the neighbourhoods being cumulative such that
each larger neighbourhood around i includes the smaller neighbourhoods. These results were
compared using transition probability matrices (Gallo and Ertur 2003), where the matrix
values represent the number of counties that had each combination of classifications between
the first- and second-order, and the first- and third-order, neighbourhoods. This approach
allows the assessment of the number of counties that retain their initial classification (no
change) and the direction of those that change as the spatial neighbourhood increases, such
as from non-significant to high–low. If there is little change in the classification then the
results are robust to changes of spatial neighbourhood size.

3.2. LISA results
The Ii results indicate that there are significant non-random clusters of biased SRB at the
county level (Figure 3). Specific explanations are not documented in the academic literature,
although illegal prenatal sex identification and sex-selective abortion have been reported in
Heze (#100) and Juancheng (#91) counties associated with private clinics and some
maternity hospitals (CCTV.com 2005).

Both the high–high and the low–low counties form contiguous groups. The number of
high–high clusters (35) is approximately half that of the low–low clusters, and only nine of
them are located in Shandong. Those nine Shandong counties in high–high clusters (Table 1)
are located primarily in the southwest of Shandong. All nine have highly positively skewed
zSRB values, of which Chengwu county (#110) has the lowest value at 5.78 (SRB = 120.64).
The most skewed observation is in Yuncheng (#87), with a value of 23.95 (SRB = 150.29). A
further 26 high–high counties are located in the neighbouring provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui
and Henan. It is worth noting that these neighbouring provinces each have higher SRB
scores than does Shandong (Figure 1). The low–low clusters are concentrated in the north,
east and centre of Shandong province. Of the 63 counties identified as low–low, all except
four are within Shandong province. There is a clear division of non-significant counties
between the high–high cluster and the low–low cluster, although this can be attributed to a
transition zone between two clusters of distinctly high and low zSRB values. The low–high
outliers are usually isolated and tend to border high–high counties, although this is to be
expected given the formulation of the statistic. There are no high–low outliers.

The number of non-significant counties changes considerably between the first and the
higher order spatial neighbourhoods (Table 2). About 43.5% of the non-significant counties
the second-order

neighbourhood, whereas 52.2% are low–low at the third order. Of the remaining counties
that are non-significant at the first order, 45.6% and 34.8% remain non-significant at the
second and third order, respectively. All the high–high and low–high counties retain their
classification as the neighbourhood increases, whereas 98.3% of the low–low counties

scale and enables some confidence in the spatial structure of the first-order neighbour results.

4. Alternative spatial configurations and their evaluation

The current pilot counties are dispersed across the province. Most are located in non-
significant clusters (Figure 4), with the exception of Yuncheng (#87) which is part of a
high–high cluster. The results of the LISA analysis represent one method to determine an
alternative configuration of pilot counties that might have a greater impact on the SRB bias if
resources are allocated to them.

4.1. Ranking criteria
The four classes of Ii defined by Anselin et al. (2007) can be used as the basis of a ranking
system. A high–high county is one with a high zSRB value surrounded by other counties
with high zSRB values. Such neighbourhoods are likely to be the most unfavourable region
for the survival of female foetuses and are locations where the Care-for-Girls campaign
might have the greatest effect if they are used as pilot counties. This assumes that the effects
will be proportional to the zSRB values, as the number of private clinics and hospitals with
ultrasound equipment should be approximately proportional to the population, and indir-
ectly to the zSRB values. We note that this does not account for resistance to the campaign.
An assessment of the actual effectiveness of the campaign must wait until data are available
to assess changes in the SRB in the pilot counties. Low–low clusters are counties with low
zSRB values surrounded by counties with low zSRB values. Such clusters are likely to have
less impact if used as pilot counties because they have a more balanced SRB relative to the
remainder of the province. High–low counties have high zSRB values but are surrounded by
counties with low zSRB values. In these cases, the high-zSRB county might have a negative
influence on its low-zSRB neighbours, and selecting these as pilot counties could reduce
such risk. Low–high counties have low zSRB values but are surrounded by counties with
high zSRB values. Selecting these as pilot counties might reduce negative interactions from
neighbouring counties with high SRB values. Non-significant counties are not sufficiently
different from the permutations to be considered further.

On the basis of the above, we suggest the following priority sequence for selecting pilot
counties: high–high, high–low, low–high and low–low counties. Given there are nine
high–high counties in Shandong province, and only eight pilot counties, only the nine
high–high counties need to be considered for alternate configurations in this case. The
issue that remains is that not all of the counties can be selected if we assume that only eight
pilot counties can be allocated. We propose three criteria for this purpose.

The criteria are (1) minimise the Ii p-scores, (2) maximise the zSRB values and (3)
maximise the absolute number of missing girls (female deficit, fdef). The female deficit
represents the upper bound of the number of females that the Care-for-Girls campaign could
potentially save. The female deficit is calculated as the difference between the observed and
the expected newborn females if the SRB is at a biologically normal level [100 females per
106 males, as in Equation (2)], where negative deficits are assigned a zero value.

(cid:3)
fdef ¼ max 0; fexp (cid:2) f0

where fexp is the expected number of newborn females, and f0 and m0 are the observed
number of newborn females and males in 2000, respectively.

There is no solution that allows us to optimise against all three criteria simultaneously.
However,
two alternative configurations have been identified that satisfy each one
separately (Configurations 1 and 2), and these have considerable overlap (Figure 4).
In Configuration 1, Yuncheng county (#87) is excluded because of its having the largest
Ii p-value (0.0438) among the nine high–high counties. This is somewhat surprising, as
Yuncheng has both the highest SRB and the zSRB values. However, it also has three
adjoining counties that are in the non-significant category. Optimising against both the
zSRB and the female deficit criteria results in the same set of counties (Configuration 2). In

Configuration 2, Chengwu county (#110) is excluded as it has the smallest zSRB (5.78)
and female deficit (438).

What remains now is to assess the differences between the three configurations, both

against each other and against configurations generated by random selection.

4.2. Monte Carlo simulation
The possible number of configurations of eight counties selected from the 116 counties in
Shandong is 635,299,897,870. This is clearly an impractical number to test directly and
would be especially so if one applies these analyses to a case study with a larger number of
locations. A Monte Carlo analysis is used for this purpose to define empirical distributions
for each of the aggregated zSRB and female deficit, derived by randomly selecting eight
counties from Shandong province 10,000,000 times. The aggregated zSRB was calculated
using Equations (2) and (3), where the SRB and standard deviation were calculated using the
sum of the zero-aged males and females in the eight selected counties. The female deficit
[Equations (6) and (7)] was similarly calculated using the aggregated population data. As
with the permutation analysis used for the Ii scores, the relative rankings equate to p-values
and can be interpreted as significance measures. The Monte Carlo analysis was implemented
using the R statistical package (R Development Core Team 2007).

The empirical distributions (Figure 5, Table 3) show that the aggregate zSRB percentile
of the current configuration has a p-value of 0.023, and thus can be considered significantly
different from a random selection at the 0.05 level. However, although this is a good result,
the two alternate configurations have considerably smaller p-values (much less than 0.001).
In terms of the female deficit, the current configuration has a p-value of 0.045. This is
close to 0.05, but is significant at that level. However, both alternate configurations again
have p-values considerably less than 0.001. The relative rankings therefore indicate that,
while the current configuration will have some effect that is considerably better than a purely
random selection of counties, the alternate configurations developed using spatial analysis are
likely to be better than the current configuration given the two criteria of maximising the
aggregated zSRB and maximising the female deficit.

5. Conclusions

The analysis results suggest that the governmental prioritisation of pilot counties for the
Care-for-Girls Campaign in Shandong province are less effective than they could be. An
analysis of the spatial association of the SRB data for the county level indicates that there are
significant spatial clusters of counties with higher than expected SRB values, and that these
are consistent across three neighbourhood sizes. Two alternate configurations were devel-
oped from the high–high clusters using three criteria (minimise LISA p-values, maximise the
aggregate zSRB score, and maximise the aggregate female deficit). A Monte Carlo analysis
of the three configurations indicates that the current configuration would be more effective
than a random selection at the 0.05 significance level for both the aggregate female deficit
and the aggregate zSRB score criteria. However, both alternate configurations rank more
highly for both criteria (significant at the 0.001 level). This indicates that the configuration of
the current pilot counties is good, but not optimal given the assessment criteria. Better
allocation of resources could potentially be achieved using either of the two alternate
configurations.

It is worth also noting that, while the alternate configurations are developed using spatial
association, the assessment of them does not directly quantify the interaction effects of

neighbours. Such effects are difficult to reliably quantify but, given the movement of people
between neighbouring counties, it is expected that additional benefits will accrue from having the
pilot counties located in adjacent counties resulting in a more spatially compact configuration.
Only one province, Shandong, has been considered in this research. However, as with any
repeatable analysis, the approach is applicable to any location with suitable spatial data. Importantly,
the use of the biologically expected SRB value allows a direct comparison across such analyses.

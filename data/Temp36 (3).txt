PERSPECTIVE

Survey-as-process: meanders or oxbows?

Steven Rogers, Brian Ballantyne, and Erin Tompkins

Abstract: Land surveying is a process that is more than fieldwork. Survey-as-process
includes interplay with existing surveys, with landowners (and others with rights in the
land) and with regulators. Proof of concept evidence, theoretical constructs, a Specific
Claims Tribunal decision and a First Nations Land Management Act boundary opinion illustrate
how survey-as process fits within the larger exercise of re-establishing boundaries.
Key word: land surveying.

Résumé : L’arpentage des terres est un processus qui englobe beaucoup plus que le travail
sur le terrain. L’arpentage comme processus comprend l’interaction avec les arpentages
existants, avec les propriétaires fonciers (et autres intervenants qui ont des droits sur les
terres) et avec les régulateurs. La preuve de la validité du concept, les hypothèses
théoriques, les décisions du Tribunal des revendications particulières et les opinions sur
les limites de la Loi sur la gestion des terres des premières nations illustrent la mesure dans
laquelle l’arpentage comme processus correspond à l’exercice plus large qui sert à rétablir
les limites. [Traduit par la Rédaction]
Mot-clé : l’arpentage des terres.

Context

Let’s banish the misconception that land surveying is merely the exercise of fieldwork,
consisting of setting up instruments; measuring distances, directions, and coordinates; plac-
ing monuments; and recording observations. Of course, fieldwork is integral to marking a
boundary on the ground and to providing something physical to landowners and others of
the spatial extent of the parcel (Equitable Building & Investment Company v Ross 1886
NZLR 229 (SC)). However, survey-as-fieldwork (and glorifying that exercise to the expense
of all else) masks two truths, that:

– Surveys and surveyors do not, in and of themselves, establish boundaries. Boundaries are

established through the sanction of those who enjoy rights in the land.
– Survey-as-fieldwork is part of a larger exercise, that of survey-as-process.

Nowhere is the latter truth more apparent than in re-establishing boundaries, particu-
larly the water bounds but also the rectilinear bounds of First Nation parcels. The principle
that surveying is a process that includes much interplay with landowners and land admin-
istrators and regulators both before and after fieldwork is explained well in a Specific
Claims Tribunal decision: Madawaska Maliseet First Nation v Canada 2017 SCTC 5.

The research needed to glean the facts about survey-as-process is illustrated well by an opin-
ion as to the riparian boundary of the Gambler Reserve in Manitoba.

Proof of Concept

It is critical that we supplement the analysis with proof of concept evidence and with
theoretical constructs to reach a certain equilibrium between the assertion that survey-is-
process and the Gambler First Nation case study. The precedent for such supplementary
analysis is Sokal (1996), who transgressed the boundaries in 1994 by suggesting closer ties
between the humanities and the sciences, in arguing for a transformative hermeneutics,
and by observing that strategies of description (mathematical, experimental, and verbal)
are inherently problematizing — part of the semiotics of investigating the universe. Of
course, Sokal (1996) was examining quantum gravity as a process whereas we examine land
surveying — and, in particular, the surveying of the boundaries of First Nation Reserves — as
a process. Thus, we argue by analogy with Sokal (1996), by suggesting closer ties between sur-
veying and process, rather than merely between surveying and fieldwork. The evidence for
such ties comes to us from disparate sources, including historical accounts, surveying text-
books, legislation, and decisions of the courts.

A few examples suffice to establish proof of concept. In Elementary Surveying, the seminal
text for many aspiring land surveyors, surveying is defined as “that discipline which encom-
passes all methods for gathering and processing information about the physical earth and
the environment” (Brinker and Wolf 1977). Fieldwork is captured within the verb “gather-
ing”; process is explicitly captured within the verb “processing”. Indeed, to be even more
explicit, the text illustrates survey-as-process by describing activities that go beyond mere
boundary fieldwork such as mapping, state plane coordinates, control surveys, parabolic
curves, volumes, and photogrammetry. This theme is reflected in a host of other texts,
including Cadastral surveys within the Commonwealth, which devotes two chapters to the
components of a cadastral system (chapter 3) and to survey administration and education
(chapter 9). Survey-as-process is illustrated through descriptions of feedback elements such
as title legislation, boundary disputes, land values, and planning control; and through an
emphasis on professionalism in informing the debate between the public and private sec-
tor (Dale 1976). The final textbook example is supplied by Survey law in Canada, whose focus
is the surveying of boundaries of parcels but whose scope embraces the Canadian legal sys-
tem (chapter 1), land registration systems (chapter 3), liability in negligence and contract
(chapter 9), and the surveying profession (chapter 11) (Canadian Institute of Surveying &
Mapping/Canadian Council of Land Surveyors 1989).

Lest we be accused of cherry-picking textbooks to substantiate our assertion, let us turn
our attention to legislation. The Canada Lands Surveys Act sets out that the Minister of
Natural Resources (within the federal government) has the administration, direction, and
control of surveys on Canada Lands; and that the Surveyor General has the management
of surveys and the custody of the original plans, journals, field notes, and other papers con-
nected with those surveys. Those two mandates embrace surveys as more than simply
fieldwork, to the extent that the Surveyor General Branch advises First Nations and others
on thorny boundary issues, negotiates funding, issues instructions, maintains technical
standards, administers contracts, reviews plans and field notes, registers survey returns,
compiles cadastral maps, and researches and drafts parcel descriptions. These and a host
of other survey tasks comprise a very wide process.

Indeed, the legislation is explicit about survey-as-process in s29(5): “No survey of Canada
Lands under this part shall be deemed to be completed until the plans thereof have been
confirmed under this section”. Allied to this broad definition of surveys is s32(1) by which
boundaries of parcels are only defined by monuments if the plans of the surveys that placed

the monuments are confirmed by the Surveyor General. Taken together, both sections
define survey-as-fieldwork as a necessary but an insufficient component of finalizing plans
and establishing boundaries.

Let us conclude this proof-of-concept examination with the Canada Lands Surveyors Act, a
companion piece of federal legislation, which defines both cadastral surveying and survey-
ing. In so doing, survey-as-process is captured twice:

– Cadastral surveying is defined as surveying that identifies, establishes, documents, and

describes a boundary.

– Surveying is defined as determining the position of a boundary; collecting and storing
spatial information pertaining to the earth; and interpreting, reporting, and advising
on that information.

To summarize the federal legislation, surveying is implicitly and explicitly defined as
much broader and deeper than using instruments to measure distances and directions,
placing monuments, and recording observations.

Theoretical Constructs

Theoretical constructs are needed to explain two distinct phenomena in this discourse.
The first phenomenon is the discussion that spans a spectrum from gentle debate about
what is a survey and what is surveying, to genuine uncertainty about the role of fieldwork
within process, to vehement denial that surveying extends beyond fieldwork. Two con-
structs assist: System Justification Theory and the Kruger–Dunning Effect (Kruger and
Dunning 1999). System Justification Theory explains that people are motivated to defend
and bolster the status quo. The need for order and stability, and thus resistance to change
or alternatives, is a motivator for individuals to see the status quo as good, legitimate, and
even desirable (Jost and Hunyady 2005). The second construct is the Kruger–Dunning
Effect (Kruger and Dunning 1999), by which people tend to hold overly favorable views of
their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. Such abilities include, of course,
the holding and expressing of views about whether surveying is a process or whether sur-
veying is fieldwork. There is, at best, an inconsistency in the respective methodologies.
Those that argue for survey-as-process readily acknowledge that surveying includes field-
work; whereas those that cleave to survey-as-fieldwork are unwilling to acknowledge the
bigger picture. The Kruger–Dunning Effect (Kruger and Dunning 1999) might well explain
the unidirectional nature of the viewpoint.

The second phenomenon is the embedded nature of survey-as-fieldwork within survey-as-
process and is explained by the Waterfall and Staircase models. Both are models that we
borrow from land tenure reform research in the developing world, in which the theories
explain land-securing behavior (Sewornu 2018). The Waterfall Model progresses from physi-
cal possession to official structures (with some intermediate steps); the Staircase Model
progresses from physical possession to force (such as land guards and private security).
Likewise in this analysis — again, arguing by analogy — the Staircase Model explains the
progression from survey-as-fieldwork to survey-as-process (i.e., from the part to the whole);
whereas the Waterfall Model explains survey-as-process as including survey-as-fieldwork
(i.e., from the whole to the part).

Surveyor General Sproule had been instructed to survey two parcels of land in the upper
St John River Valley:

– a black-lined parcel for settlers
– a red-lined parcel for the Madawaska Maliseet.

The Tribunal found that Sproule’s survey had been accepted by New Brunswick and that
the Madawaska Maliseet accepted his demarcation, assisted him in surveying, and relied on
his monuments and plan. Thus, the 1787 survey helped in creating a Reserve. Sadly, without
the consent of the Madawaska Maliseet, 350 ac of the red-lined parcel was granted in fee
simple to settlers by 1860, 19 aces of the red-lined parcel was granted as a Licence of
Occupation by 1829, and the remaining lands were no longer within the First Nation
Reserve by 1867.

The Tribunal decision is instructive twice. First, it describes the sort of research that is
necessary to re-establish parcels and boundaries. Second, and of more importance, it
describes surveying as a process that includes fieldwork and that itself is included within
the process of establishing a boundary. Thus, surveying is more than mere fieldwork but
less than fully establishing a boundary. Indeed, even the expert for the Madawaska
Maliseet conceded that Sproule’s survey did not create the Reserve but was “making a
recommendation that a Reserve be created” (Madawaska Maliseet First Nation v Canada
2017 SCTC 5 at para 194).

Certainly, the Tribunal acknowledged that Sproule was acting with clear instruc-
tions from his superiors and that he was aware of the importance of “identi-
fying and demarcating areas”, some reserved for the First Nations and others to be granted
to settlers (Madawaska Maliseet First Nation v Canada 2017 SCTC 5 at para 232 and 234). The
1787 demarcation of a line “was the first step in the process of reserve creation”; a process
that the Tribunal set out in detail by focusing on the 1787–1790 period and on the
1787–1825 period (Madawaska Maliseet First Nation v Canada 2017 SCTC 5 at para 271). The
survey and the “acceptance” of the survey by the Crown and the First Nation “together
exhibited an acknowledgement that a Reserve from Crown land had been made for the
use of the Madawaska Maliseet” (Madawaska Maliseet First Nation v Canada 2017 SCTC 5
at para 311). Thus, it was a combination of fieldwork, the survey process that preceded
(e.g., instructions) and succeeded (e.g., plans) the fieldwork and the sanctioning of the
surveying process that comprised the boundary process.

Oxbows within the Gambler Reserve

This tripartite hierarchy, with boundaries at the top, survey process in the middle, and
fieldwork at the bottom, is illustrated in the analysis of the boundaries of the Gambler
Reserve in Manitoba. The Gambler First Nation is interested in taking control of land
management functions pursuant to the First Nations Land Management Act, and thus requires
a rigorous opinion as to its boundaries. That is, the First Nation can only exercise its juris-
diction with certainty if it knows the spatial extent of its Reserve (i.e., the character and
location of its boundaries).

The west boundary of the reserve is the Assiniboine River. A 2017 boundary opinion dis-
closed three ambiguities associated with the riparian boundary — the presence of a series
of oxbows within the Reserve, and the status of two islands in the river (Fig. 1). What follows
focuses only on the first issue — Had the river continued to meander after the Reserve was
created or did the oxbows exist at the time of Reserve creation? The focus illustrates
that boundary establishment in the 19th century relied on more than fieldwork, as does
boundary re-establishment in the 21st century.

Before the creation of the Gambler Reserve, the survey of T18-R29-WPM was completed
by Webb in 1875 (block outline) and by Beatty in 1880 (subdivision). Beatty traversed the
Assiniboine River through T18-R29 (Fig. 2). Through Sections 33 and 34, he set 11 traverse
stations on the bank of the Assiniboine (averaging one station per seven chains or 140 m).
He likely sketched the river location between these mathematical ties.

In addition, Beatty crossed the Assiniboine three times as he surveyed the east boundary
of Section 33. He also noted a body of water or change in elevation, 7 chains (∼141 m) in
width near the north end of Section 33. At the south end where he crossed the River, he
noted a width of 3.2 chains (∼64 m) and a width of the peninsula of 1.8 chains
(∼36 m) (Fig. 3).

When Ponton surveyed the Gambler Reserve in 1883, he did not traverse the Assiniboine
River. Rather, he plotted the river from the Dominion Land Surveys (ostensibly the work of
Beatty). There were, however, substantial differences in the plotting of the river between
Ponton’s 1883 Plan of the Gambler Reserve (Plan 6157 CLSR) and the Township Plan of
18-29-WPM (66667 CLSR) (Fig. 4). At Sections 33 and 34, the general trend of the River was
the same but the magnitude of the meanders differed.

Reid retraced the subdivision of the surrendered part of the Gambler Reserve in May
1900. He surveyed the east bank of the Assiniboine as it ran through Sections 22, 27, 33,
and 34 (the latter two being the remaining part of the Reserve); tied to the Assiniboine
every 3–5 chains; and did not survey the interior subdivision line between Sections 33 and
34. Reid’s Plan showed slightly more than Beatty’s Plan, including more pronounced and

wider meanders. Neither surveyor tied to the Assiniboine frequently enough to create a
high accuracy drawing. Overall, the trend of the Assiniboine as surveyed by Reid was consis-
tent with Beatty’s survey in 1880 (Fig. 5).

The first aerial photography of the area (April 1945, Fig. 6) shows the Assiniboine in the
same location as shown by Beatty in 1880 and Reid in 1900. The image also shows areas
covered by water within Sections 33 and 34 outside of the main channel of the
Assiniboine in what appear to be oxbows. One body of water (part of an oxbow) intersected
the east boundary of Section 33 at the north end, which coincided with the change in eleva-
tion or body of water that Beatty noted. In the next aerial photograph — August 1948 —
these oxbows appear to have dried up. Through successive aerial photographs in 1955,
1956, 1976, 1977, 1985, 1990, 1994, 2005, and 2012 (Fig. 6), these areas are sometimes covered
by water and sometimes dry.

The oxbows appear to have existed prior to the original survey by Beatty in 1880 and
therefore prior to the Reserve survey in 1883 and the Reserve creation in 1889. The oxbows
continued to exist as periodically wet areas and periodically dry areas within the Gambler
Reserve. Indeed, in the more recent colour aerial photos from 2005 to 2012, there is a notice-
able separation between the cultivated areas and the oxbows. In 2005, these areas appear to
be dry, whereas in 2012 (a heavy flooding year), they appear to be covered in small pockets
of water or marshes. These wet–dry changes also vary by season. Overall, the course of the
river seems relatively constant across the imagery, and it does not deviate substantially
from the established main channel, which is also consistent with the previous surveys of
both Beatty and Reid.

A water level station (05ME001) located 30 km upstream from the Reserve has measured
the flow of the Assiniboine River since 1914. Comparing the aerial photos with the water
flow data, it can be inferred that the oxbows are only full of water at times of very high flow
in the Assiniboine (Fig. 7). These events are rare. For instance, the May 1955 aerial photo
shows an oxbow full of water (and high water in the river). Across 104 yr of flow data, only
five spring flow rates have exceeded the rate in 1955 (1922, 1923, 1956, 1995, and 2011).

Conversely, the May 1985 aerial photo shows the oxbow as mostly dry. When compared
with the mean flow rate for all months, the normal flow is rarely above the May 1985 level
(when the oxbow was mostly dry). These data suggests that the oxbow is mostly dry, rarely
does it have some water, and even more rarely does it have a lot of water.

LiDAR data from May 2007 (with updates in October 2008) show an accurate elevation
model of the Reserve area (Fig. 8). There are clear elevation changes from the oxbow areas

up to the top of the cultivated areas and then there is a further elevation change down to
the Assiniboine River. This elevation profile corroborates the historical flow rate data and
suggests that the oxbows rarely (and at times of high water) contain water.

The LiDAR data also suggests historical channel migration in the predominantly flat
Assiniboine valley (Fig. 9). Clear elevation imprints are visible on both sides of the river in
a layered fashion. The time scale of this movement pre-dates Reserve creation, given the
constant river channel location.

The Gambler Reserve conclusion is that the trend of the river has been constant since
the 1880 township survey. The evidence suggests that oxbows existed when the Reserve

was created and are thus within the Reserve. The discussion of both the Specific Claims
Tribunal decision and the FNLMA boundary opinion provides guidance in three areas:

2.

3.

Be expansive — Surveying is more than merely fieldwork; it is a comprehensive process
that requires much interplay between surveyor, landowner (and others with rights in land),
and regulators and much use of previous surveys.
Be fettered — Surveying does not, in and of itself, establish boundaries. Rather, it is often
an integral part of the boundary process.
Be diligent — When re-establishing boundaries, survey-as-process requires that many
sources of information be researched. The best available evidence of a boundary — particu-
larly of a water boundary — includes many documents and databases outside existing
plans and field notes.

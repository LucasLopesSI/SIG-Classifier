The development of interoperable environmental process models is widely
supported by both the research community and government agencies. This paper
discusses a conceptual
framework to guide the delineation of process
components, the basic unit of interoperable models. The concepts of semantic
reference system and dual hierarchy are explored to establish the conceptual
framework. Based on this discussion, the Formal Concept Analysis is used as an
analytical approach to decompose and fuse existing environmental process
models in order to identify environmental process components. For purposes of
discussion, a hydrological process, surface runoff, is used throughout the paper
as an example of an environmental process to support the conceptual discussion
and to illustrate the application of the conceptual framework and analytical
approach.

Introduction

Many environmental process models are closed monolithic systems. These models
simulate the physical processes of the environment and contribute greatly to
environmental management. However, the structure of these models has become
increasingly unsuitable for complex problems. It is common that multiple models
are involved in a single project, but only parts of each model are relevant. With the
closed monolithic structure, it is difficult to insert new functions into an existing
model system or to use only parts of the system. In addition, in order to maintain
the internal consistency, a modification to one part of a model system frequently
requires changes in many other parts regardless of how minor the initial
modification might be. Furthermore, the current generation of models tends to
borrow common sets of functions from earlier generations, leading to an increasing
duplication among models. The use of modular design in later generations of
process models alleviated these problems to some extent, but these modules are
confined within the boundaries of a closed model system and cannot be used by
other models. The monolithic model structure has become an increasingly acute

problem. This is especially true as our knowledge of environmental processes
becomes increasingly sophisticated and the process models become increasingly
complex. It is widely recognized that the closed monolithic modeling approach must
be replaced with more effective ones (Bennett 1997, Benz et al. 2001, Bernard and
Kruger 2000, Bian 2000, He et al. 2003, Huang and Claramunt 2004, Keller and
Dungan 1999, Leavesley et al. 1996, Taylor et al. 1999, Villa 2001, Westervelt and
Shapiro 2000).

An ideal approach is to develop customized models—assembling only those parts
of models that are relevant to a particular project or so called interoperable models.
In recent years, the concept of interoperability has received increasing attention in
environmental modeling (Bennett 1997, Benz et al. 2001, Bernard and Kruger 2000,
Bian 2000, Crosier et al. 2003, He et al. 2003, Huang and Claramunt 2004, Keller
and Dungan 1999, Leavesley et al. 1996, Taylor et al. 1999, Villa 2001, Westervelt
and Shapiro 2000). The development of interoperable process models is widely
supported by both the research community and government agencies. The report
issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Task Committee on GIS
Modules and Distributed Models of the Watershed (1999) and the Memorandum of
Understanding issued by eight federal government agencies (Interagency Steering
Committee on Multimedia Environmental Models 2001) are notable examples.

Component-based modeling, a method that facilitates interoperation, is readily
available and has been implemented in major GIS software packages. In
comparison, the development of interoperable process models is still in its infancy,
despite a widely supported call for such development. In the long history of process
model development, there have been established algorithms contained in the models
to represent physical processes. These algorithms contain accumulated scientific
knowledge, time tested representations, and efficient coding. It is practical, as well as
strategic, to respect these developments instead of reinventing the wheel to develop
‘another model’ (Bower and Luda¨ scher 2004). However, identifying components
from a large number and diverse set of process models presents a number of
technical and, especially, conceptual challenges.

Several conceptual issues must be addressed before components can be identified
and developed. These issues include principles to guide the delineation of
components, the meta-information necessary to describe a component, and the
semantic compatibility among components. This paper focuses on the first issue,
discussing the principles
to guide the delineation of process components.
Specifically, two issues are addressed: (1) a conceptual framework to delineate
process components and (2) an analytical approach to decomposing existing process
models in order to derive process components.

Due to the large number of concepts involved in the following discussion, this
paper begins with a background section describing the concepts of interoperability
and component-based modeling. In the section that follows, the discussion focuses

guidelines to delineate environmental process components. The analytical approach
uses the Formal Concept Analysis (Kavouras and Kokla 2002, Kokla and Kavouras
1999, 2001, Priss 2006, Wille 1992). It is used to decompose existing process models.

throughout the paper as an example of an environmental process. The third section
of the paper demonstrates the delineation of runoff process components to support
the conceptual discussion and illustrate the application of the conceptual framework
and analytical approach.

2. Background

2.1

Interoperability

Interoperability is one of the research topics in the forefront of several research
communities (Benz et al. 2001, Bian 2000, Crosier et al. 2003, Goodchild et al. 1998,
Keller and Dungan 1999, Villa 2001, Westervelt and Shapiro 2000). Interoperation
allows data and functions to be used freely across systems. Research in the field of
interoperability has focused on issues at the technical, semantic, and institutional
levels (Goodchild et al. 1998). Research at the technical level addresses issues that
affect shared operation, such as data format, data structure, language, and user
interface. Research in semantic interoperation involves the establishment of
meaning for data and functions and the sharing of the meaning across different
user communities. Institutional interoperation addresses social, economic, and legal
issues that affect the sharing of data and functions across organizations (Goodchild
et al. 1998, Taylor et al. 1999, Westervelt and Shapiro 2000). Of the three levels,
semantic interoperability is of particular research importance because the technical
interoperation and institutional support cannot guarantee a meaningful sharing of
data and functions across system and institution boundaries.

Since the late 1990s, the GIS community has seen rapid progression in the
analysis, design, and implementation of interoperable GIS systems. In terms of
analysis, there has been an important collection of papers discussing semantically
interoperable GIS (Abel et al. 1998, Bishr 1998, Devogele et al. 1998, Laurini 1998,
Voisard and Schweppe 1998). In addition, specifications for exchanging GIS data
and functions have been developed. The one developed by the Open GIS
Consortium (OPGIS, http://www.opengis.org)
example.
interoperable GIS products, such as ArcObjectsH developed by

implemented in commercial GIS packages. In comparison to GIS, the development
of interoperable environmental process models still requires attention, despite the
fact that the need is widely recognized.

is a most notable

2.2 Component-based modeling

Computing theory and techniques to support interoperable models are already
available, namely, the component-based modeling approach. It was seen as one of
the major computation developments in the post object-orientation era (Pfister and
Szyperski 1998, Wegner 1990). Components are independently developed, ready-to-
use software units. They can be assembled together in a plug-and-play fashion to
form a functional software system, in which each component plays a clearly defined
role (Kruchten 1998, Szyperski 1998). The development of components embodies a
general
trend in software development, a movement away from stand-alone
monolithic systems and toward the assembly of a large number of components into
a system (Kruchten 1998, Szyperski 1998).

In the context of process models, component-based modeling is to some extent
similar to the modular design in recent environmental models. However, unlike

modules, components are not constrained by system boundaries. From the design
perspective, components in many ways resemble objects (in the context of object
orientation) from which the component approach evolved. Unique to components is
an explicit interface architecture that consists of a number of interfaces. These
interfaces describe a component to users. The most basic categories of description
include (1) the identification of a component, (2) the function that the component
provides to other components, and (3) the data and functions that the component
requires to carry out its own functions. These interfaces facilitate the communica-
tion and integration between components. Thus,
the components can exist
independently yet be integrated with each other when desired.

The

critical

component-based approach provides

conceptual advantages,
although most discussions have focused on its technical merits. The fundamental
concept behind the component-based modeling is that complex systems, such as
those of environmental concerns, are compositions of a finite number of
components in various combinations and arrangements (Booch 1994, Pfister and
Szyperski 1998). The component-based modeling approach offers advantages
particularly for dealing with complex systems. Components are organized in a
hierarchy of primitive and composite components. A primitive component is the
most basic unit and a composite component consists of other primitive or composite
components. This organization principle is well suited to the multi-scale nature of
environmental systems. Further, components at a same level of hierarchy are
associated with one another through an explicit compositional relationship. This
structure favors the modeling of environments that are often perceived as assembled
systems.

The concept of components can have profound implications in the representation
of environmental phenomena and processes, as evidenced in recent development of
geographic information systems. The component-based modeling approach may
fundamentally change the way environmental models are developed and used, as
well as the way environmental models integrate with GIS and other modeling tools.

2.3 Component-based modeling for environmental models

Environmental process models describe physical processes in the environment
through mathematical expressions. The goal of modeling is to forecast the outcome
of processes that are of environmental concern. At the core of the physical processes
is the exchange of energy and material through time. The mathematical descriptions
of the processes are governed by basic laws of physics, such as conservation of mass,
momentum (the law of motion), and energy (the law of thermodynamics). The
concepts of these processes (and their associated mathematical expressions) and
relationships between them form the knowledge framework for disciplines that
handle environmental process modeling. Typical process models include those in
hydrologic, atmospheric, meteorological, climatic, and oceanographic sciences.

The composition of this knowledge framework is consistent with the principle of
component-based modeling. First, each process is clearly defined and is separated
from other processes by distinct boundaries, conceptually and mathematically.
Second, the relationships between the processes are either hierarchical according to
the level of representation or compositional if at a same level of hierarchy. Thus, it is
possible to develop model components, each representing a distinct environmental
process or a set of processes. These components serve as building blocks for

customized modeling and can be assembled together to form a model according to
the specific problem at hand.

The development of environmental process components

several
conceptual issues to be addressed. As noted above, these include (1) the principles
to guide the delineation of components, (2) the meta-information necessary to
describe a component, and (3) the semantic compatibility between components. The
first issue, which is the focus of this paper, is to identify the most basic modeling
units that serve as the primitive components or the building blocks of a customized
model. The two subsequent issues fall outside the scope of this paper and are briefly
discussed below in order to provide a broad context of this research.

requires

the second issue,

Once the primitive components are identified, meta-information, which is the
focus of
is necessary to describe a component. Spatial
heterogeneity, temporal dependence, and certain stochastic behavior of physical
processes are major categories of assumptions underlying many process models
(Eagleson 1970, Maidment 1993). Related to these assumptions, a list of candidate
meta-information has been discussed in the literature. One type of this information
involves spatial and temporal concerns, such as spatial and temporal distribution
(e.g. event-based vs. continuous and lumped vs. distributed), spatial extent and
temporal duration, and spatial and temporal resolutions (Benz et al. 2001, Villa
2001). Another type of information is related to the process itself, such as entities,
processes, and relations (Crosier et al. 2003, Keller and Dungan 1999, Mcintosh and
Yuan 2005). A third type of information addresses parameters and their value range
for such as environment conditions, initial conditions and boundary conditions
(Leavesley et al. 1996). The fourth type is concerned with model development, such
as model creation, validation, and referencing (Benz et al. 2001, Crosier et al. 2003).
The third issue, semantic compatibility between components, addresses whether
environmental process components can be assembled together. The meta-informa-
tion associated with each component is critical for this step. These components can
be organized into an ontological
framework for evaluation. A number of
approaches have been used or can be potentially used to evaluate semantic
similarity between components. These include the approaches to organize the
concepts, such as trees and conceptual graphs, including Formal Concept Analysis,
and associated methods to evaluate compatibilities (Bower and Luda¨ scher 2004,
2005, Cruz et al. 2004, Feng and Flewelling 2004, Kavouras and Kokla 2002, Kokla
and Kavouras 1999, 2001, Luda¨ scher et al. 2006, Priss 2006, Rada et al. 1989, Sowa
2000, Tversky 1977, Wille 1992). The rich content of these two issues, meta-
information and semantic compatibility, deserves separate discussions outside this
paper.

While component-based modeling is experiencing a rapid evolution,

the
development is not balanced. The technical aspect of component development is
far more advanced than is its conceptual counterpart. Of all conceptual concerns,
the issue of how to identify primitive components and the composite components in
a system has received the least attention, despite the fact that this is a critical first
step for any component-based development. The lack of attention to this issue arises
because component-based modeling originates from computer science. Component
delineation is considered a practical issue and is left to the judgment of researchers
and project managers for specific projects. In the computer science literature, most
discussions focus on how to make a component, rather than on what constitutes a
component. In the GIS literature, most discussions focus on how to manage the

semantic compatibility between different systems when they are incorporated into
one application. This approach treats an entire model system, rather than parts of a
system, as an interoperational unit (Taylor et al. 1999). Another approach is to treat
a symbol in an equation as a basic unit to register meta-information (Keller and
Dungan 1999), implying a symbol in an equation as the basic modeling unit. The
proprietary GIS software packages tend to define components in a wide range of
levels in order to accommodate a variety of needs (Zeiler 2002). The diversity in
defining components reflects the still-evolving research over how to identify
components, which is the focus of this paper.

3. Framework and approach

3.1 Environmental process models

This paper focuses on hydrological models to address the issue of delineating
components. Hydrological models are typical of process models. By definition, they
are mathematical representations of the flow of water and its constituents on the
land surface and in the subsurface environment (Maidment 1993). Hydrology as a
discipline has long established principles that are closely related to the basic laws of
physics. Following these principles, a large number of hydrological models of many
generations have been developed. Of these models, a finite number are most
frequently used in practice and most of them are either developed or endorsed by the
federal agencies in the U.S. (Maidment 1993). From this pool, a number of non-
point-source pollution process models are selected for the intended analysis. The
reason to choose these models is to focus the analysis on a manageable number of
models. In addition, non-point-source pollution remains one of the most challenging
environmental problems we face today. Furthermore, the frequently used models
have evolved over time and are more comprehensive than other models, thus
providing a reliable basis for the intended analysis. Lastly, components developed
from these frequently used models may have greater utility for the user community.

3.2 Formal concept analysis

Formal Concept Analysis is designed for data analysis, knowledge representation,
and information management (Wille 1992). This analysis has received increased
attention in the last decade and has grown from a topic of a small research group to
that of an international research community (Priss 2006). This analysis offers a
systematic approach to place concepts in heterogeneous ontological systems into a
single framework, i.e. the concept lattice. An ontological system consists of a set of
concepts and the relationships between them. These heterogeneous ontological
systems may share a similar theme, but be developed at different levels of detail with
different application intentions.

The concept

lattice method projects original concepts
in heterogeneous
ontological systems onto a set of reference concepts. Reference concepts are widely
accepted basic terms in a discipline. They are used as semantic reference to annotate
and uniformly represent the heterogeneous original concepts. Based on the reference
concepts associated with each original concept, a set of generic new concepts is
extracted. These are the basic concepts and unique combinations of them embedded
in the original concepts. These new concepts are then organized in the multi-level
hierarchical concept lattice (Kavouras and Kokla 2002, Kokla and Kavouras 1999,

Downloaded by [Flinders University of South Australia] at 02:11 04 October 2014 Identifying components for interoperable process models

1015

2001). New information and insights can then be drawn from this lattice for
intended applications.

For geographic research, the concept lattice method has been used to detect the
semantic equivalence, overlap, and diversity between concepts in heterogeneous
geographic ontological systems (Kavouras and Kokla 2002), and to integrate
heterogeneous geographic ontological systems into one cohesive system (Kokla and
Kavouras 1999, 2001).

Relevant to this study, hydrological models are equivalent to the heterogeneous
ontological systems. Elements in a model, which represent certain hydrological
processes and are implemented by algorithms, are equivalent to the original
concepts in heterogeneous ontological systems. Once the reference concepts are
identified, which will be discussed further in later sections, a set of generic processes
contained in these model elements can be identified. These generic processes are
equivalent to the aforementioned new concepts. They include both the most basic
processes (those that cannot be divided further) and combinations of
them
contained in various models. Algorithms associated with these generic processes
can then be used as a basis to develop primitive and composite process components.
Hydrological models consist of processes and a hierarchy defining the relation-
ships between these processes. These models may follow the same knowledge
framework, but differ in representation emphasis, levels of generalization, and
intended applications. In this sense, these models are perceived as the heterogeneous
ontological systems. Each model has its own hierarchy, inclusion and exclusion of
specific processes, and simplified or detailed representation of a process. Elements
that represent these processes (or sets of processes) in a model are perceived as the
original concepts of individual ontological systems.

3.3 Reference concepts

As discussed above, three sets of concepts are involved in the concept lattice
analysis. These are the (1) original concepts, (2) reference concepts, and (3) new
concepts. Of the three sets, the original concepts are adopted directly from their
home systems. The new concepts are extracted using concept lattice analysis. The
identification of the reference concepts is most critical because, as the semantic
reference, these concepts directly affect the semantic identity and representation
level of the new concepts. For this study, these new concepts are the generic
hydrological processes and associated algorithms.

One commonly used method to identify the reference concepts is the semantic
factoring approach (Kokla and Kavouras 2001, Sowa 2000). This approach makes
use of the properties of concepts, if available, to identify the core and boundary of
reference concepts. The properties can be phrases and key words in a descriptive
definition of a concept. If properties of a concept in one ontological system overlap
with those of a concept in another system, the original concept (or both original
concepts) that contains more than one concept should be divided into multiple
concepts. For example, the process ‘surface runoff’ overlaps with the concept
‘surface water storage’ in terms of the concept ‘surface water storage’. Of the two,
‘surface runoff’ is a larger concept than ‘surface water storage’ because it contains
additional concepts such as ‘overland flow’. The larger concept ‘surface runoff’ is
then divided into two concepts, ‘surface water storage’ and ‘overland flow’.

This process continues until all resultant concepts are unique, with each serving as
a reference concept. This approach is easy to execute, but requires the availability

L. Bian and S. Hu

and completeness of property information. For example, the concept ‘surface
runoff’ contains several other concepts in addition to ‘surface water storage’ and
‘overland flow’. If the property information is not complete, ‘surface runoff’ may be
divided only into two sub-concepts, thus possibly misrepresenting its true meaning.
Input from users is often required to manually augment the identification of
reference concepts.

In this study, the knowledge framework of hydrology is used as the reference
concepts (hereafter called reference processes). This framework consists of concepts
and a hierarchy that organizes these concepts (see section 2.3). It serves as the
standard ontology for the discipline (such as that documented in Hydrology
Handbook, 1996 and other documents, Appendix A). Similar to many physics-based
environmental sciences, concepts and relationships in this standard ontology are
registered to the basic laws of physics. This ontology has been stable for a long time
and is respected as the semantic reference system by the discipline. This standard
ontology provides more robust reference concepts than those derived from
individual definitions. In addition, this usage also takes advantage of recent
developments in the philosophy of science, such as the semantic reference system
(Kuhn and Raubal 2003) and dual hierarchy (Ahl and Allen 1996, Yuan 2000).

3.4 Semantic reference system and dual hierarchy

Kuhn and Raubal (2003), from the perspective of ontology, proposed the concept of
semantic reference system in order to achieve semantic interoperation when sharing
data and functions across systems. This concept draws analogy to the referencing
between spatial coordinate systems and between temporal systems. An example of
the latter is referencing across different calendars. The semantic reference system, as
the authors proposed, should consist of three elements, a semantic datum, a
semantic reference frame, and translation functions. The semantic datum contains
the most basic terms used in a given knowledge system and meaning of these terms.
The semantic reference frame is a formally defined and application-independent
concept structure. This frame defines the conceptualization underlying the use of
these terms. Any term can be projected to the reference frame in order to be
understood and used properly. The translation functions relate a concept in an
application to the semantic reference frame and semantically annotate this concept
by the semantic datum. The importance of the semantic reference system has been
evidenced in data and analysis management in ecology, geology, and land use
studies (Bower and Luda¨ scher 2005, Brodaric and Gahegan 2006, Cruz et al. 2004,
Luda¨ scher et al. 2006).

The idea of the semantic reference system is consistent with the dual hierarchy
theory (Ahl and Allen 1996). From the viewpoint of science epistemology, the
authors proposed the concept of dual hierarchy, a definitional hierarchy and an
empirical hierarchy. The definitional hierarchy is independent of an observer. The
levels of concepts in this hierarchy are organized according to the inclusion
relationships implied in the definition principles, mostly by the type of a
phenomenon. Another, the empirical hierarchy, exists relative to the observer’s
questions. The concepts in this empirical hierarchy are organized by the scalar
aspects of a phenomenon, such as spatio-temporal scales of an observation, and this
organization may change depending on the observer’s questions. The separation
between the two hierarchies, while being used in tandem, is crucial. Otherwise,
‘While a definitional hierarchy can be consonant with an empirical hierarchy, power

Downloaded by [Flinders University of South Australia] at 02:11 04 October 2014 Identifying components for interoperable process models

1017

is severely limited, and analyses become muddled if definitional and scalar levels are
confused one with another.’ (Ahl and Allen 1996, p. 79).

The two developments, semantic reference system and dual hierarchy, are related
to each other. The definitional hierarchy defined by Ahl and Allen (1996) is
equivalent to the semantic reference system defined by Kuhn and Raubal (2003). In
both, the hierarchy and the concepts residing in the hierarchy are established prior
to a specific investigation (hereafter, ‘definitional hierarchy’ and ‘semantic reference
systems’ are uniformly referred to as the semantic reference system unless explicitly
stated otherwise).

The standard ontology of a discipline is equivalent to the semantic reference
system. These ontologies exist independently of their applications in various process
models. Specific models, on the other hand, are equivalent to the empirical
hierarchies. These models are developed for certain investigations, and often focus
on particular scalar aspects of the environment. Because of the diverse focuses,
differences are expected between them regarding which parts of the knowledge
framework to use and how to use them in a model (Bras 1990 (see Appendix A),
ASCE Task Committee on GIS Modules and Distributed Models of the Watershed
1999). The intention of this research is to use the semantic reference system to guide
the delineation of the generic processes present in the empirical systems.

For this research, the standard ontology of surface runoff, a subset of the
hydrological knowledge framework,
is used as the semantic reference system
(table 1). Surface runoff refers to all the waters flowing on the surface of the earth in
response to precipitation, by either overland flow or channel flow (Maidment 1993).
Surface runoff can be further divided into several levels of processes, as shown in
table 1. This hierarchy is arranged according to classic texts and current literature in
hydrology (Appendix A). Arguably, alternative arrangements exist. Our intent,
however, is not to establish a hydrological conceptual framework, but to adopt a
reasonable framework as the basis to discuss the identification of environmental
process components. The 12 hydrological processes at the lowest level of this
hierarchy are deemed as the semantic datum and used as the reference processes for

Table 1. The knowledge framework of surface runoff. Note that the surface runoff hierarchy
is designated ‘1’ here because there are other hydrological processes that are not included in
this study, such as interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration, etc.

the subsequent concept lattice analysis. The hierarchy itself is equivalent to the
semantic reference frame defined in Kuhn and Raubal (2003).

Equivalent to the empirical hierarchies are six hydrological models. These models
include EPIC, SWAT, WEPP, CREAMS, MIKE SHE, and PRMS (Appendix B),
commonly used non-point source pollution models. Due to the sheer number of
processes contained in these models, only those that contain detailed surface runoff
processes are selected for the intended study. A total of 30 model elements for runoff
are identified from these six hydrological models, according to definitions in the
manual of each model (Appendix B).

In the subsequent concept

the hydrological models are
lattice analysis,
decomposed into elements. These elements are projected to the reference processes.
A set of generic processes present in these model elements is identified, including
both the most basic processes and combinations of them. These generic processes
are then organized into a hierarchy according to the reference processes contained in
them. This hierarchy identifies those generic processes that are equivalent to the
primitive and/or composite components.

4. Delineating process components

The concept lattice method consists of several steps (Kavouras and Kokla 2002,
Kokla and Kavouras 1999). The first step projects model elements to the reference
processes in a matrix (table 2). The 12 reference processes are arranged along the top
row. The 30 model elements are placed in the left column, arranged according to the
hierarchical levels in their home model. For example, the SWAT model contains
elements in three levels (2., 2.x, and 2.x.x). The body of the matrix indicates whether
a model element contains a reference process, denoted by an ‘x’ sign. The
containment relationship between the model elements and reference processes is
identified based on the definition and hierarchy detailed in the manual
‘surface runoff’,
(Appendix B). For example, the top-level element of SWAT,
contains seven reference processes (surface storage, lumped overland flow, overland
flow routing, transmission loss, evaporation loss, bank storage, and reservoir routing).
One of the second-level elements, ‘overland flow’, contains three reference processes
(lumped overland flow, overland flow routing, and transmission loss). A third level
element, ‘surface runoff lag’, contains one reference process (overland flow routing).
Based on the reference processes contained in the model elements, this step reveals
equivalence, overlap, and diversity between these elements. For example, both
SWAT and WEPP contain an element called ‘overland flow’, and both elements
contain three reference processes. However, only one of the three is identical
between the two elements. Thus, these two ‘overland flow’, though sharing the same
name, are not equivalent. They overlap by one reference process. On the other hand,
SWAT contains a third-level element called ‘surface runoff lag’ and WEPP contains
another third-level element called ‘overland flow routing’. Both contain a single
identical reference process, overland flow routing. Thus, the two elements are
equivalent though carrying different names. This step annotates and uniformly
represents the model elements by the reference processes.

The second step of the concept lattice method identifies new concepts that emerge
from the matrix. They are those combinations of reference processes that are present
in various model elements. With respect to the matrix in table 2, these refer to
combinations of reference processes (identified by the ‘x’ sign) along a row. This can
range from a combination of one reference process to the combination of all 12

reference processes. For example, a combination of three reference processes,
surface storage (m1), overland flow routing (m5), and reservoir routing (m11) is
present in both the ‘Surface runoff’ (g2), a top-level element of SWAT, and ‘Surface
water’ (g13), a top level element in WEPP. Thus, the new concept for this particular
combination of three reference processes can be expressed as this combination,
along with the model elements containing this combination

Ci5(Surface runoff, Surface water, surface storage, overland flow routing,

reservoir routing).

Table 3 lists 29 new concepts derived from the matrix in table 2. The example
above is the C235(g2, g13, m1, m5, m11) in the list. Of all these generic processes,
the one that contains the largest number of reference concepts is the ‘largest concept’
and the one that contains the least number of reference concepts is the ‘least
concept’. The largest concept C1 contains all 12 reference processes and is used only
as a reference. It is not a meaningful new concept in itself. The next largest concepts
are C3 and C22, each containing seven reference processes. There are a number of
least concepts that contain only one reference process. For example, new concept C2
contains only one reference process m12. Initially 53 new concepts were derived and
they were reduced to optimize the presentation. For example, C2 (g1, g22, m12) and
C37 (g22, m12) share a single identical reference process m12, and C2 includes all
the elements in C37, i.e. g22. In this case, C37 is eliminated. This process yields the
29 new concepts (Table 3) contained in various model elements.

The third step identifies inclusion relationships between the new concepts and
generates a concept lattice. This involves an examination of whether a new concept
includes any other new concepts in their entirety. For example, the new concept C3
includes the new concept C6, in terms of reference processes m4, m5, and m7. This
relationship is expressed as C3(C6). In this relationship, C3 is a super-concept to C6
and the latter is a sub-concept to the former.

Table 4 lists the resultant concept lattice—the set of 29 new concepts and the
relationships between them organized into five levels. The graphic form of this
concept lattice is displayed in figure 1, including the reference processes. Level 1 is
the highest level of the hierarchy, consisting of the largest concept, C1. Level 5 is the
lowest level, consisting of ten least concepts, C2, C4, C8, C11, C15, C18, C20, C24,
C28, and C30. The levels are organized based on the inclusion relationships between
the concepts. For example, the concepts C3, C22, C38, and C46 at Level 2 are direct
super-concepts of concept C6, C40, C43, C47, or C50 at Level 3. Similarly, the
concepts at Level 3 are direct super-concepts of most concepts at Level 4. The
relationship between two successive levels is not a necessary restriction, as long as
super-concepts are at levels higher than those of sub-concepts. The concept C3 in
Level 2, for example, includes sub-concepts at two different levels 3 (C6, C47) and 4
(C14, C23). The new concept C1 at Level 1 includes sub-concepts at three Levels 2,
3, and 5.

The description of the concept lattice method above highlights the basic steps that
are directly relevant
to the study presented in this paper. The description
intentionally minimizes mathematical expressions and emphasizes basic concepts
that are most useful for potential users. See Kokla and Kavouras (1999) and
Kavouras and Kokla (2002) for detailed treatments on procedures and mathema-
tical context of the method.

In the original design of the concept lattice method, concepts between levels of the
lattice are in an is-a relationship. That is, a sub-concept at a lower level is a type of

its super-concept. The sub-concept should inherit all attributes from its super-
concept, and usually possess its own additional attributes. The top concept usually
has the least number of attributes and the least concepts at the bottom contain the
greatest number of attributes. The study presented in this paper presents an
alternative pattern due to the structure of standard ontology of hydrology. The
concepts between levels are related in a part-of, rather than an is-a, relationship. For
example, the process ‘surface runoff’ is a super-concept of its sub-concept ‘surface
water storage’. The sub-concept ‘surface water storage’ is part of its super-concept
‘surface runoff’, but is not a type of ‘surface runoff’. Contrary to the original design,
the super-concepts in the lattice of this study contain more reference processes than
their sub-concepts. As a result, the top concept in figure 1 contains all reference
processes, while the least concept contains only one reference process.

5. Discussion

Several implications can be drawn from the concept lattice in figure 1. First, the
concept lattice in figure 1 relates all model elements, along with their models, into a
single hierarchy based on the reference processes shared between them. The
hierarchy reveals clear, yet intricate relationships between these models in terms of
similarities and heterogeneities in representation emphasis, level of generalization,
and intended applications. These similarities and heterogeneities may not be obvious
when evaluated without an approach such as the concept lattice method, especially
for a large number of complex models.

Second, the vertical structure of the lattice shows the combination of processes at
different levels. Level 2 shows the most comprehensive combination of processes,
while Level 5 presents the most basic individual processes. The levels in between are
those that contain either the next most comprehensive combinations or the next
most basic combinations. This hierarchical structure reveals the model elements that
can be adopted to develop primitive and composite components.

respectively. These four models

Specifically, the four concepts at Level 2 (the virtually highest level) C3, C22, C38,
and C46 roughly correspond to four hydrological models SWAT, WEPP, MIKE
SHE, and PRMS,
include more detailed
representations of surface runoff than the remaining two models (EPIC and
CREAMS). The combination of processes included in each of the four concepts is
characteristic of the representation emphasis and intended applications of the
corresponding model. The information of combination is useful
to develop
customized hydrological models.

On the other hand, the concepts at the lowest level, Level 5, correspond to
individual reference processes (table 1). However, there are only ten concepts in
Level 5, two less than the 12 reference processes. This is because the reference
process Lumped stream runoff (m6) is not included in any of the models without
associating it with the reference process Stream flow routing (m10). Similarly, the
reference process Lumped overland flow (m4) is always associated with the reference
process Overland flow routing (m5). Thus, m6 and m4 are not recognized as stand-
alone concepts in the lattice. The two pairs, m6/m10 and m4/m5, are essential
combinations
for developing composite components. Among the ten basic
processes, the reference process Overland flow routing (m5) represented by C8 and
Stream flow routing (m10) represented by C24 are the most commonly included

development. Even with a manageable number of models, the number of processes

in the models. This

1027

included in these models is overwhelming. It is sensible to identify the most
commonly included processes to begin the component development. Thus, m5 and
m10 should be among the first to be developed into components for interoperable
hydrological models.

Furthermore, the super- and sub-concepts located in non-successive levels, linked
by dash-line arrows in figure 1, indicate a special relationship between levels. The
sub-concepts are placed in the correct level in terms of the scale of representation.
However, concepts in their successive upper level do not contain these sub-concepts.
For example, C27 in Level 4 is a combination of inter-rill flow (m2), rill flow (m3),
and overland flow routing (m5), primarily detailed overland flow processes. Its
successive upper Level 3 is mainly concerned with stream runoff processes (e.g.
Lumped stream runoff, Transmission loss, Evaporation loss, Bank storage, or Stream
flow routing, m6–10) and does not typically include detailed overland flow processes.
Therefore, C27 does not have a direct connection with concepts in its successive
super-concept Level 3. Instead, it is linked to a concept in Level 2. Concepts such as
C27 suggest specialized combinations for component development.

the concept

Third, horizontally,

lattice reveals the differences in level of
generalization and application intention. For example, concept C2 is on a shallow
branch (with few levels of concepts) distant from the other four models. C2 contains
a single reference process Lumped surface runoff (m12) associated with model
elements g1 and g22 included in EPIC and CREAMS, respectively. This reflects the
fact that EPIC and CREAM are an earlier generation of models that uses a simple
lumped approach to modeling surface runoff. The other four models are more
complex and closely related to each other. The combinations in these four models
are slightly polarized. On one end is the overland emphasis dominated by Surface
storage, Inter-rill flow, Rill flow, Lumped overland flow, or Overland flow routing
(m1–m5). On the other end is a stream emphasis dominated by Lumped stream
runoff, Transmission loss, Evaporation loss, Bank storage, or Stream flow routing
(m6–10). This polarization is most easily recognizable at Level 4. This information is
useful for developing specialized composite components.

Fourth and lastly, in a concept lattice hierarchy, a concept is expected to have
multiple sub-concepts, but typically only one super-concept. Figure 1 shows a rather
different pattern. Many concepts have multiple super-concepts, and this occurs at
multiple levels within the four models. This suggests a high degree of similarity
between these four models. That is, these models share not only similar individual
processes, but also similar combinations of processes. This confirms the observation
that current models overlap in functions and warrants the development of
interoperable process models, rather than increasingly larger and more similar
models.

The concept lattice method offers a comprehensive view of all model elements at a
glance to identify the essential components and their combinations. This
information is useful for identifying the appropriate models and model elements
from which algorithms can be adopted for the development of components. For
illustration purposes, this paper analyzes model elements at the process level. This
analysis can be extended to multiple finer levels, such as at the equation and
parameter levels. A model may include a number of processes. Each process is
mathematically defined by equations, and each equation is further quantified by
parameters. Similar to the analysis for processes, the equations (or parameters) can
be uniformly represented by reference equations (or parameters). Generic equations

(or parameters) can subsequently be extracted and organized in a concept lattice.
The most basic equations (or parameters) and their combinations can be identified
for use in the development of interoperable models.

The basic processes, equations, and parameters may have meta-information (see
section 2.3). With this information, the semantic compatibility between processes,
between equations, and between parameters can be evaluated at both individual
and multiple levels. For example, if the process of overland flow is evaluated for
its compatibility with another process, one of its meta-information, climate
conditions (either arid or humid areas), could dictate the selection of two sub-
processes, infiltration-excess-overland-flow for arid areas and saturation-overland-
flow for humid areas. Further, at the equation level, the Horton infiltration
equation and Green-Ampt infiltration equation could be considered for arid and
humid areas, respectively. One of the meta-information, surface material (clay/silt
or fine sand), at the equation level (i.e. Horton) could dictate the value range of
the infiltration rate at the parameter level. The same principle is applicable for the
Green-Ampt equation. These sub-processes, equations, and parameters of over-
land flow are then evaluated as to whether they are compatible with those of
another process.

Because meta-information and compatibility evaluation are not the focus of this
paper, these two issues are not considered in detail. Collectively, the identification of
basic components, meta-information, and semantic compatibility at multiple levels
helps the development of interoperable environmental models.

6. Conclusions

Interoperable process models offer flexibility and efficiency for environmental
modeling. Physics-based environmental disciplines, such as hydrology, have a distinct
advantage for such a development. The standard ontology of these disciplines follows
the basic laws of physics. It is ideal to serve as the semantic reference system to guide
the delineation of process components and for the adoption of algorithms. Although
focusing on the surface runoff process, the conceptual framework discussed in this
paper can be readily applied to other hydrological processes and processes in other
physics-based disciplines. This framework can also be used for those environmental
disciplines that do not heavily depend on physics, although such an application may
face different conceptual challenges.

The concept

lattice method is an effective analytical

tool. It unifies the
representation of original concepts present in heterogeneous model elements and
organizes these concepts into a hierarchy to identify primitive and composite
components. The findings of this paper confirm many of the strengths of the concept
lattice method (Hirtle 1995, Kavouras and Kokla 2002, Kokla and Kavouras 1999).
Specifically for this research, this method reveals emerging information through
fusion and division of diverse models. For example, the multi-level combination of
processes and the hierarchical relationships between processes across different
models are not obvious without using an analytical tool such as the concept lattice
method.

We believe that interoperable process models are an inevitable direction for future
generations of environmental process models. The delineation of process
components is a crucial first step toward this development. We hope that the
discussions presented in this paper can contribute toward this goal.

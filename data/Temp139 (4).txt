Geographic Information Systems (GIS) users now have multiple options for using ele-
vation data ranging from submeter to kilometers, owing to the rapid development and
extensive use of geographic information technologies, such as light detection and rang-
ing (lidar). However, such data are often provided ‘as is,’ creating a need for error
propagation and validation of digital elevation data, which is the motivation for this
research. We start by seeking the ‘signature’ of elevation distributions. Zipf’s law and
hypsometry both analyze the distribution of data by aggregation and ranking, the for-
mer for discrete data and the latter for continuous data. The objectives of this study are
(1) to adopt Zipf’s law for discrete nominal or ordinal data and apply it to continuous
interval or ratio data; (2) to propose a uniform, parametric model of the elevation dis-
tribution of inland water basins for characterizing the overall topographic landscape;
(3) to open discussion on another possible statistical method to generalize physical
phenomena for geographers and other researchers; and (4) to explore new approaches
for error propagation and validate digital elevation data from lidar and other sources.
Combining Zipf’s law and hypsometry, this article proposes a quadratic polynomial ﬁt-
ting of the log(value)–log(frequency) plot to study the elevation distribution of inland
water basins, thus providing a holistic description of the topographic landscape of
an inland water basin. Based on several experimental designs, we conclude that the
method is scale independent, and it can be applied to different hierarchical levels of
water basins. The vertical resolution of elevation is more sensitive than the horizontal
resolution. However, the method cannot be applied to arbitrary regions or basins with
outﬂow to the ocean, and a value shift is suggested for using the method in near sea level
inland basins. This method introduces additional statistical regularity based on empiri-
cal observations of elevation data of inland water basins. It extends Zipf’s law from the
nominal/ordinal scale to the interval/ratio scale and extends hypsometry from a non-
parametric histogram to a parametric quadratic polynomial. Future research that will
speciﬁcally tackle issues in applications, such as lidar data validation and archeological
site prediction models, is also discussed.

Above all, in a universe ruled by entropy, drawing inexorably toward
greater and greater disorder, how does order arise?

Introduction

1.
Owing to the rapid development and extensive use of geographic information technologies,
such as light detection and ranging (lidar), a massive amount of point cloud data has
become available. A major product derived from the data cloud is highly accurate digi-
tal elevation. The lidar data, together with existing data from other remote sensors and old
surveys, provide GIS users with multiple options for using elevation data ranging from
submeter to kilometers. However, such data are often provided ‘as is.’ There is a need for
error propagation and validation of digital elevation data, which is the motivation for this
research. We start by seeking the ‘signature’ of the elevation distribution. Two key terms in
this article, ‘hypsometry’ and ‘Zipf’s law,’ will be introduced and the linkage between them
will be discussed. Hypsometry is the measurement of elevation relative to sea level, with
the form of a basic elevation histogram to more speciﬁc analyses, including hypsometric
curves of elevation versus area, which is sometimes normalized, and the integrated area
beneath the hypsometric curve. Zipf’s law (Zipf 1949) is an empirical law originated from
linguistics, showing that the frequency of a word from a book is inversely proportional
to its rank. Zipf’s law has been applied to economic geography to study city size. Zipf’s
law and hypsometry are seemingly different, yet they both examine data distributions by
aggregation and ranking, which is an essential approach for analyzing geospatial data.

The objectives of this research are (1) to adopt Zipf’s law for discrete nominal or ordinal
data and apply it to continuous interval or ratio data; (2) to propose a uniform, paramet-
ric model of the elevation distribution of inland water basins for characterizing overall
topographic landscape; (3) to open discussion of another possible statistical method to
generalize physical phenomena for geographers and other researchers; and (4) to explore
new approaches for error propagation and validate digital elevation data from lidar and
other sources.

In the following sections, Section 2 outlines the linkage between Zipf’s law and
hypsometry, Section 3 introduces the study area and the method design, Section 4 elab-
orates on the analysis and results with case studies, Section 5 summarizes the research and
draws conclusions, and Section 6 identiﬁes the limitations and future research directions.

2. Hypsometry and Zipf’s law
In GIS analysis, there are many methods for describing the characteristics of a point on an
elevation surface, from ﬁrst-order derivatives of slope and aspect to second-order deriva-
tives of proﬁle and plan curvature. In characterizing an entire landscape, such as a water
basin, it is often qualitatively described by terms, such as hilly or ﬂat, or the point descrip-
tions are aggregated to obtain average values. If more detailed topographic information
is needed, hypsometry is frequently used. Among several forms of hypsometry, this arti-
cle uses the simplest elevation histogram form. The term ‘bin’ is prevalent in hypsometry
literature for representing a group of values. There are two constraints for hypsometric
analysis: the vertical bin and the horizontal bin. The vertical bin is the value group in a
histogram. The horizontal bin is the ground areal unit (cells or grids in digital elevation
model (DEM) format) of elevation data. We refer to the size of a bin as resolution due

to its common use in GIS literature and use vertical resolution and horizontal resolution
in the following discussion. Vertical resolution is a major concern when compiling hyp-
sometric data based on the number of classes and the distribution of values across them:
‘the chosen bin size is a compromise between not gaining enough information with too
large a bin size, and obscuring the signal with scatter in the data with too small a bin
size’ (Brocklehurst and Whipple 2004). Hypsometry has been used in geomorphologic
and hydrological research, speciﬁcally to study the morphological and statistical aspects
of topography (Algeo and Seslavinsky 1995, Tate et al. 2002, Mizuta and Masuda 2003,
Brocklehurst and Whipple 2004, Schiefer and Klinkenberg 2004) and as a reference or
metric to examine soil, water, and other environmental elements (Deschaux and Souriau
1996, Hurtrez et al. 1999, Awasthi et al. 2002, Nemecek and Kozak 2003). However, only
basic or graphical descriptions have been used in these studies, and a parametric model has
not been used.

While hypsometry is intended for elevation data, which are usually considered to be
continuous with applications mainly in the physical sciences, such as geomorphology
and hydrology, Zipf’s law deals with discrete phenomena and is often applied to social
sciences, such as geography, economics, and linguistics. Zipf’s law, together with the Zipf–
Mandelbrot law (also known as the Pareto–Zipf law) (Mandelbrot 1961) and Benford’s law
(Benford 1938), is derived from empirical studies in a variety of ﬁelds, including linguis-
tics, geography, biology, biophysics, and musicology. Zipf’s law is named after the Harvard
linguistic professor George Kingsley Zipf (1902–1950). Based on the word count in James
Joyce’s Ulysses, Zipf revealed that the frequency of the words ﬁts a power-law function of
the ranks, when the rank is determined by the frequency, and therefore such a distribution
is called rank size or harmonic distribution (Zipf 1949). Harmonic distribution is better
viewed after logarithmic transformations for both rank and frequency, and the transformed
relationship ﬁts a linear decay function: log(frequency) = c – a log(rank). Zipf’s law has
been commonly used by geographers to study city size and distribution in many places
such as the United States (Black and Henderson 2003, Ioannides and Overman 2003, Mu
and Wang 2006), South Africa (Naude and Krugell 2003), Denmark (Knudsen 2001), and
other areas (Garbaix 1999, Urzua 2000).

Zipf’s law is usually presented as a log–log scatter plot of the rank (X -axis) and fre-
quency (Y -axis) of data. Samples of words in a book or populations of US cities show a
linear relationship on the log–log scatter plot with a slope of approximately 1. The similar-
ities and differences between Zipf’s law and hypsometry inspire the research described in
this article. Could these two, like other ‘natural and social adversaries,’ be treated in terms
of ‘the same analytical vocabulary,’ so researchers can discover patterns shared in different
ﬁelds (Law 1987)?

Debating the laws of geography using Tobler’s ﬁrst law (TFL) as an example, some
believe that it is scientiﬁcally acceptable to have empirical laws or compact descriptions of
patterns and regularities (Miller 2004); others argue that statements or empirical general-
izations are unlawful because they do not satisfy the three requirements of being universal,
synthetic, and necessary (Smith 2004). Nevertheless, both sides agree that laws or reg-
ularities, such as TFL and Zipf’s law (Tobler 2004), are applicable to geography as ‘a
searchlight in geographers’ exploration’ (Sui 2004). It is beyond the scope of this article
to participate in the semantic discussion of laws. However, Zipf’s law and the contribution
of laws and regularities in geography (Tobler 2004) draw our interest. We examine the link
between Zipf’s law and hypsometry and propose a parametric approach for characterizing
topographic landscapes with a scale-independent model.

Zipf’s law and hypsometry can be viewed as two extremes of a threshold metric, from
a nominal/ordinal scale to an interval/ratio scale and from log–log graphs to histograms.
This article suggests a parametric approach to studying hypsometry by creating a log–log
graph, as in the method employed in Zipf’s law. The log–log graph is a very common trans-
formation technique to reveal relationships among data. The log–log graphs for Zipf’s law
and Pareto–Zipf’s law explore rank–frequency and frequency–count distributions. Varied
log–log graphs are also used in elevation data analysis as topographic signatures, such as
the log–log graph of area and slope for characterizing debris ﬂows in a valley (Stock and
Dietrich 2003). However, the log–log graph has not been applied to hypsometry. Zipf’s law
says that the relationship between rank and frequency should have a linear trend on the
log–log graph. We examine if this idea can be expanded to continuous elevation data.

3. Study areas and method
For DEM data in water basins, this study employs the hierarchical classiﬁcation system of
the USGS hydrologic unit code (HUC), in which HUC2 (a 2-digit code), HUC4 (a 4-digit
code), HUC6 (a 6-digit code), and HUC (or watershed, an 8-digit code) represent the water
region, subregion, accounting unit, and cataloging unit, respectively. The DEM data have
horizontal resolutions of 10, 30, 100, 500, and 1000 m. All elevation values are integers.
The testing data (Figure 1) include the following:

(cid:129) All 18 water regions (HUC2 = 1–18) in the contiguous United States.
(cid:129) Upper Mississippi Region (HUC2 = 07) and its 14 subregions (HUC4 =

0701–0714).

(cid:129) Upper

Illinois Subregion (HUC 4 = 0712) and Lower

Illinois Subregion
(HUC4 = 0713) and their cataloging units (HUC = 07120001–07120007 and
07130001–07130012).

The Upper Mississippi Region includes major parts of the states of Illinois (IL), Iowa
(IA), Minnesota (MN), Missouri (MO), and Wisconsin (WI), and small parts of Indiana
(IN), Michigan (MI), and South Dakota (SD). The area of the basin is approximately
189,000 mi2. Of the 30 million people who live within the basin, 80% live in urban areas.
Over 60% of the basin is cropland or pasture. The basin is a major agricultural base in

the United States. More than 50% of the nation’s corn and over 40% of the nation’s
soybean exports are grown in this basin (The Upper Mississippi River Basin Association
2007).

There are constraints on and critiques of Zipf’s law. Mandelbrot (1957) argued that
Zipf’s law is ‘nothing more profound than a random process for creating words and the
boundaries between words in natural languages.’ Due to its ranking approach, Zipf’s law
can only be applied to discrete data. A well-documented problem with the linear ﬁtting of
Zipf’s law is the ‘top concavity’ (Powers 1998). High-ranked data with large values often
bend away from the ﬁtted line. In searching for a ranking distribution to correct the devia-
tion, the boundary between the discrete and continuous is blurred as methods traditionally
used for continuous data are applied. After linear ﬁtting, quadratic polynomials are the next
choice for many continuous data sets. Second-order quadratic polynomials or parabolic
fractals are the most common adjustments to Zipf’s law when analyzing continuous data,
while higher order quadratic curves are not very often applied (Bi et al. 2001). One exam-
ple of the quadratic approach is the parabolic fractal distribution (Laherrère 1996), in
which log(frequency) is a quadratic polynomial of log(rank). This can overcome the simple
power-law relationship (transformed as a log–log graph) in Zipf’s law. A discrete Gaussian
exponential (DGX) distribution has also been proposed to represent a more generic dis-
tribution than that used in Zipf’s law. While other curve-ﬁtting methods are statistically
ad hoc, DGX is statistically sound with respect to the maximum likelihood estimation for
parameters (Bi et al. 2001).

By simply applying Zipf’s law to the elevation data, the plot will deviate from a straight
line because of the ‘top concavity’ problem discussed above. Furthermore, preliminary
analysis of sample data shows that the plot cannot be easily parameterized, nor does it have
a uniform linear shape as in Zipf’s law. In addition, Zipf’s law is designed for nominal
data, so a ranking of frequency is applied. However, for interval or ratio data, ranking the
continuous integer elevations masks the value information. To avoid these problems, we
use the value instead of the rank for interval and ratio data.

To preliminarily explore the data, value–frequency scatter plots were created for all
HUC levels of water basins in the study area. As an example, Figure 2a shows scatter
plots of elevation value and frequency for the Upper Mississippi Region (HUC2 = 07),
the Upper Illinois Subregion (HUC4 = 0712), and the Upper Illinois watershed1
(HUC = 07120005). Other basins in the study area show distributions similar to the three
examples, which are skewed, mostly concave, and cannot be ﬁtted with a uniform curve.
If the curve ﬁtting is forced, then various orders of polynomials will ﬁt each basin and
subregion. For such simple elevation value–frequency scatter plots, descriptive statistics
are often used in hypsometric studies to identify changing elevations due to certain physical
processes, such as glacier erosion (Brocklehurst and Whipple 2002).

The logarithmic transformation is often used as a data-condensing technique. It is
applied here (Figure 2b) to condense the scales of the data and reveal the relationship
between the two variables. As shown in Figure 2b, the relationship is convex and follows a
uniform quadratic polynomial. The generic form is y = ax2 + bx + c, with x = log(value)
and y = log(frequency), where log() is base 10. Zipf’s law has been used with both
log10 and loge. In this study, log10 is chosen to follow the convention of many Zipf’s
law studies. However, other logarithms, such as a binary logarithm (base 2) or a natural
logarithm (base e), could be similarly applied. The transformation makes it possible to
parameterize the relationship, thus shedding light on both Zipf’s law (log–log graph of
rank and frequency) and hypsometric studies (value and frequency). A detailed discussion
follows.

4. Analysis and results

To better understand the basic method of polynomial ﬁtting for log–log graphs of ele-
vation data outlined in the previous section, we explore the method in different settings
using several experimental designs. Section 4.1 uses the method to extract and under-
stand the characteristics of elevation of water basins in varied geographic locations and
scales, thus further evaluating the generality of the method. Section 4.2 focuses on the
sensitivity and effect on the method caused by both horizontal and vertical resolutions.

Section 4.3 compares the method’s utilization and appropriateness for different aggrega-
tion levels of water basins, as well as naturally delineated regions versus man-made regions.
Section 4.4 investigates whether the absolute elevation value matters in the polynomial
ﬁtting of log–log graphs.

4.1. Characteristics, generality, and scale independence

Data from the study areas (Figure 2) show that the quadratic polynomial can be a uniform
curve for the log–log graph of value and frequency for various HUC levels of inland water
basins. However, do the parameters of the curve reveal characteristics of the basin’s ele-
vation such that the curve can serve as a topographic signature of inland water basins?
The log–log transformation of the elevation value–frequency of inland water basins is
represented in the following equation and in Figure 3:

log(frequency) = a[log(value)]2 + b[log(value)] + c

(1)

Because the graph of a quadratic polynomial is a parabola, the properties of the vertex of
the parabola can be used to characterize the log–log graph of elevation data. The value
of |a| is the tightness or narrowness of the curve: a larger |a| indicates a narrower curve.
The value of –b/2a determines the horizontal location of the vertex (the most frequent
elevation) of the parabola and the value of –(b2–4ac)/4a determines the vertical location
of the vertex.

The deterministic factor, a, is observed and calculated from the curve ﬁtting of the
Upper Mississippi Region data. Both b and c are strongly correlated with a, with corre-
lation coefﬁcients close to 1. These variables can be written as proportional to a: b = ma
and c = na, where m and n are real numbers. For the Upper Mississippi Region and its
14 subregions, the correlation coefﬁcient between a and b is –0.99 and 0.98 between a
and c. Table 1 lists the values of a, b, c, m, n, and R2 (for the overall curve ﬁtting) of these
basins. The value of m ranges from –5.1 to –4.5 and has an average of –5. The value of n

Basic Pearson’s correlation statistical tests show that a is signiﬁcantly correlated with
the degree of dispersion (standard deviation) and randomness (entropy) of the inland water
basin elevation (Figure 4) at the 0.01 level. A smaller |a| (larger a, as a is negative) indicates
larger dispersion and randomness of the basin’s elevation.

Figure 5. Polynomial curve ﬁtting for the log–log graph of elevation data for water subregions
(HUC4) within all inland water regions (HUC2) in the contiguous United States.

Is the relationship between a, b, and c derived from the study area a coincidence? To test
the generality, we ﬁt the polynomial curve for all subregions (HUC4) of the inland water
regions (HUC2) in the contiguous United States. The results are presented in Figure 5.
A total of 60 water subregions are included, 28% of which have R2 larger than 0.85,
77% with R2 larger than 0.7, and 92% with R2 larger than 0.6. The correlation coefﬁ-
cient between a and b is very close to –1, and very close to 1 between a and c. Based on the
sample data, the log–log hypsometric transformation is scale independent, i.e., a quadratic
polynomial can ﬁt the log–log graph of the elevation data of inland water basins at differ-
ent geographic scales (HUC2, HUC4, and HUC) in the contiguous United States. By scale
independence, we mean the model, not the parameters of the model, is scale independent,
such that the polynomial has different values of a, b, and c for different basins.

4.2. Vertical and horizontal resolutions
Vertical and horizontal resolutions are major considerations for raster data. Different verti-
cal and horizontal resolutions of water basin DEM data result in different parameter values
for the polynomial curve. Our next step is to test the sensitivity to vertical and horizon-
tal resolutions. A watershed from the Upper Illinois River (HUC = 07120005) was used
to explore the relationships. To test whether the vertical resolution inﬂuences the polyno-
mial curve, vertical resolutions of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 were chosen to generate log–log
graphs. Each graph was then ﬁtted with a quadratic polynomial curve (Figure 6, left). The
dashed arrow indicates a decrease in the vertical resolution. In this test, the horizontal res-
olution was ﬁxed at 1 km. On a simple value–frequency scatter plot, changes in vertical
resolution dramatically change the shape of the plot. However, after the log–log transfor-
mation, the uniform quadratic polynomial curve still holds for different vertical resolutions.
The coarser the vertical resolution, the higher the overall position of the quadratic curve,

which is due to the frequency increase with aggregation level. In addition to the higher
vertex location of the curve, the result tends toward a narrower openness (larger |a|) of the
polynomial curve with a decrease in vertical resolution. Because the vertex location is a
function of a, b, and c, and can be interpreted using a, we use a to evaluate the sensitivity.
In the sample data, the vertical resolution decreases from 1 to 10 m, and the value of a
changes from –109 to –163. On average, the polynomial curve narrows by 5% for each
unit decrease in the vertical resolution.

Similarly, horizontal resolutions of 10, 30, 100, 500, and 1000 m were studied for
the same river basin (Figure 6, middle). The vertical resolution was ﬁxed at 1 m in this
horizontal resolution threshold. The result tends toward a wider openness (smaller |a|)
and lower vertex location of the polynomial curve with decreasing horizontal resolution
(direction indicated by the dashed arrow). In the sample data, the horizontal resolution
decreases from 10 to 1000 m and the value of a changes from –169 to –109. On average,
the polynomial curve widens by 0.04% for each unit decrease in the horizontal resolution.
Previous analysis of small drainage basins in Central Nepal shows that hypsometry (simple
histogram, scatter plot) is robust against horizontal resolutions of DEM (Hurtrez et al.
1999). Our results from the Upper Illinois River watershed reveal that the log–log graph of
value–frequency is robust against the vertical and horizontal resolutions of DEM, and the
vertical resolution is more sensitive than the horizontal resolution when characterizing the
overall elevation landscape of an inland water basin.

The R2 values of the polynomial curve ﬁt to different vertical and horizontal resolutions
are fairly high and stable, as shown on the right of Figure 6. On that graph, the left Y -axis
shows the vertical resolution, the right Y -axis shows the horizontal resolution, the X -axis
shows the R2 value, and the dashed arrow indicates the decrease in horizontal and vertical
resolutions. As the resolution decreases, the R2 value slightly increases for vertical changes
and slightly decreases for horizontal changes. However, the values are highly clustered
around 0.7.

4.3. Water basin aggregation levels and arbitrary regions
The vertical and horizontal resolutions shift the log–log graph, but the shape remains
almost identical. How do water basin aggregation levels affect the relationships? Given

the procedure for generating the log–log value–frequency plot, the graphs for smaller
hierarchical basins should always nest within their upper-level graph. Following the HUC
classiﬁcation system, inland water basins at different levels are retrieved and the log–log
graphs are plotted and ﬁtted. Figure 7 demonstrates the hierarchical relationships using
examples from the Upper Mississippi Region (HUC2 = 07), the Illinois River Subregion
(HUC4 = 0712), and the Upper Illinois Watershed (HUC = 07120005). Similar to the
changes in resolution, the water basin aggregation level shifts the log–log graph, but the
polynomial model remains the same. The aggregation test conﬁrms the scale independence
of the method as discussed in Section 4.1.

We want to ﬁnd if the quadratic polynomial curve is applicable only to inland water
basins, or if it can be applied to any continuous surface. To address this, the log(value)–
log(frequency) analysis is performed on ﬁve randomly selected counties in the Upper
Mississippi Region: Webster, IA; Kane, IL; Morrison, MN; Lincoln, MO; and Grant,
WI. Figure 8 shows an example from Grant County. For the quadratic polynomial ﬁt to
log(value)–log(frequency) plots, the average R2 is 0.77 for all subregions in the Upper
Mississippi Region and 0.50 for all the sampled arbitrary regions. Graphs from the arbi-
trary regions are generally not as symmetric, well ﬁtting, or unimodal as those for the
inland water basins.

4.4. The inﬂuence of elevation
Does the absolute elevation matter in the polynomial ﬁtting of log–log graphs? In other
words, does the same method apply to both near sea level basins and high-altitude basins?
We consider the Upper Mississippi Region as an example. Let min be the minimum ele-
vation value in the basin (min = 91 m in the sample data). We shift all elevation values
by –(min – 1), –(min – 1)/2, 0, (min – 1)/2, and (min – 1) and then ﬁt curves to them.
The results are presented in Figure 9. The scenario of –(min – 1) arbitrarily shifts the basin
elevation to near sea level, and the other scenarios are designed to compare the elevation
change within a range. The original values are very well ﬁt by the polynomial curve and
almost 90% (R2 = 0.89) of the variation in the log–log graph can be explained by the curve.
The near sea level log–log graph has a very poor ﬁt and less than 50% of the variation can
be explained. The higher the overall elevation, the better the ﬁt. In the ﬁve tested scenarios
with overall elevation ordered from low to high, the R2 values are 0.49, 0.84, 0.89, 0.91,
and 0.92.

Figure 9. Curve ﬁttings for shifted values.

The gray insert in Figure 9 helps explain the effect of the elevation value. The log(value)
changes rapidly when the value is below 100 and more smoothly for higher values. As a
consequence, the curve ﬁt to the log–log graph is more stable when the overall elevation
value is above 100 map units. In the test data, min = 91 m (very close to 100); therefore,
the data can be ﬁt using the original log–log graph. Based on this observation and testing,
we suggest adding one condition to using the method: if the minimum elevation value of
the inland water basin is much lower than 100, all values should be shifted to above 100.
If a comparison between basins is to be conducted, the global value shifting of all basins
should be performed cautiously, if necessary, and the scales and resolutions should be
ﬁxed.

5. Summary and conclusions

To explore the relationship between value and frequency of elevation data for inland water
basins, we ﬁnd that the shape of the original scatter plot varies from basin to basin, but the
log–log transformation can be ﬁtted with a quadratic polynomial curve (y = ax2 + bx + c,
where x = log(value) and y = log(frequency)). Based on the study areas in the Upper
Mississippi Region, the key parameter is a, with b and c both highly correlated to a. Based
on several experimental designs, the method is scale independent and it can be applied to
different hierarchical levels of water basins. The vertical resolution of elevation is more
sensitive than horizontal resolution; however, the method cannot be applied to arbitrary
regions or basins with outﬂow to the ocean, and value shifting is suggested for using the
method for inland basins that are near sea level.

‘Chaos was the creation of information’ (Gleick 1987). In this article, we present an
example of searching for order in the elevation data for inland water basins. Although the
physiographic reasons for the correlations between a, b, and c remain to be answered, the
utility of this method lies in the statistical regularity of empirical data, similar to Zipf’s
law. As presented in Table 2, this method can be understood as a variation of Zipf’s law.
Zipf’s law is considered by some to be the fundamental quantitative law of human activity
(Tarapanoff et al. 2001), and it is an empirical law generalized from the observation of the
frequency and rank of discrete, social events. We look for similarities that can be applied

to continuous, physical phenomena. Zipf’s law interprets the rank–size distribution as the
interaction of two competing forces: uniﬁcation and diversiﬁcation. Uniﬁcation ﬂattens
the slope of the ﬁtting line and diversiﬁcation steepens it. The competing forces can be
depicted as a ‘vector model.’ In our study, we can use the same competing forces to explain
the shape of the quadratic polynomial curve: uniﬁcation narrows the polynomial curve, and
diversiﬁcation widens it. The competing forces can be depicted as a ‘spring model.’ The
meanings of the parameters are summarized in Table 2.

Because of its uniform shape and the parametric representation, this approach extends
the application of Zipf’s law from a nominal/ordinal scale to an interval/ratio scale and
extends hypsometry from nonparametric histogram to parametric quadratic polynomial.
In the discussion of laws and regularities of geography, we introduce a statistical regularity
based on empirical observations of elevation data for inland water basins, and welcome fur-
ther discussions and testing. Obtaining hypsometric data and ﬁtting a curve to them are now
less challenging, and the process can be automated using remote sensing and GIS tools.
Understanding the relationships between the topographic signature and the transformed
hypsometry empowers us to better understand the landscape process.

6. Discussion, limitations, and future research

To let the proposed measurements be more than a simple description, we identify future
research topics and applications. Although the focus of this article is the topographic sig-
nature of elevation distributions using inland river basins as examples, it is important to
discuss the associated feature, such as the overall topography and magnitude of a basin
(e.g., size and mean slope) and river characteristics (e.g., discharge). In other words, what
controls the distribution of elevation in basins? Using the above analysis and the resulting
log–log graph, we ﬁnd that there is no signiﬁcant correlation between the overall topogra-
phy of an inland river basin and its size or the mean slope of the basin. Of the 1107 sites in
the Upper Mississippi Region collected from USGS National Water Information System
(WaterData), 978 sites have complete annual statistics. The annual stream discharge data
are extremely skewed (skewness = 8.2) and peaked (kurtosis = 68.2). At the subregion
level, the maximum discharge and the variation in discharge are signiﬁcantly (at a 0.1 level)
related to the uniﬁcation/diversiﬁcation factor. The larger the uniﬁcation (the |a| value,
Table 2) is, the smaller the amount and variation of the discharge are. However, such a
relationship cannot be derived at the watershed level.

Additionally, we identify three future research topics and applications:

(1) The morphology of a drainage basin is complicated and related to many factors,
such as soil properties and climate, and the topography is shaped by long pro-
cesses of erosion, deposition, sediment transport, etc. (Roth and La Barbara 1997,
Berger and Entekhabi 2001, Tucker et al. 2001). To understand the ‘signature’ of
a water basin’s elevation distribution, these processes need to be reﬂected in the
method.

(2) Many archeological site prediction models use elevation, but not elevation distri-
bution, as an input variable. There is potential for integrating the ‘signature’ of
a study area’s elevation distribution into a prediction model. Figure 10 shows a
preliminary result of our exploration. Due to the limitations and sensitivity of the
data, county-scale archeological sites are used for the entire Upper Mississippi
Region. There is a very rough trend between archeological site density and the

parabola area of the hypsometric ﬁtted line for each subregion, and the relation-
ships for better data sets and additional methods could be investigated in the
future.

(3) Numerous algorithms have been proposed and adopted to extract bare Earth eleva-
tion from lidar point cloud data. The ‘signature’ of elevation distribution has shed
some light on error propagation and data validation for the elevation derived from
lidar point cloud data. To utilize this idea, future research will test large quantities
of lidar data and use the method described here to compare and evaluate different
bare-earth retrieving algorithms.

1.

In this example, the selected watershed or cataloging unit (HUC = 07120005) happens to have
the same name, ‘Upper Illinois,’ as the subregion (HUC4 = 0712) it belongs to. This is not
common in HUC names.

Abstract

Bike‐sharing systems have been widely used in major cities 

across the world. As bike borrowing and return at different 

stations in different periods are not balanced, the bikes in 

a  bike‐sharing  system  need  to  be  redistributed  frequently 

to rebalance the system. Therefore, traffic flow forecasting 

of  the  bike‐sharing  system  is  an  important  issue,  as  this  is 

conducive  to  achieving  rebalancing  of  the  bike  system.  In 

this  article,  we  present  a  new  traffic  flow  prediction  ap‐

proach based on the temporal links in dynamic traffic flow 

networks. A station clustering algorithm is first introduced 

to  cluster  stations  into  groups.  A  temporal  link  prediction 

method based on the dynamic traffic flow network method 

(STW+M)  is  then  proposed  to  predict  the  traffic  flow  be‐

tween stations. In our method, the non‐negative tensor de‐

composition and time‐series analysis model capture the rich 

information  (temporal  variabilities,  spatial  characteristics, 

and  weather  information)  of  the  across‐clusters  transition. 

Then, a temporal link prediction strategy is used to forecast 

potential  links  and  weights  in  the  traffic  flow  network  by 

investigating both the network structure and the results of 

tensor  computations.  In  order  to  assess  the  methods  pro‐

posed in this article, we have used the data of bike‐sharing 

systems in New York and Washington, DC to conduct bike

traffic prediction and the experimental results have shown 

that  our  method  produces  the  lowest  root  mean  square 

error  (RMSE)  and  mean  square  error  (MSE).  Compared  to 

four prediction methods from the literature, our RMSE and 

MSE of the two datasets have been lowered by an average 

of  2.55  (Washington,  DC)  and  2.41  (New  York)  and  3.35 

(Washington,  DC)  and  2.96  (New  York),  respectively.  The 

results show that the proposed approach improves predic‐

tions of traffic flow.

In recent years, bike‐sharing systems have been widely used in major cities across the world, such as Paris, New 

York, Beijing, and so on. Sharing bikes provides a convenient means of transportation for urban short‐distance 

commuting and connecting to urban public transport stations (such as subway stations and bus stops) (Midgley, 

2009). People usually borrow (i.e., check out) bikes at a station near the departure station and return (i.e., check 

in) bikes at a station near the destination station. This type of one‐way use and short rental time may lead to a 

skewed distribution of bike utility with the usage time and location, thereby resulting in uneven distribution of 

bikes between stations in bike‐sharing systems. It may be so crowded in some stations that not enough returning 

space can be provided, while there may be a lack of available bikes at other stations. Therefore, the challenge for 

bike‐sharing systems is bike rebalancing between stations. Although the distribution of bikes can be obtained by 

monitoring each station in the bike‐sharing system and the number of bikes can be reallocated when the stations 

are skewed, it is obviously too late to reallocate the bikes after a skewed distribution has occurred. Bike traffic 

flow forecasting is necessary for bike‐sharing systems to achieve bike rebalancing in a timely manner. It is used to 

guide the bike‐sharing system to reallocate bikes, thereby achieving bike rebalancing and making the bike‐sharing 

system run more efficiently.

In the existing bike traffic flow forecasting methods, the bike traffic flow in a future period is generally pre‐

dicted according to the historical bike data. The impact of other factors on traffic flow is rarely taken into consid‐

eration. For example, the traffic flow at bike stations is usually affected by many factors, such as station location, 

commuting hours, weather, and so on. Although the impact of weather conditions on the traffic flow of a bike‐

sharing system was included in some studies, in bike traffic flow forecasting, an overall consideration of many 

factors in a single model, including temporal, spatial, weather, and other factors, has not been reported in the 

literature.

To make full use of traffic information and other related factors to improve short‐term traffic flow prediction, 

we propose a new traffic flow prediction approach based on the temporal links in dynamic traffic flow networks, 

which takes the temporal, spatial, and weather factors into consideration and utilizes centrality measures to rank 

the importance of a node in traffic flow networks. Our method is named STW+M. In this method, the non‐negative 

tensor decomposition and time‐series analysis model capture the rich information (temporal variabilities, spatial 

characteristics,  and  weather  information)  of  across‐clusters  transitions.  In  addition,  a  temporal  link  prediction 

strategy is used to forecast potential links and weights in the traffic flow network by investigating both the net‐

work structure and the results of tensor computations. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method was eval‐

uated using bike and weather datasets for New York City (NYC) and Washington, DC, and several state‐of‐the‐art 

methods were compared.

ZHOU et al.The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related work, Section 3 shows the 

framework of our method, and Section 4 describes our proposed temporal link prediction method. Experimental 

results are presented in Section 5. Conclusions are presented in Section 6.

Because traffic prediction is important for rebalancing bike‐sharing systems, many prediction methods for bike 

traffic flow have been proposed in recent years. Froehlich, Neumann, and Oliver (2009) predicted the number of 

bikes at each station by comparing four models: Last Value, Historic Mean, Historic Trend, and Bayesian Network. 

Other scholars proposed predicting traffic flow and the number of available bikes/docks for each station using 

a mathematical model (Darbha, Rajagopal, & Tyagi, 2008; Lin & Yang, 2011) or a statistical model (Borgnat et al., 

2010; Kaltenbrunner, Meza, Grivolla, Codina, & Banchs, 2010). Some methods, which are based on data mining 

techniques, have also been developed for this problem. Borgnat et al. (2011) combined nonstationary statistical 

modeling and data mining techniques for the prediction of hourly fluctuations in a bike‐sharing system. Vogel, 

Greiser, and Mattfeld (2011) used data mining to explore the bike activity patterns at stations, and this helps to 

reveal the distribution of bikes in a system and leads to better understanding of the bike‐sharing system structure. 

Most of these prediction methods, which were proposed for forecasting traffic flow according to the temporal 

variabilities of traffic data, are based on time‐series models such as autoregression (AR), moving average (MA), 

autoregressive  moving  average  (ARMA),  and  autoregressive  integrated  moving  average  (ARIMA)  models  (Han, 

Song, & Wang, 2004; Li, Li, & Li, 2014; Vogel & Mattfeld, 2011; Voort, Dougherty, & Watson, 1996). To capture 

the  nonlinear  variation  of  traffic  flow  in  prediction,  especially  for  the  prediction  of  multiple  locations,  support 

vector regression (Castro‐Neto, Jeong, Jeong, & Han, 2009), neural networks (Ishak, Kotha, & Alecsandru, 2003; 

Jiang & Adeli, 2005; Quek, Pasquier, & Lim, 2006; Vlahogianni, Karlaftis, & Golias, 2005), and hybrid nonlinear dy‐

namic systems (Vlahogianni, 2009) have been used to approximate the short‐term nonlinear fluctuations of traffic 

flow. Because only using temporal variation could be insufficient for an accurate forecasting in traffic flow, some 

spatiotemporal prediction approaches have been proposed, such as the multivariate time‐series method (Dunne 

& Ghosh, 2012; Min & Wynter, 2011; Stathopoulos & Karlaftis, 2003), the neural networks method with spatial 

information (Vlahogianni, Karlaftis, & Golias, 2007, 2014), and several hybrid methods (Borgnat et al., 2013; Giot & 

Cherrier, 2014; Xu, Ying, Wu, & Lin, 2013; Yang et al., 2016; Yoon, Pinelli, & Calabrese, 2012). These spatial–tem‐

poral predication methods usually construct the traffic flow in a two‐way pattern that incorporates both spatial 

characteristics and temporal variabilities. Their results demonstrated that, generally, by taking both the spatial 

and temporal modes of traffic flow into consideration, better prediction accuracy can be achieved (Borgnat et al., 

2010; Li, Li, & Li, 2013). By considering complex traffic flow patterns with a multi‐dimensional structure (e.g., time, 

space, week, day, etc.), there are some attempts that use tensor decomposition algorithms for traffic flow predic‐

tion. Dauwels, Aslam, Asif, and Zhao (2014) combined tensor decomposition and the support vector regression 

(SVR) method to solve the traffic prediction problem. Tan, Wu, Shen, Jin, and Ran (2016) proposed a novel dy‐

namic tensor completion (DTC) method by taking the multimode information of traffic data into consideration for 

short‐term traffic prediction. Most of the existing methods predict traffic flows using historical check‐out/in data 

in a bike system. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction, some methods took more factors into account in 

the prediction model. Williams and Hoel (2003) took the seasonal trend of traffic flow into account and proposed 

a seasonal ARIMA prediction method. Hong (2012) presented a seasonal SVR model for traffic flow forecasting. 

There are also a few studies that took weather factors into account in the prediction of traffic flows. For example, 

Wang, Deng, Shi, and Tan (2009) presented an SVM‐based prediction model by adopting data‐mining techniques 

to forecast traffic flow. They used the data, which have similar weather and daily patterns, to predict the traf‐

fic flow in a future day. Gebhart and Noland (2014) did some research on the impact of weather conditions on 

bike‐sharing trips in Washington, DC. Li, Zheng, Zhang, and Chen (2015) proposed a hierarchical model to predict 

ZHOU et al.1128  |    

the traffic flow of each station based on time and weather similarity. However, in these methods, weather factors 

were generally used as a constraint to decrease the number of training samples or to reduce the redundancy in 

data. As far as we know, there is no method that takes overall consideration of many factors in a single model, 

including temporal, spatial, weather factors, and so on.

Therefore,  for  the  purpose  of  improving  bike  traffic  flow  forecasting  accuracy,  the  influence  of  temporal, 

spatial, and weather factors on bike traffic flow forecasting accuracy is discussed comprehensively in this article. 

By studying the periodicity and regularity of traffic flow in bike‐sharing systems, we propose a temporal link pre‐

diction method based on the dynamic traffic flow network method (STW+M).

The framework of the bike traffic flow forecasting method proposed in this study is shown in Figure 1. The four 

main parts of the framework involved the clustering of stations, traffic prediction of clusters, link prediction of 

dynamic traffic flow network, and weight prediction of dynamic traffic flow network.

3.1 | Clustering of stations

As we all know, the more obvious the periodicity and regularity of traffic flow, the more beneficial it will be to our 

predictions. However, it seems impossible to find any periodicity and regularity in the traffic flow of an individual 

station, because users usually borrow/return bikes at a random station close to their origin/destination station. 

That is, if a station cannot provide available bikes/docks, the user would check out/in a bike at another nearby sta‐

tion. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the traffic flow of each individual station directly. Besides, if certain events 

happen, they usually influence the bike check‐out/in of an area instead of only those of an individual station. In 

order to find the periodicity and regularity of traffic flow in a bike‐sharing system, we gathered individual stations 

into clusters according to their connectivity, geographical location, and transition pattern. The clustering method 

proposed in this study includes three main processes: transfer network generation, network clustering, and transit 

clustering. For detailed steps, see Section 4.1.

3.2 | Traffic prediction of clusters

The  traffic  flow  of  clusters  has  obvious  periodicity  and  regularity  compared  with  those  of  individual  stations, 

which are time‐evolving data affected by multiple factors such as time, weather, and the correlation of stations. 

Time‐evolving data can be organized as a tensor model. The advantage of a tensor model is that we can model the 

time dimension explicitly, and then obtain data characteristics of the time dimension by tensor decomposition, 
so that the prediction can be made in the time dimension. Therefore, we constructed a four‐way tensor model Z
t 
(defined in Section 4.2) to represent the traffic flow affected by multi‐dimensional factors, in which the influence 

of temporal, spatial, and weather factors on bike traffic flow prediction was considered synthetically based on 

the results of station clustering. In order to obtain the traffic flow of clusters, the non‐negative tensor decompo‐
sition and time‐series analysis model were used to predict the traffic flow of a cluster at time T + 1, denoted by 
STW(clui)T+1 (defined in Section 4.2). The traffic flows of other clusters were obtained similarly.

3.3 | Link prediction of dynamic traffic flow network

In order to predict if there exists traffic flow between stations in the future time period, a dynamic traffic flow net‐

work was first generated based on the historical data of bike check‐out/in at stations. A dynamic traffic flow network 

is a directed weighted network, in which nodes stand for stations and the weight of the directed edges represents the 

traffic flow between stations. Based on the dynamic traffic flow network, we can extract and calculate the network 
structural features between stations, denoted by M (i,j)t (defined in Section 4.3). Then, the link prediction method 
in complex networks was used to predict the link probability of the edge connection between nodes (stations) in 
the next time period. The link probability indicates the probability of traffic flow between two stations at time T + 1,  
denoted by score(i → j)T+1 (defined in Section 4.3), which can be calculated according to the traffic flow of clusters 
obtained and M (i,j)t. If score > 0, that indicates there is a link between station i  and station  j; the value of their traffic 
flow prediction is then the weight prediction of the link. Otherwise, there is no link between stations.

3.4 | Weight prediction of dynamic traffic flow network

The traffic flow between stations changes with time. In order to predict further the traffic flow between stations, 

we  constructed  an  origin–destination–time  (ODT)  tensor  model  (defined  in  Section  4.4)  based  on  the  dynamic 

traffic flow network to represent the traffic flow between individual stations in the time dimension. Then, simi‐

larly, we used the non‐negative tensor decomposition and time‐series analysis model to predict the traffic flow 
between stations, denoted by ODT (i → j)T+1 (defined in Section 4.4). This value is the weight prediction of the link 
from station i  to station  j at time T + 1.

4.1 | The clustering of stations

Generally, it is difficult to find regularity and periodicity from an individual station's check‐outs, as can be dem‐

onstrated intuitively through the example shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a presents the result of station clustering 

for Washington, DC, where points of the same color denote stations pertaining to the same cluster. We randomly 

selected five clusters from all the clusters and three random stations from each cluster, and then compared the 

daily check‐outs from 9:00 to 10:00 a.m. at these stations and clusters for five consecutive weeks (from July 28 

to August 31). The results are shown in Figure 2b–u, in which the first three columns of subgraphs present the 
check‐outs of the stations from station S1 to station S15. It seems impossible to find any periodicity and regular‐
ity from an individual station's check‐outs. In Figure 2b–u, the fourth column subgraphs present the check‐outs

of clusters from cluster C1 to cluster C5 after station clustering. As shown in Figure 2, the check‐outs of clusters 
feature obvious periodicity and regularity compared with those of individual stations, which is conducive to bike 

traffic prediction. Therefore, to find the periodicity and regularity of bike stations' traffic, we grouped individual 

ZHOU et al.stations into clusters according to station locations in the road network and transition patterns, which denote the 

check‐out proportions across clusters. Figure 3 presents the proposed procedure for clustering stations, which 

organically combines the location and transition of a station. Triangles with the same color denote stations that 

belong to the same cluster. The proposed clustering method includes the following three main steps.

1.  Transfer  network  generation.  In  this  step,  the  roads  were  represented  in  a  transfer  network  model.  We 

first  constructed  a  road  network  model,  where  roads  are  turned  into  edges  and  intersections  into  nodes. 

Then,  we  transferred  the  road  network  model  into  a  transfer  network  by  using  the  dual‐graph  approach 

(Porta,  Crucitti,  &  Latora,  2006),  where  roads  are  nodes  and  intersections  are  edges.  The  dual  graph  is 

constructed  by  mapping  edges  with  the  same  road  ID  in  the  road  network  model  into  nodes  of  the  dual 

graph,  and  intersections  among  each  pair  of  edges  in  the  road  network  model  into  edges  connecting 

the  corresponding  nodes  of  the  dual  graph,  which  allows  us  to  acknowledge  the  continuity  of  roads 

over  a  plurality  of  edges.  In  the  generated  transfer  network,  nodes  stand  for  roads  and  there  is  a  link 

between  two  nodes  if  the  two  nodes  are  connected  by  an  intersection  on  a  road  network  model.

2.  Network clustering. According to the transfer network obtained in step 1, network clustering is first performed 

using a community detection method (Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, & Lefebvre, 2008) in a complex network. 

Community is characterized as a set of nodes that are densely connected internally and have comparatively 

sparser connections with the other nodes (Reichardt, 2009; Saha, Mandal, Tripathy, & Mukherjee, 2015). Then, 

the clustering result of the road is obtained by the community detection method. As shown on the left of Figure 

3 ②, different clustering categories are represented by roads of different colors. According to the geographi‐

cal location information of the bike stations, a station is matched with the closest road, thereby obtaining the 

clustering category of the station (shown on the right of Figure 3 ②). Network clustering considers not only the 

connectivity among stations, but also the stations' geographical locations.

3.  Transit  clustering.  Based  on  the  clusters  obtained  in  step  2,  we  generated  a  transit  matrix  for  each  cluster. 

According to people's commuting patterns, we divide the day into seven time slots as shown in Table 1 and 

generate a transit matrix which has seven rows. A transit matrix describes the stations' transition pattern in each 
l,j is the traffic flow from cluster Ci to station Sj in time slot l , where Sj does not belong 
cluster, and each entry 
n
to Ci. After obtaining a set of transit matrices for each cluster, 
i=1, we divided all of the stations in each cluster 
into L2,i clusters according to their transit matrices by a K‐means clustering algorithm, which can produce tighter

Taking  some  stations  of  the  bike‐sharing  system  in  Washington,  DC  for  example,  Figure  4  shows  intuitively 

the progression of station clustering through steps 2 and 3. Figure 4a presents the original distribution of stations; 

Figure 4b shows the result of station clustering through network clustering; Figure 4c shows the results with transit 

clustering based on Figure 4b, where points with the same color denote stations pertaining to the same cluster. As 

shown in Figure 4, the results of station clustering, after network and transit clustering, have featured spatial aggre‐

gation more consistent with connectivity of the road network and transition patterns of stations.

4.2 | Traffic prediction of clusters

After station clustering, the periodicity and regularity of the clusters' traffic flow become much more obvious, 

and thus easier to predict. The traffic flow of clusters data can be organized as a tensor model. The advantage 

of a tensor model is that we can model the time dimension explicitly. In this study, the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC 

(CP) tensor model is built, which is one of the most commonly used tensor models (Carroll & Chang, 1970; Kolda 

& Bader, 2009), and K‐component CP factorization is obtained by adopting non‐negative CP decomposition. The 

temporal profiles were computed to predict the scores in future time steps using the components extracted by 

the CP model. This is used to generate the traffic flow forecasting value of a cluster. Among them, the principle of 
non‐negative CP decomposition is reproduced as follows. Given a three‐way tensor Z of size M × N × T, where M, N, 
and T are the size of the first, second, and third way, respectively, K‐component CP factorization of Z is given by:

Here the symbol ◦ denotes the outer product,1  a, b, and c denote vectors of a three‐way tensor Z in three direc‐
k ∈ ℝT for k = 1,...,K. Each sum‐

(Chatfield & Yar, 1988), which only requires the data and the expected period (e.g., we use L = 1 for daily data) 

(Dunlavy et al., 2011). This method has been proven to be appropriate for dealing with time‐series data and is 

accurate in picking up patterns in time series. Therefore, it was used as a prediction tool in this study. If we are 
predicting L time steps in the future, we obtain a tensor of prediction scores of size M × N × L. This is computed as:

where each 𝜸k is a vector of length L that is the prediction of the next L time steps from the additive Holt–Winters

We  used  a  multi‐way  tensor  to  represent  the  spatial,  temporal,  and  weather  characteristics  of  traffic  flow. 

For the temporal characteristics, we divided the temporal characteristics into two kinds of time cycle conditions 

by day and time interval, considering the division of the time slots in Table 1. We constructed a four‐way tensor 
t ∈ ℝl×w×d×n, which incorporates spatial information, weather information, and day information from the 
model Z
same time interval in several past weeks.  l  is the number of clusters, w is the number of weather types, d is the 
number of days, and n is the number of time intervals. Figure 5 shows an example of such a tensor pattern. It 
covers the weather, day, space, and time information of the traffic flow data. For the four‐way tensor model Z
t,  
we  used  the  non‐negative  CP  tensor  decomposition  and  the  time‐series  analysis  model  introduced  above  [cf. 
Equations (2) and (3)] to predict the traffic flow of individual cluster i  at time T + 1, denoted by STW(clui)T+1, which 
can be calculated by extending Equations (2) and (3) to fourth order. The traffic flows of the other clusters were 

obtained similarly.

4.3 | Link prediction based on tensor computations and dynamic traffic flow 
network structure

The traffic flow variation process between stations can be abstracted as a temporal dynamic traffic flow network, 

which is a directed, weighted, and temporal network. We first generated the dynamic traffic flow network based 

on bike check‐out/in data of stations, in which directed edges denote the traffic flow between nodes, the direc‐

tion of edge indicates the direction of traffic flow, and the weight of edges represents the traffic flow between 

stations. And then the link prediction method in complex networks is used to obtain the link probability of the 

edge connection between nodes (stations) in the dynamic traffic flow network, that is, whether there is traffic 

flow between stations in the future time period, which is forecast based on the link probability.

Link prediction in complex networks is a popular research topic. It attempts to infer which new links are likely 

to occur soon (Liben‐Nowell & Kleinberg, 2003). There are many link prediction methods, including node‐based 

metrics,  topology‐based  metrics,  and  learning‐based  methods  (Wang,  Yu,  Huang,  &  Ma,  2016).  Among  these 

methods, the topology‐based method was chosen because of its simplicity and good performance on link predic‐

tion (Wang, Xu, Wu, & Zhou, 2015). There are four widely used topology‐based metrics. The common assumption 

of these approaches is that individuals who collaborate with more similar people are more likely to collaborate in 
the future. These methods and their weighted counterparts are given in Table 2. In all of the definitions, u, v, and 
Z denote nodes in the network, and similarities are always evaluated between two different nodes. In Table 2, 
Γ (u) denotes the nodes that are neighbors of node u in the network, Γ (v) denotes the nodes that are neighbors of 
node v in the network, and Γ (z) denotes the nodes that are neighbors of node z in the network. w (u,z) denotes the 
weight of the link between nodes u and z and likewise for w (v,z) of nodes v and z, w
of nodes u and u′, and w

 of nodes z′ and z, w

 of nodes v and v′.

Among  the  four  types  of  topology‐based  metrics,  the  CN  method  is  based  on  the  heuristic  of  “similarity.” 

According  to  the  principle  of  “popularity,”  the  betweenness  centrality  of  a  node  can  be  used  to  measure  the 

amount of control that this node exerts over the interactions between other nodes in the network (Yoon, Blumer, 

& Lee, 2006). In this article, the traffic flow network is a directed, weighted, and temporal network. In order to 

calculate the network structure features of network nodes, we first changed them into an undirected, weighted, 
and temporal network. The edge weight wt (i,j) is computed as follows:

wt (i,j) = wt (i → j) + wt (j → i)

Here, wt (i → j) is the edge weight from station  i  to station  j in the directed network, wt (j → i) is the edge weight 
from  station  j  to  station  i   in  the  directed  network.  Then,  we  use  the  weighted  CN  method  to  show  the  link's 
“similarity” between station  i  and station  j. The betweenness centrality of nodes shows the “popularity” values 

between them. It is defined as follows:

M (i,j)t = 𝛽 ⋅ wcn (i,j)t + (1 − 𝛽) ⋅

bc (i)t + bc (j)t

wcn(i,j)t =

wt (i,z) + wt (j,z)

where 𝛽 is a positive parameter in [0, 1], which is used to adjust the weight of the similarity between nodes in the 

dynamic traffic flow network and the popularity of the node (bike station) on the traffic flow forecasting models. 
wcn (i,j)t, computed in Equation (6), refers to the “similarity” value of the link between station i  and station  j at time 
t. In Equation (6), wt (i,z) and wt (j,z) can be computed by Equation (4). bc (i)t, as introduced in Yoon et al. (2006), 
refers to the shortest‐path betweenness centrality for node  i  at time t. bc (i)t is computed in Equation (7), where 
i) is the number of those paths that pass 
V is the set of nodes, 𝜎(u,v) is the number of shortest (u,v) paths, and 𝜎(u,v
through node  i  other than u and v, and likewise for bc (j)t of node  j. The value of 𝛽 has impact on the accuracy of 
link prediction. In Section 5.3.3, the optimized value of 𝛽 has been analyzed through experiment.

To  better  predict  traffic  flow,  we  present  an  efficient  approach  to  predicting  potential  links  in  a  temporal 

traffic flow network. This method, named STW+M, is based on the previous tensor computation results and the 

network structure of links' “popularity” and “similarity.” Therefore, we calculated the link probabilities of edges in 

the temporal traffic flow network graph based on the following equation:

t by non‐negative CP tensor decomposition and the time‐series analysis model, 
and likewise for STW(cluj)T+1 of node  j. 𝜃 is a positive parameter in [0, 1], which is used to measure the impact of 
historical generation on link prediction. If the result score > 0, that indicates there is a link between station  i  and 
station  j. Otherwise, there is no link between stations. The link probabilities computed by Equation (8) take into 

(

account not only bike traffic flow interactions between clusters but also network topology structures (similarity 

and popularity) of dynamic traffic flow networks.

4.4 | ODT tensor model for weight prediction of dynamic traffic flow network

In order to further predict the bike traffic flow between individual stations, we constructed an ODT tensor model 
ODT ∈ ℝs×s×t based on the dynamic traffic flow network to represent the traffic flow between individual stations 
in the time dimension. Figure 6 presents the transformation process from the dynamic traffic flow network to a 

three‐way tensor model. In Figure 6a, gray nodes represent bike stations, the directional arrows between stations 
indicate the direction of traffic flow between stations, and the weight of edges denoted by w is the traffic flow (the 

number of check‐outs/ins) between stations at a specific time. In Figure 6, the traffic flow network is a directed, 
weighted, and temporal network, and ODT is a three‐way tensor that has three modes: two station modes and 
a time mode, as shown in Figure 6b. For tensor ODT ∈ ℝs×s×t, s and t refer to the number of stations in the traffic 
flow network and the number of sampling steps in each time period, respectively. The entry ODT (i,j,k) denotes 
the total traffic flow from station  i  to station  j in time slot k. For the three‐way tensor ODT, we used the same 

tensor decomposition and time‐series analysis model as introduced in Equations (2) and (3) to predict the traffic 
flow between stations, denoted by ODT (i → j)T+1. This value was the weight prediction of the link from station i  to 
station  j at time T + 1.

datasets consist of check‐out/in data of bike and bike station data. The data format of bikes' check‐out/in data 

includes the following attributes: trip duration, start station ID and name, end station ID and name, start time, end 

time, and bike ID. For the check‐out/in data of bikes, records with a trip duration of less than 1 min were noise 

and not considered. Bike station data consists of four attributes: station ID, station name, station longitude, and 

station latitude. Weather datasets include three attributes: ID, timestamp, and weather. Here, timestamp refers to 

the time when the weather information is collected on an hourly basis, and weather refers to the type of weather, 

divided into three types: sunny, foggy, and rainy. We used the method shown in Figure 7 to divide the data into 
a training set and a test set. First, the starting ΔT moments of the snapshot in the network were used as a train‐
ing set for input to the tensor analysis. Then, the ΔT + 1 moments of the snapshot were used as a test set, which 

would be compared with the estimated results. We moved the time window one step forward and re‐executed 

the above steps.

5.2 | Evaluation metrics

To quantify the accuracy of the proposed prediction method, we used different evaluation metrics including mean 

average error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 

and area under precision‐recall curve (AUPR). MAE is the average absolute difference between the real values 

and the predicted values (Jalili, Orouskhani, Asgari, Alipourfard, & Perc, 2017). RMSE is the standard deviation of 

the differences between the actual values and the predicted ones (Jalili et al., 2017). AUC can be interpreted as 

the probability that a random missing link has a higher score than a random non‐existent link (Sett, Basu, Nandi, & 

Singh, 2018). AUPR is considered as a relevant measure for imbalanced classification problems (Sett et al., 2018).

5.3 | Discussion of results

5.3.1 | Evaluation of station clustering

We applied the proposed method to the traffic flow network to predict traffic flow. First, we need to cluster all 

the stations in NYC and Washington, DC. To demonstrate the advantages of the clustering method proposed in 

this study and illustrate the effect of station clustering on traffic flow forecasting results, the bike‐sharing con‐

dition  is taken  as an example in Washington, DC, and the density‐based spatial clustering of  applications with 

noise (DBSCAN) clustering method (Ester, Kriegel, & Xu, 1996), K‐means clustering method (Kanungo et al., 2002), 

and proposed station clustering method are used to cluster bikes in Washington, DC. In order to better conduct 

comparative experiments, the clustering result is approximately the same as the number of clusters at the clus‐

tering method mentioned in this study by adjusting the parameter values in DBSCAN and K‐means. As shown in 
Figure 8a, the parameter settings are as follows: Eps = 1000 m, MinPts = 1 in DBSCAN and K = 25 in the K‐means 
method. Here, Eps denotes the radius of the neighborhood around a point. If Eps is too small, sparser clusters will 
be defined as noise; if Eps is too large, denser clusters could be merged together. MinPts is the minimum number of 
points required to form a dense region in the DBSCAN method, and K defines the number of clusters in K‐means. 

Compared with the DBSCAN and K‐means clustering algorithms, there is no need to manually set the clustering 

parameters in the proposed clustering method.

The location information of the bike station is just thought of in the DBSCAN and K‐means clustering meth‐

ods  without  the  flow  variation  between  stations  or  the  connectivity  of  the  road  network.  As  shown  in  Tables 

4‒6, compared with K‐means and the clustering method proposed in this study, the results of station clustering 

obtained by the DBSCAN method show that the number of intra‐cluster stations distributed among the clusters 

is extremely uneven, that is, a few clusters contain most stations, and most clusters only contain a small number 

of stations. As shown in Tables 5 and 6, the results of station clustering from the K‐means clustering method and 

our proposed clustering method show that the number of stations in each cluster is relatively even among the 

clusters. For further comparison among the three clustering methods, the bike check‐out within the same time 

period  for  five  consecutive  weeks  was  used  for  traffic  flow  analysis  of  various  clusters  obtained  by  different 

clustering methods; then, the results were presented through a weekly pattern, so as to easily ascertain the peri‐

odicity and regularity of traffic flow in various clusters. To showcase intuitively the traffic flow of various clusters 

from different clustering methods, we randomly selected the check‐outs of five clusters from the three clustering 

methods, respectively. The check‐outs of these clusters, during the period from 9:00 to 10:00 a.m. for five con‐

secutive weeks (starting from July 28 through August 31), are shown in Figure 8b–p. The first line, Figure 8b–f, 
shows the check‐outs of five clusters (from cluster C1 to cluster C5) obtained by the DBSCAN method; the second 
line, Figure 8g–k, shows the check‐outs of five clusters (from cluster C6 to cluster C10) obtained by the K‐means 
clustering method; and the third line, Figure 8l–p, shows the check‐outs of five clusters (from cluster C11 to cluster 
C15) obtained from our proposed clustering method. As shown in Figure 8, the check‐outs of clusters from our 
proposed clustering method feature much more obvious periodicity and regularity than with the DBSCAN and 

K‐means  clustering  methods.  Even  if  the  number  of  stations  is  relatively  even  as  shown  in  Tables  5  and  6,  the 

check‐outs of clusters from our proposed clustering method still show better periodicity and regularity compared 

with K‐means clustering methods. In contrast, the geographical location of the station, the traffic flow changes 

between the stations, and the connectivity of the road network in the process of station clustering are considered 

in the clustering method proposed in this study. Therefore, there is noticeable periodicity in the obtained traffic 

variation of clusters. At the same time, as shown in Figure 9, when the traffic flow forecasting is performed based 

on  different  clustering  results,  the  lowest  RMSE  and  MAE  values  of  the  two  datasets  (NYC  and  Washington, 

DC) are obtained using the clustering method proposed in this study, which means that our proposed clustering 

method has a better traffic flow forecasting result.

t(D.C.). According to our four‐way tensor model defined 
t ∈ ℝl×w×d×n, where l  is the number of clusters, w is the number of weather types, d is the number 
in Section 4.2, Z
of days, and n is the number of time intervals. For the two datasets of NYC and Washington, DC,  l  is 29 and 25, 
respectively, and weather includes three types: sunny, foggy, and rainy (i.e., w = 3). We set days as the weekly pat‐

t(NYC) and Z

tern, and 1 h as the time interval; then the number of days in one week is 7 and the number of time intervals in 
one day is 24 (i.e., d = 7 and n = 24). Therefore, the sizes of the two tensors Z
t(D.C.) are 29 × 3 × 7 × 24 and 
25 × 3 × 7 × 24, respectively. The length of a time slot can be adjusted according to the applications. To evaluate

Tables 7 and 8 summarize the average prediction accuracy of different link prediction methods on the datasets 
of NYC and Washington, DC, respectively. We set 1 h as the time interval and set the first ΔT = 5 moments of the 
snapshot in the networks as a training set. Therefore, the number of intervals in a day is n = 5. We used the CP 
model with K = 10 components (Dunlavy et al., 2011), using the forecasting scoring model described in Section 

4.2. The model parameters for level, trend, and seasonality were set to 0.2 in the Holt–Winters method (Dunlavy 
et al., 2011). To give wcn (i,j)t and bc (i)t the same weight, we set parameter values for all of the datasets as 𝛽 = 0.5. 
We set parameter 𝜃 = 0.5 as introduced in Spiegel, Clausen, Albayrak, and Kunegis (2011).

TA B L E   8  Link prediction accuracy comparison of different methods on the Washington DC datasets

As  shown  in  Tables  7  and  8,  the  proposed  STW+M  method  improved  the  results  of  link  prediction  (about 

14% increased AUC, 14% increased AUPR, 16% decreased RMSE, and 13% decreased MAE in NYC; about 24% 

increased AUC, 2% increased AUPR, 33% decreased RMSE, and 19% decreased MAE in Washington, DC) when 

compared with the poorest link prediction accuracy obtained by the baseline method WPA. Using the weather 
factor in tensor Z
t, STW+M significantly improved the link prediction accuracy (with about 2% and 5% higher AUC 
for the two datasets of NYC and Washington, DC, respectively) compared with the ST+M method. This indicates 

that to predict the links in a dynamic traffic flow network, taking the weather factor into consideration can im‐

prove the link prediction accuracy. One can also see that the ST+M and STW+M methods, which both merge the 

traffic flow in each cluster, can always achieve higher link prediction accuracy than the M method, which only uses 

the network structure of the links' “popularity” and “similarity.” Generally, our STW+M method, which integrates 

spatial, temporal, and weather factors of traffic flow and topological structures of traffic flow network, has the 

best link prediction accuracy in comparison with the other methods.

Figures 11 and 12 present parts of the traffic flow prediction results and prediction errors of STW+M on week‐

days and weekends for the datasets of NYC and Washington, DC, respectively. As can be seen in Figures 11 and 

12, STW+M exhibits reliable prediction results on both weekdays and weekends. The overall accuracy of traffic 

flow predictions during off‐peak hours is higher than that during peak hours. In addition, the prediction accuracy 

of traffic flow on weekends is higher than that on weekdays.

To test the validity and feasibility of our method, back propagation neural network (BPNN) (Chen, Zeng, & 

Gang, 2008), individual support vector machine (SVM) (Wang et al., 2009), ARIMA (Williams & Hoel, 2003), DTC 

(Tan et al., 2016), and ST+M (prediction without weather factor) methods were applied to forecast traffic flow in 

the same datasets. The forecasting results obtained by different methods are shown in Figure 13. In the experi‐
ment, the BPNN structure is 5–7–1, the system error is 10−3, and the maximal interactive time is 1,000. In SVM,

Washington, DC datasets

the radial basis function was chosen as the kernel function and the parameters were C = 10, 𝜀 = 0.1, e = 0.001, and 
r = 0.5 (Wang et al., 2009). For ARIMA, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to measure goodness‐of‐fit 
models and the parameters were p = 2, d = 1, and q = 4. As shown in Figure 13, our method produced the lowest 

RMSE and MAE values. Compared with other methods—such as BPNN, SVM, ARIMA, DTC, and ST+M—our RMSE 

and MAE values of the two datasets have been lowered by an average of 2.55 (Washington, DC) and 2.41 (NYC) 

and 3.35 (Washington, DC) and 2.96 (NYC), respectively. The results show that our method has higher prediction 

accuracy than the other prediction models.

5.3.3 | Sensitivity analysis

In  our  experiments,  we  also  varied  the  value  of 𝛽  in  the  range  [0,  1]  to  examine  the  impact  of  the  “similarity” 

and “popularity” value on the link prediction in our STW+M method. The results of link prediction are shown in 
Figure  14. With 𝛽 = 0,  the  link  prediction  method  has  the  poorest  accuracy  based  on  the  average  AUC,  AUPR, 

RMSE, and MAE values of the two datasets. It can be seen that the “similarity” value of the links is indeed an 

important factor, because the prediction accuracy improves sharply when this information is incorporated. After 
the prediction accuracy reaches a maximum, it decreases slightly when 𝛽 is increased. When 𝛽 = 1, the links predic‐

tion method has the poorest accuracy based on the average AUC, AUPR, RMSE, and MAE values. It can also be 

seen that the “popularity” value of the links (the shortest‐path betweenness centrality for nodes on the links) is 

ZHOU et al.1148  |    

F I G U R E   1 6  The prediction results of the three‐way ODT tensor model

also an important factor. This can be explained by the need for a tradeoff among “similarity” and “popularity” and 
other integrated information in our STW+M method. The value of 𝛽 has an impact on the accuracy of link predic‐
tion. In order to get the optimized value of 𝛽, we have tuned it from 0 to 1 and used the link prediction method 

proposed in this article to predict bike traffic flow, and then compared the results with the historical data, using 

AUC, AUPR, RMSE, and MAE metrics to measure accuracy. From the experimental results in Figure 14, as regards 
the two datasets of NYC and Washington, DC, when the value of 𝛽 is 0.5 and 0.6, respectively, the corresponding 

AUC and AUPR values are the highest and RMSE and MAE values are the lowest, indicating the best accuracy of 
link prediction and the optimized value of 𝛽. Therefore, the optimal values of 𝛽 for the two datasets of NYC and 

Washington, DC are 0.5 and 0.6, respectively.

Figure 15 shows part of the traffic prediction results of STW+M when 𝛽 = 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 on workdays and week‐
ends. As in Figure 14, the value of 𝛽 has a strong influence on link prediction accuracy. The traffic prediction accu‐
racy of the STW+M method improves as the value of 𝛽 increases. After the link prediction accuracy has reached a 
maximum, it decreases slightly when the value of 𝛽 increases.

After obtaining the results of the link prediction in a dynamic traffic flow network, we used the ODT tensor 
model ODT ∈ ℝs×s×t to predict the traffic flow between the stations and the results of tensor computations as the 
weight prediction of the links. Figure 16 illustrates the average RMSE and MAE values for the weight prediction 

of the links in the traffic flow network. It can be seen from this figure that the ODT tensor model and the tensor 

computations exhibit reliable prediction results on the two datasets when predicting the traffic flow based on the 

results of the link prediction. It can also be seen that the time slots of 8:00 to 9:00 a.m., 2:00 to 3:00 p.m., and 7:00 

to 8:00 p.m. have the best prediction accuracy of all the time slots.

The challenge for bike‐sharing systems is how to accurately predict station‐to‐station traffic flows to realize bike 

rebalancing between stations. We first present a station clustering method, which has not only taken into consid‐

eration the location of stations but also their connectivity and transition patterns. As shown in the experiment, 

the  clustering  method  proposed  in  this  article  produced  better  prediction  results  than  DBSCAN  and  K‐means 

methods.  Then,  based  on  the  results  of  station  clustering,  a  temporal  link  prediction  method,  namely  STW+M, 

was proposed based on a dynamic traffic flow network. In the proposed method, both the traffic flow network 

ZHOU et al.    |  1149

structure and the more related information of traffic data are integrated in the prediction model. We use non‐

negative tensor factorization and a time‐series analysis model, which can make full use of the temporal, spatial, 

and weather mode information of traffic flow.

The STW+M method considers not only temporal and spatial factors but also weather factors while predicting 

bike  traffic  flows;  this  method  helps  to  improve  the  accuracy  of  bike  traffic  prediction  between  stations.  The 

data from two bike‐sharing systems in NYC and Washington, DC was employed for experiments. Compared with 

other forecasting methods—such as BPNN, SVM, ARIMA, DTC, and ST+M—the RMSE and MAE values are the 

smallest using our method. In addition, the values of RMSE are reduced by an average of 2.55 (Washington, DC) 

and 2.41 (NYC), respectively; for MAE values, they are reduced by an average of 3.35 (Washington, DC) and 2.96 

(NYC), respectively. The results show that the proposed approach improves predictions of traffic flow. The bike 

traffic predictions will contribute to guide bike rebalancing in bike‐sharing systems and help them operate more 

efficiently. Moreover, it could also support the activities of decision‐makers, public/private institutions, and city 

managers in urban mobility strategies in a more effective manner. Because generally the aim of some bike‐sharing 

trips is to solve the problem of the first‐ or last‐mile trips to public transport stations, it is believed that taking 

other factors, such as closeness to public transport stations, into account could improve the proposed method.

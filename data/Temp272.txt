Li and Zhang (2012b, Comments on ‘Combining spatial transition probabilities for
stochastic simulation of categorical ﬁelds’ with communications on some issues related
to Markov chain geostatics) raised a series of comments on our recent paper (Cao, G.,
Kyriakidis, P.C., and Goodchild, M.F., 2011. Combining spatial transition probabilities
for stochastic simulation of categorical ﬁelds. International Journal of Geographical
Information Science, 25 (11), 1773–1791), which include a notation error in the model
equation provided for the Markov chain random ﬁeld (MCRF) or spatial Markov chain
model (SMC), originally proposed by Li (2007b, Markov chain random ﬁelds for
estimation of categorical variables. Mathematical Geology, 39 (3), 321–335), and fol-
lowed by Allard et al. (2011, An efﬁcient maximum entropy approach for categorical
variable prediction. European Journal of Soil Science, 62, 381–393) about the mis-
interpretation of MCRF (or SMC) as a simpliﬁed form of the Bayesian maximum

of ratios and conditional independence, connections between MCRF and Bayesian net-
works and transiograms as spatial continuity measures. In this response, all of the
comments and concerns will be addressed, while also communicating with Li and other

G. Cao et al.

We shall ﬁrst acknowledge that, as Li and Zhang (2012b) rightly point out, Equation (7)
in our paper (Cao et al. 2011) has a notation error. There was no intention, as Li and
Zhang (2012b) guessed, to cite incorrectly their earlier work on extended coupled Markov
chain (Li and Zhang 2006). Our intention was to rewrite Equation (19) in Li (2007b) to
review the concepts of MCRFs in the context of the particular discussion (on a rectangular
lattice system under conditional independence, as illustrated by Figure 2 of Li (2007b)), but
mistakenly swapped the position of subscripts k and kR. Equation (7) in Cao et al. (2011)
should be corrected as

P {C(x0) = k|c(x1), . . . , c(xN )}
= P{Ik(x0) = 1|IkL(xL
1)πkU |k(hx

or in a more consistent notation with the rest of Cao et al. (2011) as

P {C(x0) = k|c(x1), . . . , c(xN )}

P {C(x0) = k|c(x1)} (cid:3)4

n=2P {c(xn)|C(x0) = k}

n=2P {c(xn)|C(x0) = k}

where x1, x2, x3, and x4 represent the four nearest neighbors of x0 along cardinal directions.
We apologize for such a careless error in notation, as well as the confusion it might
have caused. It should be stressed, however, that this notational error does not affect the
soundness of the proposed method, the results of the case studies, and the validity of the
conclusions in Cao et al. (2011).

1. Markov chain random ﬁeld and Markovian-type categorical prediction

A single-chain-based Markov chain random ﬁeld was proposed in Li (2007b) for esti-
mation and stochastic simulation of categorical spatial variables. As in Markov random
ﬁelds (MRFs), a random variable in MCRFs at location u0 is speciﬁed by a multi-point
conditional probability distribution p[i0(u0)|i1(u1), . . . , im(um)] that is entirely spec-
iﬁed by its nearest neighbors u1, . . . , um in different directions. Based on Bayes’s
factorization (Equation (2) in Li and Zhang (2012b)) and the conditional independence
assumption, Li and Zhang (2012b) further decomposed the multi-point posterior prob-
ability in Equation (6) of Li and Zhang (2012b) into a multiplicative combination of
(two-point) spatial transition probabilities, which is copied below as in Equation (3). Please
note that, from now on, we will follow the notation of Li and Zhang (2012b) to facilitate
the communication:

p [i0(u0)|i1(u1), . . . , im(um)] =

(cid:2)

pi1i0 (h10)(cid:3)m
n
f0=1 pi1f0 (h10)(cid:3)m

g=2 pi0ig (h0g)

g=2 pf0ig (h0g)

(3)

where pi0ig (h0g) represents a spatial transition probability from class i0 to class ig over a
vector h0g and n is the number of class labels.

Please recall that a random ﬁeld or more generally a spatial process indexed by
sites u1, . . . , um is completely characterized by a joint probability density function
p [u1, . . . , um]; Gaussian random ﬁelds (GRFs), for example, are fully speciﬁed by

multivariate Gaussian distribution. The conditional probability approach of random ﬁeld
model formulation has been well studied and eventually led to the celebrated Markov
random ﬁeld theory (Besag 1974). For a regular lattice system, this simpliﬁed condi-
tional probability distribution (Equation (3)) is equivalent to a Pickard random ﬁeld (PRF)
(Pickard 1977, 1980, Haslett 1985) according to the theorem of Hammersley and Clifford
(1971). For general irregular sparse cases, however, p [i0(u0)|i1(u1), . . . , im(um)] does not
usually warrant a ‘theoretically sound Markov chain model’, or necessarily lead to a legit-
imate random ﬁeld model. By assuming a rectangular lattice and limiting the nearest
neighbors to cardinal directions, which essentially simpliﬁes Equation (3) to Equation (2),
Li (2007b) applied the concepts of PRF (Haslett 1985) to general sparse cases and claimed
a ‘theoretically sound Markov chain model’ (Li 2007b, p. 328).

the general Bayes’

According to Li and Zhang (2012b),

factorization of
p [i0(u0)|i1(u1), . . . , im(um)] is the explicit full general solution of MCRF with the con-
ditional independence-based result (Equation (3)) as a simpliﬁed general solution, and the
neighborhood could also be extended beyond the cardinal settings for this simpliﬁed case.
This extension, however, as stated in Li and Zhang (2012a), requires different lattice struc-
tures or spatial sampling units, ‘three for a triangular lattice, four for a rectangle lattice
or six for a hexagonal lattice’ (Li and Zhang 2012a, p. 123), to ensure the ‘directional
interactions’ and existence of Markov ﬁelds. For general irregular sparse cases, practi-
cally a ‘suitable tolerance angle for cardinal directions should be feasible for dealing with
irregular point samples with a random path, and in a non-lattice space it may be feasible
to consider more than four cardinal directions’ (Li 2007b, p. 332). This statement, how-
ever, does not necessarily extend the concept of MCRF to account for a general setting
of neighbors.

Within the paradigm of Bayesian maximum entropy (Christakos 1990, Bogaert 2002),
MCP was proposed in Allard et al. (2009, 2011) for categorical spatial data modeling.
By only accounting for main effects and ﬁrst-order interaction effects, which essentially
corresponds to the assumption of conditional independence, a multi-point conditional
probability is decomposed into a multiplicative combination of elementary two-point inter-
actions quantiﬁed by bivariate joint probabilities or equivalently transition probabilities
(Equation (4)):

p[i0(u0) |i1(u1), . . . , im(um)] =

m
g=1 pi0ig (h0g)
(cid:3)

m
g=1 pf0ig (h0g)

=
where pi0 is the class proportion of i0 at target location u0. By applying pi0i1 (h01)pi0
pi1i0 (h10)pi1 , as stated in Allard et al. (2012), the MCP (Equation (4)) and MCRF
(Equation (3)) are theoretically equivalent to each other as long as the univariate and
bivariate marginal probabilities exist, which is obviously the case in the context of this
discussion. Through the term pi0 , which need not be stationary, spatial models for class
proportions, such as the Dirichlet process (Neal 2000), could be naturally incorporated
into Equation (4) in Bayesian inference.

Despite the background differences between MCRF and MCP, both Equations (3) and
(4) aim at decomposing the difﬁcult-to-get multi-point conditional probability into a com-
bination of two-point probabilities, based on the assumption of conditional independence.
Our statement (Cao et al. 2011) that Equation (2) could be extended into Equation (4)
is only based on the fact that, on rectangular lattice systems under the conditional inde-
pendence assumption, as is the case considered in Cao et al. (2011), MCP (Equation (4))

accounts for a general neighboring settings while MCRFs require directional interactions
between target locations and neighbors.

A Bayesian network (BN), together with its undirected counterpart MRF, represents
two branches of probabilistic graphical models. These models encode complex systems,
e.g., spatially dependent categorical data in this discussion, as an intuitive graph-based rep-
resentation and learn the probabilistic connections among components or variables through
statistical and probabilistic techniques. Many of classical multivariate probabilistic models,
such as Markov models (e.g., MRFs, Markov networks, Markov chains), hidden Markov
models, conditional random ﬁelds, and Kalman ﬁlters, can be regarded as special cases
of this general graph model representation. In fact, given a single chain, a MCRF could
also be represented naturally in such a graph theoretical framework. Despite its root in arti-
ﬁcial intelligence and machine learning, BNs are playing an increasingly important role
in the design and analysis of general statistical and learning algorithms. By capitalizing
on the concepts and results of graph theory and probability theory, unique methods and
applications (e.g., Yedidia et al. 2003, Bishop 2006) have been developed for inference,
learning, and sampling of the complexly dependent graph representation. As in statisti-
cal modeling of categorical spatial data, conditional independence is often assumed in the
learning of probabilistic graphical models, and signiﬁcant efforts and progress have been
made to relax such an assumption. By stating that a MCRF is tantamount to Naive Bayes
(NB), we did not intend to identify the idea of MCRF with NB, which is obviously not the
case, guess the inspirations and motivations of MCRFs, and downplay or deny Li’s contri-
bution, but to illustrate the fact that both NB and MCRF can be formulated based on the
conditional independence assumption and the idea and sequence-dependent property of the
Tau model that we proposed. By connecting our discussion in Cao et al. (2011) with BN,
we hoped to inspire new ideas for categorical spatial data modeling by taking advantage of
the concepts and progress in the ﬁeld of BN and probabilistic graphical models in general,
and of course vice versa.

While we do appreciate the idea of a single-chain random ﬁeld and the relevant progress
that has been made in the past few years, we often ﬁnd several concepts in MCRF confus-
ing. Li and Zhang (2012b) updated the deﬁnition of MCRF as ‘a single spatial Markov
chain moves or jumps in a space and decides its state at any uninformed location by inter-
actions with its nearest neighbors in different directions and its last stay location.’ As an
extension of causal Markov random ﬁelds, which are usually deﬁned in lattice systems, to a
general sparse context, a MCRF is also described by conditional probabilities speciﬁed by
nearest neighbors and the last stay location in a single chain. Beyond the brief discussion
(Li 2007b) on rectangular lattice systems under the conditional independence assumption
between pair-wise interactions, little attention has been given to date to the properties of
such a system, e.g., whether this causal deﬁnition leads to a stationary distribution in a
spatial context, or in other words, whether this deﬁnition ensures a legitimate random ﬁeld
for general sparse cases, as a causal MRF (e.g., PRF) for lattice systems. Similar prob-
lems have been addressed before the formulation of MRF (Besag 1974) and PRF (Pickard
1977, 1980), but the single-chain element of MCRF seems to increase the complexity of
answers. Given a collection of spatially indexed variables, for example, on a lattice system,
different chains could be deﬁned, and they may lead to different random ﬁelds depending
on their deﬁnition. Considering directional effects (e.g., anisotropic transiograms for pair-
wise interactions), will each of these chains ensure a stationary distribution as discussed
earlier and, if they do, are the corresponding stationary distributions consistent with each
other? This possible inconsistency immediately leads to another related problem in spa-
tial prediction and conditional simulation scenarios: which of these chains would yield

1745

optimal results? Without such questions being formally addressed, there is room for doubt
regarding the theoretical soundness of MCRF theory.

Based on concepts of the general Tau model, Cao et al. (2011) proposed an approx-
imation of multi-point conditional probabilities in categorical ﬁelds by a combination of
two-point spatial transition probabilities while accounting for dependencies in a spatial
context. Different from the MCRF model, the proposed approximation is independent of
the random ﬁeld assumptions, as long as there is a stationary distribution in the categorical
ﬁelds. Sequential indicator simulations were conducted particularly in truncated Gaussian-
based categorical ﬁelds to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approximation
in reproducing transition probabilities, because in such ﬁelds, the multipoint conditional
probabilities and spatial transition probabilities can be numerically computed.

2. Transiograms as spatial continuity measures
Under the assumption of second-order or intrinsic stationarity (Chilès and Delﬁner 1999),
a transiogram is simply deﬁned as a one-dimensional transition probability function of lag
vector h in a d-dimensional space (d ≥ 1) (Carle and Fogg 1996, Li 2006, 2007a):

pkk(cid:3) (h) = P

(cid:4)
Z (u + h) = k(cid:3)|Z (u) = k

(cid:5)

(5)

where pkk(cid:3) (h) is the transition probability of the realization of the categorical random
variable Z from class k to class k(cid:3). Note that since d ≥ 1, there are theoretically inﬁnite
paths to reach a destination location u + h from a source location u. To eliminate possible
ambiguity and confusion, this deﬁnition should be emphasized to be restricted to the path
deﬁned by the vector h.

As an intuitive alternative to indicator covariograms and variograms, transiograms
could be employed as spatial continuity measures not only in MCRFs, but rather in gen-
eral transiogram-based geostatistics and categorical ﬁelds, such as MRFs, truncated GRFs,
and indicator random ﬁelds (IRFs). The deﬁnition of a transiogram itself may be general
and simple, but applying such a spatial continuity measure to speciﬁc types of random
ﬁelds could yield variable results. Actually, statements regarding transiograms, such as
which functions of distance (linear, exponential, and Gaussian) can serve as valid basic
mathematical models (Li 2006, 2007a), might not hold for a speciﬁc random ﬁeld. In an
excursion set of stationary GRFs, for example, transiogram values can be computed numer-
ically based on threshold values for class labels, and these computed transiogram values
are not necessarily consistent with any of the existing basic transiogram models. One might
reach incorrect conclusions by simply using existing mathematical models without further
investigating the properties of the speciﬁc random ﬁeld.

In a random set,
(cid:6)
−|h|2

it has been known that a Gaussian variogram γkk (h) = 1 −
cannot be a valid variogram for class k (Chiles and Delﬁner 1999). Auto-
exp
transiograms pkk (h) and indicator variograms γkk (h) for class k are functionally linked as
(Carle and Fogg 1996):

(cid:7)

pkk (h) = 1 −

γkk(h)
pk

(6)

where pk represents the proportion of class with label k, which is assumed to be stationary.
According to this analytical connection, one can immediately conclude that, contrary to
what Li (2007a) proposed, a Gaussian function cannot be a valid transiogram model for a
random set.

G. Cao et al.

Similarly, in stationary IRFs, according to the necessary condition Matheron (1993)
provided for eligible indicator variograms and the analytical link between pkk (h) and
γkk (h) (Equation (6)), we can have a necessary condition for eligible transiogram models
in stationary IRFs: for any set of m (m ≥ 2) points u1, . . . , um with category k, and val-

(7)

It is still an open question whether the necessary condition Matheron (1993) provided
is sufﬁcient for eligible indicator variograms. Emery (2010) recently suggested that the
properties of triangular, circular, and spherical variograms are rather restrictive in two-
or three-dimensional stationary IRFs and proved that these three variograms are not valid
indicator variograms for excursion sets of stationary GRFs. Following the same fashion as
in previous discussions, we can conclude that the Gaussian, triangular, spherical, and cir-
cular basic transiogram models that are originally proposed for MCRFs (Li 2007a) are not
eligible transiograms for indicators of excursion sets of stationary GRFs. The exponential
form, however, stays eligible, since the corresponding indicator variograms are valid indi-
cator variograms in any space where the Euclidean distance metric can be deﬁned (Emery
2010).

Transiograms provide an intuitive and promising spatial continuity measure in cate-
gorical ﬁelds. In MCRF, transiogram models must only meet basic probability constraints,
and practically one ‘may use any suitable mathematical model to represent an experimental
transiogram’ (Li 2007a, p. 886). In general transiogram-based geostatistics and categorical
ﬁelds, however, a careful investigation of the properties of the particular random ﬁeld is
recommended for a better understanding of transiogram model behavior (as demonstrated
in the earlier discussion), to avoid potential misuse and misinterpretation of this spatial
continuity measure in practice. In this context, we stated that the basic transiogram models
proposed in Li (2006, 2007a) for MCRFs are rather arbitrary and lack ‘a clear underlying
theory’ (Cao et al. 2011).

3. Conditional independence
Connections between the conditional independence assumption and permanence of ratios
are further investigated in this section to address Li and Zhang’s concern about our state-
ment ‘the permanence of ratios is a general form of conditional independence’ (Cao et al.
2011, p. 1787).

To simplify the discussion and without loss of generality, suppose there is an unknown
event A informed by two data events D1 and D2, which have been evaluated for their indi-
vidual information content with regard to the unknown event A through the elementary
probabilities P(D1|A) and P(D1|A). The challenge is how to combine P(D1|A) and P(D2|A)
to represent the posterior probability P(A|D1, D2) while accounting for interdependence
information among A, D1, and D2. Under the conditional independence assumption, i.e.,
P(D1, D2|A) = P(D1|A)P(D2|A) or denoted as D1 ⊥ D2|A, the posterior probability P(A|D1,
D2) can be written as

P(A|D1, D2)CI = P(A)

P(D1|A)P(D2|A)

P(D1, D2)

The assumption of conditional independence has been widely used in the ﬁeld of
Bayesian statistics, and despite its simplicity, practice has shown that it performs quite
well. In the presence of actual data dependence where such independence assumption is
difﬁcult to corroborate, however, Journel (2002) has shown that Equation (8) tends to be
non-robust and leads to various inconsistencies. A robust alternative was proposed based
on an assumption of permanence of ratios and the engineering paradigm that ratios are
typically most stable than their components (Journel 2002). Let ˜A indicate the complimen-
tary event of A, and considering the logistic-type probability ratios, r0 = P( ˜A)
P(A) , r1 = P( ˜A|D1)
P(A|D1) ,
r2 = P( ˜A|D2)
P(A|D1,D2) , the permanence of ratios amounts to assuming

P(A|D2) , and r = P( ˜A|D1,D2)

Journel (2002) interpreted this assumption as the incremental contribution of data event
D2 to knowledge of A is the same after or before knowing D1. Put differently, this actually
makes a non-interaction assumption between D1 and D2, which is different from either full
or conditional independence. To relax this assumption further, the Tau model was even-
tually developed to exactly represent the desirable posterior probability by introducing an
exponent factor τ (D1, D2) to account for similarity information (clustering or redundancy)
between D1 and D2:

r
r1

≈ r2
r0

(cid:9)

(cid:10)τ (D1,D2)

=

r
r1

r2
r0

It has been shown that conditional independence of D1 and D2 given A and ˜A leads to
unit τ (D1, D2), i.e., permanence of ratios, and the reverse is not actually true (Krishnan
2008, Journel 2002). To further address the concern of Li and Zhang (2012b), ana-
lytical connections between permanence of ratios and conditional independence to get
P(A|D1, D2) are given in this section. According to the assumption of permanence of ratios
(Equation (9)), P(A|D1, D2) can be given as

P(A|D1, D2)PR =

1 + P(A)P( ˜A|D1)P( ˜A|D2)
P( ˜A)P(A|D1)P(A|D2)

By applying Bayes’s theorem and reorganizing the terms, we can further represent P(A|D1,
D2)PR as a function of P(A|D1, D2)CI:

1

P(A|D1, D2)PR =

Compared to P(A |D1, D2 )CI

the expression of P(A |D1, D2 )PR
(Equation (8)),
(Equation (11)) avoids the difﬁcult-to-get marginal probability P(D1, D2) and only calls
for the prior probability P(A) and two pre-posterior probabilities P(A|D1) and P(A|D2).
It is easy to check that P(A |D1, D2 )PR equals P(A |D1 , D2)CI, if the following condition
holds:

P(D1, D2) = P(A)P(D1|A)P(D2|A) + P( ˜A)P(D1| ˜A)P(D2| ˜A)

A sufﬁcient (but not necessary) condition to satisfy Equation (14) is D1 ⊥ D2|A
and D1 ⊥ D2| ˜A, which is commonly made in practice (e.g., Equation (3) in MCRFs).
Please note that traditional conditional independence of D1 and D2 given only A does
not necessarily lead to D1 ⊥ D2| ˜A, and does not ensure the condition in Equation (14).
In the presence of data dependence, however, the marginal probability P(D1, D2) equals
P(A)P(D1, D2|A) + P( ˜A)P(D1, D2| ˜A) according to the law of total probability, but it does
not necessarily lead to the summation on the right side of Equation (14). In such a context,
we stated that ‘the permanence of ratios is a general form of the conditional independence
assumption’ (Cao et al. 2011 p. 1787).

Due to the overwhelming dependencies in a spatial context, the conditional indepen-
dence assumption is often found to be inadequate and should be made with particular
caution (Journel 2002). Consequences of ignoring spatial dependencies by incorrectly
assuming conditional independence were illustrated in Krishnan (2008). The main focus
of our study (Cao et al. 2011) was to relax the assumption of conditional independence
in the prediction and simulation of categorical spatial data by application of the Tau
model, a general paradigm for combining diverse sources of information while accounting
for data redundancy. A Kriging-based algorithm was proposed for obtaining the unintu-
itive weights τ (D1, D2) of the Tau model, which actually carry the clustering information
between neighbors. The proposed method was compared to conditional independence-
based Equation (4) (essentially equivalent to Equation (3)) in stochastic simulation of
truncated Gaussian-based categorical ﬁelds.

4. Conclusion
In this response to Li and Zhang (2012b), we addressed all the comments and concerns
raised regarding our article published in International Journal of Geographical Information
Science (Cao et al. 2011). We apologize again for the notational error regarding the MCRF
equation (a particular case on rectangular systems with conditional independence) in Cao
et al. (2011). A corrected equation has been provided. This notation error, however, does
not affect the models, case studies, and conclusions in Cao et al. (2011). Clariﬁcation of
our statements (Cao et al. 2011) on connections between MCRF and MCP, connections
between MCRF and Bayesian networks, connections between conditional independence
and permanence of ratios, and transiogram models as spatial continuity measures were
particularly given in detail.

From a historical, conceptual, and practical perspective, Li and Zhang (2012b) pro-
vided a long detailed explanation of the motivation and background that led to the MCRF
framework. We commend Li and Zhang on their progress on MCRF in the recent years,
especially on the increasing number of applications in various ﬁelds. As an attempt to
extend causal MRFs to general sparse cases, the single-chain idea is unique, but the
construction of the corresponding MCRFs remains descriptive instead of analytical. A for-
mal treatment that could explicitly synthesize the key elements of MCRFs (single chain,
transition probabilities, and directional interactions) is still missing.

As in other conditional probability approaches for categorical spatial data modeling,
a key element of MCRFs is to model the posterior probability of class occurrence at a
target location conditioned jointly to its directional nearest neighbors. To feasibly obtain
this difﬁcult-to-get term, one often needs to decompose the multi-point conditional prob-
ability into a multiplicative combination of elementary (oftentimes two-point) transition
probabilities based on the assumption of conditional independence as in Li (2007b). This
strict assumption, however, is often found to be inadequate in a spatial context where spa-
tial dependencies are common and complex, and thus the need for alternative methods that
could fully account for such dependencies. By adopting the general Tau model in a spa-
tial context, Cao et al. (2011) proposed a method to relax the assumption of conditional
independence in the spatial prediction and simulation of categorical ﬁelds. From this point
of view, Cao et al. (2011) actually contributed to the continuing advancement of MCRFs
framework and Markov chain geostatistics, and certainly not the otherwise as it appears to
be claimed by Li and Zhang (2012b).

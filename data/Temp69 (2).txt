Abstract
Adverse weather conditions have a significant impact on the safety, mobility, and efficiency
of highway networks. Weather contributed to 23 percent of all non-reoccurring delay and
approximately 544 million vehicle hours of delay each year (2014). Nearly 2.3 billion dol-
lars each year are spent by transportation agencies for winter maintenance that contribute to
close to 20 percent of most DOT’s yearly budgets (2014). These safety and mobility factors
make it important to develop new and more effective methods to address road conditions
during adverse weather conditions. Given weather and traffic sensors installed along side of
the highway networks, how can we automatically detect weather and traffic change events
and prevent from the traffic delay or harsh weather accidents? To this end, we propose a
novel framework to address this problem. This paper develops techniques for efficiently
detecting rapid weather change events and analyzing their impacts on the traffic flow char-
acteristics of a highway network. It is composed of three components, including 1) detection
of rapid weather change events in a highway network using the streaming weather informa-
tion from a sensor network of weather stations; 2) detection of rapid traffic change events
on the traffic flow characteristics (e.g., travel time) of the highway network; and 3) anal-
ysis of correlations between the detected weather and traffic change events in space and
time. The proposed approach was applied to a weather dataset provided by New York State
Mesonet and a traffic flow dataset the National Performance Management Research Data
Set (NPMRDS) provided by NYSDOT. The empirical results provide potential evidence
about the significant impacts of rapid weather change events on traffic flow characteristics
of the Interstate 90 (I-90) Highway in the state of New York. We show the quantitative per-
formance evaluation of our change event detection algorithm and three baseline methods
on manually labeled the weather dataset and our method outperforms baselines in terms of
precision, recall and F-score. We present the analysis of Top K detected change events as
case studies and also provide the spatio-temporal correlation statistics of top k weather and
traffic change events. The limitations of the proposed approach and the empirical study are
also discussed.

1 Introduction

Analysis of the rapid (or sudden) weather changes has real-world implications in the trans-
portation field such as improvement of transportation safety, mobility, and efficiency in
response to rapid weather changes. Weather acts through visibility impairments, precipita-
tion, high winds, and temperature extremes to affect driver capabilities, vehicle performance
(i.e., traction, stability, and maneuverability), pavement friction, roadway infrastructure,
crash risk, traffic flow, and agency productivity. On average, there are over 5,748,000
vehicle crashes each year. Approximately 22% of these crashes (nearly 1,259,000) are
weather-related. Weather-related crashes are defined as those crashes that occur during
adverse weather conditions (i.e., rain, sleet, snow, fog, severe crosswinds, or blowing
snow/sand/debris) or on slick pavement (i.e., wet pavement, snowy/slushy pavement, or icy
pavement). On average, nearly 6,000 people are killed and over 445,000 people are injured
in weather-related crashes each year [3]. These safety and mobility factors make it impor-
tant to develop new and more effective methods to address road conditions during adverse
weather conditions.

Existing techniques to detect a change point in weather conditions [12, 15, 17] either
do not work with sensor networks or explore only regular-shaped subsets. The impact of
weather conditions on traffic conditions has been studied in [7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 21, 22, 24],
however, the impact of rapid weather changes on traffic conditions is not well-explored.
The techniques developed in [18, 19, 23] study the single point traffic flow forecasting,
however, there is no multi-point traffic flow forecasting model that can deal with distribution
changes. This paper aims to address three main research questions:

– How can rapid weather changes in a highway network be detected in real time using
the streaming multivariate weather information collected from weather stations near the
network?

– How can rapid traffic flow changes in the highway network be detected in real time
using the streaming traffic flow information collected from the highway network
sensors?

– How can the significance of correlations between rapid weather changes and traffic

flow changes in space and time be well assessed?

The detection and statistical analysis of rapid weather change events has two main chal-
lenges as follows: 1. Detection of multivariate change points in a time-evolving weather
station network (WSN) with time-lagging effects. A weather change event in a WSN
is often indicated by change points of multivariate weather variables (e.g., temperature,
average wind speed, and solar radiation) in a subset of weather stations in the WSN that
are connected and irregular-shaped. The change points have time-lagging effects, which
means some of the change points occurred latter than the other change points. The detection
of such multivariate change points is challenging and has not been well addressed in the
current literature. 2. Statistical analysis of colocation patterns between different types
of spatio-temporal events. Are weather change events statistically colocated with other
spatio-temporal events, i.e., traffic change events? It is challenging to design a statistical
approach to study spatio-temporal colocation patterns between these two types of events.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel multivariate network-based change point
detection approach to detect weather change events and develop a novel spatio-temporal

Geoinformatica

hypothesis testing approach to study statistical collocation patterns between weather change
events and traffic change events.

Figure 1 shows that our algorithms correctly detect the rapid weather and traffic change
events in a given time window (red) in specific weather stations or road sections: 3 time-
series on the top right show the traffic speed on 3 TMCs (ID: 27 29) is dropped dramatically
around 17:30 17:40 pm; and 3 time-series on the bottom left show the weather variables on
WATE rapidly change at the same time period. Our algorithms output the detected weather
and traffic change events and the correlation significance value of two types of events within
a specific time period. Our change event detection techniques rely on the structural rela-
tionship of the network graph. We further study the spatio-temporal correlation statistics
between the two types of events (weather events and traffic events). The remainder of this
paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews existing literature on rapid weather change
detection. Section 3 proposes the modeling of real WSN and Traffic Message Channel
(TMC) network into graphs and provides details about data processing. Section 4 intro-
duces our research methodology. Section 5 presents the experiment and numerical results
followed by the concluding remarks and future research directions in Section 6.

2 Literature review

The literature review is organized based on the three research questions as discussed in the
previous section.

1) Detection of rapid weather changes. This is also called a change point (event) detec-
tion problem, and refers to the identification of abrupt variation of weather variables
(e.g., temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, and solar radiation) in a certain geographic
region and a time point due to distributional or structural changes. A number of algo-
rithms are available for change point detection, including detection of a change point
in a univariate or multivariate time series collected from a single sensor node (weather
station) [15], and detection of a change point in a collection of multivariate time series
from multiple sensor nodes in a sensor network, where an unknown subset of sensor

Fig. 1 Our algorithms correctly detect the rapid weather and traffic change events

Geoinformatica

nodes are affected by the change point [12, 17]. As there are a large (exponential) num-
ber of possible subsets, much of this literature only explores regular-shaped subsets,
such as circles and rectangles, in order to restrict the search space. To our knowledge,
only a few references have addressed techniques for detecting a change point in a sen-
sor network, where both the subset of sensor nodes and the subset of weather variables
that are impacted by the change point are unknown [12, 17]. In particular, Neil explores
space-time scan statistics to identify the best combination of subsets of sensor nodes
and weather variables as the indicator of a change point [17]. Jiang et al. explore joint
sparse principle component analysis (PCA) algorithms to identify the indicating subsets
of sensor nodes and variables for detecting a change point [12].

2) Statistical impact analysis. The impact of weather conditions (variables) on traffic
conditions (e.g., speed, volume, travel time) was largely studied using statistical anal-
ysis techniques based on linear or logistic regressions [22], such as the impact of rainy
weather on the speed variance of rural highways [14], the impact of cold and snow on
traffic volumes [7], the impact of snow on travel time [24], and several others [13, 21].
Only a few references have studied the impact of weather conditions using nonlinear
techniques [8, 16]. In particular, Mohammed et al. explore a mixture of linear regres-
sion models to study the impact of weather events (e.g., rain, fog, haze) on congestion
identification [8]. Martchouk and Mannering apply a first-order autoregressive model
to study the impact of weather events on travel time [16]. To our knowledge, there is
limited work that has studied the impact of rapid weather changes on traffic conditions.
3) Short-term traffic flow forecasting. A number of algorithms are available for traffic
flow forecasting [23]. Most of the algorithms have focused on “one point” (or a single
road link) short-term traffic prediction that considered only the temporal domain and
did not take into account the dependencies between road links (spatial domain) [23].
These so-called “univariate” methods are generally based on the use of time-series-
based methods, such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) [18],
back-propagation neural networks, nonparametric regressions, and several others [19].
Despite these successes in single-point prediction, recent advances demonstrate that
the multi-point forecasting models that take into consideration “geographic advantage”
of urban network provide better prediction results, such as the spatio-temporal (ST)
ARIMA [20] and spatio-temporal random effects (STRE) model [23]. All the preceding
forecasting models assume that the distribution of traffic conditions does not change
over time. However, rapid weather changes will lead to the change of distribution of
traffic flow.

To our knowledge, there is no multi-point traffic flow forecasting model that can deal
with distribution changes. In the machine learning field, switching state-space models are
designed to model change of distributions [9],

but the integration of switching state-space models into existing traffic flow forecasting

models is nontrivial.

3 Modeling of weather station and TMC real networks

In this section, we discuss the weather and traffic flow datasets which were employed for
our evaluation. In addition to that, we also discuss the modeling of the WSN graph and the
TMC network graph from the respective real network data. The weather dataset was origi-
nally provided by New York State Mesonet [2]. The traffic flow dataset, the NPMRDS, was

provided by New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Based on the geo-
graphical locations and the distances between the Weather stations or TMCs, we generated
the Mesonet WSN and TMC Network, respectively (Table 1).

3.1 Mesonet WSN

The New York State Mesonet consists of 125 stations across the state of New York. Each sta-
tion houses a suite of automated sensors, which sample the sensors data and package them into 5-
minute averages. We selected 10 weather stations along the I-90 route, Batavia, South Bristol,
Waterloo, Jordon, Westmoreland, Central Square, Cold Brook, Sprakers, Cobleskill and
Stephentown. Figure 2 shows locations of weather stations (represented by red stars) on the map.
Based on the spatial neighborhood relationships of the selected weather stations, we
modeled a graph viz. weather station graph, and denoted the weather stations as the nodes,
and the spatial neighborhood relationships between the nodes as the edges in the graph.

3.2 TMC network

The NPMRDS has vehicle probe-based travel time data for passenger autos and trucks. The
real-time probe data were collected from a variety of sources including mobile devices,

Fig. 2 WSN modeling

Geoinformatica

connected autos, portable navigation devices, commercial fleet, and sensors. The NPMRDS
includes historical average travel times in 5-minute increments on daily basis covering the
National Highway System (NHS). We used NPMRDS data which includes the traveling
time of I-90 West (consists of 52 TMCs) and I-90 East (consists of 54 TMCs) routes. Each
TMC has a length of the channel and geographic information of the channel where the
geographic location coordinate is a polygon. We calculated the TMC’s centroid geographic
coordinates (i.e. latitude and longitude) and plotted them on the map. Figure 3 is the map
plot of I-90 West and I-90 East TMC centroid locations. We modeled the TMC networks
for I-90 West and I-90 East routes into two TMC network graphs separately.

In each of the TMC network graphs the nodes represent TMCs and the edges represent

the neighborhood relationships between the TMCs, and as a result

we get two path graphs. Figure 3 shows the constructed graph of I-90 West (indexed the
TMC with new ID 0 to 51) and I-90 East (indexed the TMC with new ID 0 to 53) TMC
network.

3.3 Data description

We have access to the weather and traffic data from Mar. 1, 2016 to Dec. 31, 2016 (a total
of 306 days), provided by Mesonet and NYSDOT. As discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2,
we modeled both WSN and I-90 TMC networks as sensor graphs. The weather stations and
TMCs both have records in 5-minute increments. We denote 5-minute interval time as a
time slot (or an epoch), in total we have 288 time slots for each day. A Mesonet weather
station records each weather variable every 5 minutes and obtains total 288 records per day.
Similarly, each TMC has 288 traveling time records per day.

3.3.1 Weather data

For 10 selected stations, the complete data of the following 8 weather variables are avail-
able: Temperature 2m(T2M) [degF], Temperature 9m(T9M) [degF], Relative Humidity [%],
Average Wind Speed [mph], Max Wind Speed [mph], Wind Direction [degree], Solar Radi-
ation [W/m2] and Station Pressure [mbar]. We pre-processed the raw data and for each
individual weather variable, we extracted the daily data for 10 selected weather stations.

3.3.2 Traﬃc data

For both, I-90 West and I-90 East route, we have the traffic Average Traveling Time [Sec.]
data. We pre-processed the raw traffic data in a way similar to the raw weather data as
explained earlier. For all TMCs in I-90 West route, we extracted the average traveling time
data, and generated I-90 West route TMC daily data. For all TMCs in I-90 East route, we
followed the same process.

4 Methodology and proposed approach

In this section, we will explain our proposed approach which consists of three main components:

1. Weather change event detection. Detection of change events from multiple weather

variables data.

2. Traffic change event detection. Detection of change events from single traffic variable data.
3. Correlation study between rapid weather and traffic change events. Study of the
spatio-temporal correlation between detected weather change events and traffic change
events that are the result of our weather and traffic change event detection.

The main goal of our proposed work is to develop efficient techniques to detect rapid
weather changes in a highway road network using the streaming weather information from a
sensor network of weather stations. We also developed similar techniques to detect (predict)
traffic changes in TMC network. Further, we studied the correlation between the weather
and traffic change events (Fig. 4).

4.1 Problem deﬁnition

Both WSN and TMC network are time evolving dynamic networks. Our main problem is
to detect weather and traffic change events. A change event is represented by a tuple of 1) a

Geoinformatica

subset of nodes (weather stations or TMCs); 2) a subset of variables and 3) a time window
(a continuous sequence of time slots). In this section, we will discuss the formulation of
weather change event detection problem, which is analogous to the traffic change event
detection problem. Due to the similarity of the problems and networks, the traffic change
event detection problem is analogous to the weather change event detection problem.

The sensor network is defined as G = (V, E, x) where V = {1, 2, ..., n} refers to the
set of sensor nodes (weather stations), E ⊆ V × V refers to the set of edges, and x(v)
is a mapping function: V → Rd×T that returns a matrix storing the measurements of d
weather variables at node v for the time interval T (continuous time slots). The objective
is to identify a change event characterized as a tuple (ω, S, R) where ω is a time window
(ω = [ωstart , ωend ], ωstart and ωend is the starting and ending time slots of time window
ω), S ⊆ V is a subset of stations and R ⊆ {1, ...d} is a subset of variables. The detection
problem can be modeled using a hypothesis testing framework:
– Null hypothesis H0 (there is no change event): {x(i) | i ∈ V} ∼ D0(θ0), where D0 refers
to the distribution under the null hypothesis, and θ0 is the parameter of this distribution.
i (v) | v ∈ S, t ≥
ωstart and t (cid:2) ωend , i ∈ R} ∼ D1(θ1), where D1 refers to a new (or changed) distribu-
i (v) | v /∈ S or t <
tion corresponding to the change event within a given time window; {xt
ωstart or i /∈ R} ∼ D0(θ0). It means that the values in the time window follow D1(θ1)
distribution and the historical values before this time window ω follow D0(θ0) distribution.

– Alternative hypothesis H1(ω, S, R) (there is a change event): {xt

The change event detection problem can then be implemented in three following steps:
Step 1: Application of Gaussian distribution to define D0 and D1 for the hypothesis
testing framework.
Step 2: Identification of the best possible change event ( ˆω, ˆS, ˆR) by solving the
optimization problem:

( ˆω, ˆS, ˆR) = arg max
ω,S,R

F (ω, S, R) = Prob(data | H1(ω, S, R))

,

Prob(data | H0)

(1)

where data = {x(i) | i ∈ V}. The numerator in Eq. 1, refers to likelihood of data
under alternative hypothesis whereas, the denominator refers to likelihood of data under null
hypothesis. The ratio F (ω, S, R) is called generalized likelihood ratio test statistic (GLRT).
Step 3: Estimation of the empirical p-value of estimated GLRT score: F ( ˆω, ˆS, ˆR)
using bootstrap methods. If the empirical p-value is below a predefined significance
level (e.g., α = 0.05) then ( ˆω, ˆS, ˆR) is returned as a significant change event;
otherwise, no change event is returned.

Previous work in [6, 25] developed efficient algorithms for optimizing a general GLRT
function in nearly-linear time in a univariate sensor network (d = 1). We extend this work
and design efficient algorithms to optimize Problem (1) with d > 1.

4.2 Weather change event detection

A weather change event is a tuple of a connected subset of weather station nodes, a subset
of rapid change related weather variables and a time window in which the rapid change
has occurred. We designed an invariant of Graph-MP method [6] to address this problem
in order to achieve a nearly-linear time complexity and high accuracy. In Fig. 5, the top
sub-figure shows a time evolving attributed graph for Mar. 17, 2016, in which each node
is associated with multiple attributes. The bottom sub-figure of Fig. 5 shows a detected

Geoinformatica

weather change event, which indicates that the time interval 16:55 to 18:20 on Mar. 17, 2016
at weather stations COLD, SPRA and STEP rapid change occurred and involved variables
such as Solar Radiation, Relative Humidity, T2M, T9M, Average Wind Speed, Max. Wind
Speed. The following are several key notations used throughout the paper:

– Time Window is a time interval that consists of continuous time slots and has minimum
and maximum length. ω = [ωstart , ωend ], ωstart and ωend is the starting and ending
time slots of time window ω.

– Rapid weather change is indicated that the weather variables of weather station(s) are

rapidly decreasing or increasing in a given time window ω.

It is the difference between the historical base value and the time window value, and
indicates the changing level of the values in the time window, ∇μchange = |μω −μbase|.
Algorithm 1 is our proposed single variable change event detection algorithm and includes three
main steps: 1) normalization of a given time window; 2) detection of the most anomalous subset
of station(s) in a given time window and 3) ranking and filtering of the change event results.

In Algorithm 1, the input data D = {D1, · · · , DNum days} includes daily data of a single
weather variable for whole WSN. A is the adjacency matrix of the network graph, s is
the upper bound of the maximum subset of nodes (our algorithm will return at most 4*s
nodes), min window and max window are minimum and maximum time window size
respectively, hist base length is the size of the historical base time window.

4.2.1 Aggregation strategy of time window values

In Algorithm 1, at Line 5, all possible time windows are generated. Inner loop at Line 7
iterates over all possible time windows to test whether there exists a change event in any of
these time windows. At Line 8, the historical base of the current time window is calculated,
which is the mean value of previous hist base length time slots. At Line 9∼10, calculates
the changing value for a given time window. This is a feature aggregation process, and it
converts feature values in a given time window into a single changing value for each weather
station node based on the definitions of Time Window Value, Historical Base Value and
Changing Value in Section 4.2.

If there is a lag effect in the time window, the mean value of the time window cannot
represent the true changing level. To eliminate the lag effect within the time window, we
considered two cases when we calculated the changing value:

– Case 1: Without a lag effect in the time window. The changing value of the given

time window ω is equal to ∇μchange = |μω − μbase|;

– Case 2: With a lag effect in the time window.

To decrease the impact of the lag effect on the mean value of the time window,
we split the time window into two sub-windows viz. T1 and T2, such that, their mean
values are μT1 and μT2 respectively. This breaking point guarantees that the difference
of μT1 and μT2 is the maximum difference compared to any other breaking points.The

changing value of the given window is ∇μchange = max{|μT1

Geoinformatica

4.2.2 Change event detection

After normalization of the time window data, each weather station node has a changing value.
Our problem is to find the most anomalous, connected subset of weather stations such that, the
summation of the changing values of these weather station nodes is the maximum. To solve
this problem we applied the Evaluated Mean Scan (EMS) Statistics and Graph-structured
matching pursuit (Graph-MP) [6] method to detect a subset of stations that are spatially
connected and their weather variables changed rapidly within the time window (See Fig. 6).
1, xi is following Normal
distribution and S is some unknown anomalous cluster, where S ⊆ V . The aim is to decide
between the null hypothesis H0 : xi ∼ N(0, 1), ∀i ∈ V and the alternative hypothesis
H1 : xi ∼ N(μ, 1), ∀i ∈ S and xi ∼ N(0, 1), ∀i ∈ V − S. The EMS statistics for a cluster(a
subset) S is:

In EMS Statistics, we assume there is a ground set V = {xi}n

EMS(S) = 1√

Under certain conditions, the test of rejecting H0 for larger values of maxS⊆V EMS(S) is
statistically optimal.

Graph-MP Method is an efficient approximation algorithm and can optimize our objec-
tive EMS score function and returns a subset of weather station nodes that are connected
with each other. In Algorithm 1, at Line 11, Graph-MP takes the network graph adjacency
matrix A, normalized changing values of each node ˆX, sparsity constraint s and our main
objective EMS score function as the input. Graph-MP returns a subset of connected nodes
and their objective EMS score. If the returned subset of nodes has a larger change level then
its corresponding EMS score will be large, otherwise, the score will be small.

4.2.3 Ranking and Filtering of the results

Ranking the change events. After running Algorithm 1 for all the data and for all possible
time windows, we obtained a list of candidate change events with their corresponding EMS
scores. Line 15, ranks the candidate change events based on the EMS scores. The candidate
change events with higher EMS scores are most likely to be the true rapid change events.

Filtering the results. In the list of ranked candidate change events, if the multiple events
have overlapped time window and the subset of nodes, then only the event/s with the highest
EMS score among the overlapping events are kept.

Geoinformatica

4.3 Trafﬁc change event detection

We have two TMC network graphs for I-90 West and I-90 East (See Fig. 3). Both of
these network graphs have a similar shape and each TMC has average traveling time as an
attribute. Since the Traffic change event detection is similar to the single variable weather
change event detection method, we can use Algorithm 1. Currently, we only have the data
for traveling time available. If in the future, more traffic variables data become available,
then we can apply Algorithm 2 viz. Multi-variable change event detection algorithm.

4.4 Multi-variable change event detection

In the WSN, each node is associated with multiple weather variables, and we proposed
Algorithm 2 to detect the multi-variable change events. Compared to Algorithm 1, Algo-
rithm 2 has two main differences: 1) selection of the subset of change event related variables;
and 2) Multi-GraphMP algorithm.

4.4.1 Selection of related variables

In Algorithm 2, the inner loop Line 8∼17, iterates over all the variables in the given time
window and separately runs the Graph-MP method for each variable. In Line 10 Di,j indi-
cates the j th day data matrix of ith variable for WSN graph. Line 13∼16 compares the

Geoinformatica

EMS score of each variable change event with their threshold EMS score. In a given time
window if the EMS score of a variable change event is higher than the corresponding vari-
able EMS threshold score, then we assume this variable has a rapid change in the current
time window. Line 15 stores the changing values of ith variable for current time window to
the list ˆXrelated .

Weather Variables Anomalous Threshold Score. For each weather variable’s complete
data (for all the available data from Mar. 1, 2016 ∼ Dec. 31, 2016), we ran Algorithm 1
separately to obtain a change event list for each variable and calculated the median and
mad (mean absolute deviation) EMS scores of each variable change event list separately.
We set threshold(vari) = mediani + 2 ∗ madi as the threshold score for each variable,
where i indicates the index of the variable. For a given time window, if the EMS score of
detected change event is equal to or greater than the threshold EMS score, then this change
event is most likely to be the true rapid change event, as we call it change event related
variable. Table 2 shows the threshold of each weather variable.

4.4.2 Multi-GraphMP algorithm

In Algorithm 2, we used Multi-GraphMP Algorithm, which is a variant of GraphMP algorithm.
At Line 18 MULTIGRAPHMP takes A, the network adjacency matrix, ˆXrelated , the changing
values of related variables in the current time window, related vars, an index list of change
event related weather variables and MultiEMS, a variant of EMS score function as input.
The main difference between GraphMP and Multi-GraphMP is that in Multi-GraphMP the
EMS score is summation of the EMS score related variables in a given set of nodes:

MultiEMS(S, R) =

EMS(S, j ) =

where R is the list of variable indices and x corresponds to the variable ˆXrelated , xi,j rep-
resents the changing value of ith node’s j th variable in the current time window. Line 18
of MULTIGRAPHMP returns the subset of nodes and its MultiEMS score. Line 19 adds
a newly detected changing result to the result list. result.Score is the MultiEMS score,
result.SubsetN odes is the change event weather station node(s), j is the j th day and
time window[k] is the time slot interval of the current time window.

4.5 Correlation study

Our another important task is to study the spatio-temporal correlation between weather
change event and traffic change event. Is there any correlation between the weather change

events and the traffic change events? In this section, we will introduce Test Statistic Function
and Hypothesis Testing Method.

4.5.1 Problem deﬁnition

We defined the change event as a tuple (a subset of nodes, a subset of variables, time slots).
To study the correlation of weather and traffic events, we split the weather/traffic change
event into individual weather/traffic Events. A general event is defined as:

(Event T ype, Event Location, Event T ime).

The event type “0” and “1” indicate the weather and traffic respectively. The event locations
are the weather station or TMC locations, and the event occur time consists of date and time
slot. We have given the definition of two types of events, and both types of events have type,
location and occur time.

Assume, we have n weather events and m traffic events. W = {ew

set of weather events, and T = {et
(0, ew
events, the weather events and traffic events. Now we can define our hypothesis:

1, · · · , et

} is a set of traffic events, where ew

n

= (1, et

– Alternative Hypothesis(H1) The events of these two types are distributed in the space

time independently.

and time dependently.

In the following two sections we will discuss the design of a statistical model to test our
hypothesis.

4.5.2 Spatio-temporal correlation statistics

We use Pattern Instance Count(PIC) [5] as a test statistic for the statistical significance test
and show its ability to find all true co-locations at their “correct” co-location distances.
Figure 7 shows the PIC-values of different distances and a circle in Fig. 7 represents a co-
location neighborhood. We have two types of events, and they only can occur at the weather
station locations or TMC locations. Currently, we use PIC, the number of pairs of events
(instance) of two different types within a given radius r. In Fig. 7, assume there are two
types of events (instances) A and B that are spatially distributed in the study region.

Geoinformatica

(cid:2)

To calculate the PIC score for a set of events (instances, including Type A and Type B),
for each Type A event we count the Type B events within the given radius r and the final
PIC score is the summation of all pair counts. For example, the formula for Type A event is
PIC(A, B, r) =
k∈A PIC(Ak, B, r), where PIC(Ak, B, r) is the number of Type B events
within the radius r for Ak . The radius of the instance Ak is r, and its center is a Type A
event (blue triangle symbol). To calculate the PIC score of this single event, we count the
Type B events (red rectangle symbol) within the circle. For example, in Fig. 7, for instance
Ak, when the testing radius is r1 then PIC(Ak, B, r1) is 3; when the testing radius is r2 then
PIC(Ak, B, r2) is 7.

The PIC(A Events, B Events, r) score function has three inputs, where A Events is a
set of A type of events and B Events is a set of B type of events, and r is the testing radius.
The PIC score is the number of pairs of events of two different types (e.g. Type A and B)
within a given radius r.

In the time evolving network graphs, each event has the geographic location and occur
time (See Fig. 8). In our study, we treated event occur time as another “spatial coordinate”.
If the geographic distance of a pair of events is less than the given testing radius and the
occurrence time interval is less than the given time threshold (or the time radius), then
we can count this pair of events in the PIC score, otherwise, we can not count it in. In
Algorithm 3, Line 6 checks that the time interval of the weather event and traffic event must
be less than the time radius rt and the geographic distance must be less than geographic
radius rg.

4.5.3 Hypothesis testing

To test our null hypothesis we need a test statistic that will have different values under the
null hypothesis and the alternatives we care about. We then need to compute the sampling
distribution of the test statistic when the null hypothesis is true. The p-value is the probabil-
ity that the test statistic would be at least as extreme as we observed if the null hypothesis is
true. A permutation test gives a simple way to compute the sampling distribution for any

Fig. 7 PIC-values of a specific instance Ak for different radiuses; a circle represents a co-location
neighborhood area

respectively

test statistic, under the strong null hypothesis that a set of genetic variants has absolutely no
effect on the outcome.

Random Permutation Test is an examination of Test Statistics (TS) of the original data
and the TS of randomly permuted data (See Fig. 9). Random permutation hypothesis:

– Null Hypothesis(H0) Random permutation has no effect on the Test Statistics.
– Alternative Hypothesis(H1) Random permutation changes the Test Statistics results.

In our correlation study, the Test Statistics is the PIC score for a given radius r which
includes the time radius rt and geographic radius rg, however, for simplicity we denote it
with the symbol r. For the correlation study, we used random permutation testing to test our
hypothesis. Now we are reformulating our main hypothesis:

– Null Hypothesis(H0) The weather events and traffic events have a correla-

tion in a given radius r.

Fig. 9 Random permutation test statistics:“Does the random permutation change the Test Statistics results?”

Geoinformatica

– Alternative Hypothesis(H1) The weather events and traffic events are

randomly distributed within the given radius r.

We have a set of weather events W and a set of traffic events T and All Events = T∪W.
Similar to the process in Fig. 9, we perform the random permutation process by randomly
swapping the event location coordinates in the All Events set. We denote the original data
as Data0 = (W, T), perform the random permutation process to the original data p times,
and then obtain p data set {Data1, Data2, · · · , Datap}, where Datai = (Wi, Ti). For a
given radius r, the p value of the test statistic is the ratio of random permutation data sets
whose test statistic scores are not less than the test statistic of the original data Data0 set:

p value =

p(cid:3)

i=1

I (P I C(Data0, r) (cid:2) P I C(Datai, r))
p

,

(4)

where r is the test radius(rt , rg), I (P I C(Data0, r) (cid:2) P I C(Datai, r)) is an indicator
function, if the inequality is true, then it returns 1, otherwise it returns 0. P I C(Datai, r) is
the PIC score of the Datai for the given radius r.

We proposed the Algorithm 4, namely NETWORK BASED RANDOM PERMUTATION
TEST STATISTIC ALGORITHM, to testify our hypothesis. The inputs of the algorithm are a
set of weather events W, a set of traffic events T, the testing geographic radius rg and the
time radius rt . The output of this algorithm is the p value.

In Algorithm 4, Line 5 calculates the Test Statistic Score of original data
W, T. In between Lines 7∼16, the outer loop repeats the random permutation test
max permutation num times. At Line 8∼9 in each iteration the location of the events in
original set is randomized and randomly permuted new event set is obtained. Line 10∼11
regroups the new event set into the weather event set and traffic event set (both sets are ran-
domly mixed types of events). Line 12 calculates the randomly permuted data Test Statistic
score. In Line 13∼15 if the randomly permuted data Test Statistic score is equal to or greater

Geoinformatica

than the Test Statistic score then the “total greater score num” is increased by one. Line 17
calculates the p value.

4.6 Complexity analysis

As discussed earlier, we have two network graphs (WSN graph or TMC Network graph)
with |V| number of nodes (representing the weather stations or the TMCs nodes in the
network) and |E| number of edges.

Change event detection Algorithm. The key steps of our proposed algorithm for change
event detection are summarized in Algorithm 1. In line 8∼12, it shows the process of
detecting a change event in a given specific time window. The time complexity for Algo-
rithm 1 is dependent on the time complexity of Graph-MP method, which has a nearly
linear time complexity in terms of the number of nodes O(|E| log |V|) ∼ O(|V| log |V|)
due to sparsity of the underlined graph [6]. In Algorithm 2, we process multiple vari-
ables using MultiGraphMP method. The time complexity for this method can be written as
O(|V| log |V|).

Correlation study Algorithm. Assume we have two types of events, for which the event
sets are denoted as W and T respectively. If we perform the random permutation L number
of times, then the time complexity of Algorithm 4 can be expressed as O(L|W||T|).

5 Experiments

In this section, we will discuss the experiment results of the weather and traffic change
event detection and the correlation study between the weather event and the traffic event.
The experimental code and data sets are available from the Link [1] for reproducibility.

Fig. 10 Time-lag effect across the state from West to East [T2M and Average Wind Speed]

Geoinformatica

5.1 Experiments on weather dataset

5.1.1 Time-lag eﬀect and detection

We observed interesting rapid changes from the weather data plots. Figure 10 shows a case
study plot for the time-lag effect of T2M change on Apr. 12, 2016. Interestingly Fig. 10
shows the corresponding time-lag effect of Average Wind Speed change at the same time.
The temperature (wind speed) changes across the New York state from West to East. The
figure shows that the temperature (wind speed) is dropping down (increasing) one by one
on the time line from western weather stations to eastern weather stations.

Our proposed method can detect the time-lag effect in rapid weather change detection.
If there exists a time-lag effect, then it will be returned as a list of change events. Figure 11
shows the detected change events corresponding to Fig. 10, which shows a time lag effect
occurred on Apr. 12, 2016. The (a) subplot in Fig. 11 shows that weather station BATA has
a rapid change in temperature when it dropped down very quickly in the time interval 3:30
am ∼ 3:55 am. In the plot, we used two red dashed vertical lines to indicate the time window
of change event. The (b) subplot shows that two hours later, weather stations SBRI, WATE,
JORD, and CSQR also have a rapid weather change in temperature when the temperature
dropped down very quickly in the time interval 5:50 am ∼ 7:10 am. And the (c) subplot
shows that weather stations WEST, COLD, SPRA, and COBL have a rapid weather change
in temperature, and the temperature dropped down very quickly in the time interval 8:25 am
∼ 9:55 am.

5.1.2 Weather Change Event Detection

In the weather change event detection experiment, we used 8 weather variables data from
Mar. 1, 2016 to Dec. 31, 2016 (in total 306 days). As discussed in Section 4.3, in our
weather change event detection experiment we applied Algorithm 2. Algorithm 2 itera-
tively loads 306 days data of multi-variables and returns a list of change events ranked
by their EMS scores. The top ranked change events are most likely to be the true rapid
changes. For each input parameters of Algorithm 2 we tried several different settings.
The weather change events do not have ground truth, so we tried different combinations
of parameters, s = {2, 3}, min window = 3, max window = {6, 12, 18, 24, 36} and
hist base length = {6, 12}. After manually checking the true positive change events and

Fig. 11 Time-lag effect change event detection

Geoinformatica

Fig. 12 Weather change event detection Case 1

false positive change events in the returned top change events, we selected the parameter
combination that returned the highest precision score of change events list. So, we set the
upper bound s to 2 (our algorithm returns at most 4 ∗ s nodes). We set the minimum and
maximum time window size min window and max window to 3 and 18 respectively, the
size of historical base time window hist base length to 12.

We show the top 3 detected weather change events as the case studies of the multi-

variable change event detection experiment:

Case Study 1 [COLD, SPRA, STEP], [Radiation, Relative Humidity, T2M, Average Wind
Speed], 20160317, 16:55∼18:20.

In Fig. 12, there are four plots for four change event related variables viz. the Solar
Radiation, T2M, Average Wind Speed and Relative Humidity. The vertical red dash lines
indicate the time intervals in which the rapid change occurred. In the plot, each different
color line represents the values of different stations. Within the time interval 16:55 ∼ 18:20

Fig. 13 Weather change event detection Case 2

Geoinformatica

Fig. 14 Weather change event detection Case 3

on Mar. 17, 2016, the Solar Radiation at COLD and SPRA has increased and at STEP
weather station it has decreased. The temperature at COLD and STEP has dropped down
and at SPRA it has increased. Average Wind Speed at COLD and STEP has increased and at
SPRA it has decreased. The Relative Humidity at COLD has increased, at SPRA and STEP
it has decreased. We call the value of a variable has decreased or increased within a time
window based on the comparison of its time window value and the historical base value.

Case Study 2 [BATA, SBRI, WATE], [Radiation, Relative Humidity, T2M, Average Wind
Speed], 20160328, 18:10∼19:35.

In Fig. 13, there are four plots for weather change event related variables and at BATA,
SBRI, WATE the rapid weather change have occurred within the time interval 18:10 ∼
19:35 on Mar. 28, 2016. We can see from the plots, the radiation has obviously dropped
down very quickly and temperature has also dropped down for all three weather stations. At
BATA the Average Wind Speed has decreased and at SBRI, WATE the Average Wind Speed
has increased. At all three stations, the Relative humidity has increased.

Case Study 3 [WATE, JORD, WEST], [Radiation, Relative Humidity, T2M], 20160529,
18:15∼19:35.

In Fig. 14, there are three plots for weather change event related variables and WATE,
JORD, WEST are the weather stations where rapid weather change have occurred within
the time interval 18:15 ∼ 19:35 on May 29, 2016. From this figure, we can see the obvious
weather change events similar to the previous two cases.

5.1.3 Change event detection performance analysis

Precision, recall and F1-score of Top K detected change events. To show the effective-
ness of our change event detection algorithm, we considered the precision, recall and
F1-score of detected change events. Due to lack of ground truth labels for the change events,
three people have manually labeled 107 weather change events (in which the temperature
increases or drops harshly) in selected 20 days of T2M data. We applied Algorithm 1 on
this labeled data and computed the precision, recall, and F1-score for the topmost k detected

Geoinformatica

Fig. 15 Precision, Recall and F1-score of Top k (k = 5, 10, · · · , 100) detected weather change events of our
method.

change events, where k = 5, 10, · · · , 100. As shown in Fig. 15 our detection algorithm
achieved over 0.9 precision, recall, and F1-Score when k was set to 90. when k was set to
100 the precision, recall, and F1-Score were 0.94, 0.90 and 0.92, respectively.

Comparison against baseline event detection algorithms. In this experiment, we com-
pared our method with three state-of-the-art representative baseline methods on T2M data
with labels which was labeled as discussed earlier. As our baseline, we used ECP-Divisive,
ECP-Agglomerative [11] and NP-PELT [10] methods to identify change points within
a given time window. ECP-Divisive and ECP-Agglomerative are nonparametric multiple
change point detection algorithms on multivariate data proposed in [11]. NP-PELT [10] is
a nonparametric PELT which can detect changes in data series. If within a time window at
least one node has a change point(s), then we label it as a change event. Figure 16 shows
the precision-recall plot for top k detected change events.

Compared to other baselines, our method shows the best performance with high precision
and recall for Top K (K ≤ 100) change events. NP-PELT is the best baseline, the detected

days, there are 1 to 6 occurrences of rapid weather change events every day)

top 100 weather change events the precision, recall, and F1-Score are 0.5, 0.61 and 0.55,
respectively. ECP-Divisive performance is close to NP-PELT. Overall performance order is:
our method > NP-PELT > ECP-Divisive >ECP-Agglomerative.

5.1.4 Monthly statistics of daily change event counts

Figure 17 shows the monthly statistics of daily change event counts between Mar. to Sep.
For example, in Mar. ∼35% of the days, there are 1 to 6 occurrences of rapid weather change
events whereas ∼50% days there were 7 to 12 occurrences, and for ∼15% of the days there
were 13 to 18 occurrences of rapid weather change events. Interestingly Fig. 17 shows that
during Mar. to May time period the rapid weather change occurred more frequently than the
Aug. to Sep. time period in New York state.

5.2 Experiments on trafﬁc dataset

In the traffic change event detection experiment we used the average traffic traveling time
data for I-90 East and I-90 West from Mar. 1, 2016 to Dec. 31, 2016 (in total 306 days).
As we described in Section 4.2, in traffic change event detection experiment we applied
Algorithm 1. In Algorithm 1 we iteratively loaded 306 days data of traveling time, and

Fig. 18 I-90 East traffic change event detection Case 1

Geoinformatica

Fig. 19 I-90 East traffic change event detection Case 2

the algorithm returned a list of change events ranked by their EMS scores. The top ranked
change events are most likely to be the true rapid changes.

For the parameters of Algorithm 1 we did the same process as weather event detection
experiment. So, we set the upper bound s to 3, the minimum time window min window and
maximum time window max window sizes to 3 and 18 respectively, the size of historical
base time window hist base length to 12.

From the top change event results we removed the outlier change events related to only
one TMC with traveling time greater than 3600 seconds (one hour). Now we show several
Case study plots of the single variable change event detection experiment for I-90 East and
I-90 West data.

Case Study 1 In Fig. 18, at 19:20∼20:40 on Dec. 14, 2016 the traveling times for I-90 East
TMC-46 ∼ TMC-51 were rapidly increasing.

Case Study 2 In Fig. 19, at 9:50∼11:10 on Sep. 16, 2016 the traveling times for I-90 East
TMC-40 and TMC-41 were rapidly increasing.

Case Study 3 In Fig. 20, at 15:35∼17:00 on Dec. 15, 2016 the traveling times for I-90 West
TMC-17 ∼ TMC-27 were rapidly increasing.

Fig. 20 I-90 West traffic change event detection Case 3

Geoinformatica

All three plots for Case Study 1∼3 show that our algorithm accurately detects the exact
time slots and the connected road sections (or TMCs). For other detected traffic change
events, we observed the same patterns, where our algorithm avoids to return randomly
fluctuation or noisy changes.

5.3 Correlation study

As we discussed in Section 4.5, we used Top K change event results of both the weather and
traffic (includes I-90 West and I-90 East route results) change event detection experiments to
generate the weather events and the traffic events. To determine the values of K for weather
change event results and I-90 East and I-90 West change event results, we calculated the
median and mad of the EMS scores of each group of results separately. We set the value of
K to the number of change events that have EMS scores greater than median + 2 ∗ mad. We
obtained K=103 for the weather change event results, K=33 for the I-90 East route change
event results and K=29 for the I-90 West route change event results. Table 3 shows Top
103 weather change events, Table 4 shows the Top 29 I-90 West traffic change events and
Table 5 shows the Top 33 I-90 East traffic change events.

After selecting the Top K weather change events and Top K traffic change events, we
used them to generate the weather events and traffic events by applying the method intro-
duced in Section 4.5.1. We obtained 5755 weather events and 3657 traffic events (total
events of I-90 East and I-90 West route). Each event has Event Type, Latitude, Longitude,
Time and Station or TMC ID.

In the correlation study experiment, we applied the Algorithm 4 (NETWORK
BASED RANDOM PERMUTATION TEST STATISTIC ALGORITHM). Algorithm 4 takes
traffic events and maximum permutation number parameter,
the weather events,
max permutation num=500, as
the geographic radius rg we tested
{5, 10, 15, · · · , 40} (the unit is miles) and for the time radius rt we tested {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} time
slots (or {5, 10, 15, 20, 25} minutes). Based on our assumption and PIC spatial pairwise
correlation statistic, if two types of events have correlation on the given fixed radius (or dis-
tance), then we expect the p-values to be minimum at the given geographic radius and time
radius.

input. For

Figure 21 shows the results of our correlation study experiments. When the geographic
radius is less than or equal to 10 miles, the random permutation test returned the minimum
p-values, where the p-values are lower than the significance level 0.05. Thus, the weather
event and traffic event have a high correlation in given radius less than or equal to 10 miles.

6 Discussion

We conducted comprehensive experiments and determined the best parameter settings for
our proposed change event detection algorithms. In our change event detection experiment,
our two main proposed algorithms Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 performed very well. In the
correlation study, the input data of the experiment comes from previous change event detec-
tion experiments. We manually checked and ensured that all of the change events are true
change events. We tried different parameter settings when we run Algorithm 4 to obtain
expected results. When the testing geographic radius is less than or equal to 10 miles, the
p-values are lower than 0.03. We used Mesonet weather data and NPMRDS Traffic data,
but we only have data from Mar. 2016 to Dec. 2016. We ran our experiments with lim-
ited datasets. For example, we only had ten months of weather data rather than several

years, we had no incidents data, and the weather characteristics did not include precipi-
tation, snow coverage, or visibility. Additionally, if the weather observations are captured
closer to the roadway, they should be more reliable and improve the accuracy of our experi-
ments. Further, obtaining ground truth for the weather and traffic change events, or finding
more suitable distributions in our assumptions for the hypothesis tests, should lead to more
accurate and convincing results.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed three novel algorithms to study the correlation between weather
and traffic change events. We used the weather and traffic data in our network based
spatio-temporal model and found a new approach to analyze such data. Our case study
experiment results showed that our proposed algorithms performed very well. The proposed
research showed the feasibility of using weather and traffic data to detect the traffic con-
dition change during adverse weather conditions in real-time or further, predict the traffic
condition change during adverse weather conditions. In Experiments Section 5, we showed
that the proposed change event detection algorithms, Algorithm 1 and 2, are generalized
and flexible algorithm and we can use 8 weather variables data and also the traveling time
data. The change event detection experiment results show high quality change events and
also the correlation study experiment shows reasonable results. When the testing radii are
less than or equal to 10 miles, our random permutation test statistic return the minimum p-
values, which indicates the weather events and traffic events have a high correlation when
their distances are less than or equal to 10 miles. We also validate the change event detection
quality via comparing with three state-of-the-art baseline methods on temperature dataset.
And our method outperforms all the baselines in terms of precision, recall and f-score of
top K detected change events.

The methodology used in this research promises a way forward for the development
of techniques to be applied to real-time data feeds. By applying our technique to real-
time 5-minute weather observations and real-time 5-minute traffic data, we anticipate the
ability to alert traffic operations staff, decision makers, and the public, to upcoming con-
ditions. Further research will examine the relationship between conditions identified using
our rapid-change algorithm with weather and traffic data, and recorded incidents, to inform
safety researchers and transportation planner.

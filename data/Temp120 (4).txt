(Received 16 August 2007; in final form 18 December 2007 )

Monitoring and assessment of landslide hazard is an important task for decision
making and policy planning in the landslide area. Massive landslides, caused by
the catastrophic Chi-Chi earthquake in 1999, occurred in Central Taiwan,
especially at Chiufenershan area in Nantou county. This study proposed two
useful indicators coupled with the Self-organizing map (SOM) neural network
and the Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluations
(PROMETHEE) technique to quickly extract accurate post-quake landslides
from multi-temporal Syste`me Probatoire de l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT)
images. A GIS-based system was developed to simplify and integrate the
procedures such as image pre-processing, the SOM training, the PROMETHEE
calculation, landslide extraction and accuracy assessment. The evaluated result
shows that the landslide area soon after the earthquake is 209.50 ha (Kappa
coefficient 96.88%). Over seven years of vegetation recovery, the denudation area
has declined to 112.64 ha (Kappa coefficient 90.64%). Most earthquake-induced
landslides could be restored by natural vegetation succession. The developed
system is a useful decision-making tool for landslide area planning.

Introduction

Landslides are one of the most common natural hazards and are the most damaging,
leading to a variety of human and eco-environmental impacts (Dhakal et al. 2000).
The level of landslide hazard depends on land physical attributes, such as topsoil
depth and geologic structure, and external triggered factors such as large-scale
earthquakes, intensive rainfalls and improper human activities, especially agricul-
ture practices or land development on steep slopeland. Taiwan is a country
comprised of 75% hills and mountains, and steep terrain, fragile geology, and
seasonal monsoon rainfall contribute to the landslide potential. A catastrophic
earthquake with Richter magnitude of 7.3 occurred at Chi-Chi area of Nantou
County on 21 September 1999. The Chi-Chi Earthquake led to massive landslides,
dammed lakes and a high death toll
in central Taiwan, especially serious at
Chiufenershan area in Nantou county, the Jou-Jou Mountain area in Wu-Chi River

basin, Tasoling near the border between Yunlin and Chiai counties, and slopeland
along the East-West Expressway in Da-Chia River basin (Lin et al. 2005).

The Chiufenershan landslide is located about 15 km NNE of the epicenter
(23.85uN, 120.81uE). The slid materials buried 39 persons and 228 Asiatic deer, and
blocked a confluence of two streams, Chiutsaihuhsi and Satsikenghsi, to form two
landslide-dammed lakes (Shou and Wang 2003). The large-scale landslides at
Chiufenershan are more dangerous than others. The loose earth and stones
accumulated on the surface of slopes would increase the possibility of debris flows
and additional landslides and directly threaten downstream neighbouring villages
during typhoon seasons. As a result, there were several attempts, such as a variety of
dam constructions and ecological engineering, made by the government in this area
for mitigating second hazards. In fact, from 1999 to 2006, several typhoons,
especially Toraji (30 July 2001), have struck central Taiwan and caused serious
debris flow disasters at Chiufenershan landslide area. Therefore,
long-term
monitoring and assessment for the earthquake-induced landslides is essential.

Traditionally,

landslide monitoring is generally accomplished by field-based
geodetic, geotechnical and geophysical techniques complemented with aerial photos
interpretation (Keaton and DeGraff 1996) by use of manpower. It is not easy for
these attempts to evaluate effectively such tremendous landslides due to their
scattered spatial distribution. In recent years, with rapid acquisition for remotely
sensed data such as Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Syste`me Probatoire de
l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), it has been
used for landslide hazard assessment (Wang and Unwin 1992, Lee and Choi 2004,
Lee 2005, Andrews Deller 2006, Noferini et al. 2006). However, most of the
applications mainly focused on predicting spatial distribution of landslide hazard
using land uses derived from satellite images coupled with GIS techniques,
topographic data, predicting models or statistical analysis (McKean et al. 1991,
Mantovani et al. 1996, Walsh and Butler 1997, Dhakal et al. 2000, Komac 2006).
For example, there are many researchers who have analysed and monitored
the landslide hazard zonation by means of GIS technology and remote sensing
data (Irigaray et al. 2007, Wang et al. 2007). However, the precise extraction of
landslide sites should be the first assignment before assessment. For landslide land
cover detection, change detection coupled with suitable threshold selection is the
common used method. For example, Herva´ s et al. (2003) used change detection and
threshold to map and monitor landslide hazard from suitably pre-processed multi-
temporal imagery. Lin et al. (2005) identified landslide sites using image subtraction
algorithm coupled with suitable change threshold from multi-temporal SPOT
images.

Although many useful classification methods, such as ISODATA, maximum
likelihood estimation, fuzzy c-mean algorithm, neural network classifiers and
decision trees have been widely used to classify land covers from a variety of satellite
images (Baraldi and Parmiggiani 1995, Bastin 1997, Matsakis et al. 2000, Keuchel et
al. 2003, Pal and Mather 2003, Arora et al. 2004), supervised and unsupervised
classification techniques are two main categories that can be used to interpret
remotely sensed data. In supervised classification procedures, according to the
spectral features and land cover patterns, sufficient
training sites of known
informational classes must be selected and assisted by appropriate ancillary
groundtruthing data. The supervised classification method requires a certain level
of expertise to classify properly the informational classes from the spectral classes. It

is normally an iterative procedure in which the analyst revises the training sites or
category types until they are sufficiently spectrally classified (Lillesand et al. 2004).
that are spectrally similar
Unsupervised image classification places pixels
into groupings or clusters using classifiers. The analyst has to compare the classified
data with reference data to determine the identity and informational value of the
spectral classes (Lillesand et al. 2004). Inappropriate land cover classes selected will
cause problems in image interpretation. Besides, purely unsupervised procedures
without preprocessed feature extraction, such as image enhancement or index
transformation, cannot reach high accuracy results. For specific land cover
classification, it still needs complicated procedures and experienced operator for
high accurate result.

The objective of this study is to effectively identify accurate landslides from post-
quake images using the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network and the
Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluations
(PROMETHEE) techniques. The SOM neural network algorithm is suitable for
the extraction of patterns to support the understanding of the structures and the
(Koua et al. 2006). PROMETHEE is a well-known
geographic processes
multicriteria decision support method which gives insight into the preference
structure of a whole set of alternatives. The retrieved preference information is used
to give the partial or complete preorder of the available alternatives, which makes
PROMETHEE a well-suited decision support tool (Marinoni 2005).

In order

to facilitate establishing landslide assessment, several steps are
incorporated in the processes. First, two indicators coupled with image subtraction
was used to extract spectral feature of the landslide from pre- and post-quake SPOT
images. Second, by the SOM classifier, the derived spectral feature was projected
into two-dimensional maps, and similar feature values were grouped into same or
neighbouring neurons. Third, the landslides can be rapidly identified based on the
calculated outranking flow of neurons using the PROMETHEE technique. Then,
landslide changes such as unchanged, restored and enlarged sites can be assessed. A
system coupled with GIS was developed in this study and used for landslide hazard
monitoring and assessment. Additionally,
the analysed results were verified
according to on-site investigations in the landslide area.

2. Study area

The Chiufenershan landslide area (figure 1), with altitude 650–1040 m, average slope
38.27%, average precipitation 2144 mm year21 and annual mean temperature
21.1uC, is located at Nantou County in central Taiwan, about 15 km NNE of the
epicenter of the 921 earthquake. The area lies between 23u589080 N and 23u569520 N
latitudes and between 120u499360 E and 120u519010 E longitudes. The earthquake-
induced landslide area is over 200 ha. The primary land use patterns are composed
of wood, bamboo, betel nut, orchard and grass. Over 100 ha of farming land was
devastated by this landslide disaster. Topographically, the Chiufenershan is located
in the valley of a small stream called Chiutsaihuhsi with another small branch called
Satsikenghsi, and the valley is narrowed and isolated by the N–S trending Shihmen
ridge in the east. The geological data from Taiwan’s Central Geological Service
shows that the rock formation occurring in the target area is the Changhuken
formation, mainly formed by dark grey shale with thin alternating beds of
sandstone. The huge landslide was triggered along a weak bedding plane, on the dip
slope in the west wing of the syncline.

3. Methodologies

In order to monitor and assess the landslide changes, one pre-quake and two post-
quake SPOT satellite images were chosen, as shown in figure 2. The pre-quake image
was taken on 1 April 1999. The first post-quake image was taken on 27 September
1999, soon after the earthquake. The second post-quake images were taken on 17
November 2006, over seven years after the quake. Firstly, two indicators coupled
with image subtraction method were proposed to extract landslide spectral feature
landslide land cover can be
from pre- and post-quake SPOT images. Then,
effectively identified from the derived indicators using the SOM neural network and
the PROMETHEE technique. The change patterns such as restored, unchanged or
enlarged sites were assessed based on the extracted denudation sites.

The SOM is employed to transfer the complicated data from multispectral
satellite images to tens of two-dimensional clustered neurons. In other words, the
high-dimensional multispectral data would be simplified to the two-dimensional
data. Furthermore, the weight vectors of neurons are transferred to a one-
dimensional outranking flow using PROMETHEE. At this moment in time, these
two-dimensional data would be simplified to the one-dimensional data. Based on the
high spectral reflection distinguishing characteristic of landslides, the suitable
outranking flow of neurons can be determined for landslide identification. This
study provides a combination model to simplify high-dimensional data. The quick
and effective landslide auto-extracted information may also be provided as a basis
for emergency evaluation of landslide hazards.

3.1 Landslide spectral feature extraction

The SPOT image consists of green (G), red (R) and near-infrared (IR) wavebands.
including landslide, vegetation and water,
There are three major land covers,
distributed in post-quake study area. Usually, landslide with bared topsoil has
stronger reflectance than vegetation and water in G and R wavebands and lower
than vegetation in IR waveband. Therefore, two effective indicators, Ci and Cj, were
proposed to enhance brightness value of the landslide land cover and lower other
land covers. They are described as follows:

Ci~

GzR
GzIR

p
| ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃG(cid:1)R

where GzR
GzIR is a normalized function that can raise landslide brightness value and
lower vegetation; the function,
, can generate higher brightness value for
landslide and lower brightness value for water. Combining both functions, the
landslide shows a higher brightness value in the histogram.

Cj~ GzR{IR

ð

Þ| ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃG(cid:1)R

where G + R2IR is a differenced function that can transform the landslide
brightness value as positive (larger than zero), water as near zero and vegetation
as negative (smaller than zero); the function,
, is the same as mentioned-
above. Therefore, Cj can generate a larger positive brightness value for landslide, a
smaller negative for vegetation and close to zero for water.

Additionally, landslide is a kind of land cover change type between pre-quake and
post-quake imageries, which can be obtained using the method of image subtraction.
The algorithm is based on a pair of coregistered images of the same area collected at
different times. The process simply subtracts one digital image, pixel-by-pixel, from
another, to generate a third image composed of the numerical differences between
the pairs of pixels (Ridd and Liu 1998). After image subtraction, the denudation
sites can be highlighted and have a larger brightness value, which can be easily used
for landslide extraction. Therefore, landslide spectral features, LSF1 and LSF2, can
be derived from Ci and Cj coupled with image subtraction method. They were
described as follows:

After extracting landslide spectral feature from pre- and post-quake images,
brightness value of the landslide in LSF1 and LSF2 obviously shows larger than
other land covers. The derived characteristic facilitates landslide extraction using the
SOM neural network and the PROMETHEE technique.

3.2 Self-organizing map (SOM)

The SOM is a popular feed forward artificial neural network based on unsupervised
learning (Kohonen 1997). It consists of two layers—the input layer and the output layer.
Figure 3 illustrates the SOM network architecture. The neurons of the two layers are fully
connected. The SOM can project high-dimensional input vectors to low-dimensional map
(most commonly two-dimensional spaces), and perform this transformation adaptively
in a topologically ordered fashion. Similar input vectors should be mapped close together
on the nearby neurons, and group them into clusters. Before using the SOM, it is
important to normalize the input vector. The study used the following function:

x~

X { ¯X
sX

ð5Þ

where x is the normalized input vector, X is the input vector, X¯ and sX are the mean and
standard deviation.

In the SOM, each neuron i has an associated n-dimensional weight or codebook
vector, mi5[mi1, mi2,…,min], where n denotes the dimension of the input vectors. In
this study, n is two because two indicators were used as data sets. The SOM is
trained iteratively. The learning steps are expressed as follows (Kohonen 1997,
Giraudel and Lek 2001):

Step 1. Initialize randomly the weight vectors, mi(t), drawn from the input data set

and set t50.

Step 5. The SOM is iteratively trained until a predefined number of iterations is

reached.

The dimension of input vectors in this study is two because the transforming
feature indicators, LSF1 and LSF2, were chosen as data set. The
spectral
SOM_PAK tools developed by Kohonen et al. (1995) was used to cluster the
data set. The learning is broken down into ordering and tuning phases. In
the ordering phase, the neighbourhood radius decreases linearly from 5 to 1.
The initial learning rates were 0.9 and 0.25, and the training lengths were 2000
and 10,000 epochs for the ordering and tuning phases, respectively. In the
tuning phase, the learning rate decreased linearly from 0.25 to zero during
training. The hexagonal topology was used in this study. Usually, the number
of neurons can vary from a few dozen up to several thousand. A useful
performance index, the average quantization error (the mean of uc), proposed
by Kohonen et al. (1995) was used to determine the number of neurons. This
study used a rectangular grid with N6N hexagons, and proposed an evaluating
to determine the suitable N6N neurons. Usually, average
function, EN,
quantization error will gradually decrease with the increasing of output
neurons. The formula, EN, is to calculate the decreased average quantization
error for the increased neurons from N216N21 neurons to N6N. While EN
converged and was close to zero, the N6N hexagons were regarded as the
suitable neurons in the SOM network. It can be expressed as:

EN ~

QEN{QEN{1

N 2{ N{1

ð9Þ

where QEN and QEN21 is the average quantization error in a rectangular grid
with N6N and N216N21 hexagons.

When the training is over, the Kohonen map should be topologically ordered and
similar input vectors can map to the same or adjacent neurons. According to the
proposed indicators, the landslide will be enhanced and show larger brightness
values. A similar trend for the trained weight vectors can be found in the Kohonen
map. The landslide land cover can be rapidly extracted based on the derived weight
vectors. The larger the weight vectors, the higher the possibility of pixel belonging to

3.3 Landslide extraction using the PROMETHEE technique

Multiple criteria decision-making methods are suitable for analysing this problem
because the cell of Kohonen map having larger weight vectors is likely to be
identified as the landslide land cover. The PROMETHEE method presented by
Brans et al. (1984) is an iterative multiple criteria decision-making technique
designed to handle qualitative and discrete alternatives. The reasons for choosing
PROMETHEE are based on our former study for effectively determining the
optimal depression outlet from digital elevation models (Chou et al. 2004). In the
current study, two indicators (LSF1 and LSF2) coupled with the image subtraction
method were proposed to extract landslide sites for their stronger spectral responses
than other land covers. Furthermore, the derived weight vectors from the SOM are
suitable for PROMETHEE outranking flow calculations. Moreover, Marinoni
(2005) discussed the integration of PROMETHEE in a GIS and indicated that the
combination of a sophisticated decision support methodology with powerful spatial
analysis and visualisation capabilities can be applied to evaluating decision
alternatives. Marinoni (2006) also applied the PROMETHEE outranking approach
for land-suitability assessment using the raster data sets. In this study,
the
PROMETHEE II method was chosen to quantify and determine the priority of the
cells of the Kohonen map for the landslide. The method PROMETHEE II is a
popular decision method that has been successfully applied in the selection of the
final solution of convex multiobjective optimization problems. It is based on the
concept of outranking relation, which is a binary relation defined between every pair
(a, b) of alternatives. If a is preferred to b, then a outranks b. The method
PROMETHEE II extends this classical PROMETHEE approach by modelling the
decision-maker preferences through a preference function H(d) (Parreiras and
Vasconcelos 2007). The calculation steps of
the PROMETHEE method are
described as follows:

(1) Establishing an alternatives and criterion matrix
If the Kohonen map has n cells (or neurons), there will be n alternatives (a1,
a2,…,an). Each cell has two evaluative factors, w1 and w2 (the trained weight
vectors). The evaluative function can be written as f1(.) and f2(.). Both the
alternatives and criterion can be expressed as a n by 2 matrix ~TT.

From the outranking flow calculation, the cell that has larger outranking flow has
a higher possibility of belonging to the landslide. The user needs to select an
appropriate outranking flow from the calculated n cells (or neurons). If the
outranking flow of cells is greater than the selected outranking flow, the pixels in
those cells are defined as the landslide and others are defined as non-landslide. The
optimal outranking flow can be easily recognized while comparing the identified
result with aerial photos and/or filed surveys. There are obvious differences between
optimal outranking flow and its neighbouring outranking flow.

Additionally, by developed GIS-based system, the suitable threshold of out-
ranking flow for landslide identification becomes an easy task. The operators can
quickly select the outranking flow from the n cells (or neurons) in descending order,
and to rapidly compare the extracted landslide with ancillary data such as aerial
photos and/or field survey. If the suitable outranking flow was determined, the
landslide can be extracted.

3.4 Landslide accuracy and change patterns assessment

Additionally, the classification accuracy for the extracted landslides can be assessed
using kappa statistic, which is a measure of agreement or accuracy for land cover
classification (Congalton 1991). Landslide change patterns (CP) over seven years
after the quake can be analysed using the following function:

CP~LSiz2|LSj

ð18Þ

where LSi is the extracted landslides soon after the quake, LSj is the any period of
the extracted landslides after the quake. The CP value ranges from 1 to 3,
representing the restored, enlarged and unchanged landslides, respectively.

3.5 System architecture

The LandHaz spatial analysis software was developed in this study to derive
landslide spectral feature, perform the operation of the SOM classifier, calculate the
outranking flow of the PROMETHEE algorithm and identify the landslide for
hazard assesses. LandHaz is written in C + + coupled with ESRI MapObjects
component for Microsoft Windows platforms and includes tools for managing
satellite image coverage data, and displaying statistical analysis results in colour.
The LandHaz system consists of several separate program components (e.g. PRE-
PROCESSING for extracting image spectral indicators, transforming file format
between algorithms and handling data from/to ArcView, Imagine and SOM_PAK
programs; SOM_PRO for determining suitable number of neurons of the SOM,
optimizing the parameters of SOM_PAK programs, accessing the operation and
results of SOM_PAK programs, and calculating the outranking flow of weight
neurons; LANDSLIDE for identifying the landslide based on the selected
outranking flow, computing Kappa accuracy of the landslide, analysing landslide
change patterns).

multi-temporal SPOT imageries to obtain landslide spectral features (LSF1 and
LSF2) for each pixel. Then, the SOM was utilized first to cluster the normalized
input data (LSF1 and LSF2) by a large set of prototype vectors. The training
parameters of the SOM have been described in section 3.2. The suitable number of
neurons was determined using an evaluating function (EN). It is very important to
select suitable numbers of neurons for the SOM network. If the selected neurons are
not enough, the high-dimensional data cannot be separated effectively. That is to
say, the similarity among the trained neurons is too low for them to be clustered
appropriately. Oppositely, if too many neurons are selected, they need a longer time
for data training. The simplification effect for high-dimensional data is limited in
this scenario. It may lead to poor results for determining suitable landslide
outranking flow using PROMETHEE. Therefore, the values of EN are proposed in
this study to calculate the suitable numbers of neurons for the SOM. Figure 4 shows
the calculated results for two post-quake images. Whether they are from the initial
post-quake stage (27 September 1999) or after seven years (17 November 2006), the
values of EN have gradually converged and were close to zero with the increasing of
neurons. It is obvious that the calculated EN has been converged after 969 neurons
in figure 4. Therefore, 969 neurons were chosen for training the extracted the
landslide from post-quake images in the SOM network.

The input data can be transferred as weight vectors after iteratively training in the
SOM. The converged weight vectors mapped on the Kohonen map were shown in
figure 5. The SOM is a useful tool for the visualization of association of similar land
covers distribution. With the help of Kohonen map, the associations of similar land
covers can be observed very clearly. According to the extracted landslide spectral
feature, the larger the extracted feature value, the higher the possibility of belonging
to the landslide. The weight vector trained in the SOM has the same association. In

figure 5, the darker colour represents larger weight value; that is, a higher possibility
belonging to the landslide. In figure 5, the landslide distribution of both LSF1 and
LSF2 weight vectors on 27 September 1999 and 17 November 2006 are similar,
which indicates the derived two indicators can be effectively used to enhance the
spectral feature of the landslide land cover. Based on the distribution of trained
weight vectors, the landslide soon after the earthquake (27 September 1999) and
over seven years (17 November 2006) were concentrated near the lower-right side
and near upper-right side, respectively.

4.2 Landslide hazard assessment using the PROMETHEE technique

The approximate landslide spatial distribution can be obtained from the converged
weight vectors mapped on the Kohonen map shown in figure 5. However, the two-
dimensional input vectors (LSF1 and LSF2) cannot be used to extract landslide sites
directly. Based on the PROMETHEE concept of outranking relation, the two-
dimensional weight vectors are calculated as paired alternatives for the outranking

flow of neurons. That is to say, when the training process was finished and the
prototype vectors were obtained, the PROMETHEE technique was utilized to
calculate the outranking flow of neurons of the SOM. The larger the outranking flow
of neurons, the higher the possibility of a pixel belonging to the landslide because of the
high spectral reflection characteristic of the landslide. At this moment, the complicated
high-dimensional satellite image data have been transferred to tens of neurons as one-
dimensional data by using the SOM and PROMETHEE. Landslide sites are now
ready to be extracted from these neurons. According to descendant order of
outranking flow, the image pixels in the selected neurons are categorized as landslide
and illustrated in the GIS-based interface. Meanwhile, the aerial photos or field
investigation data can assist the extraction until all landslide sites are fully extracted.
The outranking flow of neurons for post-quake images was calculated, as shown in
figure 6. The suitable outranking flow for landslide identification on 27 September
1999 and 17 November 2006 were 23.78 and 20.96, respectively.

The extracted landslide sites are shown in figure 7. The former landslide area is
209.50 ha with high Kappa coefficient up to 96.88%, and the latter is 112.64 ha with
high Kappa coefficient 90.64%. With vegetation restoration in denudation sites,
landslide pixel was mixed with vegetation, which increases the difficulty of landslide
identification. Therefore, the accuracy assessment of the landslide on 17 November
2006 was declined. The Kappa coefficient using different outranking flow of neuron
was assessed in figure 8. There are obvious differences in Kappa coefficient between
optimal accuracy of outranking flow and its neighbouring outranking flow. The
differences facilitate the operator to determine suitable the threshold of outranking
flow from neurons of the SOM. The assessed result shows that over seven years the
landslide area has reduced by 46.23%. In initial stage of the earthquake, the
landslide site is extensively distributed throughout
the study area. By 2006
November, these placements have been significantly covered with vegetation.
Figure 9 illustrates the landslide changes from 1999 to 2006. Three change patterns
can be analysed, including the restored, enlarged and unchanged landslide. The
areas for three change patterns are 107.94, 11.08 and 101.56 ha, respectively. The
calculated result
indicates that most earthquake-induced landslides could be
restored by natural vegetation succession. Though several typhoons and storms

struck during the rainfall seasons, only small parts of landslide sites are enlarged and
most of them are located at the deposited area. The observed major vegetation at the
enlarged landslide sites are trees and the restored landslide sites are grasses. The
enlarged and unchanged landslide sites may be defined as vegetation vulnerable
areas in this study. Those areas are suggested for the implementation of vegetation
practices or ecotechnology measures to assist vegetation regrowth. Continuing
landslide monitoring and evaluations are also recommended.

5. Conclusions

Monitoring and assessment of landslide hazard is an important task for decision
making and policy planning in the landslide area. This study proposed two useful
indicators coupled with image subtraction to derive landslide spectral feature from
pre- and post-quake SPOT images and combined the SOM with the PROMETHEE

technique for extracting landslide. A system that integrates the proposed indicators,
the SOM, the PROMETHEE technique and GIS-based interface was developed to
facilitate application of
landslide identification. Compared with traditional
classification methods, the developed model simplifies the procedures of classifying
landslide land cover. The brightness values of the landslide in multi-dimensional
wavebands were transformed into a one-dimensional vector, usually composed of
tens of cells (or neurons). Therefore, the landslide land cover can be quickly
acquired from these neurons. However, the image acquiring season should be
consistent to prevent seasonal effects, and in the meantime the topographic effects
for the terrain should be carefully considered in the mountainous areas. According
to verification at Chiufenershan area, high accuracy of post-quake landslides can be
calculated. The analysed results indicate that the developed system is a useful tool
for landslide hazard assessment. Possible future research for this work may include
using higher resolution images such as IKONOS or QuickBird, and incorporating
other algorithms with learning functions to establish a knowledge store for landslide
extraction.

ABSTRACT
This study examined how contextual areas deﬁned and operationa-
lized diﬀerently may lead to diﬀerent exposure estimates. Substance
users’ exposures to environmental stress (in terms of two variables:
community social economic status and crime) were assessed from
global positioning systems (GPS) data. Participants were 47 outpati-
ents with substance use disorders admitted for methadone mainte-
nance at a research clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. From 35.2 million
GPS tracking points, we compared 7 diﬀerent methods for deﬁning
activity space. The diﬀerent methods yielded diﬀerent exposure
estimates, which would lead to diﬀerent conclusions in studies
using only one method. These results have important implications
for future research on the eﬀect of contextual inﬂuences on health
behaviors and outcomes: whether a study observes any signiﬁcant
inﬂuence of an environmental factor on health may depend on what
contextual units are used to assess individual exposure.

1. Introduction

Much of environmental health research is concerned with whether and how social and
physical environments aﬀect health (Berkman and Kawachi 2000; Diez-Roux 2001;
Macintyre et al. 2002; Myers et al. 2016). To examine whether an environmental factor
has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on a speciﬁc health behavior or outcome, it is ﬁrst necessary
to accurately measure individual exposure to the relevant environmental factor. An
important issue in this measurement process is to identify the appropriate geographic
area to be used as the contextual unit for deriving the values of various environmental
variables (e.g. neighborhood socioeconomic status [SES]). Contextual areas in most
studies in the past tend to be based on conventional delineations of people’s residential
neighborhood, which is often identiﬁed in terms of administrative units such as census
tracts or postal code areas (Arcaya et al. 2016). Common assumptions underlying these
conventional delineations of contextual areas include the neighborhood of residence is

the most relevant area aﬀecting health behaviors and outcomes, and neighborhood
eﬀects operate only through interactions among those residing within the same neigh-
borhood unit. Further,
individuals who live in the same areal unit are assumed to
experience the same level of contextual inﬂuences, regardless of where they actually
live within the area or how much time they spend outside their neighborhood of
residence.

Using administrative units as the basis for evaluating neighborhood eﬀects is con-
venient because they are often tied to data from censuses and surveys that can be used
to derive contextual measures. However, people’s exposures to inﬂuences from their
social and physical environments are determined by where they go and how much time
they spend there as they move around to undertake their daily activities (Cummins et al.
2007; Kwan 2009, 2013; Matthews 2008; Widener et al. 2013). People’s activities (and
thus environmental exposures) do not take place at one time point and wholly within
any static, administratively bounded areal unit like census tracts or blocks. Residential
location is one of the places where people spend their time, but for most people, the
residential neighborhood does not capture many of their daily activities or the locations
of these activities. In light of this, people’s movement in space and time should be taken
into account in order to more accurately estimate their environmental exposures and
the eﬀects of various contextual factors on their health behaviors and outcomes.

The methodological issue arising from the use of conventional contextual areas,
largely in the form of static administrative areas, in health and geographic research
has been recently articulated as the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP)
It refers to the problem that inferences about eﬀects of area-based
(Kwan 2012).
attributes (e.g.
land-use mix) on individual behaviors or outcomes (e.g. physical
activity) may be aﬀected by how contextual areas or neighborhoods are geographi-
cally delineated. The problem ‘arises because of the spatial uncertainty in the actual
inﬂuences on the individuals being studied and the
areas that exert contextual
temporal uncertainty in the timing and duration in which individuals experienced
these contextual inﬂuences’ (Kwan 2012). As no researcher has complete and perfect
knowledge of the ‘true causally relevant’ geographic context, all previous studies that
used area-based contextual variables to explain individual behaviors or outcomes face
the problem.

The UGCoP argument is strongly corroborated by ﬁndings from recent studies on
environmental inﬂuences on body weight (James et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2018), food
access and its eﬀects on health (Widener et al. 2013; Chen and Kwan 2015) and
individual exposure to air pollution (Yoo et al. 2015; Dewulf et al. 2016; Park and Kwan
2017; Yu et al. 2018). These studies indicate that the UGCoP is a signiﬁcant methodolo-
gical problem in geographic and health research that seeks to understand how environ-
mental factors aﬀect health behaviors and outcomes. This paper seeks to contribute to
this literature by showing how uncertainties in geographic context may aﬀect exposure
measures in a study of substance users’ exposure to psychosocial stress using global
positioning systems (GPS) data. It extends conventional concepts of neighborhood to a
broader understanding of context based on people’s activity spaces (i.e. the actual
locations where people undertake their daily activities) (Golledge and Stimson 1997). It
explores how context deﬁned and operationalized diﬀerently may lead to diﬀerent
exposure estimates and diﬀerent conclusions about their eﬀects on health.

Speciﬁcally, the study examines substance users’ exposure to psychosocial stress
evaluated with two variables: a composite measure of community SES and crime. It
uses a GPS dataset collected from outpatients with substance use disorders admitted for
methadone maintenance at a research clinic in Baltimore, Maryland (Epstein et al. 2014).
From 35.2 million GPS tracking points (GTPs), 7 contextual areas based on the notion of
activity space are delineated for 47 participants. Measures of these participants’ expo-
sure to psychosocial stress are derived with these seven contextual areas, which are
GTPs, GPS trajectory buﬀers (GTBs), standard deviational ellipses (SDEs) with one or two
standard deviation(s) [SD(s)] (SDE1, SDE2), minimum convex polygons (MCPs), kernel
density surfaces (KDSs) and home buﬀers (HBs). The results indicate that diﬀerent
delineations of contextual areas yield diﬀerent exposure estimates, which vary consider-
ably across the participants and exposure measures. These results have important
implications for future research on the eﬀect of contextual inﬂuences on health beha-
viors and outcomes: whether a study observes any signiﬁcant inﬂuence of an environ-
mental factor on health may depend on what contextual units are used to assess
individual exposure.

2. Environmental inﬂuences on substance use behavior

Substance use and addiction are public health concerns that have wide-ranging social
consequences. Considerable research has been conducted to identify risk and protective
factors at the psychological and social levels (Boardman et al. 2001; Molina et al. 2012;
Brenner et al. 2013). These factors generally fall into two broad categories: those that
pertain to individuals and their interpersonal environments (e.g. attitudes and inﬂuences
from peer groups) and those that reﬂect societal contextual conditions (e.g. neighbor-
hood disorganization and economic deprivation).

Much of the early work in this area focused on individuals’ own characteristics and
those of their families and peers (Hawkins et al. 1992; Galea et al. 2004). Recent studies
emphasize the additional impact of the neighborhood environment or context (which
were largely derived from census-tract data) based on the hypothesis that neighbor-
hoods can contribute to problem behavior (Sampson et al. 2002; Galea et al. 2005). For
instance, researchers have observed associations between the physical and social envir-
onments and substance dependence (Kadushin et al. 1998) and between neighborhood
disadvantage and the availability of illegal substances (Storr et al. 2004). Studies have
also found that the association between neighborhood deprivation and substance use
was partly mediated by diﬀerences in the level of psychological distress (Boardman et al.
2001). Many of these ﬁndings suggest that the inﬂuence of neighborhoods is causal.
Speciﬁcally, neighborhood environment may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence stress levels, which
may inﬂuence substance use (Kwan et al. 2008; Mennis and Mason 2010, 2011; Brenner
et al. 2013).

On the whole, however, research ﬁndings on the eﬀect of neighborhood character-
istics on illicit substance use are inconsistent. For instance, while several studies indicate
that diﬀerences in neighborhood disadvantage – variously deﬁned in terms of one or
more characteristics based on census tracts, such as poverty status or an index capturing
several community features – provide part of the explanation for higher levels of illicit
substance use among adolescents and adults (Boardman et al. 2001; Hoﬀman 2002),

4

others found that such neighborhood disadvantage measures are not signiﬁcantly
associated with adolescent substance use (e.g. Allison et al. 1999). Thus, among the
many sociogeographic factors identiﬁed as relevant for illicit substance use and abuse,
the role of neighborhood context remains less clear than those of individual, family and
peer risk factors. While it is recognized that certain environmental or contextual condi-
tions may invoke substance use among addicted individuals, there are signiﬁcant con-
ceptual and measurement issues in past studies that call for further investigation.

One important issue, as noted above, is that these studies have usually relied on
exposure measurements based on people’s residential neighborhoods, which are
static and administratively bounded. Researchers have recently begun to adopt a
dynamic notion of sociogeographic context (Kwan et al. 2008; Kwan 2009; Mason and
Korpela 2009; Mennis and Mason 2011; Mennis et al. 2016; Epstein et al. 2014) and to
use new data collection methods and analytical techniques (e.g. GPS data that tie to
real-time ecological momentary assessment [EMA] data and geographic information
systems [GIS]) (e.g. Mason et al. 2009; Mason and Korpela 2009).

This study uses a GPS dataset collected from substance users in Baltimore, Maryland,
to explore how estimates of substance users’ exposure to psychosocial stress may be
aﬀected by the contextual areas used to derive the exposure measures. It examines
exposure to psychosocial stress using two variables: a composite measure of community
SES and crime. The study seeks to shed light on the inconsistencies in previous ﬁndings
and to contribute to the nascent literature on the UGCoP in health and GIScience
research (e.g. James et al. 2014; Park and Kwan 2017; Shafran-Nathan et al. 2017;
Helbich 2018; Wei et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2018).

3. Data and methods

3.1. Data collection and preprocessing

The GPS dataset used in this study was collected in Baltimore, Maryland, from 2009 to
2011, using methods similar to those we described in a published pilot study with data
collected in 2008–2009 (Epstein et al. 2014), but in a larger sample (Preston et al. 2018).
The purpose of the project was to assess the associations between participants’ real-time
environmental psychosocial
substance use behavior.
stress exposure and their
Participants were outpatients admitted for methadone maintenance at a research clinic
in Baltimore. Eligibility criteria for enrollment were aged 18–65, physical dependence on
opioids and evidence of cocaine and opiate use (self-report and urine). Exclusion criteria
were any psychotic disorder listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), history of bipolar disorder or current major depressive
disorder; current DSM-IV dependence on alcohol or sedative-hypnotics; cognitive impair-
ment severe enough to preclude informed consent or valid self-report; and medical
illness that would compromise participation. The Institutional Review Board of the
National Institute on Drug Abuse approved the study, and participants gave written
informed consent before enrollment. All data were covered by a Federal Certiﬁcate of
Conﬁdentiality.

Each participant carried a small GPS logger at all times during the study period. The
GPS devices were set to log geolocation (latitude, longitude and altitude) every 20 m or

every 15 min, whichever came ﬁrst. This means that the GPS tracking data were not
collected evenly in space and time but rather selectively: a location was logged if a
participant moved more than 20 m from the previously recorded location, or a location
was logged every 15 min if the participant did not move more than 20 m from the
previously recorded location within the period. Each participant also carried a PalmPilot
PDA at all times and was trained to use it as an electronic diary (ED), which provided
data for the EMA component of the project. An ED entry was initiated whenever the
participant (1) used any substance (e.g. cocaine, heroin or other opioid, marijuana, an
amphetamine, benzodiazepines or alcohol) outside of a medical context or (2) felt
overwhelmed, anxious or stressed more than usual. In addition to these event-triggered
entries, participants responded to randomly timed prompts via their PDAs three times
per day to report their mood, stress level, environmental setting, activities and degree of
substance craving.

Analyses reported in this paper are based on a subsample of 47 participants from the
intensity of the geospatial
larger multi-week project because of the computational
analysis involved. For these 47 participants, there were 35.2 million GTPs and the
average tracking period is 107 days. Note that the tracking periods among these
participants varied considerably: two participants had the shortest tracking period of
19 days, while two other participants had very long tracking periods that exceeded
200 days. Further, although the participants were outpatients admitted for methadone
maintenance at a research clinic in the city of Baltimore, some of them spent consider-
able time outside the city. We thus expanded the study area to include the entire state
of Maryland, which covers more than 90% of the total GPS records in the subsample.

Before data analysis was performed, a Python program was implemented to ensure
consistency and eliminate errors in the GPS data. Each GPS track was checked to ensure
proper temporal order and presence of at least two GPS points. Duplicate points
were eliminated. Each track was also checked to make sure it met the criterion that a
location was logged if a participant moved more than 20 m from the previously logged
location, or every 15 min otherwise. Further, to reduce computational complexity, the
duration between any pair of consecutive GPS records was assigned to the ﬁrst point if
a participant did not move more than 20 m during the period. This simpliﬁcation is
acceptable since 20 m is a small distance relative to the area of the contextual units
delineated in the study.

3.2. Contextual variables

links between contextual

Past health studies have identiﬁed causal
inﬂuences and
people’s health behaviors. Particularly salient for substance use are social cohesion,
social capital and collective eﬃcacy, each of which can be protective against sub-
stance-related problems (Boardman et al. 2001; Latkin et al. 2005; Brenner et al. 2013).
Conversely, neighborhoods that are low in these dimensions and have high crime rates
tend also to have high rates of substance-related problems. In this study, we used two
inﬂuences on the participants. The ﬁrst
constructs to capture potential contextual
construct is community SES; the second is crime. Each is useful for representing social
cohesion, collective eﬃcacy and social disorder (e.g. Stahler et al. 2007; Mennis and
Mason 2011; Epstein et al. 2014).

Community SES was operationalized in this study as a composite socioeconomic
index (CSI) based on the modiﬁed Darden–Kamel composite index developed by
Darden et al. (2010).
It uses nine variables from census data and assigns a higher
score to communities with higher SES. The nine variables are the percentage of residents
with university degrees, median household income, the percentage of managerial and
professional positions, median value of dwelling, median gross rent of dwelling, the
percentage of homeownership, the percentage of households with vehicle, the percen-
tage of population below poverty (reverse scored) and unemployment rate (reverse
scored). The CSI was calculated as the sum of Z scores of the nine variables by using the
following formula:

CSIi ¼

Xn

j¼1

Vij (cid:2) Vj MD
(cid:3)
(cid:2)
SD Vj MD

(1)

where CSIi is the composite SES index for census tract i; n is the number of variables
for the index (it is 9 for the modiﬁed Darden–Kamel composite index), Vij is the jth
variable for a given census tract i, Vj MD is the mean of the jth variable for all census
tracts in the state of Maryland and SD(Vj MD) is the SD of jth variable for all census tracts
in Maryland. Since the GPS data were collected from 2009 to 2011, the American
Community Survey census tract data of 2010 were used in this study to calculate the
CSI for each census tract in Maryland (this was the ﬁnest resolution available on the
website of the US Census at the time when analyses for this paper were performed).
Figure 1 shows the CSI scores for all census tracts in Maryland.

Crime data were obtained from the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicator Alliance
website, which provides data on two relevant measures: rate of violent crime and rate
of general crime, each taken from reports to the Baltimore Police Department. Violent
crimes include murder and nonnegligent homicide, forcible rape, aggravated assault

SES of a census tract and a low CSI score reﬂects lower SES of a census tract.

and robbery. General crime includes violent crime plus burglary, larceny-theft, motor
vehicle theft and arson. Both violent and general crime rates are based on the number of
relevant crimes per 100,000 residents in a particular community. This study used the
broader category of general crime as the measure of crime. Since crime data at the level
of census tract are available only for the city of Baltimore but not for the state of
Maryland, analyses in this paper that used crime data focused only on Baltimore City.

3.3. Delineations of contextual areas and deriving exposure measures

To assess participants’ exposure to psychosocial stress (measured by the CSI and crime),
7 delineations of individual contextual areas were implemented for the 47 selected
participants – 6 using their GPS data, one using their home location. The six GPS-based
delineations are GTPs, GTBs, SDEs with one or two SD(s) (SDE1, SDE2), KDSs and MCPs.
The home-based delineations are HBs. Figure 2 illustrates ﬁve of these contextual areas
for one participant (excluding GTP and HB to protect the participant’s privacy).
Appropriate methods of temporal or spatial interpolation were used to derive exposure
measures from these contextual areas for each participant, and the contextual variables
(CSI and crime) were standardized or normalized to ensure comparability among the
participants. All data processing and analyses were performed with ArcGIS.

1. GTPs – Participants’ exposure to psychosocial stress was ﬁrst assessed using their
GTPs. Because the original GPS points are temporally uneven, a Python program was
developed to interpolate data, using these steps: (1) The time diﬀerence between every
pair of consecutive GPS points was calculated; (2) if the diﬀerence was longer than 1 s
(say, N seconds), the program used linear interpolation to insert N − 1 more points
evenly between the two. After this, each participant’s GPS tracks had one point every

included for privacy concern).

second. Further, each of the contextual variables (CSI and crime) was computed as the
sum of its values at all GPS points divided by the number of GPS points for each
participant (this step standardized the contextual variable because the number of GPS
points was diﬀerent across participants).

2. GTBs – A GTB was created for each participant by covering the participant’s
GPS trajectories with a 200-m buﬀer area. Because this buﬀer area covers all the
locations that a participant visited or passed during GPS logging, it can be used to
assess participants’ exposure to psychosocial stress in their daily life. This was done with
a weighted sum of the contextual values based on the area of each census tract that was
within a participant’s GTB.

3 and 4. SDEs at one and two SD(s) (SDE1 and SDE2) – The SDE has been used in prior
studies to delineate individual activity space and derive exposure measures (e.g.
Sherman et al. 2005; Rainham et al. 2010). An SDE captures the geographic distribution
and directional trend of a series of points and was derived in the following manner
(Arcury et al. 2005; Wong and Lee 2005). First, the mean center of a participant’s GPS
points was derived. Then, the coordinates of each point in the set were transformed so
that the center of the transformed coordinates became (0,0). The ellipse was ﬁnally
obtained based on one or two SD(s) of the distances between each point and the
transformed mean center along the rotated major and minor axes of the point set
(Sherman et al. 2005). Since some past studies used one SD SDE while other studies used
two, we derived both for comparison. For each participant, an SDE at one SD (SDE1)
includes approximately 68% of the participant’s GPS points within its boundary, while an
SDE at two SDs (SDE2) contains approximately 95% (Sherman et al. 2005). To assess
participants’ exposure to psychosocial stress, a weighted sum of the values of a con-
textual variable (e.g. crime) was used, based on the area of each census tract that was
within a participant’s SDE.

5. Time-weighted KDSs – The KDS has also been used in prior studies to represent
activity space and derive exposure measures. It is a density surface derived from the
location of a set of points (and an associated weight such as the population at each
point) using a kernel function and a predetermined search radius (or bandwidth). To
generate a KDS for each participant in the study, a nonparametric kernel estimation
method and a bandwidth of 1000 m was used. The 1000-m bandwidth avoids two issues
associated with smaller bandwidths. First, the resulting density surface obtained with
smaller bandwidths may approximate the GPS buﬀers, since the density surface is
derived with only a few adjacent GPS points. Second, the resulting density surface
obtained with smaller bandwidths may consist of many small discrete areas, because
many cells in the raster surface will have 0 values, given that the smoothing kernel
function covers only a small area and thus falls oﬀ rapidly. Based on some experiments
with diﬀerent bandwidth values, we found that 1000 m worked well for our dataset and
study area. Using this bandwidth, the KDSs were generated based on the duration spent
at each GTP as the weight on a raster layer with a spatial resolution of 100 × 100 m. To
utilize the estimated kernel density values as the weight at each GTP for calculation of
participants’ contextual exposures, the raster cells with a density value larger than 0
were converted to points in a point-feature vector layer. The weighted sum of the values
of a contextual variable (e.g. crime) was ﬁnally derived based on the kernel density value
at each point.

6. MCPs – The MCP for a participant is the smallest convex polygon that contains all of
the person’s GTPs. To assess participants’ exposure to psychosocial stress using the MCP,
a weighted sum of the values of each contextual variable was derived, based on the area
of each census tract that was within a participant’s MCP.

7. HBs – Home location and residential neighborhood are the most commonly used
contextual areas in past studies. Each participant’s home location was used to construct
a 1-km HB area for assessment of residential exposure to psychosocial stress. Note that
information about participants’ home location was not available in the dataset due to
the need to protect their geoprivacy and data conﬁdentiality. We inferred home loca-
tions based on the assumption that people tend to spend most of their time at or
around their home location (e.g. sleep time and the time spent on home-based activ-
ities). This was achieved by using the total amount of time participants spent at and
around their GTPs using the time-weighted KDS (which is a raster layer at the spatial
resolution of 100 × 100 m): the location where a participant spent most time is treated
as his/her home location. To assess participants’ exposure to psychosocial stress using
the home location buﬀer, a weighted sum of the values of each contextual variable was
derived, based on the area of each census tract that was within a participant’s home
location buﬀer.

All seven contextual areas described above were implemented to derive measures of
individual exposure to diﬀerent levels of SES (CSI), but only the ﬁrst six were used to
evaluate exposure to crime. This was because the inferred home locations of many
participants were outside Baltimore City, and crime data at the level of census tract were
available only within the city.

4. Analysis and results

4.1. Comparison of the size of diﬀerent contextual areas

We begin our analysis by comparing the size of 5 of the contextual area delineations
described in the last section (Figure 3). The HBs had the same area for all participants
because they were deﬁned as 1-km buﬀer areas, and the GTPs method did not generate

participants. The vertical axis that indicates the size of contextual areas is on a logarithmic scale.

any area. Of the other ﬁve methods, four produced polygons with explicit boundaries
(GTB, SDE1, SDE1, MCP) such that their areas were straightforward to calculate. For KDS
(a continuous surface with diﬀerent density values for diﬀerent cells), the area was
derived using a threshold density value that separates the top quantile from the four
quantiles below it, and cells with values higher than the threshold were considered part
of the contextual area.

The KDSs had sizes similar to the HBs, but with some variation across participants. The
other four contextual areas varied considerably more across participants. MCP tended to
be largest while SDE1 tended to be the smallest. While the sizes of these four contextual
areas were largely diﬀerent from each other, their diﬀerences among the participants
tended to correlate (i.e. a participant with a small SDE1 would also have a small MCP,
and vice versa). It is not surprising that the sizes of the SDE1 and SDE2 were highly
correlated, because they were generated with the same method. However, the correla-
tion between areas of MCP and GTB was somewhat surprising. It may reﬂect the fact that
both methods generated polygons that included all GTPs.

The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to evaluate the diﬀerences in size among
these ﬁve contextual areas. It is a nonparametric equivalent of the paired-sample t-test;
it does not assume normality in the data and thus can be used when this assumption is
violated. Table 1 shows the results: the sizes of the ﬁve contextual areas were signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent from each other. Note that the sizes of these ﬁve contextual areas varied
considerably for some participants but much less for other participants. Participants with
spatially dispersed GPS trajectories tended to have MCPs that were much larger than
other delineations of contextual areas (and thus also tended to have the largest variation
among the ﬁve contextual areas). Conversely, participants with relatively circumscribed
GPS trajectories had smaller and similarly sized contextual areas. This could have
practical implications, because the size of the contextual areas can aﬀect estimates of
exposure (e.g. to crime), as we discuss in the next section.

4.2. Comparison of individual exposure to community SES

The community SES index (CSI) described earlier was used as a surrogate to assess
participants’ exposure to the psychosocial stress presumed to accompany social disor-
der. We used all of the 7 contextual areas to derive 7 CSIs for each of the 47 participants.
As shown in Figure 4, values of CSI in the participants’ activity spaces varied from −23 to

10, where a higher CSI score indicates higher SES, and vice versa. Variation among
participants was largest with the HBs (SD = 6.54) and the GTPs (SD = 4.91), and smallest
with MCP (SD = 1.55) and GTB (SD = 1.52). This is perhaps because delineations other
than the HBs and the GTP are relatively large polygons that cover many census tracts,
attenuating the inﬂuence of extremes.

To explore how values of the CSI varied within participants, we examined variations in
the SD of the CSI in Figure 5. The ﬁgure shows that the CSIs obtained with the seven
contextual areas for three participants (s6, s20 and s42) had very large SDs, while the CSI
for three other participants (s12, s26 and s35) had very small SDs. We further investi-
gated these six participants using geovisualizations, whose results are discussed here
but cannot be shown due to IRB requirements to protect participants’ privacy. All three
participants with large CSI SDs had relatively small activity spaces with fairly even
coverage within those spaces. On the other hand, two out of the three participants
with small CSI SDs had relatively large activity spaces with strong directional trends. As
suggested earlier, larger contextual areas cover many census tracts and the CSI derived
with them tend to vary less.

These results indicate that variation in CSI exposure can vary depending on the
method used to deﬁne contextual areas – not only across participants but also for the
same participant. A Wilcoxon signed rank test (Table 2) indicated that 6 out of 15 pairs of
CSI estimates were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from each other: MCP versus KDS, SDE1 versus
KDS, SDE1 versus MCP, SDE2 versus MCP, GTB versus MCP and GTP versus SDE1. Note
that four of these six pairs involve MCP and three of them involve SDE. Also note that all
of the six pairs involving the HBs were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, which means that the
CSI derived with the HBs were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the CSI assessed using the
other six contextual areas. This result may be due to the fact that the HBs were deﬁned
around the locations where participants spent most of their time, and participants’
home location also ﬁgured prominently in the deﬁnitions of the other contextual
areas. For instance, the GTPs, GPS buﬀers (GTB), SDEs (SDE1 and SDE2) and time-
weighted KDSs tended to be skewed toward the place where participants spent the
most time (i.e. their home location) because this place was heavily weighted in the
data set.

4.3. Comparison of individual exposure to crime

Figure 6 shows estimates of general crime exposures as assessed by six of the contextual
areas (HBs were not included in this analysis because the inferred home locations of
many participants were outside Baltimore City, and crime data at the level of census
tract were available only within the city). Exposures assessed with KDS (SD = 19.43) and
GTP (SD = 26.17) had the largest variations among the 47 participants; exposures
assessed with MCP (SD = 5.88) had the least variation.

Wilcoxon signed rank tests (Table 3) showed that 11 out of the 15 pairs of crime-
exposure estimates were diﬀerent from each other: MCP versus KDS, SDE1 versus KDS,
SDE2 versus KDS, SDE1 versus MCP, SDE2 versus MCP, GTB versus MCP, GTP versus MCP,
GTB versus SDE1, GTP versus SDE1, GTB versus SDE2 and GTP versus SDE2. Exposures for
only four pairs of contextual areas were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent: GTB versus KDS, GTP
versus KDS, GTP versus GTB and SDE2 versus SDE1.

Figure 7 shows the SDs of general crime exposures assessed by the 6 contextual areas
for the 47 participants. Three participants (s4, s6 and s16) had very high SDs; two
participants (s31 and s40) had very low SDs. Geovisualizations did not identify any dis-
tinctive patterns that would help explain these diﬀerences across participants. The diﬀer-
ences may have occurred because crime exposures are highly dependent on the unique
geographic distribution of crime in the study area and the exposure measures obtained are
not heavily inﬂuenced by the spatial conﬁgurations of the participants’ activity spaces. This
in turn may be due to fact that contextual areas other than the GTP and GTB are relatively
large polygons that cover many census tracts, attenuating the inﬂuence of extremes and
thus producing similarly moderate estimates for crime exposure.

4.4. Factor analysis of the associations among the contextual variables

To assess the extent to which contextual variables derived with diﬀerent contextual areas
capture similar or diﬀerent information regarding exposures, their associations were examined

using factor analysis. Three factors were extracted from the six measures, and a varimax
rotation was performed to make these factors more interpretable. These three rotated factors
together explained 89.57% of the total variance for CSI exposures (Table 4) and 87.02% of the
total variance for crime exposures (Table 5). It can be seen from these tables that all six
exposure measures had large communalities, which indicate that a large amount of their
variance has been extracted. Figures 8 and 9 visualize the factor loadings of the six measures
with three-dimensional scatterplots, in which clusters of diﬀerent types of exposure measures
can be easily identiﬁed. As these ﬁgures show, KDS and GTP measures had high loadings (over
0.7) on Factor 1, on which SDE1 also had moderate loadings (over 0.5). Furthermore, SDE1 and

SDE2 both had high loadings (over 0.7) on Factor 2, while MCP and GTB had high loadings
(over 0.7) on Factor 3. As to the factor loadings for crime exposure, similar patterns were found.
KDS and GTP measures had high loadings (over 0.7) on Factor 1, while MCP and GTB had high
loadings (over 0.7) on Factor 2. In addition, only SDE2 had high loadings (over 0.7) on Factor 3,
on which SDE1 also had moderate loadings (over 0.5). Overall, a general pattern can be
identiﬁed: values of exposure measures obtained with KDS and GTP were similar, those
obtained with SDE1 and SDE2 fell into another group and those obtained with MCP and
GTB fell into a third group.

4.5. Regression analyses on CSI and crime estimates as predictors of substance
use behavior

Multivariate linear regression models were used to examine the associations between
the participants’ exposure to psychosocial stress (based on the CSI and crime) and their
substance use behaviors. Multilevel models were not feasible because there was no
obvious spatial clustering in participants’ home location and the number of participants
was small. Further, given that the average GPS tracking period was only 107 days, both
community SES and crime in the study area were assumed to be stable enough not to
require longitudinal analyses.

The dependent variables were two measures of substance use for each participant:
total and standardized. The total substance use score for each participant was the sum
of seven substance use indicators based on urine tests performed three times each week
during the study period. Each indicator reﬂects the presence or absence of ampheta-
mine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, phencyclidine and cannabinoids
(1 for presence and 0 for absence). Because the number of total urine tests diﬀered
among participants, a standardized substance use score for each participant was
obtained by dividing the total score by the number of urine tests. Both substance use
scores were log-transformed to minimize their skewness. The main independent vari-
ables in all regression models were the CSI and crime exposure measured by the seven
contextual areas. There were thus 14 models: 7 used the total substance use score, and 7
used the standardized substance use score. Another 14 models included participants’
income, marital status and employment
demographic characteristics: gender, race,
status. There were no signiﬁcant associations among substance use, contextual expo-
sures and demographic characteristics, and R2 values of the regression models were
uniformly low, ranging from 0.020 to 0.337.

However, the ﬁnding that exposures to CSI and crime were not signiﬁcantly asso-
ciated with substance use behavior does not necessarily mean that these contextual
inﬂuences are unimportant. All participants were substance users admitted for metha-
done maintenance at a research clinic, and there was no control group of nonusers, so it
is possible that participants’ substance use behaviors were inﬂuenced more by the
momentary psychosocial stress they experienced at particular places and times (e.g.
sighting of law enforcement personnel at a particular time and place) than by the
general sociogeographic contexts assessed using their activity spaces (Kwan 2018).

5. Conclusion

This study used a GPS dataset collected from substance users in Baltimore, Maryland, to
explore how estimates of substance users’ exposure to psychosocial stress may be aﬀected
by the contextual areas used to derive the exposure measures. It examined how geographic
context deﬁned and operationalized diﬀerently may lead to diﬀerent exposure estimates
and diﬀerent conclusions about their eﬀects on health, using two variables (a composite
measure of community SES and crime) to assess participants’ exposure to psychosocial
stress. The study sought to shed light on the inconsistencies in previous ﬁndings and
contribute to the nascent literature on the UGCoP in health and GIScience research.

The results indicate that diﬀerent delineations of contextual areas yield diﬀerent
exposure estimates, and this may lead to diﬀerent conclusions. For instance, values of
CSI based on diﬀerent contextual areas varied greatly, and variation among participants
was largest with the HBs and the GTPs, and smallest with MCP and GTB. Six out of 15
pairs of CSI estimates were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. With respect to crime, exposures
assessed with KDS and GTP had the largest variations among the 47 participants, and
exposures assessed with MCP had the least variation. Eleven out of 15 pairs of crime-
exposure estimates were diﬀerent from each other. These results suggest that contex-
tual uncertainty is an important issue when examining the eﬀects of various contextual
factors on substance use behaviors. It has important implications for future research on
the eﬀect of contextual inﬂuences on health behaviors and outcomes: whether a study
observes any signiﬁcant inﬂuence of an environmental factor on health depends on
what contextual units are used to assess individual exposure.

Several areas seem promising for future research. First, as pointed out earlier in this
paper, participants’ substance use behaviors may be inﬂuenced more by the momentary
psychosocial stress they experienced at particular places and times than by the socio-
geographic contexts assessed using their activity spaces (Kwan 2018). This may be an
important basis for momentary interventions. Second, as our ongoing work indicates,
whether a participant used a substance may be inﬂuenced by the sociogeographic
context he/she experienced several hours ago; substance use may be a response to
psychosocial stress with a certain time lag. Future studies should try to examine the
particular temporality of the association between contextual inﬂuences and people’s
substance use behaviors. Lastly, individual response to the same contextual inﬂuences
may be highly idiosyncratic (Kwan 2018). A substance user may feel stressed in places
where nonusers typically feel safe (e.g. areas with high SES, or low-crime areas that are
heavily patrolled by police). Future studies should try to take into account the idiosyn-
cratic responses of individuals to the same contextual inﬂuences.

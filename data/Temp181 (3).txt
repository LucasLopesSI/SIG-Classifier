Abstract. The objective of this work is to develop a dynamic geographical
information system (DGIS) applicable for the simulation of spatio-temporal phen-
omena. DGIS is designed and implemented as a dynamic raster GIS in a fully
integrated systems strategy using theory of modelling and simulation, discrete
event systems speci(cid:142) cations, and knowledge-based simulation methodologies. The
approach accommodates the representations and operators of current GIS in a
broader systems representation scheme that includes the constructs for handling
continuous time, model base, multiple resolution, hierarchy, taxonomy, variable
structure, and intelligent agents. DGIS is de(cid:142) ned as an endomorphic system that
can be transformed by the user into diŒerent, application-speci(cid:142) c, spatial dynamic
simulation environments depending on the models selected to (cid:142) t the various
aspects of its structure. In this paper we describe the theory, methods, and
technologies upon which the system is designed and implemented and discuss
how it can support complex spatial simulations. To probe operational applicabil-
ity, an instance of DGIS is generated: a (cid:142) re spread simulation environment, which
is tested in the simulation of 15 real (cid:142) re events.

Introduction
The application of geographical information systems (GIS) to the simulation of
spatial dynamic processes has been presented in many studies and it is a current
topic of research (Egenhofer and Golledge 1998). However, all commercial GIS
packages represent space and its attributes statically and are designed around a
for time and process.

Consequently, the development of temporally explicit geographical information sys-
tems requires new and more encompassing models of reality that can expand the
representation capabilities to a more complex worldview.

In this context, the work presented here has the following objectives:

1. To propose an approach for the development of dynamic geographical

information systems.

environment.

2. To produce one operational instance of that approach: a (cid:142) re spread simulation

3. To test the validity of (cid:142) re spread simulations against real (cid:142) re events.

We propose applying modelling and simulation theory (Zeigler 1976) and a set
of methods known as knowledge-based simulation (Zeigler 1990) to design a system
structure that supports the synthesis of many diŒerent application-speci(cid:142) c spatial
simulation environments. The applicability of these concepts is illustrated by the
development DGIS based on which a (cid:142) re spread simulation environment is obtained,
applied, and tested in real (cid:142) re situations. The approach includes constructs for
handling time, model base, multiple resolution, hierarchy, taxonomy, variable struc-
ture, and intelligent agents. Even though all of these constructs can be available in
DGIS, the (cid:142) re spread simulation instance generated in this work uses a subset of
the listed constructs: time handling, model base, hierarchy, taxonomy, and variable
structure.

The assumption behind DGIS is that every static spatial location can become a
processor at any instant, and that active processors can also be deactivated at any
instant. This entails that the simulation environment must be capable of supporting
the dynamic transformation of static locations into spatial processors and vice versa,
and that the simulations are performed on a continuous time base.

Central to the development of DGIS is the work presented by Takeyama and
Couclelis (1997), where it is demonstrate d that the attribute layering abstraction
prevailing in GIS is isomorphic to that of a multivariate map, with every location
(geo-unit ) seen as a set of multiple attributes. As illustrated in (cid:142) gure 1, we apply the
interchangeability of the two representations, and use both representations of space
simultaneously. This dual representation integrates spatial data models and spatial
process models (Takeyama and Couclelis 1997 ).

The (cid:142) re spread simulation environment derived from DGIS is tested against real
data on the propagation of a set of 15 forest (cid:142) res. The tests are set up through an
experiment that is designed to study the match of simulated and real (cid:142) re spatial
characteristics after given time intervals. There are two separate goals for the experi-
ment that lead to two diŒerent types of presentation of results and discussion: (1) to
demonstrate the applicability of the concepts, methods, and technologies presented
for the design and development of a dynamic GIS; and (2) to evaluate the reliability
of the (cid:142) re spread predictions. The ability to proceed with the second objective implies
that the (cid:142) rst is also being accomplished.

2. Background
2.1. Modelling of spatial dynamic processes with GIS: (cid:142) re spread
Dynamic modelling with GIS has been a major topic of

interest in several
application (cid:142) elds, especially in landscape ecology, ecology, and natural resource
studies (Green et al. 1989, Costanza et al. 1990, Kelmelis 1993, Vasconcelos et al.
1993, Ball et al. 1996, Wu 1998 ). There has been increasing interest on developing
the ability to model spatially explicit dynamic processes at several diŒerent aggrega-
tion levels, and on deriving the behaviour of higher level complex entities (such as
a landscape or an ecosystem) based on the interaction of many lower-level, individual-
based models (Couclelis 1985, 1989, di Castri and Hadley 1988, Houston et al. 1988,
O’Neill et al. 1989, Pickett et al. 1989, Costanza et al. 1990, Vasconcelos et al. 1993,
Clarke 1994, Burrough 1998, Wu 1998).

Simulations of (cid:142) re spread using geographical information systems have been
presented in many studies (Cohen et al. 1989, Ball and Guertin 1992, Vasconcelos
and Guertin 1992, Clarke et al. 1994, Vasconcelos et al. 1995, Coleman and Sullivan
1996 ). However, the approaches proposed to date have two major drawbacks, which
may be common to other application (cid:142) elds. The (cid:142) rst is the use of a loosely coupled
systems strategy (Goodchild 1992a, Bennett 1997) where the GIS operations and the
model calculations are performed in separate software packages, and the second is
the lack of appropriate testing of simulation reliability.

One of the many reasons for the use of loose coupling in simulations of (cid:142) re
spread is the availability of (cid:142) re behaviour models (McArthur 1967, Rothermel 1972,
Noble et al. 1980), some of which can be obtained as ready-to-run software (Andrews
1986, Finney and Ryan 1995 ). Most of these models estimate rate of spread and
other (cid:142) re characteristics, given input values for fuel, weather, and topography of a
homogeneous parcel of land.

In this work we use Rothermel’s (cid:142) re behaviour model (Rothermel 1972, 1983)
and some extensions available in the BEHAVE program (Andrews 1986 ). The
variables used in this model are obtainable by mathematical expressions that depend
on terrain, fuel, and weather, all of which can be represented as maps in a GIS.
Given that calculations with Rothermel’s model have been validated for homogen-
eous conditions (Sneeuwjagt and Frandsen 1977, Wilgen et al. 1985) and our assump-
tion of attribute homogeneity within each spatial unit represented in DGIS, we can
consider that the values of (cid:142) re rate of spread calculated in each unit are valid. Thus,
in our experiment we only test the accuracy of the (cid:142) re growth simulations.

The accuracy of simulations performed in heterogeneous landscapes has been
weakly tested, with most tests using a single (cid:142) re event (Vasconcelos and Guertin
1992, Coleman and Sullivan 1996). Testing (cid:142) re simulations is a di(cid:141) cult endeavour
owing to the cost of both the simulation runs and the acquisition of data for

validation. In our work we overcome the (cid:142) rst problem; however the collection of
data for testing has been a very time-consuming process and this is the reason why
our testing sample is composed of only 15 (cid:142) re events.

2.2. Requirements of spatio-tempora l information systems

There is already a considerable body of work where the desirable characteristics
of truly spatio-tempora l systems are discussed and the possible avenues for develop-
ment are pointed (Goodchild 1992a, Burrough and Frank 1995, Vasconcelos et al.
1995, Bennett 1997, Takeyama and Couclelis 1997, Burrough 1998, Egenhofer and
Colledge 1998, Wu 1998). As supported by several authors (e.g. Bennett 1997,
Burrough 1998), data models for dynamic geographical systems should be thought
of as a triplet comprising state, process, and relation or (cid:143) ow. Additionally, such
systems should integrate enabling technologies, namely objects, agents, and model-
base management (Bennett 1997).

Burrough (1998) focuses on process distribution over space and addresses a vast
body of work on computation that has been covered by researchers working on
partial diŒerential equations, (cid:142) nite state machines, cellular automata and their exten-
sions. Of these, we highlight the work by Couclelis (1985, 1989) who was the (cid:142) rst
to suggest that Zeigler’s theory of modelling and simulation (Zeigler 1976) could
anchor the future development of spatial dynamic modelling environments.

Smyth (1998) considers, as we do, that the incorporation of time and process in
GIS is a geographical modelling problem that must be formally addressed. The idea
is that a complete GIS modelling framework should be able to accommodate the
many representations and levels of abstraction possible that correspond to diŒerent
models of reality depending on the particular ontology under which they are con-
ceived. A modelled world under a particular ontology is a microworld (Davis 1990)
of the real world with its associated smallness in content and detail. By using this
microworld concept in his idealized framework, Smyth (1998) is reproducing, in the
geographical modelling context, the concepts of base model,
lumped model, and
experimental f rame of the general theory of modelling and simulation (Zeigler 1976,
1984, 1990).

Burrough and Frank (1995) discuss how there is no single approach to spatial
data handling that is su(cid:141) ciently generic for all possible applications. In the same
line, Smyth (1998 ) argues that the entity view and the continuous (cid:142) eld view are not
easily integrated and that it is di(cid:141) cult to separate the logic of a continuous (cid:142) eld-
based microworld from its physics. We hope to illustrate that the entity view and
the continuous view of the world can be integrated within the same system, and that
by applying the representational constructs used in DEVS (see below) for specifying
distributed autonomous systems (Zeigler 1990) we meet all the requirements men-
tioned above. We must clarify, however, that we only address the case of closed
models (Smyth 1998 ).

2.3. DEVS

The approach proposed with the development of DGIS is called Knowledge-
Based Simulation (Zeigler 1990 ). It is based on the speci(cid:142) cation of modular, hierarch-
ical, and object-oriented discrete event systems (Zeigler 1976, 1990 ), and it integrates
arti(cid:142) cial intelligence knowledge representation schemes in a framework called DEVS
(Zeigler 1990). DEVS knowledge representation scheme, the system entity structure
(SES), is hierarchical and combines decomposition, coupling, and taxonomy (Zeigler

73

1990 ). The entities in the SES refer to conceptual components of reality for which
models may reside in a model base. A SES represents a family of models; the synthesis
of a particular hierarchical model, expressed in a composition tree, is obtained by
pruning the SES to represent a given situation.

Pruning is the process by which modular models available in the model base
are chosen and coupled according to the scheme provided by the SES. Each particular
choice of models results in a speci(cid:142) c coupled-model, which is an instance of those
many possible with that SES. In our work we have a system entity structure that
represents a family of models: spatial models (to which spatial dynamic models
belong ).

The most basic models from which all others are built by coupling are called
atomic models. Atomic models are speci(cid:142) ed in a dynamic discrete event formalism
(Zeigler 1976); since DEVS models have closure under coupling (Zeigler 1984, 1990)
all models created by coupling of atomic models also are discrete event models.

A new form of coupled models is based on the concept of Dynamic Structure
Network (Barros 1997). These network models have the ability to change their own
structure during a simulation run, and this capability allows having on memory only
those parts of the models that are currently in use, thus supporting the representation
of larger models.

Atomic models are stand-alone modular objects that are de(cid:142) ned as an 8-tuple

of the form (Zeigler 1990):

M 5

(X,S,q0 ,Y,t,dext,dint ,l )

(1)

X is the input set, S is the sequential state set, q0 is the initial state, Y is the output
is the external transition function that
set, t is the time advance function, dext
computes the next state and transition time when external events arrive, dint is the
internal transition function that computes the next state and time of transition when
no messages arrive in input ports, l is the output function that generates an output
just before an internal transition takes place.

Two state variables are usually present: phase and sigma. In the absence of
external events the model remains in the current phase for the time given by sigma.
The discrete event formalism focuses on changes of variable values and generates
time segments that are piecewise constant. When an external event, such as ignition
of (cid:142) re, occurs the external transition function places the system in a new phase and
sigma thus scheduling the next internal transition. The next state is computed on
the basis of the present state, the input port and value, and the time elapsed in the
current state.

A DEVS model works as a timed state machine, so that the state of the system
is changed by external or internal events with elapsed time. Discrete event models
use a continuous state and a continuous time axis and diŒer from continuous models
because only a (cid:142) nite number of state changes may occur within a (cid:142) nite time interval,
depending on instantaneous events (Cho and Cho 1997).

Dynamic Structure Networks are de(cid:142) ned by the 4-tuple (Barros 1998)

where N is the network name, XN is the set of network input values, Y N is the set
of network output values, g is the name of the dynamic network executive, Mg is
the model of the executive g.

is set of components in(cid:143) uencers of i, for all i × Dj n {g}, Zi,j is the input function of
component i, ZN,j is the output function of the network N.

The network structure is controlled by the executive, and can be changed when-
ever the executive changes its sequential state. These changes include the set of
components, represented by set {Mi,j}, and the interconnections among components
represented by sets {Ii,j} and {Zi,j}. The application of various forms of dynamic
structure networks to the simulation of forest (cid:142) res can be found in Barros and Ball
(1998) and Vasconcelos et al. (1995 ).

One more concept used in our approach is that of endomorphism (Zeigler 1990 ):
there are several diŒerent representations of space and its attributes embedded in
the system, which are related to each other by abstraction. One of these models is
external to the simulation processes and represents the real spatial area of concern
( layer mode representation) on which the dynamic component operates. The others
are internal to the dynamic component and are employed in the simulations.

3. Conceptualization of DGIS

DGIS is a dynamic geographical information system that supports the construc-
tion of application-speci(cid:142) c spatial simulation environments. It is designed such that
there is a variable set of spatial units, which can be (cid:142) lled with instances of the
dynamic modular models stored in a model base. The modular models must be
speci(cid:142) ed in DEVS formalism and instantiated to (cid:142) ll particular spatial and temporal
positions. The number of instances and their spatial distribution varies during the
simulations, which are driven by the ensemble of active units formalized in a dynamic
structure network.

The basic idea behind DGIS is that space is conceived as a set of spatially static
potential automata exhaustively covering space. This set is de(cid:142) ned as a variable but
(cid:142) nite network of distributed discrete event systems functioning in an emulation of
parallel processing. The units of the network have a correspondence to the representa-
tions available in GIS: cells or vector objects, which are pairs of locations and
associated values and can be denominated geo-units (Goodchild 1992b, Takeyama
and Couclelis 1997).

Owing to the discrete event nature of the systems speci(cid:142) cation used, starting a
simulation does not require the de(cid:142) nition of time steps, nor does it entail that all
locations are de(cid:142) ned as automata with synchronized, mandatory state transitions
(as occur in cellular automata speci(cid:142) cations). Only locations directly addressed
during the simulation are active, and state transitions occur on an individual basis
at uneven, previously unde(cid:142) ned points in time. The progression through space of a
phenomenon or entity can be represented by the diŒerent states the active geo-units
take at varying instants in time.

75

DGIS is a modular system with the following main characteristics:

The representations of space, attributes, and time are independent from the
speci(cid:142) c models to be used in the simulations.
Space can be simultaneously represented in two diŒerent and interchangeabl e
manners: as a set of attribute layers and as a set of geo-units with multiple
attributes.
The geo-unit space representation is used exclusively for the simulations. If
there are no processes being modelled, and only spatial operations are needed,
then the traditional GIS layer operation mode is kept.
The instances of the models used in the simulations drive the advance of time.
The model/time-induced changes in the attributes of geo-units are accounted
for, managed, and represented in the layer mode through another module, the
controller, which is an executive that keeps an updated internal representation
of geo-units.
The dynamic models reside in a model base and are instantiated for activating
the geo-units, which become distributed processors in the simulations.
The geo-units can incorporate any instance of the models in the model base
because the models are de(cid:142) ned in a modular discrete event systems formalism
for which the geo-units are a template.
The attributes in the map layers are descriptive variables of the instance models
incorporated by the active geo-units (processors) and can be used as state
variables upon activation.

In our work the geo-units representation of space is conceived as a (cid:142) xed grid of
cells. The topological invariance of this spatial representation facilitates the spatial
referencing of every geo-unit. However, this is a simpli(cid:142) cation for prototype imple-
mentation. As described above, the system is conceived to work with locations and
is thus independent of form, size, and spatial referencing mode of the implementation.
At this stage, DGIS uses vector maps only in the layer representation mode.

Figure 2 is a schematic representation of the structure of the system, which
comprises three modules. The module Interface is external to the systems speci(cid:142) cation
used for constructing DGIS. The two modules: MAP-Layers and MAP-Dynamic,
are the two components of DGIS speci(cid:142) ed in DEVS formalism. The key piece is the
Controller, which coordinates message passing between all components of the system.
If the user requests exclusively spatial data calculations and manipulations, the
Controller is passive and sends the messages received from the user to MAP-Layers
keeping the geo-units representation inactive. In this case the system looks like a
standard GIS. If a simulation is started, then the dynamic structure network
(Controller /Geo-units) is activated, and updates (model or user driven) of the data-
base layers are all mediated by the Controller. The neighbourhood shape of each
geo-unit can be (cid:142) xed at the beginning of the simulation or it can be a part of the
information content of the (cid:143) owing messages.

4.1. T he system entity structure and composition tree

The system entity structure used is shown in (cid:142) gure 3(a). DGIS is a coupled model
with two modular components: MAP-Layers and MAP-Dynamic. MAP-Layers is
the module that includes the spatial database as a set of attribute layers both in

Map—Layers, Map—Dynamic, and Interface. Interface is external to the systems

cellular and in vector format, in a standard GIS representation of space. MAP-
Dynamic is a dynamic structure network with two types of components: the
Controller, an atomic model acting as the network executive, and an indeterminate
number of similar entities called Geo-unit, represented in the network MAP-
Geounits.

In this study we transform the SES into the composition tree shown in (cid:142) gure 3(b).
The (cid:142) re simulation environment is generated by coupling the atomic models MAP-
Layers, CONTROLLER, and FIRE (which are the models available in the model
base—see Appendix 1) according to the SES. This process generates MAP-Dynamic
as a speci(cid:142) c instance of the dynamic structure networks possible with this SES, by
specifying that each newly created Geo-unit is transformed into a Geo-FIREunit.
Consequently, the spatio-tempora l structure of a dynamic GIS is in place, and
generating a simulation environment for a particular phenomenon requires just one
step: the selection and activation of the speci(cid:142) c discrete-event model each Geo-unit
must embody.

When the user, through input of an ignition location and respective time (external
event) starts a simulation, the Controller goes through a state transition from passive
to active, and one Geo-FIREunit is activated. The latter goes through a transient
state and sends a message to the Controller with its calculated time-to-burn. Then
the Geo-FIREunit goes through an internal transition and phase is set to burning
and sigma to time-to-burn. Time-to-burn is calculated using Rothermel’s (cid:142) re spread
model and variable values that correspond to the spatial attributes of the speci(cid:142) c
cell location and to the weather conditions of the present time.

Once time-to-burn has elapsed, the (cid:142) re can spread to neighbouring locations and
the active Geo-FIREunit becomes inactive. The controller knows that that speci(cid:142) c
active Geo-FIREunit has become inactive from its own internal representation of
the processing units and it is responsible for its elimination and for the creation of

(a) The system entity structure (SES) for DGIS. The denomination ‘dec’ stands for
‘decomposition’ and ‘spec’ for ‘specialization’. DGIS is composed of two entities MAP-
Dynamic and MAP-Layers. MAP-Layers is the module that includes the spatial data
base as a set of attribute layers. MAP-Dynamic is a dynamic structure network with
two components, the Controller and MAP-Geounits. The Controller is an executive
and MAP-Geounits is the Geo-units set with an undetermined number of elements
represented by the three vertical lines. MAP-Layers and MAP-Dynamic are two
representations of the same spatial reality. Geo-units are created and eliminated only
when simulations take place, each with an identity that depends on the location it
represents, and embodying an instance of a given model. The choice of models is given
by those present in the model base (FIRE, FLOOD, WALK...). (b) The generic SES

cell computes its respective time-to-burn, which varies from cell to cell and depends
on the direction of maximum spread (calculated in the (cid:142) re behaviour model) and
on the direction of contagion (see Vasconcelos et al. 1995 ). Therefore, in a running
simulation, there is a variable set of geo-referenced active processors corresponding
to the burning cells, which have asynchronous state transitions and a local internal
clock, synchronized with a global simulation clock.

4.2. Software characteristics

DGIS is a Windows-based dynamic GIS developed in a fully integrated systems
strategy (Goodchild 1992a, Bennett 1997 ) using C1
. The particular composition
tree of DGIS we apply in this study is named Geofogo, and its Graphical User
Interface (GUI) was developed using Object Pascal. Geofogo is designed for
simulation of forest (cid:142) re spread and for prediction of potential (cid:142) re behaviour.

The GUI is adapted to the particular case of (cid:142) re growth simulation. It uses drop-
down menus and pop-up windows, which are triggered both by the user and by the
running simulations. There is a spatial toolbox, and a temporal toolbox. The spatial
toolbox is similar to those found in many GISs. The temporal toolbox includes a
simulation clock, and operations to introduce start time, next run interval, and/or
total run time, and/or end time, a run button, a stop button, and a continue button.
Spatial operations require that the simulation be stopped. However, once they are
(cid:142) nished the simulations can continue with the updated spatial data.

Weather data are input in tabular mode with each record also holding a (cid:142) eld
with time. This (cid:142) eld indicates the instant on which the respective weather conditions
are to be used in the simulations. The conditions prevail until the time of the next
weather record matches the simulation clock or the user introduces a new weather
record with the clock stopped and then clicks the ‘continue’ button.

The system continuously provides the user with information related to the simu-
lated (cid:142) res. There is information obtainable during the simulations and information
that is only available when the simulations are (cid:142) nished. The progression of (cid:142) res
through space is continuously displayed to the user in a movie-like mode and the
clock runs on a continuous time base. The backdrop map can be changed at any
time and there is no limit to the number of vector maps that can be overlaid on the
running simulation.

Since all objects in the spatial database (maps, cells, and records in tables) can
have time as an attribute, it is possible for the user to determine at what instant each
existent database object has been created. However, given that the simulations are
performed on a continuous time base, it is impossible to save all the simulated sates
of the system. Consequently, the user must specify at what instants should the
database be appended with new time-indexed information. Even if no such inst-
ants are speci(cid:142) ed, the user can always recreate all previous states of the system by
re-running the simulations to a desired point in time.

5. Application of Geofogo
5.1. Experiment design and data collection

As a basic step for the application of Geofogo we evaluate the implementation
of Rothermel’s (cid:142) re model under completely controlled conditions of fuel, weather,
and topography (see Vasconcelos 1993 for details on procedures) . Then, we evaluate

the reliability of the (cid:142) re-spread predictions by performing several comparisons
between real (cid:142) res and simulated (cid:142) res.

Our experimental scheme is stepwise and is shown in table 1. The reason for this
stepwise approach is that we need to evaluate what are the conditions under which
the simulations can be used. In fact, for (cid:142) re management and pressupression planning,
where ‘what-if ’ scenarios are analysed, there is no need for the same type of accuracy
as for real-time (cid:142) re (cid:142) ghting. Furthermore, in the latter case, it can be useful to know
ahead of time what are the most likely (cid:142) re spread paths, even if the predicted forms
are not exactly reproduced.

Formal comparisons are performed for steps 2, 3, and 4. Step 1 has been visually
evaluated and step 5 was discarded from the analysis owing to lack of data. The
constant presence of smoke during the (cid:142) res and the topographic conditions of the
study area made it almost impossible to register the correct (cid:142) re front positions and
associated times on 1:25 000 topographic maps.

To assess the accuracy of (cid:142) re area and shape simulations, we performed a t test
on the pairwise values of total area burned and of the shape indices listed in table 1.
To assess the coincidence of (cid:142) re shape locations we built contingency tables for each
case with percentage correspondence of predicted burned cells versus really burned
cells and with calculation of omission and commission errors.

The study area selected for this study area corresponds to 22 municipalities in
central Portugal. For this area, a geographic digital database was built using 1:25 000
topographic maps, in a Gauss-Kruge r projection. The cartographic database includes
raster and vector maps of various themes and scales, and contains all the terrain
and cover variables that are necessary for the calculations of (cid:142) re rate of spread
(slope, aspect, and fuel). The spatial resolution of the raster database is 25 m. The
choice of grid size was made based on the scale of those maps with the lowest spatial
resolution: 1: 25 000.

Fuel maps are described in terms of fuel models (Anderson 1982). A fuel model
corresponds to a (cid:142) xed set of parameters, describing the structure and heat content

due to lack of data; the progression of simulated (cid:142) res was inspected visually and
informally compared with reality.

of each vegetation patch, which is used in the calculations of (cid:142) re rate of spread.
There are 13 standard fuel models developed for the vegetation types of the USA.
Since there are no fuel models speci(cid:142) cally developed for the Mediterranean-type
vegetation present in central Portugal, we used the correspondences to the standard
fuel models reported by ICONA (no date) for ecologically similar regions in Spain.
To create the fuel model maps we used 1:10 000 false colour aerial photography from
1995 and (cid:142) eld checking.

During two (cid:142) re seasons (1996 and 1997), (cid:142) eld teams collected data on (cid:142) re events.
For each sampled (cid:142) re we recorded the varying meteorological conditions during the
(cid:142) re (10-minute interval measurements of wind speed and direction, relative humidity,
and temperature), and the (cid:142) re spatial characteristics with a global positioning system
(GPS): ignition location, (cid:142) re perimeter, and when possible sequences of (cid:142) re front
positions. The data were later compiled and digitized for use in Geofogo and for the
comparisons of simulations with reality. Of the (cid:142) res monitored in the (cid:142) eld, 15 have
enough data to be used in the comparisons.

5.2. Simulations

There are several aspects in the occurrence of forest (cid:142) res and in the respective
simulations that have to be confronted so that the limitations of the described
experiment are clear:

(a) To perform the simulations we use the ignition locations and the approximate
times of ignition reported in the Forest Service records. When this information
is not available we use parts of large (cid:142) res for which we have collected one
or more (cid:142) re front positions with associated time.

(b) The calculations performed with Rothermel’s model predict (cid:142) re spread under
natural conditions and do not account for the reductions of (cid:142) re rate of spread
resulting from (cid:142) re (cid:142) ghting actions. Consequently, this model does not predict
the end of a (cid:142) re, unless it results from natural combinations of weather and
fuel that prevent burning form occurring. This implies that the user stops the
simulations at the containment time reported in the Forest Service records.
The exact instant for the extinction of a forest (cid:142) re is di(cid:141) cult to establish.
There are many procedures associated with the containment and extinction
of (cid:142) res, during which the (cid:142) re is still burning at low indeterminate rates. The
duration of these procedures is variable and is not accurately registered by
the (cid:142) re (cid:142) ghting personnel.

(c) There are real burned areas (mapped two or three days after the (cid:142) re with
a GPS) that include re-ignition and re-(cid:142) ghting situations after the (cid:142) res
are considered extinct. These episodes are usually of short duration, but
correspond to unknown intervals of time and weather conditions.

Keeping the above-mentione d limitations in mind, and considering that part of
those sources of error may be absorbed by the resolution (25 m) of the spatial
database, we set up the simulations by indicating the weather tables, and an ignition
point, line, or area and ignition date and time. Then, the simulation clock is started
and the spreading (cid:142) re is continuously shown on the screen along with the running
time, and the corresponding weather conditions. The simulations can be stopped
and re-initiated to update the fuel maps and/or change the map-layer on which the
(cid:142) re is displayed. Vector layers (e.g. with the location of roads) can be overlaid at
any point.

6. Results and discussion

Geofogo has been applied operationally to the simulation of forest (cid:142) res. Besides
the common di(cid:141) culties and iterations in obtaining a good graphical user interface,
there were no di(cid:141) culties with the simulations for which the appropriate data were
in place. The simulations are shown on screen with continuous motion of the (cid:142) re
fronts along with a continuous clock that reports time exclusively at event moments
(e.g. ignition of new cells).

6.1. T he Experiment

Figure 4 and table 2 summarize the results of the experiment. Some (cid:142) res are very
small (see table 2) and thus the 25 m resolution grid structure of the spatial database
becomes evident in the illustration. These (cid:142) res appear to have a diŒerent scale of
analysis. However, this is just the result of the need of magni(cid:142) cation for illustration
purposes, since all (cid:142) res were simulated using the same spatial database and scale.
The comparison of real (cid:142) re paths and burned areas (thin line) with those of the
respective simulations (grey area) shows an encouraging level of agreement. Of the
15 (cid:142) res used in this study, 11 reach step 4 of our experimental scheme.

With the exception of three cases discussed below, all the most signi(cid:142) cant diŒer-
ences in coincidence (>40%) can be explained by the (cid:142) re(cid:142) ghting activities. In fact,
those diŒerences correspond mostly to commission errors (areas that are predicted
to burn and do not burn in reality), with omission errors comparatively low.
Commission errors are generally associated with the progression in the simulation
of speci(cid:142) c (cid:142) re perimeter sections that do not burn in reality because they have been
fought (for example, the (cid:142) res of Sobral-10, and Fagilde-8). In these cases (cid:142) re shapes
are poorly predicted but the coincidence of the simulated progression in the other
perimeter sections is quite acceptable.

There are several cases where simulations are performed for parts of a (cid:142) re. This
is the case of Vila Mendo-3 where even though the (cid:142) re burned for two days, the
simulations correspond to two periods of those days for which there are meteorolo-
gical data available. Thus the (cid:142) nal simulated area is smaller than the actual burnt
area.

The analysis of shapes, shown in table 2, reveals that for those 11 (cid:142) res that
reached step 4 of our experimental scheme, the values of the indices for the real and
simulated sample are very comparable. However, we conclude that the shape indices
we used are probably not the best for this study because of situations such as that
of the Nesperido-6 (cid:142) re. This simulation is one of those that better matches the
sequences of real (cid:142) re paths, with complex inversions in direction correctly reproduced.
Additionally, the (cid:142) nal shapes of the simulated and real (cid:142) res are very similar (see
(cid:142) gure 4). Nevertheless, the values of the shape indices for simulation and reality are
signi(cid:142) cantly diŒerent.

Of the four cases that did not reach level 4, two correspond to simulations that
are completely diŒerent from reality (Encostas de Sa´-12 and Sra da Ouvida-4). The
Cujo´ -9 (cid:142) re corresponds to a simulation that shows coincident directions of spread
but presents substantial omission errors, and the Fagilde-8 (cid:142) re shows a good corres-
pondence between simulation and reality on all (cid:143) anks but one. The latter corresponds
to a (cid:142) re line that was strongly fought and stopped with heavy equipment in reality,
but spreads rapidly in the simulation.

The analysis of the two cases with no correspondence between reality and
simulation provides good insight over some of the issues that must be addressed in

cells that burned out during the simulation. The dark grey cells in the perimeter of
the burned area correspond to cells with (cid:142) re activity at the end of the simulation time.

future studies of this kind. It is worthwhile noting that in both cases, as in the Cujo´-9
(cid:142) re, the real (cid:142) re spreads on a single slope on the leeside of a mountain. In fact, the
wind adjustments used in Geofogo are not prepared to deal with the eddy eŒects
present in these situations. These eŒects can invert the direction of the wind promo-
ting the presence of upslope winds at (cid:143) ame height that push the (cid:142) re in the opposite
direction to the winds aloft (Pyne et al. 1996). This problem is particularly important
because there are situations where the meteorological measurements where taken at
some distance from the (cid:142) re. Three of the four mentioned cases where the simulations
do not correctly reproduce reality are in this situation: they occurred on one slope
on the leeside of the mountain and have no local meteorological measurements
(measurements were taken at the nearest meteorological station). To illustrate how
the weak modelling of the topographic eŒects on wind direction may be the reason
for the simulation errors, we show the results of a simulation performed with a
reversed wind direction for the case of Encostas de Sa´ in (cid:142) gure 4 (12a) and table 2.
The results of pairwise t tests (a 5 0.05) applied in the (cid:142) re samples (including the
15 sampled cases) indicate that we can accept that the real (cid:142) res and the simulated
(cid:142) res are not signi(cid:142) cantly diŒerent for items: area burned, orientation, and elongation.
We believe these results are encouraging for we tried to model an extremely complex
phenomenon. The propagation of forest (cid:142) res is controlled by the interaction of a
vast set of variables that are di(cid:141) cult to quantify and represent spatially. We should
keep in mind that the possible sources of error are manifold (data collection, digital
map representation of the variables, (cid:142) re spread model, and simulation process) and
that the errors associated exclusively with the simulation process cannot be isolated
here. Given this, it would be unrealistic to expect exact matches between real and
simulated (cid:142) res.

6.2. T he system

This study illustrated how diŒusion through space can be represented and simu-
lated within a dynamic GIS. Since the homomorphism between discrete event repres-
entations and diŒerential equation representations has been demonstrate d (Zeigler
et al. 2000) we can state that all spatial dynamic processes represented in the form
of systems of diŒerential equations can potentially be simulated with DGIS.
Additionally, as proven by Zeigler (1976) and discussed by Couclelis (1985, 1989 ),
the implementation of distributed discrete event automata is a substantial extension
of
the widespread cellular automata formalizations. Consequently, all cellular
automata implementations can also be represented and simulated in this system.

The (cid:142) re example shown used 10-minute tabular weather data, with each record
applied to the entire (cid:142) re area at the appropriate time. However, if available, spatially
distributed weather data can be easily applied by having time-stamped weather map
layers that are used by the active geo-units in the same way the other local attributes
are. As shown, the ability to distribute calculations both in space and time, in an
emulation of parallel processing, is important because it allows the simulation of
complex spatial phenomena that require very large spatial data sets, in low-end
computers. This may be a step towards achieving the desired goal: operational
dynamic geographical information systems.

It is important to note that not all constructs available in the proposed approach
were employed in our (cid:142) re example. In fact, a (cid:142) xed dimension grid was used to
represent space, only one type of atomic model was used to (cid:142) ll the active locations

in the simulations, and intelligent agents were not applied (even though endo-
morphism, which is an attribute of intelligent systems, was employed ). Realistic
applications that could take advantage of all the constructs available would also
require a set of validated process models and compatible cartographic and tabular
databases. Since this is not easily obtained, further testing of DGIS may require
several applications, each using a diŒerent subset of the mentioned constructs.

The use of a SES to represent a family of models that can be unfolded to represent
many diŒerent speci(cid:142) c models is not new in simulation. However, it has not been
commonly used in the geographical modelling context. The SES can meet the need
of representing diŒerent abstractions of the same spatial reality within the same
system (Zeigler and Moon 1997 ) and can support the attachment of diŒerent user
interfaces depending on the abstraction used for a particular application. For
example, in our case study we had a model for FIRE in the model base. However,
if other models existed, and as long as the coupling schemes were preserved, we
could have used them in diŒerent composition trees that would support diŒerent
simulations of the same (cid:142) res. These other models could correspond to lumped FIRE
models applicable with coarser map or weather data. In the same line of reasoning
we can have more elaborate SESs that include more than one dynamic structure
network, thus supporting simultaneous simulations of the same phenomenon at
diŒerent resolutions.

The above concepts can be taken further. There may be diŒerent abstractions of
MAP-Dynamic formalized as DEVS models in the model base that upon pruning
result in a diŒerent modelling environment. For example, Geo-units could correspond
to a vector representation in MAP-Layers. With this spatial representation the
de(cid:142) nition, interaction, creation, and elimination of Geo-units during the running
simulations obeys a more elaborate spatial referencing code and must include addi-
tional procedures for handling topology. However, the temporal functioning of the
system relies on the exact same constructs as in the raster mode, with the controller
processing and using a constantly updated internal representation of MAP-Geounits.

7. Conclusions and future developments

By showing an operational application to the simulation of forest (cid:142) res, we have
demonstrate d that the concepts and methods used in the development of DGIS are
usable for creating a spatio-tempora l modelling environment in GIS. DGIS can be
directly used to simulate other processes of the same type with one single requirement:
that new DEVS models are included in the model base. Once these models are
available, the geo-units can incorporate them to drive the simulations.

We performed a GIS-based simulation of a landscape level phenomenon relying
on the behaviour and interaction of many lower level entities that can simultaneously
process their respective local
information. Moreover, the simulations run on a
continuous time base (there are no prede(cid:142) ned time steps) and are performed using
a low-end platform.

The operational application of DGIS illustrates that the inclusion of a temporal
dimension in GIS does not require that the currently used spatial data formats be
dropped. By contrast, we incorporate those formats in a compatible real worldview
that corresponds to a formal, physically based theory of modelling and simulation
and to a set of proven knowledge representation schemes. The framework proposed
uses endomorphs and embedded modelling and permits the realization of many

diŒerent microworlds of the real world based on the same main structure, which is
convertible to diŒerent compositions of modular models.

Further development of the (cid:142) re simulation environment generated with DGIS is
mainly dependent on knowledge of the processes associated with the spread and
containment of forest (cid:142) res. If those processes can be described by rules, functions,
or other relation types, they can be encoded in atomic models and made available
to DGIS through its model base. Nevertheless the (cid:142) re simulation environments now
obtainable from DGIS, with continuous monitoring of (cid:142) re progression through time
and space, may be used as surrogate laboratories for fuel and forest management
and for producing projections that support decisions on allocation of resources in
large (cid:142) re events. Additionally, DGIS can serve to test and monitor the performance
of diŒerent (cid:142) re spread models encoded in DEVS formalism.

Finally we would like to point out that a system such as DGIS can be developed
within existing commercial GIS packages, some of which already have the tools for
automatic generation of special purpose graphical user interfaces. The incorporation
of the simulation capabilities presented here does not need to imply a computing
overhead for the standard user, because the system would work exactly as a common
GIS for those applications that do not require the more sophisticated simulation
capabilities.

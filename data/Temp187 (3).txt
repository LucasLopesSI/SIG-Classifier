Abstract. This paper presents an approach to capturing and representing the
uncertainty inherent in any attempt to classify continuously varying geographical
phenomena into discrete categories. This uncertainty is captured during a visual
photo-interpretation and a computerised image classi(cid:142) cation process and encoded
as a series of fuzzy surfaces. These store the fuzzy membership values (FMVs) of
each location to all candidate classes in a desired classi(cid:142) cation scheme. These
surfaces are used to explore graphically the underlying variations in the level of
certainty of assigning candidate classes to individual locations. A technique is
presented that analyses these FMV surfaces by applying alpha-cuts (thresholds)
to derive a series of traditional categorical maps in the form of vector polygons.
The relative certainty of the attribute classi(cid:142) cation is used to determine an
appropriate Epsilon band width around boundary lines separating diŒerent land
cover classes on the resulting categorical map. The approach is tested on the
practical problem of producing categorical maps of land cover for a suburban
area. Uncertainty surfaces are derived for land cover classi(cid:142) cations created both
from photogrammetric interpretation and from satellite image classi(cid:142) cation. A
series of categorical maps of land cover are derived for diŒerent minimum levels
of certainty in the attribute classi(cid:142) cation.

Introduction
Categorical maps are a traditional means for presenting information within GIS,
which depict spatial distributions in the form of exhaustive, non-overlappin g areal
units separated by boundary lines. Most conventional categorical mapping assumes
an object-based view of reality, where real world entities are represented by a set of
discrete point, line and areal objects (Goodchild 1989). An object-based model is
suitable for spatial entities whose boundaries are well de(cid:142) ned and for which attributes
are exactly valued (NCDCDS 1988). Land parcel data is a good example, where
attributes for individual parcels such as ownership, land price and tax liability can

be exactly evaluated and boundary lines can be measured to high precision. Unless
a gross error of attribution occurs, the attributes for each polygon may be considered
to be correct and the main component of error in such a map arises from positional
errors in measuring and encoding the boundary. Workers including Drummond
(1995), Goodchild and Hunter (1997) and Zhang and Kirby (2000) have proposed
various mathematical simulation methods that model the probable error in the
location of vector boundary lines in situations where this is the main component
of error.

When mapping more natural features of the environment such as land cover or
land use however, one cannot assume the features have been identi(cid:142) ed and classi(cid:142) ed
without attribute error. In many cases it is probable that the uncertainty in valuing
the attribute at a location is a greater source of error than the positioning errors
that arise from data acquisition and geo-processing (Chrisman, 1982, 1989; Goodchild
et al. 1992; Guptill and Morrison 1996). This leads to the observation that it is the
uncertainty in classifying the continuous nature of many environmental conditions
into discrete areas that mainly determines the accuracy with which boundary lines
are placed on categorical maps of these conditions.

Although this suggests that uncertainty in the boundary positioning and uncer-
tainty in attribute classi(cid:142) cation are interlinked, the majority of previous research
has dealt with these components of error separately. A particular error model known
as the Epsilon Band model is often used to represent positional errors in boundaries
and this has been applied to many types of categorical maps. The epsilon band
model was initially proposed by Perkal (1956) and has been adapted and extended
by many authors including Chrisman (1982 ), Blakemore (1984), Drummond (1987)
and Dunn et al. (1990 ). Tests for attribute accuracy, on the other hand, are more
usually made from an error matrix (sometimes called a confusion matrix), which is
constructed by comparisons between the test data and reference data of assumed
higher accuracy. From the error matrix, it is possible to derive several measures of
classi(cid:142) cation accuracy such as the overall classi(cid:142) cation accuracy and the Kappa
coe(cid:141) cient of agreement (Congalton 1991).

Aspinall and Pearson (1994) investigated the link between boundary uncertainty
and class uncertainty, in an empirically based study of boundaries in land cover
maps produced from aerial photographs of rural Scotland. Acknowledging that
transition zones vary in width for diŒerent combinations of land cover types, they
used the expert knowledge of photo-interpreter s to estimate epsilon bandwidths
between diŒerent combinations of land cover types. Edwards and Lowell (1996) have
proposed that one may estimate boundary uncertainty in categorical maps using a
fuzzy method. They endeavoured to derive a quantitative model of the width of the
epsilon error band for each individual boundary line separating adjacent areal units,
illustrating this with a simulated data set. Their method relies on multiple interpreta-
tions of the same imagery to obtain empirical estimates of the width of transition
zones. Whilst acceptable as a theoretical means to derive estimates of interpreter
uncertainty, repeated interpretation of imagery is unlikely to be a practical option.
Kiiveri (1997) presents one of few other eŒorts to pursue a general method for
describing both positional and attribute uncertainty in spatial databases. The work
is aimed primarily at discrete objects, and would be usefully extended to deal with
the real world situation, where a mixture of discrete objects and continuous (cid:142) elds
need to be represented. Nevertheless, the approach is of
interest here, since it
reinforces the idea that uncertainty in the attribute classi(cid:142) cation of an area may lead

177

to related uncertainty in the placement of the boundary line between one area and
its neighbours allocated to other classes.

The separation in the past of techniques for handling positional errors and for
attribute errors may be partly explained by disciplinary boundaries. The GIScience
community has previously focused more research on positional errors, with the
remote sensing community more naturally working on errors in classi(cid:142) cation of
image products. One area of theory that has been taken up by both communities
however, has been the contribution of fuzzy set theory for the representation of real-
world features that have boundaries that are poorly de(cid:142) ned and internal conditions
that are spatially varying (Altman 1994, Burrough 1996). For example, adjacent
areas of land cover are rarely separated by sharply de(cid:142) ned boundaries, but by zones
of transition, in which no one type may clearly dominate. To represent such features,
where there is a degree of uncertainty about the attribute class, researchers propose
the use of fuzzy set theory as opposed to crisp set theory (Kaufmann 1975).

Fuzzy set theory has been applied both for dealing with uncertainty in land cover
mapping (Fisher and Pathirana 1989) and for evaluating the accuracy of classi(cid:142) ed
maps (Gopal and Woodcock 1994 ). Lagacherie et al. (1996 ) report eŒorts to derive
fuzzy boundaries for objects to be stored within GIS and Wang and Hall (1996)
discuss the use of fuzzy methods for representing the uncertainty of boundaries
between classes of diŒerent nature. Burrough (1996) locates many of these recent
eŒorts within a more theoretical framework. With a few exceptions, most recent
work implicitly assumes a digital raster data source. It would be useful to extend
this work on class and boundary uncertainties to a more heterogeneous data environ-
ment. For example, when creating a categorical mapping of land cover, it is often
necessary to interpret and classify data sources such as aerial photographs and
remotely sensed data in both graphical and digital forms.

Whilst such research has demonstrate d the utility of fuzzy set approaches for
manipulating and classifying a variety of data types in both remote sensing and GIS,
it has also highlighted the sensitivity of the resulting outputs to the way in which
fuzzy membership values (FMVs) are assigned. Zhang and Kirby (1997) proposed
the use of
indicator kriging as a theoretically sound means of deriving a fuzzy
classi(cid:142) cation of land cover, that allows fuzzy membership values (FMVs) to be
assigned according to the certainty of the expert’s manual interpretation.

In a separate paper, Zhang and Foody (1998) developed a technique for the
fuzzy classi(cid:142) cation of multispectral satellite image data. By applying a fuzzy c-means
clustering technique similar to Bezdek et al. (1984) and supplied with training sets
of pixels that were of a certain class, FMVs were derived for the degree of membership
of every pixel into not only the (cid:142) rst, but also the second most possible class based
on spectral distance. The technique was used to derive a fuzzy measure of classi(cid:142) ca-
tion accuracy, with improved kappa statistics produced by allowing fuzzy matching
between ground and image classes.

This paper seeks an approach by which uncertainty arising primarily from the
attribution of areal classes from an original remote sensing data source, is handled
consistently and used to produce categorical maps in a GIS with levels of class
certainty that may be de(cid:142) ned (cid:143) exibly. The basis for such a consistency can be realised
using the methods established previously and separately for the fuzzy classi(cid:142) cation
of aerial photography and satellite imagery. Using both a distance-base d classi(cid:142) er
to derive FMVs for aerial photography and a spectrally-base d classi(cid:142) er for satellite
imagery, we develop a thresholding technique that allows us to analyse the extent
and nature of zones of attribute uncertainty between diŒerent classes of land cover.

J. Zhang and N. Stuart

By analysing the width of the unclassi(cid:142) ed zones between diŒerent land use types,
for varying levels of classi(cid:142) cation certainty, we explore the relationship between
uncertainty in the attribution of an area and the width of the unclassi(cid:142) ed region
separating it from areas attributed to diŒerent classes. For distance based fuzzy
classi(cid:142) ers, we show how these separating distances may be used to derive appropriate
values of Epsilon, the uncertainty in the location of the common boundary between
the land cover classes.

The utility of the proposed approach will be illustrated by an example of mapping
suburban land cover types, using both manual interpretation of aerial photography
and automatic classi(cid:142) cation of digital satellite imagery. This example will show the
practical utility of producing categorical maps which retain the uncertainty that
arises when trying to discriminate a continuum of land cover types, where some
features are well-de(cid:142) ned, others less so. The next section reviews the concepts of
fuzzy surfaces, their derivation and analysis. This is followed by details of the case
study, discussing the process of data acquisition, the generation of fuzzy surfaces
and the subsequent derivation of map boundaries and epsilon band widths. Emphasis
is placed on how estimates of boundary uncertainty can be derived from fuzzy
surfaces of class uncertainty. From the results obtained, we evaluate the potential
value of this approach for GIS users wishing to produce categorical maps that retain
more information on the uncertainty in the original remote sensing classi(cid:142) cations.

2. Methods
2.1. Representing categorical variables as fuzzy surfaces

An object-based model is not suited to mapping poorly de(cid:142) ned phenomena. A
better alternative is a (cid:142) eld-based model that conceives of the real world as a set of
single-valued functions de(cid:142) ned at each location (Goodchild 1989). Both numerical
and categorical variables may be encoded as (cid:142) elds, with elevation and rainfall being
examples of the former and land cover and soil type the latter (Goodchild 1993).

When recording a categorical variable in a (cid:142) eld model each point in the (cid:142) eld
stores a discrete outcome, such as a nominal or an ordinal label in a classi(cid:142) cation
system. One measure of uncertainty for a categorical variable at a point is the
probability that a classi(cid:142) cation is not correct. Such a probabilistic measure may be
assumed uniform for all pixels in a class, as obtained from an error matrix, or, more
realistically, to be spatially varying. This can be easily shown by an example. Suppose
a class of grassland is assigned to two locations. It is not unusual to (cid:142) nd that the
growth of grass at these two locations is distinctively diŒerent. Many properties
classi(cid:142) ed on categorical maps are in fact known to vary spatially; it follows from
this that the certainty with which the land is labelled as grassland will also vary in
space, for instance according to how similar or diŒerent is the neighbouring class.
A similar observation is made by Berry (1993).

Suppose c classes are possible, then a suitable approach might be to view a
categorical variable as a multi-nominal (cid:142) eld pi(x), where pi(x) represents the probabil-
ity of point x belonging to a candidate class i (i 5 1, 2, ..., c). Instead of a uniform
level of uncertainty at the individual class level, as assumed when an error matrix is
used, the use of pi(x) facilitates a spatially varying representation of class uncertainty.
A fuzzy categorical variable may then be de(cid:142) ned as a set of fuzzy surfaces, each
representing the certainty that the locations belong to an individual map class. The
values of pi(x) may be obtained in a variety of ways, dependent on the particular
application, such as from a quantitative probabilistic classi(cid:142) er or by a more

179

qualitative process, such as by expert deduction. The values of pi(x) are then used
directly or indirectly to assign fuzzy membership values (FMVs) to the uncertainty
surfaces for each possible map class (Lowell 1994).

At the semantic level, the interpretation of the FMVs is in(cid:143) uenced by the method
for their assignment. When FMVs are assigned primarily on the basis of a probabilis-
tic technique (where there is the requirement that the pi(x) values should sum to
unity), FMVs are understood to indicate certainty in the form of likelihood that the
correct class has been assigned to a location. When FMVs are assigned primarily
on the basis of a qualitative technique, they are interpreted as the possibility that a
location x may be admitted into class i.

In an example where there are three candidate classes of land cover, from which
a dominant class must be selected for a (cid:142) nal classi(cid:142) cation, then each class will have
a continuous surface of FMVs, describing the possibility of (cid:142) nding that particular
cover type at each location in turn. This example of a set of fuzzy surfaces for three
possible classes is shown in (cid:142) gure 1.

2.2. Deriving fuzzy surfaces

Though the concept of fuzzy classi(cid:142) cation is not new, the appropriate application
of the technique and particularly the de(cid:142) nition of appropriate fuzzy membership
functions is by no means trivial (Klir and Yuan 1995). Fuzzy membership functions
must be de(cid:142) ned according to the nature of the phenomena under study, the objectives
of the classi(cid:142) cation, and speci(cid:142) c data acquisition methods. For categorical mapping
such as land cover mapping, conventionally used methods include semi-automati c

computerised classi(cid:142) cations of digital images and visual interpretation of graphical
images. Methods of deriving the fuzzy membership values (FMVs) for each type of
classi(cid:142) cation will be considered in turn.

There are a number of ways to derive FMVs from computerised classi(cid:142) cations
of digital images such as remotely sensed imagery, depending on the speci(cid:142) c classi(cid:142) er
used. For example, FMVs may be calculated from probability density functions used
in the Maximum Likelihood Classi(cid:142) cations as discussed in Fisher and Pathirana
(1989). They may also be derived from measures of spectral distance. One such a
measure is Mahalanobis distance (D) between candidate classes over a number of
spectral bands comprising the re(cid:143) ectance data (Swain and Davis 1978). In these
methods based on spectral distance classi(cid:142) ers, FMVs are considered as a measure
of the degree of inclusion of each member (pixel ) within the class set, computed as
the proportion of the pixels with the distance further than D from the mean of the
class i, which belong to the class i. Moreover, as in conventional image classi(cid:142) cation,
fuzzy classi(cid:142) cation can be performed in both supervised and unsupervised modes.
By the unsupervised method, FMVs can be derived from the fuzzy c-means clustering
algorithm (Bezdek et al. 1984 ).

Let X 5 {x1, x2, ..., xn} be a sample of n observations in n-dimensional Euclidean
space; c is an integer not greater than n, representing the number of clusters aimed
for. There are a variety of algorithms aiming for an optimal fuzzy c-means clustering.
One method works by minimising a generalised least-squared error function Jm :

where m is the weighting exponent which controls the degree of fuzziness (increasing
m tends to increase fuzziness; usually, the value of m is set between 1.5 and 3.0),
Õ mik is a fuzzy membership function expressing the FMV of an observation xk to
the ith cluster, dik is the distance between observation xk and a fuzzy cluster centre
vi (Bezdek et al. 1984). For performing clustering on remotely sensed data, usually
the Mahalanobis distance is used.

c are generated randomly. These are indicated in two dimensions
by solid squares shown in (cid:142) gure 2(a). Figure 2(b) shows the (cid:142) nal fuzzy cluster centres
va , vb and vc. The (cid:142) nal cluster centres are formed iteratively by minimising the error
function Jm in equation (1), resulting in optimisation of Õ mik’s in relation to the
distance measure adopted. Using Bezdek’s (1994) algorithm, each observation is
given a membership value in each of the classes. Isolines of class membership in
(cid:142) gure 2 (b) are expressed as percentages.

In Zhang and Foody (1998) a fuzzy c-means classi(cid:142) er was used to derive a
continuous surface of FMV’s for all pixels in a digital image classi(cid:142) cation. FMV’s
were calculated giving the degree of membership for every pixel into both a (cid:142) rst and
second most possible land cover class, according to its DN values in multiple bands.
In this paper, we use the same technique to derive the degree of membership of every
pixel into all candidate classes. For the manual process of visual interpretation of
graphical images such as aerial photographs , an alternative method is needed to
derive FMVs that may represent the uncertainties of classifying diŒerent areas.
Instead of a fuzzy classi(cid:142) er such as c-means based on spectral distance, we use an
interpolation method based on geographical distance.

During the process of photo-interpretation , human interpreters often use their

expertise to classify the continuous variation that is known to exist in the proportions
of diŒerent land cover classes, into discrete regions where one class is assumed to
dominate. The experience of many interpreters of aerial photography is that for
more uniform regions within an image, e.g. blocks of grassland or forest, the dominant
class is more certain than in transition zones where ground condition is more
heterogeneous. In this study, this observation forms the basis for using a spatial
interpolation method to derive fuzzy membership values for locations where the
ground cover is in transition, given a set of classi(cid:142) ed samples at locations where the
ground cover is physically quite homogenous. A fuzzy surface is derived by the
human interpreter (cid:142) rstly using their expert judgement to subjectively but consistently
assign FMVs to locations where they can be very certain about the dominant land
cover class. (Example FMVs {0.95, 0.05, 0} An appropriate spatial interpolation
method is then used to infer the FMVs where the dominant class is less certain
(example FMVs {0.45, 0.4, 0.15}).

One particular form of geostatistical method that may be used to interpolate
categorical data such as this, is indicator kriging (Oliver and Webster, 1990). This
method directly estimates the probabilities of (cid:142) nding individual classes at unsampled
locations, given a set of sample locations at which classi(cid:142) cation has been made with
reasonable certainty (Bierkens and Burrough 1993a, 1993b) . In an empirical study
using aerial photography, Zhang and Kirby (1997 ) established that indicator kriging
provided a more reliable means for producing a continuous fuzzy classi(cid:142) cation of

interpreted photogrammetri c data than other distance-base d interpolators such as
triangular irregular networks or inverse distance weighting.

The method of indicator kriging supposes c mutually exclusive classes can be
found over a (cid:142) eld and n observations (i.e. unambiguousl y classi(cid:142) ed samples) are
available, at which we shall assume there is no uncertainty. Each observation is
classi(cid:142) ed as a member of one of the possible classes {c1, ..., cc}. For each class ci
(i 5 1, ..., c) under consideration, the n observations are transformed into binary data
(i.e. an observation is set to 1 if it is classi(cid:142) ed as class ci, 0 otherwise). These binary
data are denoted as pi(xk), k 5 1, 2, ..., n, for a particular class ci.

Suppose that an experimental semivariogram has been calculated and has been
subsequently (cid:142) tted by a suitable model. Indicator kriging performs the estimation
of probabilities of (cid:142) nding individual classes ci (i 5 1, ..., c) at a point x using:

pi(x) 5

lkpi(xk ),

d

k= 1

(2)

(k 5 1, 2, ..., n)
where pi(xk ) represents a binary variable at an observation xk
as described above, lk is the weight associated with the observation xk (again,
k 5 1, 2, ..., n). These weights (i.e., lk’s) depend on the semi-variances between pairs
of sampling points and the average semi-variances between the point x and a
sampling point (Bierkens and Burrough 1993a). Indicator kriging may then be
carried out by using an ordinary kriging algorithm, when the variable under study
has been transformed into binary data.

2.3. Generating categorical maps that accommodate boundary uncertainty.

Fuzzy surfaces are considered as useful analytical data, since they allow uncer-
tainty to be preserved when querying and combining data sets. For presentation
purposes, however, it is often desirable to derive traditional categorical maps from
these data. When transforming from a (cid:142) eld based model (e.g. a raster map of land
cover) to an object-based model (e.g. a categorical map of vector polygons) , it would
be desirable for estimates of the uncertainty in the attribute classi(cid:142) cation also to be
transformed and stored in an equivalent model of uncertainty in the resulting polygon
boundaries. For vector categorical maps, the Epsilon Band is one such model.
Conceptually, this equates to a transformation between attribute uncertainty in the
raster domain and boundary uncertainty in the vector domain. Uncertainty in the
position of the boundaries also derives from other sources, such as recti(cid:142) cation of
the raster data, but for the nature and use of the data in this experiment this
component may be assumed small in comparison to errors in the categorical map
due to attribute uncertainty.

Suppose that fuzzy surfaces are derived by using indicator kriging or another
method suitable for interpolating FMVs throughout an area. Then, denote a vector:

P(x) 5

( p1(x), p2(x), ..., pc(x))

(3)

where pi(x) (i 5 1, 2, ..., c) are the fuzzy membership values of location x belonging
to class i, and hence comprise a set of fuzzy surfaces for a total of c classes.

Once a set of fuzzy surfaces has been derived by such a method, a crisp classi(cid:142) ca-
tion becomes a maximisation operation, a kind of defuzzi(cid:142) cation, on fuzzy surfaces
(Altman 1994). Given vector P(x), the maximisation proceeds such that location x
is labelled with the class having the maximum fuzzy membership value. For example,

Fuzzy categorical mapping

location x is to be classi(cid:142) ed into class j on the condition as expressed in equation (2):

pj(x) 5 maximum ( p1(x), p2(x), ..., pc(x)),

for j 5 1, 2, ..., c

where the j class labels form the classi(cid:142) ed data layer. A classi(cid:142) ed map is shown in
(cid:142) gure 3 (a) based on (cid:142) gure 1, while (cid:142) gure 3(b) shows the underlying certainty levels
for the individual locations that have been classi(cid:142) ed.

Upon the completion of the maximisation process, an error matrix can be
composed by tabulating for each location the classes labelled on the classi(cid:142) ed data
layer and on the reference data layer (Congalton 1991). As well as these ‘per-pixel’
tests of accuracy, the visual acuity of the classi(cid:142) cation procedure may be assessed
by identifying regions within the image where the certainty of class assignment is
highest and inspecting a reference image or conducting (cid:142) eld checking to con(cid:142) rm if
there are similarly discrete areas of uniform cover type on the ground. The process
of selecting regions of high certainty can be facilitated by a thresholding operation,
in which the maximum FMVs (denoted by pmax
) from vector P(x) are examined with
reference to a pre-determined threshold a. Speci(cid:142) cally, processing is performed such
that a location x is selected for inclusion in a region if the value of pmax is not less
than value a.

Such processing is particularly useful in situations where the mapped phenomena
are inherently fuzzy or exist as mixtures, in particular for remote sensing data at
coarse spatial resolutions. This is because the identi(cid:142) cation of representative classes
can be performed on a quantitative basis, which would be highly subjective when
no information on class membership was available. In this paper, the desired output
is a categorical map and a thresholding into crisp classes is therefore required.
Should the user wish to produce a map showing, for example, where the classi(cid:142) cation
is at its most uncertain, then a diŒerent type of map could be produced to show
locations where there was little diŒerence between the FMVs of the two most possible
candidate classes. This idea was pursued in related work by Zhang and Foody (1998)
that assessed the accuracy of a classi(cid:142) ed image by comparing both (cid:142) rst and second
most possible class ((cid:142) rst and second highest FMV per pixel ) against reference data
from the ground, that was also allowed to be speci(cid:142) ed with some uncertainty.

The classi(cid:142) ed map in (a) has been derived by applying a maximisation operation in
turn to each of the three fuzzy surfaces in (cid:142) gure 1. The value resulting from the
maximisation in (b) gives an indication of the level of certainty at which the cell has
been allocated to the given class with larger values representing higher certainty in
the class assigned.

The thresholding operation generates a classi(cid:142) ed map, where selected locations
belong to their nominal classes with a degree of membership of not less than the
threshold a. Those locations left unclassi(cid:142) ed constitute uncertainty zones, which can
be used to derive estimates of epsilon band widths. Figure 4 illustrates this operation,
where the variation of FMVs of class 1 and class 2 is shown along a transect de(cid:142) ned
from a ‘core’ location C1 with high certainty of being class 1 to ‘core’ location C2
which is certainly of class 2. When the FMVs are sliced at the threshold a, this leads
to an epsilon band of width w. As shown in (cid:142) gure 4, the threshold can be set between
the minimum FMV indicated by ‘min’ and the maximum FMV of 1.0. Increasing
the threshold will widen the epsilon band width, and vice versa. Thus, a variety of
epsilon band models can be derived, based on diŒerent thresholds. As an example,
(cid:142) gure 5 is developed based on (cid:142) gure 4, where a sequence of categorical maps is
created by slicing at a succession of thresholds, representing FMVs of 55%, 70%,
85% and 100%. An attractive aspect of this approach is that the width of the
uncertainty zone (epsilon width w) is computed for each location in turn, on the
basis of local gradients in the underlying FMVs for the certainty of each class. This
allows the epsilon band width to vary continuously over space in a way that explicitly
takes account of the relative certainty with which all adjacent features have been
interpreted. In (cid:142) gure 5, for example, the width of the uncertainty corridor varies in
accordance with the local certainty of classes 1, 2 and 3.

3. An empirical test
3.1. T he test site and the data sources

In the test, land cover data were used as a classic example of categorical data,
to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy surface method. The chosen test site is an
area of about 2 km2, located within the city of Edinburgh, around Blackford Hill, as
shown in (cid:142) gure 6. A suburb was chosen for ease of data acquisition and also because
the high diversity of land cover within a small area provided a rigorous test for
the method.

Figure 4. A categorical map can be created containing regions identi(cid:142) ed at or above a certain
level of certainty in their attribute classi(cid:142) cation. A threshold value a is applied to the
grid of the maximised FMVs. By thresholding the maximum values of membership in
any class, pixels with Max (FMV) > a are assigned to that class, whilst others remain
unclassi(cid:142) ed. The width ‘w’ unclassi(cid:142) ed between the two regions can be used to de(cid:142) ne
an Epsilon band width.

Data sources used were aerial photographs at 1:24 000 scale, SPOT HRV imagery
(pixel size: 20 m) and Landsat TM imagery (pixel size: 30 m). Landsat TM data and
1:24 000 scale aerial photographs were acquired in May and June of 1988,
respectively. The SPOT image was acquired in July of 1985. Image interpretation
was used to identify some minor changes to the land cover in the study area in the
intervening period, in the form of a few new buildings. By identifying and accounting
for these minor changes, one may reasonably assume there were no major diŒerences
in land cover due to diŒerences in the dates of image acquisition.

Although this paper concentrates on accounting for attribute uncertainty in the
creation of categorical maps, positional errors will arise during photo-interpretatio n
and subsequent recti(cid:142) cation to co-register the photographic coverage with satellite
imagery. In the experiments that follow with aerial photographic data, eŒorts were
made to reduce the errors due to image recti(cid:142) cation and digitising so that positional
errors in digitised boundary locations could be considered small in relation to the
pixel sizes of the gridded maps.

Ground control points (GCPs) chosen for recti(cid:142) cation of the photographs and
satellite imagery were a combination of (cid:142) eld surveyed control points, densi(cid:142) ed using
photogrammetri c block adjustment based on 1:5000 scale aerial photographs , and
additional points clearly identi(cid:142) able in the imagery, which could also be digitised
from Ordnance Survey large scale plans (Zhang 1996). This set of GCPs was su(cid:141) cient
for photogrammetri c digitising and recti(cid:142) cation of the remote sensing imagery.

3.2. Deriving fuzzy surfaces

In order to provide a layer of reference data, photogrammetri c plotting was
performed based on the reconstituted 1:24 000 stereo photography. The following
land cover classes were identi(cid:142) ed:

(1) grass (park and grass land),
(2) built-up (built-up and barren land),
(3) wood (wooded land, no distinction made between deciduous and coniferous

woodland),

(4) shrub (shrub land, including open wooded land), and
(5) water (water bodies and water works).

For both SPOT HRV and Landsat TM data, a fuzzy clustering algorithm based
on Bezdek et al. (1984), programmed in FORTRAN 77, was used to produce fuzzy
membership vectors across the (cid:142) ve target classes pixel by pixel within the study area.
Due to unsatisfactory results from the unsupervised mode, the fuzzy clustering
algorithm was applied in a supervised mode with bands 1, 2 and 3 used for the
SPOT HRV image, and bands 3, 4 and 5 used for the Landsat TM image (Zhang
1996 ). For this, training data were acquired by identifying, for each class, blocks of
representative pixels from imagery displayed. These pixels were selected from outside
of the test site if possible. For SPOT HRV data, the numbers of pixels selected were
633, 1369, 332, 616 and 544 for grass, built, wood, shrub and water respectively. For
Landsat TM data, the numbers of pixels selected were much less: 72 for grass, 109
for built, 39 for wood, 47 for shrub and 16 for water. Then, the program was used
to calculate the fuzzy membership values for each pixel in each of (cid:142) ve classes using
class statistics derived from the training data and using a weight exponent of m 5 2.5.
The degree of fuzziness in the resulting sets of fuzzy surfaces was measured by
an entropy value (Foody 1995). The mean and ranges of entropy for fuzzy surfaces

based on SPOT HRV data and Landsat TM data were 1.56, [0.01, 2.26 ] and 1.64,
[0.54, 2.31 ] respectively, which suggests a relatively high degree of
fuzziness for
surfaces based on remotely sensed imagery.

To generate fuzzy surfaces from aerial photographs , it is useful to recall that
some ‘core’ locations may be correctly attributed with high certainty (e.g. water
bodies), whilst at other locations in the image the interpreter may be uncertain as
to which class should be attributed. A choice must be made from two or more
candidate classes. This subjective process is modelled by using a set of samples at
core locations, which are classi(cid:142) ed with high certainty, and using indicator kriging
to estimate the probabilities for all candidate land cover types occurring at other
locations. These probabilities of occurrence are then interpreted as FMVs for each
candidate land cover type at each location.

Indicator kriging is supported in the geostatistical package GSLIB (Deutsch and
Journel 1992). The sample data were points digitised from photogrammetri c data
displayed on-screen, which were veri(cid:142) ed by referring to the original aerial photo-
graphs and where necessary by (cid:142) eld checking. 234 points of high certainty were
recorded for grassland, 291 for built-up areas, 203 for woodland, 76 for shrubland,
and 11 for water bodies. These were then transformed to a grid co-ordinate system
required in GSLIB with grid cell size set to 2.5Ö 2.5 metres. The outputs were then
loaded into SPSS to perform semivariogram model (cid:142) ttings. Finally, the kriging
procedure okb2d was run with the output grids cell sizes set to 10 m. The degree of
fuzziness measured by entropy was 0.72, with a range of between 0.00 and 1.82,
indicating that the set of surfaces based on photogrammetri c data is much less fuzzy
than those based on remotely sensed data. This supports the expectation that the
land cover classes are de(cid:142) ned with greater certainty by aerial photography than by
satellite imagery.

The outputs from fuzzy c-means clustering and indicator kriging were converted
to ASCII (cid:142) les by some in-house FORTRAN programs, then loaded into the
ARC/INFO GRID data format to make use of the three dimensional display, surface
modelling and analysis functions of this software. As an example, the set of fuzzy
surfaces derived by using indicator kriging on the photogrammetri c data is shown
in (cid:142) gure 7, where the darker the tone, the higher the certainty of presence of a land
cover type at a particular location, and vice versa.

3.3. Constructing categorical maps with fuzzy boundaries

Once the set of fuzzy surfaces has been built for all possible classes, classi(cid:142) cation
is achieved by a maximising operation applied to the fuzzy class membership values.
The output consists of a single grid, with each cell assigned to the class with the
maximum FMV (i.e. pmax
) at that cell location. The pair of values for the class and
the corresponding FMV at which the assignment to the class was made, can be used
to display both the classi(cid:142) cation and its underlying certainty, for each of the satellite
and photographic images. The results from SPOT HRV data, Landsat TM data and
photogrammetri c data are shown in (a), (b) and (c) of (cid:142) gure 8 respectively, where the
classi(cid:142) ed maps are draped over their corresponding certainty surfaces. The higher
parts of the surfaces indicate more certainty in the classi(cid:142) cation of land cover types,
and vice versa. Presenting a classi(cid:142) cation in this way conveys a strong sense of
spatial variations of uncertainties, compared to a traditional approach where all
areas are in eŒect delineated with equal certainty.

Based on the classi(cid:142) cations presented in (cid:142) gure 8, it is possible to perform slicing

Indicator kriging was applied to points identi(cid:142) ed with high certainty from the
aerial photography in (cid:142) gure 6, to generate gridded estimates of the presence or absence
of each land cover type throughout the study area at 2.5 m by 2.5 m resolution. The

to derive a set of categorical maps, as described in $2.3. As an example, the certainty
surface shown in (cid:142) gure 8(c) was sliced at a succession of a-cuts: 60%, 73%, 86% and
96%, to produce, respectively, the categorical maps shown in (a), (b), (c) and (d) of
(cid:142) gure 9. The values of a were chosen such that there are equal planar areas (equal
numbers of pixels) between each two successive threshold values. The areas labelled
as ‘unclassi(cid:142) ed’ are where the maximum FMV (i.e., certainty of the dominant class)
falls below the speci(cid:142) ed threshold a, while the shaded areas are where the FMV for
the dominant class exceeds a. The assignment at these locations has therefore been
made with a greater level of certainty.

Figure 9 shows that when higher thresholds were applied, fewer pixels were
classi(cid:142) ed, but these classi(cid:142) ed pixels were identi(cid:142) ed with greater certainty as belonging
to their named classes. The change of spatial pattern observed when increasing or
decreasing thresholds can be visualised in a sequence of categorical maps as shown
in (cid:142) gure 9, serving to help users to choose a suitable threshold. In practical terms,
the set of categorical maps in (cid:142) gure 9 can be considered as products meeting

automatic fashion. Towards this end, sets of arcs were created, traversing the median
of the uncertainty zones shown in (a), (b), (c) and (d) of (cid:142) gure 9. For each arc, the

eŒect on the classi(cid:142) cation accuracy. Secondly, all estimates of epsilon band widths
are associated with large values of standard deviation. This indicates that there is
considerable spatial variation in the uncertainty of boundaries separating the same
two land cover types throughout the study area. The localised nature of boundary
uncertainty revealed here suggests that methods of allocating a typical epsilon band
width for each combination of boundary types ignore this spatial variability.

The resultant maps of (cid:142) gure 9 need to be interpreted with care however. The
shape of the unclassi(cid:142) ed zones and the gradients in classi(cid:142) cation certainty in this
case re(cid:143) ect the form of the indicator kriging function used to impute the decline in
FMVs with increasing distance from the core areas that were identi(cid:142) ed with certainty.
Many other factors will in(cid:143) uence the certainty of a classi(cid:142) cation. In(cid:143) uences will be
diŒerent for the manual photointerpretatio n process and the automatic classi(cid:142) cation
of a digital satellite image. Figure 10 shows a series of categorical maps derived by
thresholding the land cover map derived from SPOT data in (cid:142) gure 8(a) at a succes-
sion of a values of (a) 40%, (b) 47%, (c) 56% and (d) 69%. Again, thresholds were
selected to include equal numbers of pixels between successive a values. The lower
values of a imply that the classi(cid:142) cation of land cover is generally less certain from
the SPOT data than from the aerial photography. While many of the larger regions
of land cover are similarly identi(cid:142) ed in (cid:142) gure 10, the regions delineated are generally
not as homogenous as in (cid:142) gure 9, particularly for higher values of the certainty
threshold a. In (cid:142) gure 10, corridors of uncertainty between regions do not grow out
as simply as in (cid:142) gure 9 from the region boundaries, although these do widen as the
a value is increased. Some ‘holes’ occur in places where pixels within a region fall
below the threshold of certainty and there are ‘inclusions’ where pixels in a local
patch have a slightly higher FMV for another class than for the class of the enclosing
region. The information stored in the fuzzy surfaces can be used to estimate the
purity of regions in the resulting categorical maps, especially if inclusions or holes
are to be suppressed for cartographic simplicity.

Taken together, these results show that by applying maximising and thresholding
operations on the fuzzy surfaces, it is possible to derive object-based representations
in the form of categorical maps. It is possible to transfer a measure of classi(cid:142) cation
uncertainty held in the fuzzy surfaces and attach this to boundaries of region objects

in the categorical map. For categorical maps where the uncertainty in attribute
classi(cid:142) cation is directly related to distance in geographical space (i.e. with distance
from a ‘core’ location of known type), estimates of epsilon error band widths can be
computed locally as an attribute of individual arcs, allowing spatial variations in
boundary uncertainty across an area to be revealed. For the more general case of
satellite image classi(cid:142) cation, where the FMV depends on the distance between the
observed pixel re(cid:143) ectance and an ideal value in a multidimensional spectral space,
the fuzzy surface method allows the subtle variations in attribute class certainty to

be revealed. If it is desired to produce a categorical map with little or no areas
remaining unclassi(cid:142) ed, the fuzzy surfaces allow the underlying data about the spatial
variation in the certainty of class assignment within regions, to be retained. The
methods also allow users to make categorical maps with uncertainty zones shown
as both bands between regions and inclusions within them. These give a more
realistic impression of attribute uncertainty than is possible with the conventional
categorical map.

4. Conclusions

The results from the case study con(cid:142) rm that fuzzy surfaces can be derived using
fuzzy classi(cid:142) cation techniques from diŒerent data sources including aerial photo-
graphy and satellite remote sensing. The fuzzy surfaces generated permit a theoretic-
ally sound and data-driven solution to estimating errors in classi(cid:142) ed attributes. The
methods can be can applied across both automatic and interpretative classi(cid:142) cation
methods, which are commonly used in natural resources surveys such as land cover
mapping.

Once uncertainty estimates are derived for the candidate classes, we have shown
that classi(cid:142) cations can be produced by the relatively straightforward use of a maxim-
isation operation on the FMVs for the candidate classes. The resulting grid contains
both the dominant class and the certainty with which this has been assigned. By
draping the grid of the dominant class over the grid of maximised fuzzy membership
values at which the allocation was made, it is possible to convey simultaneously
both the class and the certainty of its allocation.

If the user prefers the output as a conventional categorical map, transformation
into the object domain is required. A technique has been developed by which the
user may generate a crisp classi(cid:142) cation by thresholding the surface of the maximised
FMVs at a given level of class certainty. Using the technique a series of categorical
maps may be created for which the areas are known to be classi(cid:142) ed at least to the
level of certainty speci(cid:142) ed. For the speci(cid:142) c case where indicator kriging is used to
produce a continuous surface of FMVs, attribute certainty decreases with increasing
distance from core locations that can be unambiguousl y classi(cid:142) ed. The width of the
unclassi(cid:142) ed area can be used to estimate an Epsilon band width for the categorical
map. This width varies continuously, as a local function of the certainty of the classes
that are immediately adjacent. For the more general case of classifying multispectral
satellite imagery, the fuzzy surfaces derived by the c-means technique allows uncer-
tainty in the attributes allocated by either supervised or unsupervised methods to
be preserved and used to show the internal variability of certainty within the hard
classi(cid:142) cation.

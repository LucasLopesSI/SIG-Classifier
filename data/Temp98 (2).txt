Abstract This paper presents a novel method to model urban land use conversion using
support vector machines (SVMs), a new generation of machine learning algorithms used in
the classification and regression domains. This method derives the relationship between
rural-urban land use change and various factors, such as population, distance to road and
facilities, and surrounding land use. Our study showed that SVMs are an effective approach
to estimating the land use conversion model, owing to their ability to model non-linear
relationships, good generalization performance, and achievement of a global and unique
optimum. The rural-urban land use conversions of New Castle County, Delaware between
1984–1992, 1992–1997, and 1997–2002 were used as a case study to demonstrate the
applicability of SVMs to urban expansion modeling. The performance of SVMs was also
compared with a commonly used binomial logistic regression (BLR) model, and the results,
in terms of the overall modeling accuracy and McNamara’s test, consistently corroborated
the better performance of SVMs.

urban growth is inevitable for economic development and has often been viewed as a sign
of the vitality of regional economy, on the other hand, rapid urban growth causes
environmental and ecological degradation. Therefore, land use change, if left unchecked,
would considerably hinder sustainable development for the future.

Understanding the complexity of land use change and evaluating its impact on the
environment involves the procedures of both detection and modeling. In recent years,
progress in modern remote sensing and GIS techniques have been instrumental in opening
this field for study, and significant success has already been achieved in monitoring and
managing rapid land use change. With the on-going development of remote sensing
techniques, image processing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, a wide variety of
digital change detection algorithms have been developed over the last two decades (see
reviews in [6, 13]). Detecting and monitoring land use change, however, is just the first step
of sustainable growth management. A further step is to identify factors that drive the land
use change and explore their relative importance, analyze the land use change pattern,
understand the dynamic process of land use change, and simulate “what-if” decision
making based on a variety of scenarios; that is, model land use change. Modeling land use
change is a prerequisite to understanding the complexity of land use change and forecasting
future trends of land use change and its ecological impacts [12]. Only after accurately
modeling land use change can decision makers generate scientific plans which cater to the
needs of usually increasing population and still maintain ecological balance.

In order to comprehend and quantitatively model the dynamic process of urban growth
or rural-urban land transformation, a broad range of techniques have been developed, such
as cellular automata (CA) [5, 24, 25], logistic regression [3, 23], and multi-agent systems
[15]. Among these methods, CA has received increased attention due to its simplicity,
transparency, strong capacities for dynamic spatial simulation, and innovative bottom-up
approach [5]. Generally, CA models focus on the simulation of spatial patterns rather than
on the interpretation or understanding of the spatio-temporal processes of land use change.
By contrast,
logistic regression is viewed as an effective tool for establishing the
relationship between land use change and the various contributing factors, such as
population density, slope, proximity to roads, and surrounding land use [22]. In spite of
varying levels of success demonstrated by the afore-mentioned techniques, several
problems still exist in urban expansion modeling. For instance, the training data that is
available to build the land use change model may not be able to accurately approximate the
underlying distribution of the whole dataset. Consequently, the modeling methodology
should have certain mechanisms to avoid overfitting and to ensure good generalization
performance [20].

This paper will add to literature by exploring a new method that utilizes support vector
machines (SVMs) to address the problems in modeling land use conversion. SVMs are a
new generation of machine learning algorithms used in classification and regression
domains [10, 19]. SVM is a machine learning formalism based on statistical learning
theory. It has several appealing features: (1) it is a statistics-based model rather than a loose
analogy with the natural learning system [20]; (2) it has the ability to model non-linear
relationships; (3) it has good generalization performance; (4) it has the ability to select only
the necessary objects (support vectors) to solve the optimization function, which results in a
sparse solution; (5) for the quadratic problem (QP), it can derive an unique global optimum;
and (6) it is a robust tool for classification and regression in noisy, complex domains.
Owing to these prominent features, SVMs have grown in popularity in recent years and
image
have been successfully applied to various fields such as text categorization,
recognition, and hand-written digit recognition. The purpose of this paper is to examine the

Geoinformatica (2010) 14:83–99

applicability of SVMs to modeling of urban growth with a set of causal factors. Its
performance will also be compared with the logistic regression models [22].

A brief introduction to SVMs will be given in the next section. The data set and
experimental design of urban growth modeling will be described in Section 3, and the
prototype system will be described in Section 4. The experimental results which include the
parameter configuration on the performances of SVMs, and comparisons of SVMs with a
spatial
logistic regression model will be presented in Section 5. A discussion and a
summary are given in the last two sections.

2 Support vector machines

Support vector machines (SVMs), which were originally developed by Vapnik [20], are a
system for efficiently training the linear learning machines in the kernel-induced feature
space [7]. SVMs utilize a computationally efficient method to identify a linear optimal
separating hyperplane in a high dimensional feature space to separate any two classes of
interest. Since the classes may be linearly or non-linearly separable, for the linear learning
machine to work in non-linear cases, a kernel function (KF) is introduced to map the non-
linearly separable classes from the input space to a higher dimensional feature space, in
which the non-linearly separable classes can be separated by an optimal linear hyperplane.
The optimization criterion for the optimal hyperplane is to maximize the margin between
the separating hyperplane and the closest data points.

2.1 The optimal separating hyperplane

Consider a training dataset, D, with two separable classes of k data points:

D ¼ x1; y1
ð
f

Þ; x2; y2
ð

Þ; . . . ; xk; yk
ð

g; (cid:1) 2 Rn; y 2 (cid:2)1; 1

That needs to be separated with a hyperplane given by

w0 (cid:3) xþb ¼ 0

where xi is a data point in n-dimensional space, yi is a class label, w is an n-dimensional
coefficient vector, and b is the offset.

Although many hyperplanes could be fitted to separate the classes, the SVM approach
consists of finding an optimal separating hyperplane that maximizes the separating margin
between the two classes of data. This method is equivalent to maximizing the distance
between H1 and H2 shown in Fig. 1. It is possible to express this distance to be equal to
1= wk k with a simple rescaling of the hyperplane parameters w and b, such that

2.2 Imperfect separation

In practice, since the data is subject to noise, it is impossible to find a hyperplane to
perfectly separate the two classes in the featured space (Fig. 2). To extend the SVMs to
solve imperfect separation, non-negative slack variables ξi are incorporated into constraints,

The only difference between the perfectly separating case and the imperfectly separating
case is that the Lagrange multipliers αi are bounded above by C in the imperfectly
separating case instead of unbounded in perfectly separating case.

2.3 Non-linear separation

In most practical applications, the two classes cannot be linearly separated. To extend the
linear learning machine to work with non-linear cases, SVMs use a kernel function (KF) to
map the non-linearly separable classes from the input space to a higher dimensional feature
space, in which the non-linearly separable classes can be separated by a linear optimal
hyperplane.

As shown in Fig. 3, a mapping function Ф is used to map examples in the input space Rn

into a higher dimensional feature space H,

Φ : Rn ! H

Fig. 3 Mapping from the input space to the feature space

An example x in the input space can be represented as Ф(x) in the feature space. Since
only the dot product of two vectors appears in the optimization problem, if we define a
kernel function K as

(cid:1)

K xi; xj

(cid:2)

(cid:1) (cid:2)
¼ Φ xið Þ0(cid:3)Φ xj

we do not need to know explicitly the mapping function. We can simply use a kernel
function of the input space to represent the dot product in the higher dimensional feature
space and the optimization problem can be rewritten as

According to Mercer’s condition [7], any positive semi-definite function K(x, y) can be
expressed as a dot product in a higher dimensional space. Therefore, any kernels that meet
Mercer’s condition can be used to construct the SVMs.

There are many kernel functions that can be used in SVMs. The most commonly used

kernels in SVMs include the polynomial kernel:

Delaware, USA. Land use changes between 1984–1992, 1992–1997 and 1997–2002 were
modeled and estimated using SVMs. The outcome of SVMs was then compared with that
of a widely used urban growth modeling approach, namely binomial logistic regression
(BLR), to demonstrate the suitability of SVMs on urban growth analysis.

3.1 Study area

Delaware State is partitioned, from north to south, into three counties: New Castle County,
Sussex County, and Kent County (Fig. 4). It covers an area of about 1,100 km2 and thus a
20×60 km rectangle is sufficient to encompass it. About 60% of Delaware’s population
lives in this county that includes the major urban and manufacturing centre of Delaware.
The northern part of Delaware State belongs to the suburban agglomeration of Philadelphia
(PA) and consists of densely populated cities such as Wilmington and Newark while the
southern part is relatively agricultural. A land use study [8] shows that both the northern
and southern regions are becoming progressively urbanized and this tendency is not
expected to decline in the forthcoming years.

3.2 Driving forces and constraints

Land use studies often propose different driving forces to elucidate land use trends at
different places and it
land use changes cannot be
attributed to any single group of factors due to the differences in the contexts of each
case. For example, Cheng and Masser [3] focused on rural to urban land use conversion in

information:

China and their model included industry structure, transportation networks, and existing
developed areas. They also considered the constraints imposed by water bodies and other
places unfit for urban development. In another study, Landis and Zhang [11] investigated
land use change near a railway station in a small-scale example. It included only four
the urban structure (residential,
classes of
commercial, public and industrial buildings), locations available for change, and locations
where no change could occur because of constraints [17]. In an additional example, Verburg
et al. [21] associated the growth of a city directly to its population growth and found
that while an increase in population led to the development of new residential areas
proximal
to roadways and railways, commercial centers had a tendency to develop
concurrently.

the transportation network,

In this study, the focus of the land use model will be on contributing factors, such as
population migration, proximity to residential, commercial and industrial areas, nearness to
transportation amenities, and the proportion of urban and rural cells in the vicinity.
Agricultural land is taken as the land available for change, while forests, wetlands, or barren
lands are considered lands unsuitable for developmental activities. The latter assumption
accounts for policies favoring the conservation of natural resources.

3.3 Training data selection

The heterogeneity of spatial data should inevitably be considered when modeling rural-
urban land conversion. Spatial statistics like spatial dependence and spatial sampling should
be incorporated to eliminate spatial auto-correlation which could result
in unreliable
parameter estimation. One effective way to eliminate spatial auto-correlation is to design a
spatial sampling scheme to expand the distance interval between sampled sites [14]. This
study uses the regular sampling technique of a non-overlapping moving window. The
center cell was retained for each window. While a small sampling window is not efficient
in removing spatial autocorrelation, a large sampling window often leads to a smaller
sample size that loses certain information, e.g., some patterns of change. Thus, a more
rational approach that will represent an acceptable trade-off between the two attributes is
needed.

To examine the spatial autocorrelation of observations proximate in space, a check of
joins was determined each time by comparing land use change types of “adjacent” cells. A
join is defined by sequential occurrences of like land cover changes in adjacent cells, which
are those center cells of current sampling window and the sampling windows to the east,
west, north, and south of this window. A similar method for handling spatial autocorrelation
was adopted in [14]. A plot showing the number of joins with increasing window size is
provided in Fig. 5. We ultimately chose to sample the data using a 9×9 window, or
sampling distances of 450 m. At
this distance, we filtered out much of the spatial
autocorrelation and still had enough cells for training and testing. For clarity, the dataset
with spatial autocorrelation eliminated is hereafter called “the whole sample dataset”.
Subsequent training and testing are based on this dataset.

3.4 GIS-based variables preparation and processing

The data used in this study consists of chronological land use data, demographic data, and
transportation data, all in vector format. Like most land use conversion modeling, this study
is also cell-based. All land use files in 1984, 1992, 1997, and 2002 were rasterized at 50×
50 m resolution. A post-classification comparison method was used to detect the land use

change between 1984–1992, 1992–1997 and 1997–2002 using the ArcInfo GIS software
(for more information about this software, please refer to its website: http://www.esri.com).
Bi-temporal change maps were generated by overlaying individual classifications. As well,
six predictor variables were compiled using ArcInfo. These predictors are Dens_Pop
(population density of the cell), Dist_Com (distance from the cell to the nearest commercial
site), Dist_Res (distance from the cell to the nearest residential area), Dist_Ind (distance from
the cell to the nearest industrial site), Dist_Road (distance from the cell to the nearest road),
and Per_Urb (Percentage of urban land use in the surround area within 200 m radius).

The six factors fall within three categories: (1) site specific characteristics, (2) proximity,
and (3) neighborhood characteristics. Since population is a leading force propelling global
land use change, the site specific characteristic, namely population density, is considered to
be a chief predictor. Proximity is a prime contributing factor in urban expansion. The
proximity variables measure the minimum Euclidean distances to the nearest commercial site,
residential area,
industrial site and transportation network, respectively. The distance
decaying mechanism of various factors is signified by the type and size of the selected
neighborhood. In this study, a circular neighborhood with a 200 m radius was selected after
considering the effect of neighboring impacts in current land use distribution. It is noted that
the data about the six contributing factors were normalized to [0, 1] in subsequent analyses.
Figure 6 depicts land use/cover maps of 1984, 1992, 1997 and 2002. It can be seen that
in 1984 most of urban land use classes (commercial, residential, and industrial) were
located on the northern region. The southern region was mostly rural in its land use.
the urban land use in the northern part expanded. Most rural–urban
Subsequently,
conversion happened along the boundary of the original urban land use. Apparently, the
proximity factor seemed to be a major contributing factor for these rural–urban conversions.

4 Prototype implementation

A prototype system for SVMs land use change modeling, called Change Analyst, was
developed using C++. This system supports GIS data visualization, processing (e.g. map
overlay), and change analysis. Figure 7 shows a snapshot of the system interface.

As shown in the ‘Change Modeling’ dialogue, this system functions via the operation of
the six tabs, i.e. Themes, Categories, Factors, Sampling, Regr/Class, and Prediction. The

92

Themes tab lets users enter the time series data to be analyzed, and the Categories tab lets
users select the change categories (e.g., rural to urban or urban to rural). In the Factors tab,
users enter the layers of contributing factors in different years. The Sampling tab allows
users to test different sizes of the sampling window and choose the one which minimizes
the spatial autocorrelation. The Regr/Class tab allows users to do both BLR and SVMs
analysis. As shown in Fig. 8, the Kernel tab lets users choose a kernel function and its
parameters (e.g., gamma (γ)). User can define his/her own kernel function if necessary (see
the User Defined textbox on the left window). The Learning tab allows users to select the

learning regularization parameter C. User can also decide if any inconsistent training
samples should be removed in the learning stage (see the check box on the right window).
After regression or classification using the training data, the estimated model is then
used to make predictions using the test data. This step is done using the Prediction tab. It
should be noted that both the regression/classification and the prediction modules can
provide the measures of modeling accuracy, conduct statistical tests, and report the results.

5 Experimental results

urban conversions between 1984–1992, 1992–1997, and 1997–2002 for New Castle

county. A subset of this information was randomly selected from the whole sample dataset
(see description in Section 3.3) to build up the SVMs model. This model was then applied
to another subset (henceforth called test dataset) to cross validate the model. Once the
model performed satisfactorily, it was tested against the whole sample dataset to validate its
applicability. In these processes, the performance of SVMs was also compared with the
widely used BLR. The percentage correctly predicted (PCP) measured using the agreement
between a classification and the actual land use (i.e., PCP = number of correctly classified (/
predicted) cells/ total number of cells) was utilized to assess the goodness-of-fit of both
models.

5.1 Parameters selection for SVMs

In this study, spherical kernels, specifically Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels,
were used because they have been shown to be effective in ill-posed classification problems
[2]. Once the kernel function has been chosen, the accuracy of classification by an SVM is
dependent on the magnitude of the parameters C and γ. Consequently, the magnitude of C
and γ must be determined carefully. In practice, a high generalization capability may be
obtained by setting γ appropriately for a given value for C. During the training phase, the
parameters C and γ were selected according to a k-fold cross validation (CV) procedure.
The training data was randomly split into k mutually exclusive subsets of equal size and
used to train a SVM classifier modeled with the predefined values of C and γ (k is 5 in our
case). Each time, we kept one of the subsets from training and used it only to obtain an
estimate of the classification accuracy. The k resultant estimates were averaged to yield the
classification accuracy for the SVM classifier. The best SVM classifier parameter values
were chosen to maximize the classification accuracy. In this paper, we used a five-fold CV
by varying the values of C and γ in the ranges [0.1, 100] and [0.05, 5], respectively. Figure 9
shows the relationships between the classification accuracy and γ for the training data and
test data with C equal to 25. It is apparent that there is a tendency for the SVMs to over fit
the training data, yielding a classifier that may generalize poorly with a large value of γ. It
can also be seen from Fig. 9 that the best value obtained for the parameter was γ=0.8 for
the 84–92 and 97–02 datasets, while γ=1.0 was the best value for the 92–97 dataset.

5.2 Comparison of SVMs with logistic regression

As mentioned in Section 3, to demonstrate the effectiveness of SVMs, the estimation results
were compared with those obtained from a corresponding BLR model. In addition to the
the difference between the
PCP which measures the goodness-of-fit of the models,
accuracies achieved by the two methods was also assessed using McNamara’s test (see
[1, 9]). This test is based on the standardized normal test statistic:

Z ¼

f12 (cid:2) f21
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
p
f12 þ f21

where f12 denotes the number of samples classified correctly and wrongly by the first and
second models, respectively. Accordingly, f12 and f21 are the counts of classified samples on
which the considered first and second models disagree. A lower prediction error (higher
accuracy) is identified by the sign on Z. A negative sign indicates that the results from f12
are more accurate than the results from model f21. At the commonly used 5% level of
significance,
the difference in the accuracies between the first and second models is
evaluated to be statistically significant if Zj

j > 1:96 [9].

Table 1 shows a comparison of the performances between SVMs and BLR for the test
dataset. Those numbers highlighted are correctly predicted and the overall PCP is the sum of
the highlighted divided by the total number of cells. It can be seen from Table 1 that the
predicted accuracy of SVMs was 82.54%, 88.5% and 87.7%, respectively, while that of BLR
was only 76.6%, 80.9% and 78.6%, respectively. These results showed that SVMs achieved
better prediction accuracies than BLR with the three periods New Castle dataset. The
McNamara test’s Z value for the three periods based on Eq. 21 was −1.99, −2.16 and −2.71,
j > 1:96), indicating
respectively (all of them exceeding the 5% level of significance with Zj
that the difference in the accuracies achieved by the two methods is statistically significant.
In other words, SVMs outperformed BLR significantly for all the three period test datasets.
The above cross validation using a test dataset verified the effectiveness of SVMs. Sub-
sequently, the SVM model was applied to the whole sample dataset to test its validity again.

Table 2 shows the comparison results. SVMs achieved the accuracy of 79.7%, 82.8%, and
82.76% for the 1984–1992, 1992–1997, and 1997–2002 datasets, respectively, which are
higher than the corresponding values of 77.2%, 77.5%, and 79.1% for BLR. The Z-values
obtained for the significance test were –3.05, −3.84, and −2.76 for the three period datasets,
respectively, indicating again that the SVMs method outperformed BLR significantly.

As shown from the above comparisons, it is apparent that SVMs with the optimal kernel
function and parameters achieved a better performance than BLR. The significant
difference between the two models was also corroborated by McNamara’s test.

6 Discussion

As demonstrated in the last section, SVMs have proved to be an efficient tool for land use
change analysis. The analysis using SVMs is obtained by solving a quadratic programming
problem using a highly effective analytical approach. This method is very efficient for a
large data set and will also ensure a global optimal solution. In addition, the solution of
SVMs is only dependent on the support vectors and the influence of support vector is
bounded. Therefore, SVMs are insensitive to small noises and are thus robust in noisy and
complex domains. Moreover, flexibility in the kernel functions allows the SVMs to search a
wide variety of hypothetical spaces and thus making it possible to explore some unknown
patterns embedded in the data.

SVMs use kernel functions to map the non-linear decision boundaries in the input space
into a linear boundary in a higher dimensional feature space. It should be noted that the type
and parameter configuration of the kernel function selected will have an impact on the
proper setting of the feature space and the shape of such a “linear” boundary which will
influence the performance of the SVMs. Our experiment results revealed that a RBF kernel
with γ=0.8 and C=25 was the best for SVMs when it was applied to modeling urban
growth in New Castle County, Delaware. The performance of SVMs depends on a proper
setting of the parameters together. A separate optimization of each parameter is not sufficient
to find the optimal parameter setting. In this study, we used the common search by

enumerations to obtain the optimal SVMs model parameters. However, some novel studies
have attempted to use analytical prescription [4], genetic algorithms (GA) and the simplex
search technique [19] to search for an optimal combination of SVMs model parameters.

Despite its many advantages, the SVMs model still has some weaknesses. Compared to
regression techniques that can give a transparent pattern in the data and the relative
importance of different predictive factors, a SVMs model is a non-parametric approach that
provides some support vectors that dominate the model [20]. How to formulate the pattern
explicitly from the optimal kernel function and support vectors still requires further study.

7 Conclusion

This study explored a new method, support vector machines, for rural–urban land use change
analysis. An effective method on eliminating spatial autocorrelation was also attempted.
Experiments on different test datasets demonstrated that SVMs performed well in deriving
the land use change patterns. Clearly, SVMs provide a new and effective option for urban
growth modeling and other similar applications, e.g., deforestation and desertification.

Our case study showed that a well-optimized SVMs model with optimal kernel
parameter outperformed the commonly used logistic regression model with respect to land
use change modeling. The difference in the two approaches has also been substantiated by
the McNamara test. Nevertheless, the performance of SVMs depends greatly on the settings
of the SVMs model parameters. A more efficient approach should be developed to identify
the optimal model parameters in regards to a specific dataset and an explicit approach to
interpreting the patterns from the optimal kernel function and support vectors should also
be examined in future investigations.

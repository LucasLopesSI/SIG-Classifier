Abstract

Anyone involved in teaching the principles and applications 

of geographic information science and technology (GIS&T) 

understands  the  challenges  of  effective  instruction  within 

an environment subject to nearly constant change. Indeed, 

the  dynamic  nature  of  GIS&T  introduces  both  new  para-

digms and increasingly powerful tools for exploring spatial 

relationships. However, while past efforts among educators 

and practitioners have identified knowledge and competen-

cies  important  to  GIS&T  learning,  less  attention  has  been 

directed  at  methods  used  to  teach  GIS&T.  For  example, 

while some instructors employ traditional approaches such 

as lectures and structured laboratory exercises, others have 

shifted  to  active  learning  strategies  such  as  “flipped  class-

rooms”  and  collaborative,  project‐oriented  assignments.  In 

this article, we assess the pedagogical approaches used to 

teach  GIS&T  courses  through  an  Internet‐based  survey  of 

318  college  and  university  faculty.  Our  findings  demon-

strate  that  active  learning  pedagogies  are  becoming  more 

firmly  established,  supplementing  or  replacing  traditional 

teaching approaches. Contrary to our assumptions, age and 

teaching experience are not factors that influence the adop-

tion  of  active  learning  strategies.  Along  with  assessing  in-

structional approaches, our survey identifies the challenges 

associated  with  teaching  GIS&T,  as  identified  by  survey 

respondents.

Successful learning often emerges from discordant ingredients. Along with helping students master the principles 

and concepts that serve as a foundation for more advanced work, geographic information science and technology 

(GIS&T) courses can be designed to address learning objectives that promote creative thinking, advance prob-

lem‐solving skills, and foster collaboration. A few elements set GIS&T learning activities apart from instruction of-

fered elsewhere on campus. Like instructors in other fields (i.e., library and information science—LIS; see Agosto, 

Rozaklis,  MacDonald,  &  Abels,  2010),  GIS&T  instructors  work  within  a  learning  environment  characterized  by 

nearly constant change as technologies and methodologies influence the development of new types of knowledge 

and  instructional  approaches.  At  the  same  time,  the  dynamic  nature  of  GIS&T  instruction  is  shaped  by  human 

factors, especially within introductory courses taken by students with a wide range of backgrounds, aptitudes, 

and interests.

GIS made its higher education debut in the 1970s as an advanced topic within graduate seminars. Accessible 

through shared time on mainframe computers, early GIS was difficult to learn and use. As Goodchild (1985) notes, 

GIS software was not easily adapted from graduate learning environments to undergraduate instruction. By the 

late 1990s, software that could be used on less expensive desktop computers facilitated the widespread adop-

tion of GIS (Chalmers, 2002), as well as a demand for undergraduate GIS courses and eventually, broader course 

sequences  culminating  in  academic  certificates  and  degrees  (Wikle,  2018).  However,  the  absence  of  teaching 

materials contributed to challenges in planning and developing early GIS courses, with instructors often creating 

their own materials or adapting lecture notes, media, or laboratory activities disseminated through projects such 

as the NCGIA Core Curriculum in GIS (Tate & Unwin, 2009) and GISTutor (Raper & Green, 1992).

Today’s GIS&T instructors have access to a wealth of GIS&T materials. However, while practitioners and ed-

ucators have worked to identify the knowledge and competencies needed by GIS&T users, there has been less 

effort focused on strategies and methods for helping students learn GIS&T principles and applications. Without 

knowledge or experience tied to alternative pedagogies, educators may fall back on familiar approaches such as 

passive lectures and structured exercises. Given the general lack of information concerning approaches used to 

teach  GIS&T,  this  article  provides  an  overview  of  pedagogical  strategies  employed  by  a  sample  of  college  and 

university GIS&T instructors. Along with questions about teaching methods, we sought to identify challenges and 

perceived barriers to effective GIS&T instruction.

1.1 | GIS&T knowledge and competencies

A  longstanding  topic  among  GIS&T  educators  is  the  need  to  balance  time  devoted  to  principles  and  concepts 

with “hands‐on” activities designed to develop problem‐solving skills involving GIS software (King, 1991; Kemp, 

Goodchild, & Dobson, 1992; Deadman, Hall, Bain, Elliot, & Dudycha, 2000; Fagin & Wikle, 2011; Bearman, Jones, 

André, Alberto Cachinho, & DeMers, 2016). This issue has been noted in other technological fields, such as com-

puter science (Titterton, Lewis, & Clancy, 2010) and LIS (Shaw & Okada, 2001). Other GIS&T research has ad-

dressed career preparation by looking at the “half‐life” of software knowledge (Wikle, 2010; Whyatt, Lewis, & 

Clancy, 2011) or the need for problem‐solvers capable of working with “messy” data (Mathews & Wikle, 2017). 

Over the last 25 years the GIS&T community has made significant progress in identifying knowledge important 

to new geospatial professionals. Beginning in the late 1990s, educators and practitioners began outlining a com-

prehensive set of subjects that later emerged as the GIS&T Body of Knowledge (BoK) (Prager & Plewe, 2009) and 

more recently, the web‐based GIS&T BoK2 (Wilson, 2014; gistbok.ucgis.org). Similar to the BoK, the Geospatial 

Technology Competency Model (GTCM) offers guidance for preparing GIS&T professionals (DOLETA; see DiBiase 

et al., 2010; Veenendaal, 2014; Career One Stop, 2018). However, while serving as resources for defining what stu-

dents should know and be capable of accomplishing (e.g., learning objectives, instructional assessment questions), 

MATHEWS And WIKLE    |  3

the BoK and GTCM were not intended to offer strategies for teaching GIS&T (see Howarth & Sinton, 2011; Baker, 

Kerski, Huynh, Viehrig, & Bednarz, 2012; Baker et al., 2015; Ricker & Thatcher, 2017).

1.2 | GIS&T pedagogies

Outside of its use within K‐12 classrooms (Kerski, 2003; Bednarz, 2004; Doering, 2004), methods and strategies 

for teaching GIS&T have received limited scholarly attention. Some research within higher education has explored 

methods for teaching the foundational knowledge needed for applying GIS&T in problem‐solving (see Table 1). 

For  example,  studies  have  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  GIS&T  using  field‐based  instruction  (Carlson,  2007), 

problem‐based learning (PBL) (Drennon, 2005; Shulz, 2012), and service learning (Schlossberg & Wyss, 2007). By 

creating activities closely associated with real‐world problems and issues, PBL and related methods (i.e., inquiry‐

based learning) have been shown to promote higher‐order learning and critical thinking skills within both GIS&T 

and  geography  (Aangeenbrug,  1992;  Chen,  1998;  Wilder,  Brinkerhoff,  &  Higgins,  2003;  Drennon,  2005;  Reed, 

2010; Howarth & Sinton, 2011; Oyana, 2012; Shulz, 2012; Weiss, 2017). Other fields that have benefitted from 

these  methods  include  environmental  education  (Ratinen  &  Keinonen,  2011),  science  (van  Joolingen,  de  Jong, 

&  Dimitrakopoulou,  2007),  geology  (Apedoe, Walker,  &  Reeves,  2018),  physics  (Sorensen,  McBride,  &  Rebello, 

2011), chemistry (Nedungadi, Malini, & Raman, 2015), and biology (Carrió et al., 2016). One successful example of 

using PBL in GIS&T instruction is illustrated by field‐based exercises, where data captured using Global Navigation 

Satellite  System  (GNSS)  receivers  (e.g.,  GPS,  GLONASS)  are  integrated  within  GIS  (Carlson,  2007;  Miller  et  al., 

2007; Favier & van der Schee, 2009). Importantly, PBL approaches can emphasize both soft skills (e.g., group work, 

planning) and principal course themes (e.g., map reading, GNSS data collection and GIS integration, GIS analyses; 

Scheyvens, Griffin, Jocoy, Liu, & Bradford, 2008). Other research has highlighted the usefulness of writing assign-

ments in teaching GIS&T concepts (Erlien, 2011), hybrid methods for teaching GIS&T principles that utilize self‐

paced multimedia modules (Zerger, Bishop, Escobar, & Hunter, 2002; Kamruzzamen, 2014), and the effectiveness 

of massive open online courses (MOOC) in GIS&T instruction (Belgiu, Strobl, & Wallentin, 2015). Despite the suc-

cess of PBL and related methods, questions remain about the most effective way of teaching GIS&T (Baker et al.,  

2012) and developing effective GIS&T curricula (Baker et al., 2015).

The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, which was formulated by Shulman 

(1987), advanced by Mishra and Koehler (2006), and most recently applied to GIS by Rickles, Ellul, and Haklay 

(2017), conceptualizes knowledge areas for instructors as falling within three broad categories: (1) content (e.g., 

subject matter expertise; often supported by structured resources like the GIS&T BoK); (2) technology (e.g., un-

derstanding and utilizing technologies and digital resources; commonly focused on the use of GIS in the class-

room via a laboratory component); and (3) pedagogy (e.g., comprehension of teaching and learning processes and

specific approaches/methods such as experiential learning, etc.). Regarding the latter, the need for improved ped-

agogical approaches in teaching GIS&T has been highlighted by recent surveys of employers suggesting that new 

geospatial professionals are often poorly prepared to take on real‐world problems (Solem, Cheung, & Schlemper, 

2008; Sinton, 2012; Wikle & Fagin, 2015; Mathews & Wikle, 2017).

1.3 | Active learning strategies and GIS&T

Compared to traditional teaching methods where students are expected to passively absorb course content, ac-

tive learning strategies encourage interactivity and learning‐by‐doing (Klein, 2003; Scheyvens et al., 2008). These 

student‐centered approaches are also well documented outside of GIS&T (see Preston, 2006; Rudduck & Fielding, 

2006; Falkner & Falkner, 2012; Bailey & Ponnusamy, 2016; Lima, Andersson, & Saalman, 2016; Park, 2018). Along 

with  facilitating  student  engagement,  active  learning  encourages  elements  of  critical  thinking  through  student 

reflection (Scheyvens et al., 2008) and student‐driven problem‐solving that may involve real‐world data (Conners, 

McCown, & Roskos‐Ewoldsen, 1998). In terms of scope, active learning includes a range of strategies with vary-

ing levels of student engagement, such as “flipped” classrooms where meeting times are reorganized to replace 

traditional  lectures  with  student‐centered  activities.  Students  in  flipped  classrooms  review  assigned  readings, 

instructor notes, or other material in advance of class meetings, enabling class time to focus on productive open‐

ended discussion or collaborative learning activities (Al‐Zaharani, 2015; O’Flaherty & Phillips, 2015; Reidsema, 

Kavanagh,  Hadgraft,  &  Smith,  2017).  Similar  active  learning  methods  include  “think–pair–share,”  which  can  be 

introduced using a formal reading assignment or lecture presentation followed by a series of questions posed by 

the instructor. Students subsequently write reflective statements and then work in pairs or small groups to discuss 

and complete assignments. Although not focused on GIS&T instruction, several previous studies demonstrate the 

effectiveness of active learning in increasing student engagement and performance (see Poirer & Feldman, 2007; 

Bergmann & Sams, 2012; Berrett, 2012; Camacho‐Miñano & del Campo, 2014; Estes, Ingram, & Liu, 2014; Prahl, 

2017; Lee & Shahrill, 2018). Some disadvantages of active learning strategies have also been noted, such as the 

added time needed for preparing materials (Hanson & Moser, 2003; although Scheyvens et al., 2008 suggest oth-

erwise) and challenges presented by large class sizes (Bonwell & Eison, 1991). A few colleges and universities have 

implemented innovative pedagogical approaches for teaching GIS&T. For example, one institution experimented 

with replacing all GIS&T lectures with learning modules completed using a supervised face‐to‐face or online envi-

ronment (Clark, Monk, & Yool, 2007). Another involved augmenting traditional GIS&T lectures with laboratory and 

discussion sections that facilitate collaborative learning (DiBiase, 1996). Despite benefits associated with active 

pedagogical approaches, a recent survey of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields dem-

onstrates that the majority of college and university instructors continue to rely on passive, lecture‐based instruc-

tional methods (Stains et al., 2018). As noted by Şeremet and Chalkley (2015), GIS&T courses are no exception.

1.4 | Pedagogy in GIS&T laboratory instruction

Laboratory exercises and activities used in GIS&T instruction are organized in several ways. For example, “con-

trolled” exercises and assignments with known results (see Figure 1) offer benefits by allowing students to work at 

their own pace in arriving at solutions that are relatively easy to assess. Controlled assignments also help students 

develop basic skills that serve as a foundation for more advanced methods. However, depending on how instruc-

tions are presented, controlled or “canned” activities completed in isolation may leave an impression that GIS&T 

problem‐solving is accomplished through a linear series of steps and in the absence of innovation and/or collabo-

ration. Given the need to provide a foundation for later work, controlled and other structured assignments are 

best suited for introducing concepts and processes at early stages of an academic term. Finally, towards the end 

of a term, students are provided with opportunities to demonstrate independence and creativity while working in 

a collaborative environment as they solve problems. A modified version of this approach has been suggested by 

MATHEWS And WIKLE    |  5

F I G U R E   1  A conceptualization of GIS&T instructional approaches

Rahn and Zygo (2004), who have experimented with having students design their own GIS&T exercises which are 

subsequently peer reviewed by classmates. Another, “lab‐centric” approach used in computer science allocates 

nearly all class time to laboratory skills (see Titterton et al., 2010).

1.5 | A conceptualization of GIS&T instruction

Figure 1 offers a summary of GIS&T instructional approaches incorporating separate lecture and laboratory com-

ponents, where each element can be introduced along a spectrum that extends from passive to active learning. 

Although not represented in the figure, blending lecture and laboratory components is another option (and spec-

trum). Instructors adopting passive approaches for both components would, for example, rely on the traditional 

lecture format to cover concepts supported by workbook exercises and hands‐on demonstrations. A completely 

active approach might involve the use of a flipped classroom where class discussion explores concepts and ap-

plied work emphasizes industry‐driven projects (including teamwork, coordination with an industry partner, etc.).

2 |  DATA A N D  M E TH O DS

Equipped with a background about issues relevant to GIS&T instruction in higher education, we set out to explore 

pedagogical approaches and challenges associated with teaching GIS&T. In June 2016, an email was sent to 1,712 

university and college GIS&T instructors identified through an investigation of websites and keyword searches. 

An introductory message explained project objectives and included a request to complete a brief questionnaire 

via SurveyMonkey.com. A total of 222 messages were returned due to invalid email addresses (e.g., no longer an 

active account, retired, moved to a different college/university, etc.), leaving 1,490 valid email addresses. From 

this group, 318 instructors completed the survey during the 45 days it remained open, providing a response rate 

of 21%.

The survey included 26 questions formatted as yes/no or multiple‐choice options, check boxes, Likert scales, 

and open‐ended responses (see Table 2). Along with information about GIS&T instruction, the survey gathered

demographic  data  (age,  gender,  and  ethnicity)  and  information  about  respondents’  discipline/department,  aca-

demic  position,  and  the  setting  where  they  teach  (e.g.,  community  college,  4‐year  teaching  college/university, 

or  4‐year  and  graduate  research  college/university).  Other  questions  asked  about  teaching  experience,  GIS&T 

course  offerings  at  their  institution,  enrollment  within  GIS&T  courses,  teaching  resources  (i.e.,  textbook  used), 

pedagogical approaches, and course organization.

Along  with  basic  questions,  respondents  were  asked  to  identify  their  level  of  agreement  with  statements 

about four elements of GIS instruction: (1) resources needed for teaching GIS&T; (2) students; (3) teaching and 

learning approaches; and (4) how student performance is evaluated. Respondents were asked to evaluate their 

level of agreement using a five‐point Likert scale from “strongly agree” to “agree,” “neutral/no opinion,” “disagree,” 

or  “strongly  disagree.”  In  addition,  respondents  were  asked  to  assess  additional  statements  using  a  scale  with 

choices that ranged from “always” to “often,” “sometimes,” “rarely,” or “never.” Examples of statements included 

“Available GIS textbooks are well‐suited for learning objectives in my course” and “Frequent changes in GIS soft-

ware force me to revise lab assignments often.” Additional open‐ended questions were included to provide an 

opportunity for respondents to identify instructional challenges not listed on the survey and to offer other sug-

gestions or observations. Basic statistical tests were used to summarize scores while open‐ended questions were 

summarized on the basis of common themes.

3.1 | Survey respondents

The largest proportion of respondents were between 45 and 64, with about 34% between 35 and 44 and 11% 

between 25 and 34 (Figure 2). The remainder were 65 and over or did not disclose their age. About 74% were 

male and 75% identified their race/ethnicity as White. The second largest racial/ethnic group was Asians (12%), 

MATHEWS And WIKLE    |  7

F I G U R E   2  Characteristics of surveyed GIS&T instructors

followed by Hispanic/Latino (4%), Black (2%), and American Indian/Alaskan Native (<1%). A small percentage (1%) 

identified as members of two or more racial/ethnic groups and slightly more than 20% indicated that English is 

not their first language.

In  terms  of  professional  background,  nearly  50%  of  respondents  were  tenured  faculty  with  titles  such  as 

Associate Professor or Professor. About 22% were Assistant Professors and another 22% identified themselves 

as  Instructors,  Lecturers,  Adjunct  Professors,  or  Visiting  Professors.  The  remaining  6%  reported  other  titles, 

including  Emeritus  Faculty,  Postdoctoral  Fellow,  GIS  Specialist,  Research  Assistant  Professor,  Senior  Academic 

Professional, or GIS Coordinator/Director. In terms of institution, the bulk of respondents are employed by 4‐year 

research colleges/universities (60%) or 4‐year teaching colleges/universities (34%), with a smaller number serving 

as instructors at community colleges (6%).

Survey  respondents  reported  considerable  experience,  with  over  52%  having  taught  GIS  for  more  than 

10 years (see Figure 2). An additional 21% have taught GIS courses for 6–10 years and 19% for 2–5 years. The 

remaining  8%  have  taught  for  less  than  2 years.  A  majority  of  respondents  reported  Geography  (55%)  or  GIS/

GIScience (13%) as the discipline where they received their academic training. Others represented in our sample 

included Environmental Science (5%), Natural Resources (e.g., Forestry or Land Management) (4%), Geology (4%), 

Planning  (3%),  and  Agriculture  (2%).  A  few  were  trained  in  disciplines  such  as  Computer  Science,  Engineering, 

Archaeology,  Political  Science,  Sociology,  Architecture,  History,  Park  Management,  Public  Health,  and  Social 

Sciences. Respondents were evenly split among those teaching only undergraduates on their courses (45%) and 

those who teach both undergraduates and graduate students (47%). A small percentage (8%) teach only at the 

graduate level. In terms of class size, most courses taught by respondents had 11 to 30 students (68%), with about 

10% having 10 or fewer students and 22% more than 30 students.

3.2 | How do GIS&T instructors teach?

Additional  survey  questions  enabled  us  to  characterize  the  environment  where  GIS&T  instruction  takes  place. 

Our data reveal a wide range of GIS coursework being taught on respondents’ campuses with almost half (49%) 

indicating that their institution offers six or more GIS&T courses during an academic year (not including independ-

ent study courses). In terms of resources used in teaching, about 78% of instructors require a textbook (print or 

digital) and 34% a lab manual (print or digital). Concerning how instructional activities are organized, 92% utilize 

classroom  time  for  demonstrating  GIS  software,  89%  for  traditional  lectures,  and  56%  for  class  discussion.  A 

majority of instructors (68%) utilize web‐based platforms such as Blackboard and D2L/eLearning. The survey also 

revealed that newer instructional methods are making headway in GIS&T instruction. For example, 19% of GIS&T 

instructors employ flipped classrooms and 25% use active learning activities (e.g., think–pair–share). Other active 

learning methods are less well integrated within GIS&T instruction, such as interactive tools for anonymous feed-

back (e.g., clickers, smartphone apps), used by just 8% of respondents.

Our examination of GIS&T pedagogy yielded some noteworthy findings about the relative importance of cap-

stone  assignments  and  the  extent  to  which  instructors  utilize  active  approaches  in  the  laboratory  portion  of 

courses  that  require  students  to  participate  in  collaborative  projects  and/or  fieldwork.  For  example,  an  over-

whelming majority of instructors (88%) require students to complete a final project. In addition, slightly more than 

three‐quarters (76%) have students present project findings (orally or as a poster display). Collaborative learning is 

also important, with over half (55%) of instructors requiring students to complete one or more group assignments. 

A  larger  number  (59%)  require  one  or  more  assignments  involving  fieldwork  and  65%  have  students  use  data 

provided by external clients. A limited number of questions about course content were included in the survey. For 

example, more than half of respondents (56%) discuss ethical issues tied to GIS with their students.

Along with questions about learning elements, we included survey questions designed to assess class time de-

voted to lecture meetings as opposed to time earmarked for laboratory instruction. About two‐thirds of respon-

dents (64%) indicated that the GIS courses they teach feature labs that meet separately from lecture meetings. 

In terms of materials used in the lab, about half (49%) use unique lab exercises or other assignments that they or 

a colleague has authored in lieu of “canned” exercises from published workbooks or other widely disseminated 

sources. Another 41% use a combination of self‐authored and externally produced exercises and activities. The 

vast  majority  of  respondents  (81%)  indicated  that  course  materials  (lecture  presentations  and  laboratory  exer-

cises/activities) are revised at least yearly.

GIS&T educators were also asked about methods for evaluating student performance. One surprise was the 

relatively  low  rating  respondents  assigned  to  examinations  as  tools  to  assess  mastery  of  conceptual  material. 

Slightly  more  than  half  (54%)  agreed  or  strongly  agreed  that  tests  provide  an  accurate  reflection  of  students’ 

understanding of concepts and principles (Table 3). In comparison, 74% agreed or strongly agreed that lab‐based 

exams provide a useful assessment of student learning. Of all types of assessment listed, GIS projects received the 

highest rating, with 86% of respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing that they are a useful method for assessing 

students’ knowledge and/or competency.

3.3 | Challenges in teaching GIS&T

Our questionnaire also sought information about the challenges instructors face in teaching GIS&T. In examining 

resources that facilitate learning, a majority of respondents (53%) agree or strongly agree that the GIS textbook 

they use is well suited to the objectives of the course(s) they teach (Table 4). In comparison, student readiness 

for working with quantitative data was cited as a problem by nearly two‐thirds (64%) of respondents (Table 5). 

Likewise, a majority of instructors (66%) cited problems with students being able to apply GIS&T concepts and 

procedures.

Another set of questions was aimed at assessing barriers to effective teaching. A Likert‐scale rating was used 

to  illicit  how  often  instructors  perceived  a  problem,  from  “never”  to  “rarely,”  “sometimes,”  “often,”  or  “always.” 

Problems with students’ mastery of theoretical and conceptual issues were identified by the largest percentage 

of  instructors,  with  around  42%  indicating  “often”  or  “always”  (Table  6).  In  contrast,  having  a  diverse  range  of 

academic majors within a course was not perceived as a challenge by most instructors. Instructors did express 

frustration that they are not rewarded for time dedicated to revising lab assignments, with nearly two‐thirds (60%) 

agreeing or strongly agreeing that preparation time goes unacknowledged or unrewarded (Table 7).

these unstructured responses overlapped significantly, we elected to aggregate the two questions and summarize 

the most frequently mentioned themes and observations.

Several respondents expressed concern about their students’ lack of basic computer skills. Specific examples 

included struggles in finding, organizing, and naming files, difficulty working with compressed data (i.e., zip files), 

problems  mapping  network  drives,  and  other  simple  tasks  such  as  downloading  shared  datasets.  Respondents 

noted  that  students’  lack  of  basic  skills  sometimes  hampered  progress  in  the  completion  of  lab  exercises  and 

other class activities. Another theme centered on the time needed by instructors to stay up‐to‐date on trends 

and developments in GIS&T. Respondents mentioned the desire to become better versed on topics such as vol-

unteered geographic information, big data, unmanned aircraft system (UAS)‐based data collection, and advanced 

geocomputation. Many also mentioned problems keeping up with software updates and how their lack of time 

or access to resources has become a barrier to participation in professional development opportunities. As one 

instructor noted, “Prep and re‐prep time for GIS classes greatly exceeds non‐GIS classes because of the rapid pace 

of technology change, software version changes (will this version break my class?) and textbook updates. This is 

not accounted for in workloads.” Concerning teaching resources, a few respondents drew attention to variation 

in the quality of GIS textbooks now on the market. One was critical of workbook‐style texts designed for specific 

software packages and their poor coverage of conceptual information, suggesting that some instructors use them 

as a “crutch” to avoid developing or revising their own labs. Another suggested that in lieu of “recipe‐style” labs 

with step‐by‐step instructions, students should find and document their own solutions that can subsequently be 

applied to future tasks and projects. Some shared frustration over the focus of many GIS&T textbooks on Esri’s 

suite of software, with one suggesting the need for “software‐neutral” GIS&T materials that take advantage of 

open‐source alternatives such as QGIS or GRASS GIS.

Another theme mentioned in open‐ended comments was a preoccupation among some students with learning 

to use GIS software at the expense of becoming familiar with the principles and foundations of GIS. One respon-

dent likened students who maintain a singular focus on GIS software to people seeking to become effective writ-

ers who are preoccupied with learning word‐processing software. A few respondents mentioned how web‐based 

assignments can play a role in improving students’ critical thinking skills. For example, take‐home assignments 

accessible via web‐based GIS platforms (e.g., arcgis.com) can potentially help students understand the principles 

and theoretical concepts within an environment influenced by technical and/or software problems. The flexibility 

of web‐based assignments also enables instructors to tailor course material for the needs of specific students or 

groups.

Finally, open‐ended questions provided a forum for recommendations about pedagogical approaches useful 

in  teaching  GIS&T.  For  example,  several  highlighted  the  value  of  project‐oriented  assignments  or  noted  possi-

bilities  for  using  combinations  of  lecture,  lab,  and  small‐group  assignments.  As  one  respondent  noted:  the  use 

of  lectures  to  address  concepts,  labs  to  provide  practice,  and  small  projects  to  help  students  understand  the 

integration of conceptual knowledge and practical skills. Others stressed the benefits of take‐home work (either 

MATHEWS And WIKLE12  |    

digital or analog) as a means of encouraging students to hone geospatial problem‐solving skills. In terms of active 

approaches, some respondents emphasized the benefits of flipped classrooms for lower‐level courses where lec-

ture time is reserved for discussing case studies. Another suggestion was to allocate laboratory time to web‐based 

GIS technologies within lower‐level GIS&T courses as a means of addressing the steep learning curve needed to 

gain proficiency with desktop GIS platforms.

The findings from our questionnaire offer a foundation to make observations about trends in pedagogical tools 

and methods used to teach GIS&T. Without question, lecture sessions and other traditional teaching approaches 

have retained their importance within GIS&T instruction. Likewise, textbooks continue to be emphasized as peda-

gogical tools for out‐of‐class learning. Over 85% of survey respondents require students to purchase a textbook 

for the classes they teach (see Frazier, Wikle, & Kedron, 2017). While textbooks are perceived as being important, 

some respondents were critical about their depth of coverage, especially with respect to workbook‐style options 

designed for use with specific software packages. Importantly, the survey demonstrated that some GIS&T instruc-

tors supplement or replace traditional lecture‐style instruction with active learning strategies including anony-

mous feedback (e.g., clickers), think–pair–share methods, and flipped classrooms. Although it is difficult to say the 

extent to which GIS&T instructors implement active learning methods compared to their non‐GIS&T peers, it ap-

pears that such methods are well established within GIS&T instruction. Not surprisingly, our findings suggest that 

active teaching strategies are more firmly established within GIS&T laboratories (i.e., with collaborative projects) 

than in non‐laboratory (i.e., lecture‐based) class settings.

A few findings came as a surprise. For example, we assumed that instructors would cite problems with stu-

dents lacking prerequisite coursework, but this was not the case. A more significant problem was a general lack 

of quantitative skills, a finding consistent with “math anxiety” that has been observed in fields such as psychol-

ogy (Conners et al., 1998). Respondents also noted that many students underestimate the difficulty of learning 

GIS concepts and procedures. Consistent with Kedron, Frazier, Greene, and Mitchell (2016), a large number of 

respondents expressed concern that theoretical and foundational aspects of GIS are taking a back seat within 

GIS&T instruction. Practical course elements were also problematic, with nearly 40% of respondents agreeing or 

strongly agreeing that their students have difficulty completing assignments without instructor help or oversight. 

Concerning the methods used to evaluate student performance, most respondents expressed confidence in tradi-

tional methods of student evaluation such as examinations and project‐based assignments (although, as previously 

noted, respondents were less confident in non‐lab exams compared to lab exams and project‐based assignments).

A  positive  trend  for  GIS&T  instruction  is  the  relatively  low  percentage  of  instructors  who  identified  hard-

ware or software issues as barriers to student learning. Likewise, scheduling limitations involving open lab hours 

for students to complete exercises or other assignments were not identified as significant barriers. Additionally, 

we were surprised to find few differences among respondents in their use of active learning approaches when 

comparing teaching versus research‐oriented universities/colleges and across faculty by rank, position, or years 

of teaching experience. This challenged our assumption that early‐career faculty might be more likely to utilize 

active  approaches  within  their  instruction  compared  to  senior  faculty.  Concerning  our  approach  to  identifying 

instructional challenges and barriers, a limitation was our inability to separately identify GIS&T‐specific problems 

from general teaching issues that impact other academic disciplines. Several respondents alluded to this in the 

open‐ended portion of our survey, noting that many or most of the teaching challenges they face are also issues 

within non‐GIS&T courses. This continues to be a hurdle for GIS&T education research (e.g., evaluating how GIS&T 

instructional practices improve spatial thinking and problem‐solving ability; see Lee & Bednarz, 2009).

In considering our look at teaching approaches and challenges, it is possible to identify a few “take‐away” thoughts 

that may be useful for planning and organizing GIS&T courses and programs. First, the survey underscored the 

importance of students receiving a solid conceptual foundation. At least some educators noted that their students 

underestimate the difficulty of becoming well versed in GIS&T principles and concepts. Another lesson is that the 

teaching strategy selected for a given GIS&T course should avoid committing to a “one‐size‐fits‐all” model. For 

example, the approach used early in a term can be designed to help students understand basic concepts, with 

lecture‐style instruction or active learning methods supplemented by discussion as students acquire greater levels 

of knowledge and expertise. Likewise, the format and organization of lab exercises should evolve from structured 

assignments early in the term to more advanced problem‐solving activities and finally, active learning assignments 

that  emphasize  critical  thinking  and  collaboration.  While  laboratory  assignments  should  help  students  master 

GIS&T applications, they should be sequenced so that later assignments build on competencies acquired in earlier 

ones while also encouraging independence and creativity. Our survey demonstrated that some barriers of the past 

appear to have faded, including resource problems that once inhibited access to the GIS&T hardware and software 

needed for completing assignments or projects. However, a previously undocumented issue affecting GIS&T in-

struction is the difficulty experienced by respondents in staying up‐to‐date with rapid changes affecting GIS&T 

applications. Our survey revealed that the time needed for updating and revising exercises and course materials 

negatively influences the ability of some instructors to stay current with GIS&T innovations or developments in 

related geospatial areas.

Like other aspects of higher education, GIS&T instruction has been influenced by larger pedagogical trends. 

While  educators  and  students  benefit  from  active  learning  approaches  and  other  teaching  innovations,  GIS&T 

instruction presents its own unique challenges, in part because of its relative youth. While this article presents 

a cursory look at GIS&T teaching approaches, there is much to be done on this and related topics. For example, 

future work must delve deeply into the effectiveness of pedagogical approaches in supporting student learning. In 

the end, effective GIS&T instruction does not happen in a vacuum. Educators must be willing to experiment with 

and share successful strategies. At the same time, it remains important to engage potential employers and other 

stakeholders in an ongoing dialog about effective teaching methods and strategies.

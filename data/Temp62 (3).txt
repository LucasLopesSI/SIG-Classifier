Abstract
This paper presents a methodology for the evaluation of land condition and for the
allocation  of  areas  requiring  restoration.  It  is  based  on  spatial  simulation  analysis
and  fuzzy  logic.  The  method  is  demonstrated  in  a  restoration  allocation  problem
within a military training area in Texas. Fuzzy logic is integrated with spatial analysis
through Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to make land condition assessment
geographically speci(cid:222)c. Two sources of uncertainty in Land Condition Analysis are
considered in this paper. First is the uncertainty due to incomplete information on
land condition. Second is the uncertainty emanating from identifying the condition
of  a  particular  parcel  of  land.  The  (cid:222)rst  is  addressed  by  using  sequential  Gaussian
simulation, a geostatistical tool. Erosion status is selected as the land condition factor,
and  uncertainty  associated  with  it  is  considered  in  this  study.  Land  allocation  is
based  on  fuzzy  logic  to  re(cid:223)ect  the  continuous  transition  between  different  land
conditions and the minimization of loss that is expected to occur in the case of mis-
allocation. Various forms of loss functions are used for allocating areas in need of
restoration. An important result of the study is a map showing the areas allocated
for restoration. The proposed method is compared to two alternative methods with
varying  degrees  of  determinism  and  uncertainty.  The  incorporation  of  uncertainty
led to better allocation strategies and results that are more realistic.

1 Background

Uncertainty is pervasive in many real-world problems and must be addressed adequately.
For instance, in many decision-making situations, uncertainty exists and should be dealt with
in the assessment of alternatives (Mowrer 2000). Uncertainty is also important and has
been recognized in geostatistical studies (Goovaerts 1997, Burrough and McDonnell 1998).
Recently, Goovaerts (2001) reported an evaluation of kriging and simulation approaches
to uncertainty. For extensive reviews of the different geostatistical algorithms available
for  uncertainty  modeling,  readers  should  refer  to  recent  books  on  the  subject,  such  as
Goovaerts (1997), Deutsch and Journel (1998) or Chil(cid:142)s and Del(cid:222)ner (1999).

Fuzzy sets can be used to manifest a type of uncertainty where elements cannot be
de(cid:222)ned sharply. Uncertainty in the context of fuzzy sets implies inexactness or impreci-
sion, not in terms of randomness or probabilistic terms. Applications of fuzzy set theory
and fuzzy logic in soil science are wide-ranging. Tran et al. (2002) applied  fuzzy  logic
to  improve  the  performance  of  the  Revised  Universal  Soil  Loss  Equation  (RUSLE).
Alternatively, Mitra et al. (1998) used fuzzy logic in devising an alternative method to
soil  erosion  prediction,  which  requires  less  data  input  than  USLE  (Universal  Soil  Loss
Equation). McBratney and Odeh (1997) provided a broad overview of fuzzy logic with
an  in-depth  look  at  the  application  of  fuzzy  logic  in  soil  science  and  geostatistics.
Burrough  and  McDonnell  (1998)  is  another  good  source  on  the  use  of  fuzzy  logic  in
GIS. Klir and Yuan (1995, 1996) offer extensive reviews of the theory and application
of fuzzy logic.

Military training activities impact the environment and especially the soil. Military
training where artillery and large off-road vehicles are in operation can adversely affect
soil condition, thereby creating conditions leading to high rates of erosion. Hence, it is
important to continuously monitor soil condition and to restore the soil to its original
state.  The  Integrated  Training  Area  Management  (ITAM)  program  is  the  Army(cid:213)s  pro-
gram  for  managing  training  lands.  A  major  objective  of  the  ITAM  program  has  been
the  development  of  a  method  for  estimating  training  land  carrying  capacity,  which  is
de(cid:222)ned  as  the  amount  of  training  that  a  given  parcel  of  land  can  accommodate  in  a
sustainable  manner  based  on  a  balance  of  use,  condition,  and  maintenance  practices.
Evaluation  of  Land  Value  Study  (ELVS)  and  the  Army  Training  and  Testing  Area
Carrying  Capacity  (ATTACC)  methodologies  are  two  initiatives  designed  to  estimate
training  land  carrying  capacity  (Concepts  Analysis  Agency  1996,  Anderson  1999,  US
AEC 1999). In early versions of the ATTACC model, land condition was expressed in
terms of erosion status (ES). Nevertheless, uncertainties in the measured values of factors
affecting  land  condition  and  in  setting  land  condition  thresholds  were  not  included  in
the  analyses  (Diersing  et  al.  1992).  Although  there  are  other  land  management  studies
that deal with uncertainty, they generally address it in (cid:212)expected(cid:213) terms without explicit
regard to variability (Batabyal and Godfrey 2002).

Earlier,  Mendoza  et  al.  (2001)  described  a  methodology  for  predicting  land  con-
dition  in  military  installation  areas  disturbed  by  training  based  on  a  combination  of
indicators. Moreover, the use of (cid:212)thresholds(cid:213) to de(cid:222)ne reference values of the indicators
and  to  characterize  the  expected  impacts  was  also  explained.  Inherently,  the  model  is
deterministic  and  is  unable  to  accommodate  the  uncertainty  that  is  prevalent  in  any
assessment that is as complex as land condition analysis.

This paper focuses on handling risk and uncertainty in land condition analysis. In
this paper, land condition is assessed using erosion status while incorporating inherent

uncertainty  in  erosion  status  data  and  in  land  classi(cid:222)cation.  The  proposed  method
addresses  two  sources  of  uncertainty  in  land  condition  analysis  using  fuzzy  set  theory.
Moreover,  while  fuzzy  logic  allows  for  a  smoother  transition  between  different  land
condition  classes  rather  than  crisp  dichotomous  divisions,  sequential  Gaussian  simula-
tion  allows  for  the  consideration  of  variability  in  erosion  status  (ES)  data  rather  than
concentrating only on expected values. The impacts of risks, uncertainty, and impreci-
sion are re(cid:223)ected in terms of the expected costs of land maintenance and improvement.
The  expected  cost  is  treated  as  imprecise  or  uncertain  because  it  is  dependent  on  how
land condition is classi(cid:222)ed. Clearly, lands that are classi(cid:222)ed as being in better condition
will cost less to maintain and improve compared to other lands in poor condition. Fuzzy
logic  combined  with  spatial  simulation  are  appropriate  tools  for  dealing  with  such
uncertainty (Altman 1994).

To describe the amount of uncertainty and illustrate its impacts, this paper is organ-
ized into six sections. Section 2 describes the erosion model along with the uncertainties
revolving  around  the  establishment  of  thresholds  and  the  erosion  status  data  due  to
incomplete information. The use of fuzzy set theory and sequential Gaussian simulation
are  then  described  as  tools  to  accommodate  these  types  of  uncertainties,  respectively.
Following the presentation of the different forms or methods of estimating land condi-
tion threshold values, one formulation of uncertainty in terms of expected loss (using a
loss function concept) and the use of this formulation in allocating lands for restoration
are  described.  In  Section  3,  the  study  site  and  data  set  are  described  including  some
procedures  used  to  generate  the  data.  Section  4  describes  an  illustrative  example  fol-
lowed by a discussion of the results in Section 5. Finally, some concluding remarks are
presented in Section 6.

2 Methodology

2.1 Erosion Model

Modeling  soil  erosion  is  a  complex  problem  because  the  determination  of  soil  loss
depends not only on many factors but also on the interactions between these factors and
the  inputs  from  other  systems.  The  spatial  variability  in  the  factors  leading  to  soil
erosion may be very large, and the sensitivity of predicted soil loss to this variability can
vary  signi(cid:222)cantly  in  space.  Neglecting  the  variability  may  result  in  large  errors  in  the
prediction of soil loss, which may lead to improper decisions and conclusions (Wang et al.
2002).  Erosion  Status  (ES)  is  estimated  using  a  modi(cid:222)cation  of  RUSLE  (Renard  et  al.
1997). Speci(cid:222)cally, soil erosion is estimated using the following equation:

2.2 Uncertainty in Establishing Thresholds and Land Condition Index Value

Threshold values are critical in any impact assessment. They serve as reference points or
limits that determine what is an acceptable or tolerable impact and what is considered
unacceptable for a variety of reasons. While threshold values are critical, they are also
very dif(cid:222)cult to determine accurately. Hence, instead of specifying these threshold
values as point estimates, it may be more meaningful to treat them as imprecise values.
Moreover, subsequent analyses of these values must recognize their inherent imprecision.

There are different ways to handle imprecision in the estimation of threshold values.
One simple way is to specify CTV as an interval value. Hence, land condition classi(cid:222)ca-
tion is no longer dichotomous (e.g. Good or Bad); but a third category is added, which
is  neither  bad  nor  good.  In  this  case,  CTV

The  above  formulation  models  imprecision  in  threshold  estimation  by  essentially
expanding  the  classi(cid:222)cation  into  three  groups.  Uncertainty  is  accommodated  by  intro-
ducing a third category, one that can be viewed as a (cid:212)gray(cid:213) category representing those
that  are  neither  good  nor  bad.  Another  approach  is  to  treat  the  threshold  value  as  a
fuzzy  value  and  develop  a  fuzzy  critical  threshold  value  using  the  theory  of  fuzzy  sets.
In  the  context  of  the  threshold  estimation,  the  fuzzy  approach  essentially  treats  the
threshold value as a fuzzy element.

Uncertainty from two sources is analyzed in this paper: one from the uncertainty in
land condition factor data and the other from identifying the condition of a particular
parcel  of  land.  In  this  paper,  Erosion  Status  (ES),  to  be  called  Land  Condition  Index
(LCI) henceforth, is used as the single land condition factor to represent the (cid:222)rst uncer-
tainty source.

2.3 Uncertainty in Land Condition Factors and Sequential Gaussian Simulation

Recently, sequential Gaussian simulation has been introduced as a powerful geostatist-
ical tool for spatial mapping and analysis. The sequential Gaussian simulation method
is particularly useful in studies where a predicted map of soil loss with uncertainties
is  needed  for  land  condition  analysis  and  decision-making.  For  example,  Wang  et  al.
(2001a)  integrated  a  sequential  indicator  co-simulation  and  Landsat  TM  data  for
vegetation  classi(cid:222)cation  and  mapping.  In  addition  to  a  vegetation  map,  they  derived
classi(cid:222)cation and misclassi(cid:222)cation probability maps. Readers can (cid:222)nd more information
on sequential Gaussian simulation and its various applications in Goovaerts (1997) and
Wang et al. (2001a, b; 2002).

As  the  number  of  simulations  increases,  the  variances  decrease  rapidly  at  the
beginning,  then  slowly  and  gradually  become  stable.  The  number  at  which  estimation
variances tend to become stable can be chosen as the (cid:222)nal number of simulations. In
this study, the number was 500 simulations. For details regarding this algorithm and
its statistics, see Goovaerts (1997).

A histogram of soil loss is needed at each location for land condition analysis. To
this  end,  spatial  simulations  need  to  be  performed  for  each  factor  in  RUSLE,  which
brings its own uncertainty into the overall soil loss.

The soil erodilibity (K) factor measures the contribution of intrinsic soil properties
to soil erosion. However, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil tend to support

the concept that soil erodibility depends spatially and dynamically on the properties of
a speci(cid:222)c soil. Therefore, it is necessary to include the uncertainty on soil erodibility in
the overall uncertainty analysis of soil loss (Wang et al. 2001b).

Predicting the rainfall and runoff (R) factor at any time for any unknown location
using  a  data  set  of  rainfall  observations  is  a  complex  process  because  of  nonlinear
variability of rainstorms over space and time. As for the data on other factors, the error
variances not only depend on data con(cid:222)guration, but also on the sample data themselves
(Wang et al. 2002).

The vegetation cover and management (C) factor represents the effect of cropping
and  management  practices  in  agricultural  management,  and  the  effect  of  ground,  tree
and  grass  covers  on  reducing  soil  loss  in  non-agricultural  situations.  The  C  factor  is
derived based on empirical equations with measurements of ground cover, aerial cover
and minimum drip height based on the samples often along transect lines ( Wischmeier
and Smith 1978).

The  slope  steepness  (S)  factor  is  a  function  of  slope  angles  in  degrees  and  re(cid:223)ects
the  in(cid:223)uence  of  slope  gradient  on  erosion.  The  slope  length  (L)  factor  is  a  function  of
slope  length  in  meters.  Soil  erosion  is  more  sensitive  to  slope  steepness  than  to  slope
length.  Their  product,  called  the  topographic  (LS)  factor,  represents  the  topographic
effect  and  is  the  most  sensitive  in  the  prediction  of  soil  loss.  Since  slope  steepness  and
slope length are computed from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) using their respective
empirical formulations, the variability in DEMs affects the factors L and S. Gertner
et al. (2002), for example, found that a DEM with a resolution lower than 5 m is not
recommended for predicting the LS factor due to large variances.

For  the  purposes  of  this  study,  the  study  area  is  divided  into  1002 

  1002  pixels
 5 m. The reason for this selection lies in the sensitivity
with a spatial resolution of 5 m 
of the LS factor to the resolution of the DEM. As described above, this (cid:222)ne resolution
may seem impractical but it was used because of potential large errors that may result
from  using  a  coarser  resolution.  In  addition,  it  should  be  noted  that  while  the
quanti(cid:222)cation  of  the  error  due  to  the  use  of  coarser  resolution  is  a  challenging  task,  it
is relatively easy to observe isolated tiny patches in the resulting (cid:222)ne resolution restora-
tion  allocation  map,  and  to  make  informed  decisions  with  regards  to  the  patches.
Sequential  Gaussian  co-simulations  were  developed  to  create  histograms  of  the  K,  C,
and LS factors for each pixel. The secondary variables were derived from Landsat TM
images  for  the  K  and  C  factors.  The  secondary  variable  for  the  LS  factor  is  a  slope
map  derived  from  the  DEM  of  the  study  area.  A  sequential  Gaussian  simulation  was
developed for the R factor. The primary variable data were available only at the sample
locations and the secondary variable data were available at all pixels of the study area.
Consequently,  the  histogram  of  soil  loss  at  each  pixel  was  calculated  following  the
model in Equation (1).

2.4 Minimization of Expected Loss Through the Use of Loss Functions

One  approach  for  handling  uncertainty  in  land  condition  analysis  that  is  particularly
meaningful for military training areas is to look at the expected costs. Once the loss due
to misallocation that is likely to occur given the uncertainty associated with land condi-
tion estimation is minimized, the calculation of the expected restoration cost is straight-
forward.  In  this  study,  there  are  two  types  of  costs  (more  generally  referred  to
henceforth  as  losses).  One  is  the  loss  due  to  allocating  a  pixel  for  restoration  when  in

fact  it  does  not  need  to  be  restored.  The  other  is  the  loss  due  to  not  allocating  a  pixel
for  restoration  when  in  fact  it  needs  to  be  restored.  Hence,  two  possible  decisions  are
evaluated in terms of their economic impacts using the concept of loss functions. To this

Having  obtained  the  histograms  for  the  land  condition  index  for  all  pixels  and
de(cid:222)ned the membership function for this land condition index, the next step is to deter-
mine suitable loss functions for the two types of misallocation. In the classical approach,
one needs to have a critical value above (below) which the pixel is said to be in (cid:210)good
(bad)(cid:211) condition to construct the loss functions. On the other hand, two critical thresh-
old values are used in fuzzy logic where the interval between the two values represents
the  intermediate  condition.  The  membership  function  of  Figure  1  provides  the  critical
threshold values needed.

Each  of  the  two  loss  functions  has  two  components:  one  is  the  loss  related  to  the
restoration  effort,  and  the  other  is  the  loss  related  to  training.  When  a  pixel  is  mis-
allocated  for  restoration  an  unnecessary  restoration  activity  occurs  in  that  pixel.  This
restoration  is  not  too  involved  consisting  only  of  seeding  and  fertilizing  because  the
assigned pixel is actually in good condition. Therefore, a low restoration cost is assigned
as  the  loss  due  to  unnecessary  restoration,  which  is  US$17/acre;  i.e.  US$0.105/pixel
(Anderson  et  al.  1996).  In  addition,  when  a  pixel  is  allocated  for  restoration,  training
activities in that pixel are halted. When this is done mistakenly, there is a loss associated
with  the  unnecessary  interruption  of  training  activities.  This  loss  is  estimated  to  be
US$2,920/acre  (i.e.  US$18/pixel),  which  is  actually  the  spending  cost  for  training  on
land units (Congressional Budget Of(cid:222)ce 1997). It is assumed that the value of training
equals this amount when training takes place on land that is in good condition. The
loss associated with misallocating a pixel for restoration is modeled in Equation (5) as
described in this section.

Critical Area Management

The  loss  function  associated  with  misallocating  a  pixel  as  not  for  restoration  also
has two components. The (cid:222)rst is the loss associated with restoration, which is estimated
as  US$350/acre;  i.e.  US$2.16/pixel.  This  is  the  cost  of  heavy  restoration,  based  on  the
 consisting of (cid:222)lling and shaping of the land, and
concept of 
forming  grassed  waterways  (Anderson  et  al.  1996).  The  reason  for  this  high  cost  is  as
follows:  if  a  pixel  is  not  allocated  for  restoration  when  in  fact  it  needs  restoration,  its
condition  will  continue  to  deteriorate  and  will  require  substantial  restoration  in  the
future. Ultimately, training is also affected. Because of this misallocation, training activ-
ities will take place on deteriorated lands. This will result in a decrease in the value of
w
training.  The  amount  of  this  decrease  is  based  on  the  land  condition  index  value  (
g
formulation  in  Equation  6).  It  is  assumed  that  the  rate  of  decrease  is  constant  while
going from the higher threshold value, T
, to zero LCI — the range where the possibility
b
for land to be in bad condition is positive — and it is spending cost for training per pixel
per  LCI  (i.e.  18/60  US$/pixel/LCI).  This  is  the  only  loss  component  that  changes  with
the changing LCI value in the loss functions; the others are constant. The loss associated
with  misallocating  a  pixel  for  no  restoration  is  modeled  in  Equation  (6).  Figure  2
presents the two loss functions.

2.5 Calculation of Average Losses of Each Type of Misallocation

The next step is to calculate the losses due to the two types of misallocation at each pixel
using the membership function in Figure 1. There are two loss functions and hence two
kinds  of  potential  losses  per  pixel,  one  for  each  misallocation  (Figure  2).  Since  a  pixel
has 500 LCI values, for some LCI values it might be classi(cid:222)ed in bad condition and for
the remainder in good or fair condition. Consequently, there are 500 loss values due to
misallocation for no restoration and 500 loss values due to misallocation for restoration
of each pixel, and their associated variances. Then, these loss values are used to deter-
mine the expected loss attached to the two types of misallocation as:

(10)

This  procedure  is  repeated  for  every  pixel;  eventually  a  map  of  the  study  region
showing the parcels allocated for restoration (or no restoration) is obtained. Once areas
to  be  restored  are  set,  it  is  relatively  easy  to  compute  the  cost  of  the  restoration.  In
addition,  it  would  also  be  helpful  to  know  the  value  of  the  minimized  expected  loss
due to misallocation, the level of con(cid:222)dence in assigning areas for restoration, and their
associated  variances.  Though  the  allocation  is  based  on  the  smaller  average  loss,  there
is  still  a  potential  loss  associated  with  that  allocation.  For  example,  if  the  average  loss
of  misallocation  for  restoration  is  US$10  and  the  average  loss  of  misallocation  for  no
restoration is US$8 for a particular pixel, then it is allocated for no restoration. How-
ever,  there  is  still  a  potential  loss  of  US$8  associated  with  this  allocation.  The  sum  of
these potential losses would give a cost estimate that re(cid:223)ects the maximum amount one
would have to spend if everything is misallocated.

The  level  of  con(cid:222)dence  (LoC)  refers  to  the  difference  between  the  two  loss  values
at  each  pixel.  The  greater  the  difference  the  more  con(cid:222)dence  we  have  in  our  decision
regarding  that  particular  pixel.  The  LoC  variances  give  a  clue  about  the  uncertainty
associated with our con(cid:222)dence.

3 Study Area and Data Set

The study site is a small area within the Ford Hood Military Training Installation. The
installation  is  located  in  Central  Texas  approximately  160  miles  southwest  of  Dallas
(Figure  3).  Its  climate  is  characterized  by  long,  hot  summers  and  short,  mild  winters.
Elevation  at  Ford  Hood  ranges  from  180  to  375  m  above  sea  level  with  90  percent
below  260 m.  Slopes  range  mostly  from  2  to  5  percent  with  slopes  in  excess  of
45 percent occurring as bluffs along the (cid:223)ood plain and the sides of slopes on the hills.
Soil cover is generally shallow to moderately deep and mostly clay. The installation area
is  normally  composed  of  oak  woodlands  with  grass  undergrowth  and  shrub  (SERDP
2001).

The  study  area  is  located  in  the  northwest  portion  of  the  Fort  Hood  installation.
The  area  is  approximately  25  km2  making  up  about  3  percent  of  the  installation.  The
northern  and  southeastern  portions  of  the  study  area  have  high  elevation  whereas  the
southwestern and northeastern portions have lower elevations. There is a ridge running
between high and low elevation areas from the northwest to the southeast corner of the
study area. There is another ridge on the northeastern part. Soil cover in the study area
is mainly shallow in high-elevation parcels, deep along the ridges and in lower elevation
parcels. The organic matter percentage is quite low (between 1—4 percent). The parent
material is mostly limestone. The study area is subject to varying degrees of disturbance
due to military training activities such as tracked and wheeled maneuver exercises.

The bulk of the data set used in the study was obtained from Wang et al. (2001c)
and  Mendoza  et  al.  (2001).  A  sampling  scheme  was  designed  to  collect  ground  data
required for predicting soil loss according to land condition trend analysis plot inventory
and (cid:222)eld methods (Tazik et al. 1992). A total of 215 (cid:222)eld plots were selected over
the  Ford  Hood  area  in  a  strati(cid:222)ed  random  fashion  and  measured  in  the  spring  and
summer of 1989 based on the vegetation types and soil types. The number of these plots
at each vegetation and  soil  type was  proportional  to its  percent of  land  area.  The  plot

width was 6 m with a 100 m line transect located in its center. For each plot, the values
of  the  K  factor  in  RUSLE  were  calculated  based  on  its  empirical  model  (Renard  et  al.
1997). The LS factor is computed from the DEM using its empirical formulation (Gertner
et al. 2002). The C factor was calculated for each (cid:222)eld plot using the approach described
by  Wischmeier  and  Smith  (1978).  Interested  readers  are  referred  to SERDP  (2001)  for
more information on the dataset.

There  are  no  rainfall  stations  within  the  study  area.  The  rainfall  data  of  218
stations around the area and covering the states of Texas, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas,
Louisiana, New Mexico, and Oklahoma were collected to derive the R factor. The cal-
culation of the values of the R factor is explained in Wang et al. (2002).

T  factor  values  for  each  soil  series  that  occurred  at  the  study  site  were  obtained
from published soil surveys of Coryell and Bell counties (Huckabee et al. 1977, McCaleb
1985). The conservation (P) factor, the rate of soil loss with a support practice such as
contouring,  strip  cropping  and  terracing,  is  assumed  to  be  one  because  no  support
practices have been implemented yet (Warren et al. 1989, SERDP 2001).

A series of Landsat TM images from 16 October 1989 and at the spatial resolution
of  30 m  ·
  30 m  was  acquired.  These  images  consisted  of  seven  channels,  were  geo-
referenced to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and re-sampled to a
resolution of 5 m ·
 5 m by simple disaggregation (SERDP 2001). The TM images were
used in the sequential Gaussian simulations to enhance the prediction precision.

Additionally,  a  digital  elevation  model  (DEM)  at  a  spacing  of  10 m  and  vertical
resolution of 1 m for this area was acquired from the U.S. Geological Survey. From the

' Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003

DEM, a slope map was derived using partial derivative of a regularized spline function
with tension developed by Mit(cid:135)sov(cid:135) et al. (1996) and described in Wang et al. (2001c).
The slope map was used to acquire the LS factor data.

4 Results

Before  doing  the  simulation  study,  preliminary  data  analysis  was  conducted  to  take  a
closer  look  at  the  data.  In  particular,  the  correlations  of  several  images  from  seven
Landsat TM channels with each factor data were examined to decide on which Landsat
TM image to use as a secondary variable for which factor during the simulations. Some
of  these  images  were  derived  as  a  combination  of  two  or  more  TM  channel  images
according to the information each channel conveys. These combined images are referred
to as ratio1, ratio2, etc.; the original channel images are referred to as TM1, TM2, etc.
It was found that the C factor data have the largest correlation with the combined image
ratio3. Ratio3 is obtained through the multiplication of the TM images from the third
and  seventh  channels  divided  by  the  TM  image  from  the  fourth  channel.  The  third
channel is designed for detecting chlorophyll absorption in vegetation. The seventh band
is  useful  for  vegetation  and  soil  moisture  studies.  The  fourth  channel  is  ideal  for  near-
IR re(cid:223)ectance peaks in healthy green vegetation and for detecting water-land interfaces.
The correlation between the C factor data and ratio3 was 0.58. In addition, the highest
correlation of the K factor data was with the TM image from the seventh channel, which
was 0.31. Therefore, ratio3 and TM7 images were used as secondary variables for the
C and K factor simulations, respectively. For the R factor data, there was no signi(cid:222)cant
correlation with any of the images; hence, it was simulated without a secondary variable.
Sequential  Gaussian  simulations  with  500  replications  were  carried  out  for  the  R,
K,  LS  and  C  factors.  The  simulated  values  of  these  factors  were  used  to  calculate  soil
erosion (erosion rate). Hence, there were 500 erosion rate values at each pixel calculated
from the simulated values of the four factors following the model in Equation (1). The
erosion rate values were then divided by the T factor map to obtain 500 erosion status
(ES) values per pixel. These values were standardized and rescaled so that higher values
mean  lower  erosion  status  —  values  larger  than  2  were  assumed  to  be equal  to  2,  they
were re-scaled from zero to 100, and the scaled values were transformed so that higher
values  are  preferable.  The  resulting  erosion  status  values  serve  as  the  land  condition
index  (LCI)  values  per  pixel.  Hence,  there  are  500  LCI  values  per  pixel.  The  average
land  condition  index  values  and  the  associated  variances  were  calculated  and  mapped
as shown in Plate 1 (see plate section). The contour stripping in Plate 1 and the remain-
der of the maps is an artifact contributed by the slope steepness (S) factor map.

Figure 4 presents the histogram and summary statistics of average LCI values. The
average  LCI  map  was  used  to  classify  pixels  as  good,  fair,  or  bad  (Plate  2).  The  maps
in Plates 1 and 2, being only average values, were not used in the proposed method for
restoration  allocation;  they  are  provided  here  for  illustrative  purposes.  The  number  of
cells classi(cid:222)ed to each group is given in Table 1. The classi(cid:222)cation of the area between
the three land classes is 78, 6, and 16 percent for good, fair, and bad, respectively. The
parcels classi(cid:222)ed in bad condition are mostly concentrated on the ridge passing through
the  center  of  the  image.  The  reason  for  this  is  probably  that  military  off-road  vehicles
cause  more  destruction  of  vegetation  cover  and  soil  texture  over  the  ridges  than  other
parts of the area during training exercises exposing the ridges to more intense water and

between the parcels assigned to the good and bad classes.

The allocation for restoration was performed using all 500 LCI values for each
pixel  (Table  2).  Approximately  18  percent  of  the  total  area  (463  ha)  is  to  be  restored
(Plate 3). The pixels were allocated either for restoration or not, and subsequently, the
loss values were calculated. The total minimized loss is US$1,299,973 and its standard
deviation is US$3,870.

Average  levels  of  con(cid:222)dence  (LoC)  are  US$12.4/pixel  and  US$16.7/pixel  for  the
lands to be restored and the lands not to be restored, respectively. The standard deviations
are US$12.6/pixel and US$5.8/pixel, respectively. The total LoC for lands to be restored
is US$2,295,784 and the total for lands not to be restored is US$13,648,318. Their total
standard deviations are US$5,685/pixel and US$5,280/pixel, respectively (Table 3).

There are 24,683 pixels classi(cid:222)ed as fair based on average LCI values and allocated
for restoration. Similarly, there are 38,366 pixels classi(cid:222)ed as fair based on average LCI
values and allocated for no restoration. Hence the total number of pixels in the fair class
is 63,049. Consequently, 39 percent of the total area in fair condition (or about 62 ha)
is allocated for restoration and 61 percent (or about 96 ha) is allocated for no restoration.
Minimized expected loss from fair parcels is US$521,593. Hence, almost half of the
total minimized expected loss is attributable to the fair parcels that make up only
6 percent of the study region. The associated variance and standard deviation are (US$)
5,702,700  and  US$2,388,  respectively.  It  is  not  surprising  that  though  almost  half  the
total expected loss comes from the fair classi(cid:222)ed areas, they contribute to 62 percent of
the total variation in it.

It  was  assumed  that  the  level  of  restoration  effort  for  the  parcels  allocated  for
restoration is low if they are classi(cid:222)ed in fair condition (i.e. their LCI is above Tg = 40)
and  high  if  they  are  classi(cid:222)ed  in  bad  condition  (i.e.  their  LCI  is  below  Tg).  Hence,  for
the  former  areas  the  cost  is  US$0.0042/m2  (US$0.105/pixel)  and  for  the  latter,
US$0.0864/m2 (US$2.16/pixel). The cost of restoration in the parcels that are classi-
(cid:222)ed fair and allocated for restoration is US$2,604. For the parcels not classi(cid:222)ed fair
and  allocated  for  restoration,  the  cost  is  US$346,308.  The  total  restoration  cost  is
US$348,912.  There  is  no  cost  associated  with  the  parcels  that  are  not  allocated  for
restoration though they may have nonzero loss values.

5 Discussion

To examine some of the insights gained from the proposed method involving the incorpora-
tion of uncertainty, the same analysis was carried out using two alternative methods. In
the (cid:222)rst alternative method (Method 2 in Table 4), the threshold is deterministic; hence,
there is one threshold value and only two possible land conditions, i.e. good or bad. The

*  In  the  table,  Method  1  is  the  proposed  method.  In  Method  2,  500  LCI  replications  are
retained  but  the  threshold  is  deterministic;  in  Method  3,  average  LCI  are  used  and  the
threshold is deterministic

500 values of LCI per pixel, however, were retained. Hence, the uncertainty coming from
the variability in land condition factor (i.e. erosion status data) was incorporated but the
uncertainty due to vagueness in land classi(cid:222)cation is ignored in Method 2. The threshold
value was taken as the average of the fuzzy threshold values, namely 50. When Method
2  is  adopted,  the  area  allocated  for  restoration  is  18  percent  of  the  region  (namely,
461.597  ha)  and  the  total  cost  of  restoration  is  US$390,511.  In  calculating  the  total
cost,  it  was  assumed  that  the  restoration  effort  would  be  substantial.  The  minimized
expected loss due to misallocation is US$1,294,149. Its variance and standard deviation
are (US$) 16,644,378 and US$4,080, respectively. The comparison of the two analyses
with the fuzzy thresholds and with the deterministic threshold is summarized in Table 4.
A  second  comparison  was  carried  out  with  a  completely  deterministic  method.  In
this  method  (Method  3  in Table  4),  a  single  threshold  value  was  used  as  in  Method  2
instead of fuzzy thresholds. In addition, the average values of LCI were used instead of
a histogram of 500 values for each pixel. Hence, the map in Plate 1 is used for restora-
tion  allocation  in  Method  3.  Note  that  in  this  method,  being  allocated  for  no  restora-
tion  (restoration)  and  classi(cid:222)ed  as  in  good  (bad)  condition  mean  the  same  thing.
Consequently, the uncertainty was completely left out of the analysis. The conservative
assumption  of  substantial  restoration  was  also  retained  in  Method  3.  The  land  to  be
restored  (480.067  ha)  is  largest  with  this  analysis  (Table  4).  This  leads  to  even  more
overestimation  of  restoration  cost,  which  is  US$406,137.  The  loss  estimates  are  not
relevant, hence they are absent in the Method 3 entries of Table 4.

Misallocation has potentially signi(cid:222)cant implications. Some of these implications can
be quanti(cid:222)ed as direct costs; others can be quanti(cid:222)ed as indirect costs. Misallocating a
parcel as requiring restoration, when it does not need it, results in unnecessary restoration
effort.  The  monetary  loss  associated  with  this  effort  is  a  direct  cost.  The  resulting  loss
of training is, however, an indirect cost. On the other hand, misallocating a parcel as not
requiring restoration leads to further degradation because of continuing training activ-
ities.  More  expensive  restoration  that  will  be  required  in  the  future  and  the  expected
poor quality of training practiced on degraded lands can be re(cid:223)ected as indirect costs.
These  costs  can  also  be  regarded  as  tangible  and  intangible  monetary  (cid:222)gures.  For
example, the expenses from unnecessary restoration effort and more intense restoration

effort are tangible costs while the costs of poor training quality and loss of training
time  are  intangible  costs.  Both  kinds  of  costs,  whether  it  is  direct/indirect  or  tangible/
intangible, were taken into account in this study. This comprehensive analysis allowed
the consideration of the major consequences of the restoration allocation.

The  fuzzy  thresholds  dictated  the  classi(cid:222)cation  of  the  study  area  in  terms  of  land
condition (i.e. good, fair, and bad) (Table 1). However, it should be noted that in setting
these thresholds there was considerable uncertainty. Hence, these estimates should not
be regarded as exact numbers but as simple approximations.

Similarly,  the  values  in  Table  2  were  very  much  affected  by  the  fuzzy  threshold
values. Moreover,  they were  affected by the loss function  formulations, which  were in
turn  affected  by  the  shape  of  the  membership  function  and  the  unit  costs  (Figure  1;
Equations 5—6). In addition, the number of classes is decreased from three to two (i.e.
from good/fair/bad to restoration/no restoration). The loss functions help to resolve the
uncertainty  in  areas  classi(cid:222)ed  as  fair  and  allocate  them  into  either  restoration  or  no
restoration  classes.  However,  these  allocations  are  also  not  exact.  They  still  bear  the
uncertainty  coming  from  the  threshold  values,  the  membership  function,  and  the  unit
costs.  The  numbers  in  Table  2  together  with  the  allocation  map  in  Plate  3  provide
essential  information  on  the  overall  land  condition  of  the  study  region  for  the  land
allocation decision-making process.

A  more  explicit  indication  of  how  sensitive  the  restoration  allocations  are  to  the
factors affecting them is the level of con(cid:222)dence (LoC) concept. For pixels allocated for
no restoration, average LoC is considerably larger than that of the pixels allocated for
restoration.  However,  the  standard  deviation  of  the  former  is  also  larger  than  that  of
the latter (Table 3). Based on the de(cid:222)nition of LoC, it can be stated that there is more
con(cid:222)dence  that  a  particular  pixel  allocated  for  no  restoration  was  allocated  correctly
than  those  allocated  for  restoration.  On  the  other  hand,  it  may  be  expected  that  all
pixels,  regardless  of  their  restoration  allocation,  have  more  or  less  the  same  sensitivity
to the factors that have an effect on the restoration allocation.

There  are  two  sources  of  uncertainty  in  this  analysis:  (cid:222)rst,  from  the  incomplete
information on land condition, and second from identifying a particular parcel of
land  as  being  in  good  or  bad  condition  based  on  a  given  LCI  value.  The  traditional
approaches  to  land  surveying  are  not  suf(cid:222)cient  to  deal  with  these  uncertainties.  How-
ever, the use of remote sensing and geostatistical methods make it possible to quantify
the uncertainty that stems from variability in data. In addition, vagueness in allocating
a parcel of land as requiring restoration or not is best handled by fuzzy logic. Thus, the
proposed  method  provides  a  measure  of  these  uncertainties  from  the  two  sources  in
monetary terms. For instance, in deciding which area should be restored in any military
area,  there  is  a  (cid:212)hidden(cid:213)  cost  (i.e.  expected  loss  due  to  misallocation),  which  must  be
minimized but cannot be totally eliminated. The proposed method recognizes that error
and uncertainty exist, and hence provides a measure of this uncertainty in monetary terms
which could be bene(cid:222)cial in planning and budgeting for military training exercises.

The  comparison  between  the  proposed  method  and  two  other  techniques  with
varying degrees of determinism (i.e. Methods 2 and 3) reveals important insights on the
utility of incorporating uncertainty in land condition analysis. Foremost is that simula-
tion  and  fuzzy  logic  rendered  the  analysis  more  realistic.  The  use  of  simulated  values
offered a range of LCI values for a particular pixel rather than simple averages. Further-
more, fuzzy logic allowed for smoother transitions between different states rather than
crisp  dichotomous  divisions,  which  are  quite  unlikely  in  actual  applications.  This  has

signi(cid:222)cant implications in the interpretation of results and the implementation phase as
described below.

The land allocated for restoration in the proposed method is larger than in Method 2
(Table  4).  Method  2  does  not  recognize  the  smooth  transition  between  land  condi-
tions; that is, if a pixel had more LCI values that fall above the deterministic threshold
they were not allocated for restoration without regard to the distribution of all values,
which  to  some  extent  is  accommodated  by  the  fuzzy  thresholds.  These  pixels  were
missed  and  not  allocated  for  restoration  in  the  deterministic  case.  On  the  other  hand,
the  land  allocated  for  restoration  in  Method  3  is  larger  than  the  allocation  in  the
proposed  method  (Method  1)  (Table  4).  The  former  uses  only  the  average  LCI  values
ignoring the variability in each pixel. In addition, using a single deterministic threshold
unduly generalizes the analysis and produces poor estimates.

Another implication is that the fuzzy thresholds are able to distinguish parcels that
are badly and moderately degraded. Invariably, not all parcels that need restoration are
of  the  same  condition.  The  fuzzy  approach  is  useful  in  capturing  variability  at  least  to
a  certain  extent.  The  lower  threshold,  Tg,  was  used  to  make  the  distinction.  Although
this  distinction  is  also  not  quite  realistic,  it  serves  as  a  means  to  increase  the  power  of
the  analysis.  Such  a  distinction  cannot  be  made  with  the  deterministic  threshold
approach (i.e. Methods 2 and 3) since all parcels allocated for restoration are alike. This
increased  resolution  capability  of  the  fuzzy  approach  allows  for  more  realistic  restora-
tion cost estimates. These cost estimates are only the direct (or tangible) costs of restora-
tion  required  for  parcels  judged  to  be  in  need  of  immediate  restoration  and  thus,  they
are different than the loss estimates associated with misallocations.

The aim in incorporating uncertainty into the analysis is not necessarily to decrease
the  total  cost  of  operation  but  to  come  up  with  more  realistic  cost  estimates  and  to
minimize  the  loss  that  is  to  occur  due  to  misallocation.  Consequently,  the  expected
restoration costs for each approach in Table 4 should be considered as such and inter-
preted  accordingly.  Although  the  proposed  method  generated  a  lower  restoration  cost
estimate than the other two methods, a more meaningful interpretation of this number
is that it is a better estimate of the real cost. That is, even if the cost associated with the
deterministic analysis were less, this only implies that there had been gross underestima-
tion since the uncertainty was not incorporated in the analysis.

The expected loss from parcels in fair condition constitutes half the total expected
loss (Table 4). It is logical to expect that most of the misallocations will occur in parcels
with LCI values indicating neither high degradation nor intactness. In other words, most
misallocations are likely to occur at sites in between these two extreme states, which is
indicated  by  the  proportion  of  the  expected  loss  from  the  fair  parcels  to  the  total
expected loss. Moreover, the proportion also helps to quantify the misallocation risk in
approximate monetary terms.

The  expected  loss  terms  are  not  considered  in  Method  3,  which  is  a  completely
deterministic analysis in which average (or estimated) values of LCI and a single thresh-
old  were  used.  In  other  words,  there  is  no  histogram  of  LCI  values  for  each  pixel  in
Method 3; just a single value. The area to be restored and the associated restoration cost
can be determined with this single value, at the cost of loss in precision. This led to an
overestimation of the restoration cost in the completely deterministic case. The expected
loss estimates, on the other hand, cannot be determined because the basic premise of the
loss  idea  is  predicated  on  the  availability  of  a  number  of  estimates  of  LCI  value  (i.e.  a
histogram of LCI) for a particular pixel. A certain amount of loss will occur as a result

of misallocation during the implementation phase but it simply cannot be determined in
a  completely  deterministic  analysis.  Thus,  there  is  a  lot  of  information  loss  as  a  result
of excluding the uncertainty (Table 4).

6 Conclusions

In  this  study,  a  method  based  on  sequential  Gaussian  simulation,  spatial  analysis  and
fuzzy logic, is proposed for the evaluation of land condition and to serve as a decision
support system for areas requiring restoration. A small area in the northwestern portion
of Ford Hood military area was selected as a case study.

The proposed method presents a novel way to deal with uncertainty in land condi-
tion analysis. One primary advantage of this study is addressing two uncertainty sources
simultaneously.  Fuzzy  logic  allowed  for  a  smoother  transition  between  different  land
condition classes rather than crisp dichotomous divisions, which are quite unlikely
in  actual  applications.  Concurrently,  sequential  Gaussian  simulation  allowed  the  con-
sideration  of  variability  in  erosion  status  (ES)  data  rather  than  concentrating  only  on
expected values. The contributions of the method were emphasized by comparing it to
two  alternative  methods  with  varying  degrees  of  determinism:  one  where  uncertainty
from the data was retained but thresholds were dichotomous (i.e. good versus bad), and
the other completely deterministic. These comparisons reveal the advantage of the
proposed method in making the most use of available information. Moreover, all likely
cost  estimates  —  both  direct  and  indirect  or  tangible  and  intangible  depending  on  the
de(cid:222)nition  —  due  to  misallocation  are  addressed  in  the  analysis.  Hence,  it  enabled  the
consideration  of  all  major  consequences  of  the  restoration  allocation.  The  major  aims
of  incorporating  uncertainty  into  the  analysis  are  not  necessarily  to  decrease  the  total
cost of operation but to come up with more realistic cost estimates, and to minimize the
loss that is to occur due to misallocation.

Even  though  the  proposed  method  aims  to  address  the  sources  of  uncertainty  in
land  condition  analysis,  there  is  still  considerable  uncertainty  in  the  fuzzy  thresholds
themselves. Sensitivity analysis is one practical tool to deal with the imprecision in these
thresholds.  For  example,  a  more  structured  approach  such  as  the  method  described  in
Mendoza et al. (2001), could be adopted in setting these threshold values. In addition,
the use of loss function attempts to resolve the uncertainty in areas classi(cid:222)ed as fair by
allocating  them  either  for  restoration,  or  no  restoration  classes.  However  informative,
these  allocations  are  still  inexact  and  bear  the  uncertainty  coming  from  the  particular
selection  of  the  membership  function  and  the  unit  cost  estimates.  A  factorial  experi-
mental design would allow addressing the sensitivity of allocations to these factors. Finally,
while  the  proposed  method  requires  considerable  computing  power,  it  is  likely  to
become  more  feasible  with  the  rapidly  increasing  capabilities  in  computing.  Con-
sequently,  the  proposed  method  may  be  useful  for  devising  improved  approaches  in
decision support systems.

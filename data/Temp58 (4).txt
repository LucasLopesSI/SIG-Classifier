Abstract.
In search for methods to handle imprecision in geographical informa-
tion this paper explores the use of rough classi(cid:142) cation to represent uncertainty.
Rough classi(cid:142) cation is based on rough set theory, where an uncertain set is
speci(cid:142) ed by giving an upper and a lower approximation. Novel measures are
presented to assess a single rough classi(cid:142) cation, to compare a rough classi(cid:142) cation
to a crisp one and to compare two rough classi(cid:142) cations. An extension to the
error matrix paradigm is also presented, both for the rough-crisp and the rough-
rough cases. An experiment on vegetation and soil data demonstrates the viability
of rough classi(cid:142) cation, comparing two incompatible vegetation classi(cid:142) cations
covering the same area. The potential uses of rough sets and rough classi(cid:142) cation
are discussed and it is suggested that this approach should be further investigated
as it can be used in a range of applications within geographic information science
from data acquisition and analysis to metadata organization.

1.

Introduction
Generalization of information into groups is a common step in traditional as
well as computerized geographical analysis. Classi(cid:142) cation into prede(cid:142) ned categories
is in many cases an important step to perform geographical analysis in order to
measure or describe a phenomenon of interest. No matter what strategy we employ
for the generalization procedure, this will lead to a loss of detail in one or more
dimensions. This imprecision has to be treated in a controlled manner, and the issue
of the representation of uncertainty in spatial data has become more and more of a
concern (Goodchild et al. 1992, Burrough and Frank 1996). One of the reasons for
this is that a current goal is to increase geographical information system interoperabi-
lity. This need may partly be met by eŒorts to arrive at various standards such as
the work by the Open GIS Consortium, CEN/TC287 and ISO/TC211 or research
focused on the development of federated database systems (Devogele et al. 1998 ).
Still there are a number of issues that remain to be solved before any of these
approaches will become feasible implementations.

In this paper we focus on one of these underlying problems, that is, semantic

imprecision as a result of categorization, exempli(cid:142) ed by spatial vegetation and soil
information. Building on existing theories of rough sets (Pawlak 1982), in §2 we
discuss the causes of semantic heterogeneity in geographical data, fuzzy sets as one
method to handle this heterogeneity and the idea of using rough sets and rough
classes as an alternative. In §3 we develop a number of quality measures as well as
methods for uncertainty assessment useful when comparing layers of roughly classi-
(cid:142) ed geographical information. We also discuss their relation to commonly used
methods for accuracy assessment in remote sensing and geographical information
systems, such as overall classi(cid:142) cation accuracy measures and confusion matrices.
Finally in §5 these ideas are taken together in an experiment on geographic data to
demonstrate our (cid:142) ndings in a reclassi(cid:142) cation task followed by an accuracy assessment
on the reclassi(cid:142) ed data.

2. Categorization

To make geographical analyses and presentations using computerized systems
we need to assemble information about geographic phenomena in a quanti(cid:142) able
manner. Geographical data as geographic entities are quanti(cid:142) ed in terms of temporal,
spatial and thematic dimensions (Lanter and Veregin 1992 ) and this complexity
makes it practically impossible to measure all aspects on continuous scales. So, the
assemblage of geographical data normally implies some kind of generalization of the
basic dimensions. This generalization is often done by (cid:142) xing one dimension, control-
ling another and measuring the third (Sinton 1978). The two main geographical
data modeling paradigms used by contemporary geographical information systems
could be looked upon as two cases of this general assumption. Both paradigms (cid:142) x
time. The spatial dimension is either controlled by a regular grid or measured as the
position of 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional objects. Finally, the thematic dimension is either
measured as (cid:142) eld values or controlled by grouping objects into predetermined classes.
A geographical information category can be termed an ‘abstraction’ meaning a
simultaneous focus on important content, structure and process while temporarily
ignoring certain details, rather than eliminating details (Nyerges 1991a) . From this
it follows that abstractions, that apparently form in our minds, can not be regarded
as crisply de(cid:142) ned and delimited objects. We will not go any further into the increas-
ingly large body of work on the theoretical basis for how categories are formed. For
the purposes of this work we conclude that apparently there is a complex background
for the formation of entities which are represented in geographic databases. To
increase interoperability in terms of a better conceptual match between diŒerent
databases we need tools to handle the conceptual and literal heterogeneity that
the higher levels of geographic information modeling (Raper and
occurs at
Livingstone 1995, Bishr 1998). If we separate this heterogeneity into aspects of
semantic, schematic and syntactic heterogeneity this article deals with methods to
handle schematic heterogeneity, i.e. where classi(cid:142) cation and hierarchical organiz-
ations of real world categories vary across disciplines or contexts (Bishr 1998).

Turning now to the issue of how to represent and logically handle semantic
heterogeneity, object oriented methods have been proposed as a viable alternative.
For example Raper and Livingstone (1995) demonstrate d how an object oriented
geomorphologi c spatial model enabled the representation of entities identi(cid:142) ed as a
result of a categorization procedure, as well as providing the means to link process
models to data models. Openshaw (1996) recently noted the evident linkage between
geographical sciences with a multitude of linguistic knowledge expressions and the

theory of fuzzy sets. Other authors argue in the opposite direction employing discrete
models but using other organizing elements such as concept neighborhoods (Freksa
and Barkowsky 1996, Bishr 1998). In the next section we will brie(cid:143) y go through
fuzzy set theory, its current applications and the reasons we see for developing an
alternative method to deal with imprecision and semantic heterogeneity.

2.1. Fuzzy sets

When considering uncertainty representation of geographic data in a digital
environment we often (cid:142) nd implementations in a (cid:142) eld (raster) rather than an object
(vector) environment. Fuzzy set theory (Zadeh 1965) is an extension of classical set
theory. In fuzzy sets each data point has an associated membership value, which
expresses the degree of membership of the data point in a particular set. The mapping
of data points to degrees of membership is called the membership function. The
theory is well known and contemporary geographic information systems usually
include methods to handle data layers with attribute vagueness using fuzzy set
theory. The fuzzy representation provides the means to express partial membership,
not in the sense of a probabilistic attribute but in the form of an admission of
possibility (Burrough and McDonnell 1998). Thus, it can be used to represent
uncertainty about class membership.

So far, most implementations of fuzzy sets in geography have been focused on
characterizing attribute ambiguity in data. However, during the last few years the
issue of spatial vagueness has also been approached (Wang and Hall 1996, Burrough
and Frank 1996, Brown 1998). Molenaar (1996) discusses fuzzy spatial objects using
a semantic formalism but he also expresses some doubt as to whether this can be
readily handled by existing tools. One major obstacle to the diŒusion of fuzzy set
based uncertainty handling is that the necessary membership function can be very
hard to determine. In those cases, we anticipate that an alternative approach based
on rough sets is more appropriate, since there will be no need to determine a
membership function, or even resort to an arbitrary one. We might for instance end
up with the following reclassi(cid:142) cation situation: given a categorical map with a map
polygon labelled A, translate this into another classi(cid:142) cation system, given the alter-
native of assigning a label 4 or 6 according to the reclassi(cid:142) cation rule. Data in real
situations are often of this discrete nature and membership values may be hard to
determine.

2.2. Rough sets

Pawlak (1982) initially introduced the idea of rough sets but links between this
theory and spatial applications have not until recently been elaborated. Rough sets,
like fuzzy sets, are an extension of standard mathematical sets. In this extension an
uncertain set is represented by its upper and lower approximation . If the data point
is in the lower approximation , we are sure that it is in the set. If it is not in the
upper approximation , we are sure that it is not in the set. The spatial representation
of the rough set can be in the form of pixels or entire polygons which are given one
of three possible values: not a member of the set (neither in lower nor upper
approximation) , maybe a member of the set (in the upper but not in the lower
approximation ) and absolutely a member of the set (in the lower approximation) .
Thus rough sets may also be used to represent uncertainty about class membership.
The use of rough set theory has not to any large extent been treated in the GIS
literature but recent work by Schneider (1997) and Worboys (1998a, 1998b) has

shown clear advantage s of using a rough set approach in dealing with imprecise
geospatial data. Schneider (1997) discusses rough sets in ROSE (Gu¨ ting et al. 1995 ),
in much the same way as we have implemented them below, but does not discuss
classi(cid:142) cations and related topics, focusing much more on the formal modeling aspects.
Stell and Worboys (1998) reported on a formal approach to multi-resolution in
spatial data handling using an approach similar to rough and fuzzy set theories.
Their most recent (cid:142) ndings are reported in (Worboys 1998a, 1998b) where rough sets
are used to handle imprecision due to (cid:142) nite spatial or semantic resolution. Also the
work of Cohn and Gotts (1996) on spatial relations between regions with indetermin-
ate boundaries has much in common with rough sets.

3. Rough classi(cid:142) cation

This section builds on rough sets to introduce the idea of rough classi(cid:142) cation.

3.1. Rough sets

A rough set is a pair (X , X ) of standard sets, the lower approximation and the
upper approximation. In the representation we have chosen, X k X. The meaning of
these two sets is that if a data point lies in X, we are sure that the point is in the
rough set, if a data point lies in XÕ X, we are unsure whether or not the point is
in the rough set, and if a data point is outside X, we are sure that the point is not
in the rough set. These sets can contain either individual points, or continuous areas;
we will use the term ‘area’ below. We will often call XÕ X the area of uncertainty
of a rough set. As opposed to rough sets, standard sets are often called crisp, a term
that also applies to a rough set where X 5 X, which implies an empty area of
uncertainty. Conversely, a rough set with an empty lower approximation and a non-
empty area of uncertainty can be called completely rough.

According to Du¨ ntsch (1997), the basic set operations, union, intersection and
negation, can easily be extended to rough sets. Union and intersection as follows:
(X > Y, X > Y ). Negation can be
(X , X )<
(Õ X, Õ X ).
extended in two ways: (X , X )* 5

(Y, Y ) 5
(Õ X, Õ X ) and (X , X )+ 5

(X < Y , X < Y ), (X, X )>

(Y, Y ) 5

3.2. Rough classi(cid:142) cation

i:Xi> Xj 5

A standard, or crisp classi(cid:142) cation C consists of a number of classes Xi, i ×I,
each of which is a crisp set. I will be called the index set of a classi(cid:142) cation. For a
crisp classi(cid:142) cation, YiYj Þ
: the classes are pairwise disjoint. We will
de(cid:142) ne the cardinality of C as |C | 5

|< Xi |, which, in this case, is equal to S |Xi |.

Xi), i ×I, each of which is a rough set. In a rough classi(cid:142) cation, however, we would
like to be able to express our uncertainty about which class, if any, a certain area
belongs to. Therefore, instead of pairwise disjointness, we impose only the following
i:X i> Xj 5 h. Of
that
restriction: YiYj Þ
i:X i> X j 5
. We do not impose such a restriction on pairs of upper approxi-

mations, though, so there may be areas where two or more upper approximation s
overlap, but none where any lower approximation overlaps with anything else than
the corresponding upper approximation . I will be called the index set of the classi(cid:142) ca-

In this way, we have expressed two fundamental types of uncertainty:

E Uncertainty of spatial location: If, for a rough class (X , X ), X 5 X, uncertainty

about the spatial location of (part of ) that class has been expressed.

E Uncertainty of attribute value: If a certain area is assigned to the area of
uncertainty of more than one class, it is no longer certain to which class that
area belongs. Thus, uncertainty of attribute value has been expressed.

Given a subset C of I, the index set of a rough classi(cid:142) cation R, we de(cid:142) ne its
rough component as follows: RC 5
i1C Xi. A rough component is the
i ×C(Xi Õ Xi)Õ
area that is in all the areas of uncertainty of the classes whose index is in C, and in
none of the areas of uncertainty of any of the classes of the rough classi(cid:142) cation
whose indices are not in C. See (cid:142) gure 1 for an example rough component. The rough
classes (X i, Xi) where i ×C we will call the founders of the rough component RC.

Rough components are de(cid:142) ned such that they are always pairwise disjoint;
furthermore, the union of all rough components of a classi(cid:142) cation and the lower
approximation s of all its rough classes is exactly the area covered by the classi(cid:142) cation.

4. Quality measures of classi(cid:142) cations

In this section we will discuss the various ways that we can measure the uncer-
tainty in rough and crisp classi(cid:142) cations. Uncertainty in geospatial data is, as we
stated above, divided into three major dimensions and since these dimensions are
often dependent on each other, it may not be useful to explore thematic and spatial
uncertainty independently (Lanter and Veregin 1992). The measures we will examine
in the following discussion deal both with the thematic and the spatial aspect of
uncertainty. This section is split up into four subsections, depending on what we
base our measures. We can base our measures on a single rough classi(cid:142) cation, on
the comparison of two crisp classi(cid:142) cations, on the comparison of a rough and a
crisp classi(cid:142) cation, or on the comparison of two rough classi(cid:142) cations.

When comparing two classi(cid:142) cations, we will sometimes assume that one of the
classi(cid:142) cations is the reference classi(cid:142) cation, containing our baseline data, whereas
the other one is the assessed classi(cid:142) cation, the one whose quality we are trying to
measure.

4.1. Single rough classi(cid:142) cations

We de(cid:142) ne two measures that apply to single rough classi(cid:142) cations: the overlap
measure and the overall crispness measure. In each of these de(cid:142) nitions, we will be
talking about a rough classi(cid:142) cation R, consisting of the rough classes (X i, Xi), i ×I.

4.1.1. T he overlap measure

(S | Xi |Õ

i:(Xi> Xj) Þ

The overlap measure can be computed as follows: Mo 5

|R|)/| R|. Since
all the area covered by the rough classi(cid:142) cation is included at least once in S | Xi|,
Mo > 0. If Mo 5 0, there is no intersection between any of the rough classes. If Mo > 0,
(since the lower approximation s are pairwise disjoint, this
Zi Zj Þ
area of intersection must be in the area of uncertainty of said rough classes). Mo can
grow if either the total area of intersection grows or (parts of ) this area are shared
by more rough classes. The upper bound for Mo is the number of classes in the
rough classi(cid:142) cation minus one, as the maximum overlap occurs when all classes
contain the whole area of the classi(cid:142) cation. For the example in (cid:142) gure 1, Mo 5
((14 1 9 1 10) 1

(14 1 9 1 10 1 14 1 4))/(14 1 9 1 10 1 14 1 4)# 0.17.

(14 1 9 1 4)Õ

Thus, the overlap measure measures the amount of overlap in the rough classi-

(cid:142) cation. This can be said to measure uncertainty in attribute value.

4.1.2. T he overall crispness measure

The overall crispness measure can be computed as follows: Mc 5 S | Xi |/|R |.
Obviously, Mc > 0, and, since the lower approximation s are pairwise disjoint, Mc < 1.
If Mc 5 0, all the lower approximation s of the classes of the rough classi(cid:142) cation are
empty, making the classi(cid:142) cation completely rough. If, on the other hand, Mc 5 1,
the areas of uncertainty of the classes of the rough classi(cid:142) cation are empty, and
the classi(cid:142) cation is in fact crisp. For the example in (cid:142) gure 1, Mc 5
(10 1 4)/
(14 1 9 1 10 1 14 1 4)# 0.27. This can easily be extended to a class based measure
(one measure for each rough class), instead of an overall measure.

The crispness measure measures how much of the total area of the classi(cid:142) cation
is assigned to lower approximations . This can be said to measure certainty in spatial
location.

4.2. Comparing two crisp classi(cid:142) cations

When comparing two crisp classi(cid:142) cations, the standard (cid:142) rst step is to compose
an error matrix (Congalton 1991), so we start oŒwith a description of this paradigm.
Congalton (1991) also describes the various accuracy measures that can be computed
from such a matrix, which we will brie(cid:143) y review.

4.2.1. Error matrix

We will consider the case where two crisp classi(cid:142) cations A and B are being
compared. A consists of the classes Xi, i ×I, while B consists of the classes Yj, j ×J.
Much of the following will only be valid if | I | 5
|I |), and will
probably only make sense if, in fact, I 5 J.

|J| (let us de(cid:142) ne N 5

|Xi> Yj|. We will also assume that <

The error matrix is now de(cid:142) ned as an N by N matrix with elements xi,j having
j Yj, i.e. that the two classi-
values xi,j 5
(cid:142) cations cover exactly the same area. Because of that and the fact that all the Xi
are pairwise disjoint, and all the Yj are also pairwise disjoint, the error matrix has
the following three properties:

column of the matrix is the area of the corresponding class of B.

matrix is the area covered by either of the classi(cid:142) cations.

4.2.2. Some commonly used measures

Overall accuracy is de(cid:142) ned as the total match between the two classi(cid:142) cations

divided by the total area of the classi(cid:142) cations, i.e.:

Ao 5

xi,i/|A |

i

This can be split up according to the classes in the classi(cid:142) cations, but in that
case one is left with the choice of dividing by the column total or by the row total.
Assuming that the reference classi(cid:142) cation is associated with the columns of the
matrix, dividing by the column total gives the omission error, also called producer ’s
accuracy. Dividing by the row total gives the commission error, also called user’s
accuracy. In other ‘words’:

Please note that, apart from the naming of omission and commission errors,
these three measures are completely symmetrical with respect to the columns and

eŒect on the computed value.

4.3. Comparing rough and crisp classi(cid:142) cations

We (cid:142) rst discuss how to extend error matrices to comparing rough and crisp
classi(cid:142) cations, and then we discuss the various measures we can compute from such
a matrix. We also introduce a method by which we may apply any measure that
can be applied to the comparison of two crisp classi(cid:142) cations.

4.3.1. Error matrix extension

When comparing a rough classi(cid:142) cation, R, with a crisp one, C, such as in (cid:142) gure 2,
we can start with constructing an extended error matrix, see table 1 for the example.
For typographic reasons, we choose to associate the crisp classi(cid:142) cation with the
rows of the matrix, and the rough classi(cid:142) cation with the columns of the matrix,
independently of which one is the reference classi(cid:142) cation.

R consists of the rough classes (X j, Xj), j ×J and C consists of the crisp classes

4.3.2. T he relative crispness measure

Assuming that the crisp classi(cid:142) cation is the reference one, the relative crispness
measure compares the crispness of a rough classi(cid:142) cation in the areas where it
corresponds to the crisp classi(cid:142) cation (where it is ‘right’) to its crispness in areas
where it does not correspond to the crisp classi(cid:142) cation (where it is ‘wrong’).

If, on the other hand, the crisp classi(cid:142) cation is the one that is being assessed, the
relative crispness measure measures whether the crisp classi(cid:142) cation is more correct
in areas where the rough classi(cid:142) cation is certain than in areas where it is uncertain.

D measures the crispness in the diagonal elements of the matrix, whereas O measures
the crispness in the oŒ-diagonal elements. The crispness is not measured in a way
compatible with Mc, since overlapping areas of uncertainty are counted twice.

The relative crispness measure can be computed as follows: Mr 5 DÕ O. Since
Õ 1, that means that there is no crispness
0< D< 1 and 0< O< 1, Õ 1< Mr < 1. If Mr 5
on the diagonal of the matrix, whereas there is perfect crispness oŒthe diagonal of
the matrix. Values between Õ 1 and 0 mean that there is more crispness oŒthe
diagonal than there is on the diagonal. Mr 5 0 means that there is no diŒerence in
crispness on or oŒthe diagonal. Values between 0 and 1 mean that there is more
crispness on the diagonal than there is oŒthe diagonal. If Mr 5 1, there is no crispness
oŒthe diagonal, while there is perfect crispness on the diagonal. Higher values of
Mr are ‘better’ than lower values. For the example error matrix in table 1, Mr # 0.31,
which tells us that the diagonal elements are signi(cid:142) cantly more crisp than the
oŒ-diagonal elements.

4.3.3. Overall accuracy

As stated above for the case of two crisp classi(cid:142) cations, overall accuracy is the
total correct area divided by the total area. This can be extended to the case of one
crisp and one rough classi(cid:142) cation. However, we will not get one single answer, but,
(cid:142) ttingly, an upper and a lower bound.

The upper and lower bounds for overall accuracy are as follows: S xi,i+ /
)/| R|. We can be sure that we are not counting anything
| R|< Ao < S(xi,i+ 1 xi,i?
twice, since we only use elements from the diagonal of the matrix. The areas
corresponding to these diagonal elements are all subsets of diŒerent classes of C,
and those are disjoint. For the example extended error matrix in table 1, 0.27<
Ao < 0.86.

The way to arrive at the bounds given above, is to think of the ways the rough
classi(cid:142) cation can be converted to a crisp one. If the assumption is made that it is
permissible not to assign (parts of ) areas of uncertainty to any crisp class at all, the
bounds given above are valid and tight. If this assumption is not valid, we will have
to resort to the procedure outlined below.

4.3.4. Error matrix parameterization

Since the row-sum and total-sum properties do not hold for extended error
matrices, it is hard to directly apply traditional measures that involve elements
beyond those on the diagonal. For this kind of global measures, we will convert the
rough classi(cid:142) cation into a crisp one. However, doing so in a consistent fashion is

not straightforward, since there may be overlap in the areas of uncertainty, and this
information is missing from the matrix. So, we will have to go back to the rough
classi(cid:142) cation, R, and convert this rough classi(cid:142) cation to a virtual crisp classi(cid:142) cation,
V , on which (together with the crisp classi(cid:142) cation, C ) we will base our crisp error
matrix. V will have the same index set as R, namely J. So there will be a one to one
correspondence between the classes (Xj, Xj) of R and the classes Zj of V .

Since there is no unique way to convert a rough classi(cid:142) cation to a crisp one, and
the value of the measure that we want to compute depends on exactly how we do
this, we will have to parameterize our matrix depending on which classes of V , if
any, we assign certain component areas. The component areas will be Yi> RC, the
intersections of the classes of C with the rough components of R; in the situation
in (cid:142) gure 2 these are the white areas that have numbers in them. We do not need
to parameterize on the lower approximation s of the classes of R, since we have
no choice where to assign them; they will become zero-th order terms in our
parameterized matrix.

Given the de(cid:142) nition Cj 5 {RC| j ×C}, the N by N parameterized error matrix has

elements pi,j given by:

pi,j 5

|Yi> Xj| 1

(xi,j,K · |Yi> K |)

K ×Cj

with the following two restrictions imposed upon the parameters:

0< xi,j,K < 1 and (cid:158)

xi,j,K < 1

j

This last inequality assumes that it is permissible not to assign some of the area
covered by the areas of uncertainty to any class of V . If this is not permissible, the
inequality becomes an equality: Sj xi,j,K 5 1.

If we apply this to the example in (cid:142) gure 2, we get the parameterized error matrix
in table 2, although we have simpli(cid:142) ed the indices somewhat. The additional restric-
tions that we should impose are x

3 < 1 and x
Now we can apply any accuracy measure to this new matrix, and we will get
a formula that gives us the value of the accuracy measure depending on exactly
how we treat the areas of uncertainty in the rough classi(cid:142) cation. Theoretically, we
could then maximize and minimize this equation within the bounds imposed on
the parameters, and obtain the maximum and minimum values for the accuracy
measure applied.

Let us look at an example. Omission and commission errors are the diagonal
elements of table 2 divided by, respectively, the sum of the column and the sum of
the row. In any parameterized error matrix, this comes down to a quotient of two
linear expressions, combined with the appropriate restrictions mentioned above.

For another example, let us look at KÃ

. Each of the xi,j is a linear expression in
an unknown number of parameters in our case, the same goes for Sj xi,j and Sj xj,i.

| A|, meanwhile, is perhaps best translated as | C|, which is constant. Thus, the whole
comes down to the quotient of two quadratic expressions which should be optimized
over a hypercube limited by some hyperplanes.

For both these examples, at least local minima and maxima can be found with
software such as Matlab. Since (cid:142) nding the extremes of a quadratic expression over
an N-dimensional box is known to be NP-complete (Garey and Johnson 1979 ),
optimizing the expression for KÃ
is at least that hard. We have been unable to (cid:142) nd
any mention about the complexity of (cid:142) nding the extremes of a quotient of two linear
expressions, so have no such information about omission and commission errors.

4.4. Comparing two rough classi® cations

In the rest of this subsection, we will assume that we are comparing the rough
classi(cid:142) cation R, consisting of (X i, Xi), i ×I, with S, consisting of (Y j, Yj), j ×J. We
will make the usual assumptions |I | 5

example from (cid:142) gure 3 is given in table 3.

For this case, as well, an upper and a lower bound for overall accuracy can

4.4.3. Error matrix parameterization

To apply conventional crisp measures to this case, we can use an approach
similar to the one we used for the rough-crisp case in §4.3.4.; constructing a para-
meterized error matrix. This time, we will parameterize on the intersections of a
component of R with a component of S. We will repeat the de(cid:142) nition Ci 5 {RC |i ×C}
and add Dj 5 {SC| j ×C}. The elements of the NÖ N parameterized error matrix are
now given by:

(or make that ... 5 1 if you do not believe in not assigning parts of areas of uncertainty
to any class). Like in §4.3.4., this parameterized error matrix is linear in its parameters,
so the conclusions we have drawn there apply to this case as well.

The only diŒerence is in the number of parameters. The maximum possible
number of parameters is much larger for this case (on the order of 22N rather than
2N, a quadratic diŒerence). In practice, however, many, if not most of these parameters
(in either case) will only ever occur in the matrix multiplied by zero, and can thus
be dropped from calculations. It is harder to estimate this practical number of
parameters, but it seems likely that it will be larger in this case than in the case
in §4.3.4.

5. Experiment

The goal of our experiment was to use the idea of rough classi(cid:142) cations to compare
two vegetation maps, covering the same area of 1.8 by 2.3 km in Stockholm County,
just north of Stockholm. The two maps had been produced for nature preservation

tasks and diŒerent classi(cid:142) cation schemes were used to delineate vegetation categories
on a categorical map sheet in 1:15 000 scale. The quality in terms of spatial and
attribute accuracy of these maps are not known but for the purpose of this experiment
that is of less importance, since the main idea is to demonstrate the technique of
using rough classi(cid:142) cations.

5.1. Experiment description

In our experiment we considered the two layers as two diŒerent representations
of the same area. We started out with two vegetation maps which provided two
crisp vegetation classi(cid:142) cation layers called veg9 and veg35. Building on vegetation
concepts that were introduced by PaÃ hlsson (1972 ), veg9 was classi(cid:142) ed using moisture
and nutrient status as the classi(cid:142) cation basis giving nine diŒerent vegetation classes
for the experiment area. Veg35 used a Nordic classi(cid:142) cation system described by
PaÃ hlsson (1995), giving 35 diŒerent vegetation classes for the experiment area. The
class descriptions are given in tables 4 and 7. To compare the two, we needed to
reclassify one of them; for obvious reasons, we picked veg35. This can be seen as a
generalization operation where we reduce the number of classes from 35 to 9 and
simultaneously change the classi(cid:142) cation system.

Reclassi(cid:142) cation of veg35 into the classi(cid:142) cation scheme used for veg9 would be a
straightforward task if a one to one or many to one correspondence between the
two classi(cid:142) cation systems existed. Since this is not the case, we used the idea of
rough classi(cid:142) cation to represent the uncertainty in the reclassi(cid:142) cation operation.
Rules to reclassify from the classi(cid:142) cation system given by PaÃ hlsson (1995) to the
one given by PaÃ hlsson (1972) were constructed using both the guidelines given in
(PaÃ hlsson 1995) and our own knowledge about the association between the diŒerent
vegetation classes. The re-classi(cid:142) cation rules are given in table 7. The reclassi(cid:142) cation
rules can also be constructed using decision tables obtained through training data
sets as described in (Skowron and Grzymala-Busse 1993).

Since the reclassi(cid:142) cation of veg35 into rough classes introduces a certain degree
of uncertainty it will be of interest to see if this uncertainty can be resolved by using
additional information about the area. Given that the veg9 classi(cid:142) cation system uses
nutrition and moisture properties we could argue that more information on these
properties could give evidence to resolve some of the areas of uncertainty. We decided
to use soil information as proxy for the moisture component and provided this
evidence in the form of a digitized soil map covering the experiment area. This
required a reclassi(cid:142) cation from the soil map classes (table 5) into rough veg9 classes.

The rules for rough classi(cid:142) cation of soil classes in the soil map was entirely done by
our own knowledge about the association between soil classes and vegetation classes
in the veg9 classi(cid:142) cation scheme. These classi(cid:142) cation rules are given in table 6.

We proceeded as shown with non-dashed lines in (cid:142) gure 4, where single boxes are
crisp layers and double boxes are rough layers. We took veg35 and the soils classi(cid:142) ca-
tions and reclassi(cid:142) ed them into two separate rough classi(cid:142) cations using the nine
classes of veg9. Having this data, we produced some statistics about them and about
their match with veg9, which are presented in §5.2.

5.1.1. Merging two rough classi(cid:142) cations

The problem under consideration in this section is, given two rough classi(cid:142) cations
of the same area, with the same classi(cid:142) cation scheme, how do we combine them?
For example, if, with respect to a speci(cid:142) c piece of land, the one classi(cid:142) cation claims
that it is either forest or city, while the other classi(cid:142) cation claims that it is either
lake or forest?

Let us call the input classi(cid:142) cations A and B, and let us say that we are looking
at these classi(cid:142) cations of point x. We will call the set of classes of A of which x is a
member K; for B, we will call that set L . The output classi(cid:142) cation we will call C,
and the set of classes of which x is a member in C we will call M.

Note that in this representation we can not diŒerentiate between if x is in the
area of uncertainty of exactly one class or in the lower approximation of exactly one
class. This is acceptable, because we are looking at complete classi(cid:142) cations, and in
that case x being in the area of uncertainty of exactly one class does not really make
sense. This is true for M, the set of output classes, too. If M contains more than one

one class, x will be in the lower approximation of that class.

There are two cases that have to be considered separately. Either the two
classi(cid:142) cations contradict each other (i.e. K >
). It
is quite likely that any two classi(cid:142) cations will contradict each other in some points,
if only in sliver areas along the not-quite-equa l borders of classes.

Let us consider the non-contradictor y case (cid:142) rst. In this case, we will apply the
rule that M 5 K >
L . For a class c, if c 1 K or ck L , that means that that classi(cid:142) cation
says that it is certain that x is not in c. So only if c ×K and c ×L can we conclude
that c ×M.

But what about the contradictory case? Here, we will adopt the reasoning that,
even if they can not both be right, one of them probably is. Since we do not know
which one, we will just say that M 5 K <
L . So if classi(cid:142) cation A says that our point

X is forest, while B says that it is really water, we will conclude that it must be
either forest or water.

5.1.2. Implementation details

This work was carried out using a custom-built system, ROVer (Rough Object
Visualizer), shown in the screenshot in (cid:142) gure 5. It is based on ROSE, the RObust
System Extension, a library of spatial operators based on exact arithmetic, specially
developed for integration into a spatial database system (Gu¨ ting et al. 1995), with
an extension to ROSE that deals with rough sets. The user interface was written
, a small, e(cid:141) cient and (cid:143) exible GUI library for X11. Perl has been embedded
with gtk 1
as a programming language. ROVer can display any number of overlaid rough and
crisp classes and classi(cid:142) cations, even transparently , using a highly dynamic user
interface, and is driven by Perl scripts, which call C routines in ROSE to do the
actual computations. What is not apparent from the screen-shot is that as the user
moves the mouse over the geometry shown, not only do the coordinates update, but
also the little icons in the legend change to indicate which classes the mouse pointer
is in (showing a ‘ 1
’ if the mouse is in the lower approximation , a ‘?’ if it is in the
area of uncertainty, and a ‘Õ

’ if it is outside the rough class).

5.2. Results

The reclassi(cid:142) ed veg35 layer has an overlap measure of 1.058 and a crispness
measure of 0.308. That means that about 30% of the area is certain, and the remaining
70% is uncertain. On that uncertain area, there is overlap (overlap measure is greater
than zero). In fact, the overlap covers a little bit more than the whole classi(cid:142) cation;
there must, in other words, be areas which are in at least three areas of uncertainty.
When comparing the reclassi(cid:142) ed veg35 layer with the veg9 layer, we get an overall
accuracy in the range of [0.039, 0.461], not very good.

The merged classi(cid:142) cation has an overlap measure of 1.981 and a crispness measure
of 0.168. That means that the certain area has almost been halved as compared to

veg35, from about 30% to about 17%. About 83% of the area is uncertain, and on
those 83% there is an overlap that covers almost twice the whole classi(cid:142) cation. Since
1.981 > 0.83 Ö 2, there must be areas where there is a triple overlap; in other words,
there must be areas which are in the area of uncertainty of at least four classes. The
overall accuracy when comparing this classi(cid:142) cation to veg9 is in the range of
[0.031, 0.697], still not very good. It does mean, however, that if we get more
information about the area under consideration, we could improve the overall
accuracy at most up to 0.697.

6. Discussion

Our experiment shows the simplicity of rough classi(cid:142) cation in situations where
we have di(cid:141) culties to associate a particular area with one speci(cid:142) c category based
on available information. The experiment shows the applicability of rough classi(cid:142) ca-
tion both to reclassi(cid:142) cation of existing datasets and to performing spatial analyses
on these datasets. We also see a potential to work with rough classi(cid:142) cation in
primary classi(cid:142) cation work such as surveying. To exemplify this we would like to
highlight an example from the (cid:142) eld of research in glacial geomorphology where we
think that a rough classi(cid:142) cation would be well suited.

In a recent paper Ha¨ttestrand (1998) treated the formation and distributional
characteristics of glacial geomorphological features, particularly ribbed moraines. As

Downloaded by [George Mason University] at 14:56 29 December 2014 492

O. Ahlqvist et al.

a basis for his study a survey of glacial landforms was done covering almost two-
thirds of Sweden. One type of moraine that was mapped was the Veiki moraine, a
type of hummocky moraine characterized by plateaus with rim ridges separated by
depressions. In his survey Ha¨ttestrand used a narrower de(cid:142) nition of this moraine
type than previous work by other authors, and what came out was a more restricted
distribution of this speci(cid:142) c landform. Especially the spatial distribution of the ridges
coincided with the distribution of other ice-marginal features and suggested an
association between them. This (cid:142) nding together with other observations made a
reinterpretation of the early phases in the latest glaciation of Fennoscandia possible.
We suggest that surveying of geomorphological landform elements using rough
classi(cid:142) cation would enable a rough assignment of nearly matching features to the
upper approximation of the set. Subsequent analysis of for example the distribution
pattern may then exploit this preservation of uncertainty and make (cid:142) ndings as the
one mentioned possible.

From a geographical information system users point of view the visual interface
is a primary tool for interpretation, analyses and visualizations of geographical data.
Most current geographic information system software provides ready to use functions
to zoom in and out, regroup, aggregate and generalize the data. Still most people in
the geographic information community now realize that the digital generalization
process is still problematic and that research needs to develop methods for data
abstraction and data reduction that keep track of data quality (Mu¨ ller et al. 1995 ).
The advantage of the rough set based approach is that one doesn’t have to quantify
uncertainty.

There is of course a risk of being too vague if every question is answered with a
rough ‘maybe’. A way to compensate for this vagueness is to provide additional
information on the context of the concept or class. Freksa and Barkowsky (1996)
discuss fuzziness in geographical objects and argue that a discrete model of spatial
concepts that preserves the conceptual neighborhood has clear advantage s in practice.
A conceptual neighborhood means a situation where we either have compatible
concepts on diŒerent levels of granularity or we have competing concepts on the
same level of granularity. Some examples demonstrate this idea of conceptual neigh-
borhood in the context of concepts for spatial relations (Freksa and Barkowsky
1996, Cohn and Gotts 1996). In our experiment we show that the same ideas can
be applied to concepts such as vegetation classes. The rules we used to reclassify our
initial data into rough layers apply the idea of conceptual neighborhoods either
stated explicitly (PaÃ hlsson 1995 ), or by using an expert decision approach. Of course,
the neighborhood structure is not preserved as such in the data but in all cases of
uncertainty each item is assigned rough set values according to the concept neighbor-
hood. Thus, we see rough classi(cid:142) cation as a candidate approach for the representation
of conceptual neighborhoods in a wider perspective.

The explicit de(cid:142) nition of multiple conceptual hierarchies as a heterachy of con-
cepts as part of the meta data may help to preserve the geographical meaning in
databases (Nyerges 1991b) . Such an idea to employ a discrete model on the seman-
tic level is closely related to the mechanisms developed by Bishr (1998) to capture
and handle concepts at a level of application semantics. Bishr (1998 ) presents a
thorough background to the reasons why and how semantic similarity between
concepts should be used to develop mediator concepts to resolve, for example,
schematic heterogeneity.

resolve some of the uncertainty can be compared to the use of inference network
operations. Examples of commonly used methods include: fuzzy logic AND and OR
operations, Bayesian updating of prior probabilities to posterior probabilities, and
the related evidence theory or Dempster-Shafer theory. The latter divides a probabil-
ity space into two parts, an inner measure given by a belief function and an outer
measure given by a plausibility function.

There is an apparent similarity between Dempster-Shafer belief and plausibility,
and the upper and lower approximation s of rough sets. Let us, as an example, look
at evidence of the in(cid:143) uence of civilization. At the locations where one sees, say, grass,
one can deduce that some external in(cid:143) uence, be it a herded (cid:143) ock of sheep or a
lawnmower, must keep out the trees from that location. This can be seen as positive
evidence for the in(cid:143) uence of civilization. At other locations, such as in a forest, such
evidence may not be present, but this is not the same as evidence of the absence of
civilization. Evidence of absence could be given by, say, extensive growth of reindeer
moss, which is very fragile and grows very slowly. Dempster-Shafer belief and
plausibility diŒerentiate between these options, and so do rough sets.

This has motivated work on the relation between rough set theory and evidence
theory, which has been reported in (Skowron and Grzymala-Busse 1993 ). It follows
from their work that the overall crispness measure described in §4.1.2. can be
interpreted as a belief value in the sense of Dempster-Shafer logic. However, much
of their (cid:142) ndings remain to be applied in a spatial context such as the one reported
here. Combination of datasets in overlay operations is an important step to per-
forming multi criteria evaluation where an attempt is made to combine a set of
criteria for a decision according to a speci(cid:142) ed question. In such a set of criteria we
may want to use boolean, fuzzy and rough set layers.

7. Conclusion

We have discussed rough set based classi(cid:142) cation, and have argued that it is a
viable alternative to fuzzy set based classi(cid:142) cation when a classi(cid:142) cation with explicit
representation of uncertainty is desired. We have introduced various useful concepts
and measures related to rough classi(cid:142) cation, and have shown how to compare a
rough classi(cid:142) cation to both a crisp and a rough classi(cid:142) cation. In our experiment,
we have shown the practical use of this theory, by converting data from one
classi(cid:142) cation system to another, so they can be compared with other data in the
latter classi(cid:142) cation system, or be used for further processing that requires data in
this classi(cid:142) cation system; the uncertainty in our data is explicitly represented at each
step in the analysis. This experiment would not have been possible without the
theory developed here.

It would be possible to perform uncertain reclassi(cid:142) cation based on fuzzy set
theory. However, as stated previously, membership functions are either di(cid:141) cult to
determine or rather arbitrary. When discussing rough sets, (Yao, 1998) states: ‘Rough
membership functions may be interpreted as a special type of fuzzy membership
functions...’. One could argue then that the decision whether a data point ‘is’, ‘is not’
or ‘is maybe’ in a given class, for instance, is also rather arbitrary. However, in our
case, given the reclassi(cid:142) cation rules, it is straightforward to determine the rough
memberships for each data point of the classi(cid:142) cation.

7.1. Future work

Two alternate reclassi(cid:142) cation approaches, indicated with dashed lines in the

graph in (cid:142) gure 4, which remain to be investigated, are:

E The ‘classical’ direct conversion: Converting the crisp classi(cid:142) cation veg35
directly to the nine classes of veg9, and comparing them. This would seem to
be an inferior approach, since we cannot indicate our uncertainty when con-
verting from one classi(cid:142) cation system to another: one input class must always
map onto exactly one output class. It would, however, give us a baseline with
which to compare the other approaches.

E The rough direct conversion: Converting the two crisp classi(cid:142) cations into one
rough classi(cid:142) cation in one single step, without any intermediate classi(cid:142) cations.
This way we can be sure that we do not lose any information in intermediate
steps, which does happen in the indirect approach that we took in the experi-
ment above, see (cid:142) gure 4. A closer matching between the conversion and the
reference classi(cid:142) cation can probably be achieved this way, because we have
the maximum amount of information available on which to base our conclu-
sions, but it is more knowledge-intensive; making this mapping is much more
di(cid:141) cult than making the two consecutive mappings.

We intend to look into more appropriate measures that can be derived directly
from the rough and/or crisp classi(cid:142) cations, without the need for converting the
rough classi(cid:142) cation to a virtual crisp classi(cid:142) cation. We should probably also explore
these alternate approaches to our experiment. It would be interesting to look at
whether and how the reclassi(cid:142) cation approach and the measures developed in this
article can be extended to fuzzy data.

Another direction one might take is to develop more high-level interfaces to
rough set based systems. There would then, as we mentioned in the discussion, be a
desire to use crisp and fuzzy data as well as rough data in such high-level systems.
This would require some way of combining these three kinds of data in multi criteria
analysis, for example. Combining crisp and fuzzy layers is rather straightforward,
using crisp data as a mask on fuzzy layers. The question of how to combine rough
data in such overlay operations is, as far as we see today, nontrivial.

A (cid:142) eld that we have not covered here is the one concerned with spatial aggregation
of raster data. The increased use and availability of diŒerent air-borne sensor imagery
produces datasets on the environment from local to global scales. In order to exploit
these data there is a current need for proper aggregation and generalization methods.
In this paper we have used rough set classi(cid:142) cation to explore the possibilities to
perform generalization using a thematic approach. An interesting question that
remains to be studied is how to incorporate this with a spatial aggregation of for
example satellite imagery or other grid datasets.

Altogether, our (cid:142) ndings suggest that rough set theory and rough classi(cid:142) cation
opens an interesting (cid:142) eld for further studies as a complement to existing theories on
the representation of uncertainty in geographical information.

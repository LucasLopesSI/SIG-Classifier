Abstract
University College London’s Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic
Engineering (CEGE) offers a number of Masters programmes in topics related to
Geomatics, including Surveying, Hydrographic Surveying, Remote Sensing and Geo-
graphical Information Science. Data management, and in particular the technology
and applications of Spatial Databases, forms a key part of the curriculum on these
courses. Interest in Spatial Databases is, however, more widespread – especially with
the increasing understanding of the relevance of geospatial techniques to ﬁelds as
diverse as anthropology and architecture. This article describes the development and
evaluation of a self-paced hands-on course on Databases and Spatial Databases for
CEGE students, presented to students to complement and enhance in-class teaching.
The article focuses on both pedagogical elements of self-paced learning and the
suitability of Free and Open Source Software and Open Data (PostgreSQL/PostGIS,
Quantum GIS, Open Street Map) for the Spatial Databases curriculum. The resulting
material was evaluated by a cohort of 25 students in 2010, and their feedback (very
positive) and the overall results provide an interesting insight into suitable methods
to employ when teaching technical subjects to a cohort having differing background
skill levels.

graphical Information Science (GIS). Data management, and in particular the technology
and applications of vector data within Spatial Databases, forms a key part of the
curriculum on CEGE’s courses. Indeed, the skills required to manage spatial data within
a database are increasingly sought after by employers. Although, to the knowledge of the
author, no direct research has been undertaken into this issue, commercially focussed GIS
websites reﬂect this trend. For example, Sciencebuddies.org lists the projected growth in
demand for Geospatial Technicians as between 7% and 13% between 2006 and 2016
and lists spatial database design and development as an important part of the technician’s
role (Sciencebuddies 2011). GIS Lounge lists database skills as part of the starting
requirements for training, and adds “since GIS analysis involves the integration of spatial
and tabular data, some knowledge of relational database management (RDBMS) is a
must. Taking a class in SQL (structured query language) is important to mastering
RDBMS and understanding structured query language (SQL).” (GIS Lounge 2011). A
GeoCommunity Staff article entitled “What Skills does a GIS Analyst require?” includes
“Strong Oracle or related RDBMS skills including development skills” as technical skills
that would be very useful to have on a Curriculum Vitae (GeoCommunity 2011).

This article describes the development of a self-paced tutorial to instruct students in
the theoretical and practical elements of Databases and Spatial Databases. The tutorial
was developed in CEGE to overcome a number of issues encountered when teaching
Databases and Spatial Databases using a traditional approach consisting of three-hour
classroom-based sessions followed by three-hour practical sessions, and is now used in
conjunction with traditional teaching to facilitate students’ understanding of the topics
covered on the course. The material developed makes use of Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) and data and is suitable for both in-class and totally independent
learning. It is evaluated using two main criteria:

(cid:129) Pedagogy – does the self-paced approach to the topic enhance learning and ensure

that the required teaching aims are met?

(cid:129) Technology – do the FOSS GIS tools and Open Data provide a wide enough range of
functionality and the possibility of developing example exercises and support addi-
tional work to facilitate the students’ understanding of the concepts and completion
of the required in-class exercises and course assignment?

The remainder of this article is set out as follows. Firstly a brief overview of the material
covered on the Databases and Spatial Databases course is given. This is followed by a
description of the previous teaching approach along with a review of its strengths and
issues. Section 3 describes the development of new material incorporating best practice
from both teaching theory and previous experience, and includes a review of the pro-
cesses used to select appropriate FOSS software and data to underpin the course. A short
summary of the resulting material is then given, along with feedback from the ﬁrst cohort
to work with the new content. The article concludes with an evaluation of the revised
approach, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of FOSS technology, Open Data and the
self-paced approach to teaching and learning.

2 Background

2.1 Use of Free and Open Source Software and Data in GIS Education

Perhaps one of the earliest known examples of self-paced learning in GIS is the GISTutor
project developed in the early 1990s (Raper and Green 1992, as cited in Venkatachalam

Transactions in GIS, 2012, 16(4)

Using FOSS and Open Data for Teaching Spatial Databases

et al. 2006). This hyper-text tool allowed users to step through the tutorial and learn GIS
concepts at their own pace. Supervised self-paced learning remains a popular concept in
GIS (see for example Orshoven et al. 2011, Zerger et al. 2002, Schweik et al. 2009,
Hubeau et al. 2011). However, more recently the availability of free/libre and open
source software (FOSS) and the emergence of free Volunteered Geographic Information
(VGI, Goodchild 2007) have enabled the use of actual GIS packages and data in teaching
rather than simple hypertext forms.

Free GIS software and data has been used by Schweik et al. (2009) to provide online
tutorials to students in developing countries, although issues were encountered due to
Internet speed and other technical restrictions. Turton (2009) reports success with
GeoServer, uDig and OpenLayers when teaching students how to develop a thin web-
mapping client. Scholz et al. (2011) employ free tools and data in teaching across both
Bachelor’s and Master’s level, reporting that they feel that such tools are only suitable for
advanced GIS courses. A white paper published by the National Geospatial Technology
Center of Excellence in the United States (Tso and Smith 2011) reviewed the potential of
FOSS in GIS education, concluding that such software is useful where budgets are
restricted, where students would like to install the software on their home computers and
where speciﬁc functionality such as databases forms part of the curriculum.

2.2 Databases and Spatial Databases Curriculum in CEGE

While the majority of GIS text books make reference to Spatial Databases (for examples,
see Longley et al. 2010, pp. 252–63, Worboys and Duckham 2004, pp. 37–71) and
specialist texts relating to Spatial Databases also exist (in particular Rigaux et al. 2002,
Manolopoulos et al. 2005, Yeung and Hall 2007), they do not, individually, provide the
mix of theory and practical skills required for a Geomatics MSc graduate. The concepts
included in the CEGE course, whilst mirroring those in the text books cited, differ in the
level of detail, the order in which concepts are presented and in the greater focus on
practical as well as theoretical skills. For this reason, custom material – both theoretical
and practical – has been developed to support the entire course.

In order to facilitate understanding of how databases are used to model the world,
the course ﬁrst introduces the concepts of conceptual, logical and physical modelling of
databases. This is followed by Entity-Relationship (E-R) Diagrams, including Entities,
Relationships, Attributes, Identiﬁers, Cardinality of Attributes and Cardinality of Rela-
tionships. Students are next introduced to database concepts – tables, data types, primary
keys, foreign keys, constraints – and are taught how to move from the E-R diagram to
the database structure. For the more practical component of the course, Data Deﬁnition
Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Query components of SQL
are also included (concepts relating to normalization are offered as an advanced topic for
those wishing to further their knowledge). Once familiar with these topics, students are
introduced to concepts relating to the storage and manipulation of spatial data, how this
differs from storage of text and numbers, and the associated SQL required to create and
query this type of data. Indexing of spatial data is also covered.

2.3 Previous Approach to Teaching Spatial Databases

For the CEGE Spatial Databases course, total contact time with the students is 18 hours,
with an additional 55 hours allocated to private study and work on an assignment. In the

past (2007–2009), Spatial Database skills were taught through in-class lectures (four
lectures of 3 hours each). These consisted of a mixture of theoretical concepts accom-
panied by paper-based exercises – for example, students were required to form groups in
class and create an E-R diagram of a library system, adding to the diagram each time a
new component of the E-R model was introduced. To introduce database concepts,
students drew three tables on paper to model land ownership (land parcels, land owners
and properties) and were then asked to allocate data types to each column in their tables.
Examining the relationships between the three tables helped students to become familiar
with primary keys, foreign keys and other constraints. To gain familiarity with SQL, they
were required to write (on paper) the SQL required to create the three tables and
populate them.

To facilitate the understanding of spatial data storage, students were given a list of
coordinates and asked to draw, on a blank piece of paper, the feature or features that they
think the list represents. As part of this process, they were required to identify any
additional information required – such as projection, single or multi-geometry, point line
or polygon, does the object have an internal hole, is the object 2D or 3D – to understand
what the coordinates represented. Standards for storing spatial data (i.e. Well-Known
Text, Herring 2010) were introduced, and spatial and non-spatial indexing theory
covered.

Two of the classroom-based sessions were followed with a 3-hour practical session
in which the students were given time to apply the knowledge learned – for example, to
create a real set of tables to match those created on paper in class, and populate and
query them using SQL. They were shown, via a series of step-by-step instructions, how
to create spatial objects in a GIS and view the results in the database and vice versa, to
illustrate the principle of ‘store once, reuse many times’ and help in the understanding of
spatial data storage and how this differs from text or number storage. The MapInfo
Professional (Version 8.5, Pitney Bowes 2011) GIS package was used in conjunction with
Oracle Spatial (Version 10.1.0.3.0, Oracle 2011) for the lab sessions.

For their assignment, students were asked to create an E-R diagram for a cleaning
and maintenance system for transport stands, shelters and stops, translate this diagram
into appropriate tables, create and populate the tables using SQL and then answer a
number of questions from the database, again using SQL.

2.4 Strengths of, and Issues with, the Previous Approach

The students on the CEGE courses come from a wide variety of backgrounds. Some have
just completed their undergraduate course (in subjects ranging from Engineering to
Geography and History), others are mid-career professionals looking for further training
in Geomatics or looking to make a complete career change. The ethnic mix of the group
is diverse – students’ originate from the UK, Europe, the US, China, India and Africa and
for many students English is a second or even a third language.

2.4.1 Strengths

Much of the content of the course takes this diversity into account. For example, all
in-class exercises and assignments are selected to focus on topics with which students

Using FOSS and Open Data for Teaching Spatial Databases

439

are generally familiar: transport systems, banks, libraries. Additionally, the mix of
theory and in-class, paper-based, exercises helps to break up the 3-hour session into
more manageable chunks and allows for the diversity of learning approaches in a
student cohort (McClellan and Conti 2008). In particular, the teaching of database
design via E-R diagrams appeared to work well in its current form, as evidenced by the
quality of assignments submitted by prior cohorts. Although this is perhaps one of the
more difﬁcult concepts to master, according to Connoly and Begg (2006) the material
has been developed using the constructivist approach that they suggest, building on
knowledge that the students already have about the world around them and allowing
active learning through in-class exercises. Additionally, assignment-based assessment
allows the students to engage in depth with what is a very technical topic where an
examination-based assessment would only permit students to engage superﬁcially
reaching the multi-structural level of learning (Biggs 1996, see Section 3.1). Using the
extended assignment, which covers the course material from start to ﬁnish, it is pos-
sible to ensure that students’ understanding of all the concepts covered in the lectures
and practical sessions is assessed (moving students towards the extended abstract level,
Biggs 1996).

2.4.2 Issues

Observation of the various groups taught using the separate lecture/lab system (two
cohorts) revealed, however, that the teaching of the more practical concepts – i.e. those
relating to databases, tables, constraints and SQL – raised a number of issues. Concepts
were ﬁrst presented in an abstract form in class, and not immediately applied in practice.
At times there was a gap of up to a week between the in-class session and the related lab
session. Technical skills and experience within each group were also very mixed. Thus the
more advanced students worked through lab sessions in 1–2 hours, leaving the students
who were new to the subject demoralized, although they were in fact able to ﬁnish within
the allocated time. In some cases, the step-by-step approach used in the lab sessions
(developed in order to accommodate the differing skill levels of the students and give
them a realistic chance of completing the work) resulted in some students taking a
mechanistic approach to the topic; the lab sessions were not assessed and the step-by-step
guidelines made it easy to complete the work without a real understanding of the
underlying principles or processes (a form of spoon-feeding, Smith 2008). The limited
staff/student contact time also caused issues, as students were required to work through
a large amount of material in a short period of time. The Oracle Spatial/MapInfo
Professional combination meant that students were required to work in a speciﬁc
computer lab (due to the expense of acquiring licenses for use on their personal laptops
or home computers) to complete their assignments, which caused problems due to lack
of out-of hours access.

The overall result was, perhaps, a “surface approach” to learning (‘memorising the
course materials for the purposes of assessment’, Richardson 2005) for the more prac-
tical aspects of the subject. Some students then struggled when attempting to translate the
concepts encountered in class and in the lab to a response to the ﬁnal assignment. This
also impeded the possibility of their using the skills gained for further project work later
on in the MSc.

3.1 Pedagogy

3 Devising a More Open, Freely Accessible, Approach

Given the relevance of the topic to future employment in a GIS and Geomatics environ-
ment it was felt that it would be important to move more students beyond a basic
understanding (where learning is ‘acquiring information’, Saljo 1979 in Richardson
2005) towards the more complex internalization of learning (‘interpreting and under-
standing reality in a different way’, ibid.). A change in the method of teaching was
required to encourage students towards a “deep approach” to learning (Richardson
2005), and hence to the ability to apply what they learn in other contexts and settings
(the highest level of learning, Biggs 1996).

As any experienced lecturer will have observed, not all students learn in the same
manner. This may be due to their diverse previous educational experiences (Hofstede
1986 and Teekens 2001b, as cited in Otten 2003), to their own preferred methods of
engaging with new material (McClennan and Conti 2008) or their own disciplinary and
educational background. Additionally,
the concept of multiple intelligences ﬁrst
described by Howard Gardner in 1983 (cited and reviewed in McClennan and Conti
2008) suggests that there are a total of nine different personal learning styles and
constructivism suggests that students build knowledge on previous knowledge (Steffe and
Gale 1995, as cited in Biggs 1999). Given the diverse background of the students, it is
thus important that the starting point for any course material is based on principles and
concepts that will be familiar to all students, and that this principle is carried through to
assessment to ensure that students have an equal opportunity to successfully complete the
material assigned. As noted above, this principle has generally been observed in the
course material developed in relation to E-R diagrams. This material has been carried
forward into the new course.

The level of students’ engagement with the material is also relevant. Richardson

(2005) identiﬁes three approaches to learning:

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

the deep approach, where the student aims to understand the meaning of the course
materials
the surface approach, where the student memorises the course materials for assess-
ment
the strategic approach, where the student selects appropriate strategies based on
getting the highest grades.

Marton and Saljo (1984) note that the learner’s conception of themselves as a learner
also has an impact. Marton (1976, as cited in Richardson 2005) suggests that their
approach can be modiﬁed by the use of appropriate teaching techniques. It is ideal that
the students engage with the material through a deep approach and gain a thorough
understanding of the content presented, along with an ability to apply this in a real-world
context. Teacher-focused teaching relates to a one-way transmission of information to
the students whereas student-focused teaching aims to bring about a conceptual change
in the students. Students scored better and are more likely to use a deep approach when
teaching is student-focused (Richardson 2005). Whilst for the E-R diagram and design
elements of the course students were able to engage directly with the material following
presentation of the theory, this was not the case for the practical aspects including SQL.
The concept of hierarchies of learning, such as the SOLO (Structure of Observed

Learning Outcomes) approach was proposed by Biggs (1996) amongst others:

© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd
Transactions in GIS, 2012, 16(4)

Using FOSS and Open Data for Teaching Spatial Databases

441

(cid:129) Prestructural – Misses point
(cid:129) Unistructural – Identify, do simple procedure
(cid:129) Multistructural – Enumerate, describe, list, combine, do algorithms
(cid:129) Relational – Compare/contrast, explain causes, analyse, relate, apply
(cid:129) Extended abstract – Theorize, generalize, hypothesize, reﬂect

To achieve the higher levels of learning, students should be able to understand both the
detail of the topic and how to apply it (relational level) and also understand the topic in
the context of other, related material (extended abstract level). The use of particular
techniques for in-class teaching, exercises and assessment may assist the students in
reaching these higher levels.

In summary, it is important that the material developed:

(cid:129) Makes use of principles with which the students are familiar, particularly as a starting
point (material and examples from the previous version of the course can be taken
forward for this purpose)

(cid:129) Presents the concepts in a structured way, ensuring that each concept builds on
previous ones (again the previous course starts with basic building blocks and works
up from these)

(cid:129) Allows for the fact that students would like to engage with the material in different
ways – some students will prefer reading, some listening, others paper-based exer-
cises, others computer-based exercises, some will prefer text, others diagrams.
(cid:129) Ensures that the varied technical skill levels of the students are taken into account.
(cid:129) Assesses the students in as equitable a manner as possible, taking into account their
diverse backgrounds. The assessment requires the students to create a spatial data-
base and GIS for a public transport system. Public transport was selected as students
from diverse backgrounds were likely to be familiar with such systems.

Following these considerations, a self-paced, stand-alone, student-centred approach
(Shuell 1986, as cited in Biggs 1996) was deemed appropriate for the more practical
elements of the course. Self-paced learning is fundamental, given that some students have
very little computer science background and others are already familiar with the concepts
from undergraduate level. To accommodate diverse learning styles, the material devel-
oped should contain a mix of theory and exercises accompanied by hands-on practical
work, and should use different techniques – for example text, diagrams, and video, to
engage the student. To maximize access and availability, and take into account differing
technical skills, the material should be delivered in such a way as to allow students to
work externally to the classroom or lab, in their own time. Free Open Source Software
(FOSS) and Open Data were seen as fundamental to achieving these aims.

3.2 Selecting and Evaluating Free Open Source Software and Open Data

Steiniger and Bocher (2009) note that FreeGIS.org lists over 330 GIS FOSS products and
a recent (unpublished) review by Sharp (2010) identiﬁed that 24 out of a possible 43
mappable quality of life indicators (from a list provided by the Audit Commission, who
are the UK’s independent watchdog with responsibility for ensuring economy, efﬁciency
and effectiveness in local public services) were freely available on the UK Government
Open Data service, http://data.gov.uk. Thus a wide range of both software and data
options were (and are) available to underpin the course. An informal review of the

442

C Ellul

available options was conducted when the course material was initially developed (the
ﬁrst half of 2010). This exercise has been repeated more formally, although with the same
requirements and evaluation criteria, for the purposes of this article.

3.2.1 Selecting the database management system

In order to ensure that the required concepts were covered, the selected software should
include an Object-Relational database (capable of handling spatial data). Three possible
options were identiﬁed; Table 1 shows the criteria used for ﬁnal selection:

(cid:129) PostgreSQL has been in development for 15 years and supports standard database
data types (integers, text, dates and so forth) and conforms to the ANSI:SQL 2008
standard. PostGIS is an extension to PostgreSQL, and has been designed to add
support for spatial objects to the database (PostgreSQL 2011).

(cid:129) Oracle Express (Oracle XE) is an entry-level, small-footprint database based on the
Oracle Database 10g Release 2 code base. It provides a greatly simpliﬁed implemen-
tation of Oracle, with easier download and installation and provides full access to all
of Oracle’s Spatial functionality (Oracle XE 2011).

(cid:129) MySQL is perhaps one of the most popular FOSS relational databases, and forms a
key component of the web development LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and
PHP) which underpins many websites (MySQL 2011).

While support for standards such as the Open Geospatial Consortium’s (OGC) Simple
Feature Access (OGC 2010a) should perhaps be considered when evaluating spatial
databases, this criterion was not included. All three databases make use of a published
storage format for spatial data, to which any GIS vendor can then provide a connection.
However, not all of these storage formats are standards-based. For example, Oracle’s
SDO_Geometry format was published in 1999 (Oracle 2010) whereas the OGC’s Simple
Feature Access speciﬁcations and related standards were ﬁrst published in 2003 (OGC
2010). Therefore, the ability of the various GIS packages to connect to the databases and
utilize the data held within was considered more relevant for the software selection
process. Similarly, support for the OGC’s spatial analysis functions and comparison
operators (OGC 2010b) could be considered relevant, but only for advanced users of
SQL. For beginners, it is perhaps easier to make use of the functionality provided within
the GIS package itself.

Given that many of the criteria were well-supported by all three database manage-
ment systems, PostgreSQL with PostGIS was selected based on the multi-platform
conﬁguration (increasing numbers of CEGE students use Apple Mac OS) and on the
greater availability of Spatial SQL queries when compared to MySQL. The range of
FOSS desktop GIS that can connect to PostGIS was an additional bonus. Even though
compliance with standards was not considered as part of the selection criteria, PostGIS
does in fact implement the Simple Features – SQL Types and Functions (OGC 2011).

3.2.2 Selecting a desktop GIS client

A number of free GIS packages are listed in a document entitled “Open Source GIS”
(Open Source GIS 2008), last updated in 2008. However, many of the packages listed
here are not fully ﬂedged GIS software packages with an appropriate installer (executable
ﬁle) for the Windows platform. Indeed, a number of them are code libraries for use by

Using FOSS and Open Data for Teaching Spatial Databases

developers. In contrast, the website of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation lists three
desktop GIS – GRASS, Quantum GIS and gvSIG (OSGeo 2011) – in this case, these are
packages that have passed through an incubation process (OSGeo 2011b) before joining
the Foundation. Previous reviews of FOSS GIS include Steiniger and Bocher (2009),
Donnelly (2010) and Chen et al. (2010), with the latter being particularly relevant as the
authors ranked packages using criteria which included Internet connection and security,
operating system, programming language, level of complexity, data format and database
connectivity, maturity, and installation processes. Steiniger and Bocher (2009) provide
additional information on the database connectivity of the packages appearing at the top
of the Chen et al. (2010) rankings, and Donnelly (2010) reviews an almost identical list
of software from the perspective of basic functionality such as opening an Esri shapeﬁle,
selecting features and producing a map layout.

The top four packages listed by Chen et al. (2010) were considered, as follows.
Table 2 compares these packages against our selection criteria (the list reﬂects a more
formal write-up of an informal evaluation conducted in 2010).

(cid:129) Quantum GIS (QGIS) was created in 2002 as a simple interface for the long-standing
FOSS GIS called GRASS. It has the ability to include custom plug-in extensions in the
Python Language and can work with many GIS data types (Steiniger and Bocher
2009).

(cid:129) gvSIG desktop can access the most common formats, both vector and raster data and
includes query tools, layout creation and networking tools. It can connect to external
data sources (databases or OGC data sources) and functionality can be extended via
the Java language (gvSIG 2011).

(cid:129) MapWindow GIS – a FOSS GIS with an extensible architecture based on the C#
language. The desktop version uses an ActiveX control at its core. Functionality can
be extended by plug-ins (MapWindow 2011).

(cid:129) OpenJump GIS is written in the Java programming language which can handle
multiple types of GIS ﬁles and provides extensibility via additional Java plug-ins
(OpenJump 2011).

Many of the FOSS Desktop GIS scored equally against our short list of criteria. Map-
Window was eliminated due to only supporting Microsoft Windows operating systems
Quantum GIS was selected due to being long-established and the ease of connecting to
the selected database (PostGIS) without a plug-in. The ability to upload Esri .shp ﬁles
also played a part in the decision, and QGIS was ranked highest in the more detailed
evaluation conducted by Chen et al. (2010).

3.2.3 Obtaining free data for teaching

In the past, spatial data was produced and provided by either governmental bodies, such
as national mapping agencies, commercial data providers or other large organizations
(Michael F. Goodchild, interviewed in Schuurman, 2009). It was provided in a top down
manner as data products, such as those provided by the Ordnance Survey (the National
Mapping Agency in the UK). However, with the emergence of the geographical infor-
mation technologies forming part of Web Mapping 2.0 (Goodchild 2007, Haklay et al.
2008, Elwood 2008) modes of production and consumption of geographical information
have changed.

Using FOSS and Open Data for Teaching Spatial Databases

447

Despite this movement towards more openness, at the time of evaluation (early
2010), the Ordnance Survey’s Open Data content had not yet been released to the public,
and the UK Government’s Open Data Store (http://data.gov.uk/) was in its infancy. Open
Street Map (OSM) data was selected. The OSM project started at UCL in 2004.
Volunteers (currently over 180,000) contributed to create a free editable vector map of
the world (see Haklay and Weber 2008 for a detailed description). For the purposes of
this course, the road network dataset for the UK was selected, along with building
polygons and points of interest, all for the Euston/Bloomsbury area of London.1

4 Resulting Material and Student Feedback

The virtual learning environment of choice at UCL is Moodle (http://www.moodle.com),
which allows a variety of material to be included for a speciﬁc course, ranging from
books, PDF ﬁles, videos, online quizzes and questionnaires, audio and links to other
websites. The ﬁrst part of content development involved the design of a step-by-step
installation guide was developed to explain the process of software download and
installation for both Quantum GIS and PostgreSQL/PostGIS.

A second element of course content consists of an introduction to databases and
spatial database theory and was developed as a Moodle book (Moodle 2011), which
allows the creation of multi-page resources that can be browsed through by students in
a similar manner to a text book (Figure 1). The contents included an introduction to
database theory (repeating material covered in class, but presenting it in a different
format), followed by specialist information on Spatial Databases. The book approach
allows students to work through the material systematically at their own pace, moving
forwards and backwards as required. A multiple-choice quiz was developed to allow
students to test their understanding of the theory. To date, content relating to E-R
diagrams has not been migrated to this environment. Given the success of the previous
approach, the approach taken has remained the same – i.e. a classroom-based mix of
lecture and hands-on paper-based exercises.

The third component of the course included practical material related to learning
SQL in an applied context. Three videos were created to instruct the students on the
process of opening the database and importing the OSM data into PostGIS via QGIS. A
second Moodle book was developed to take the students through a number of step-by-
step exercises related to the process of creating tables in the database, adding data,
spatially enabling the tables, creating spatial indexes and querying the data in the
database and through the GIS. Learning on this part of the course was validated through
a second multiple-choice (Moodle-based) quiz that was developed to allow students to
validate their understanding of the topic at the conclusion of the practical exercises.

The assignment for the revised course remains unchanged – however, students may
now implement the practical part of the work in PostgreSQL/PostGIS and QGIS rather
than in MapInfo Professional and Oracle Spatial.

4.1 Student Feedback

The revised material was trialled with 20 students in their second term of the MSc. in GIS
in CEGE, in 2010. All students managed to work their way through the material and
complete the quizzes, scoring an average mark of 8.68/10 for the ﬁrst quiz and 9.08/10

for the second quiz (Figure 2). Support was provided during the two time-tabled lab
sessions – students could either make use of the CEGE computers at this time, or bring
their own laptops to class.

The average grade for the ﬁnal assignment was 72%, which is higher than previous
years (where averages were around 65%). This may, however, be due to issues with the
quizzes – student feedback indicated that the answers had been very quickly passed
around the class.

The students were asked to provide feedback on the course, via an online question-
naire. Overall, they found both QGIS and PostgreSQL/PostGIS software easy to install
(rated 4.0 on a scale of 1 to 5 where 5 was the easiest), the theoretical background easy
to understand (3.9 on the same scale) and the practical exercises easy (3.9 again). They
were asked to specify whether they preferred self-paced independent learning, in-class
guided learning or both, with a total of only 5% preferring in class exercises, 24%
self-paced learning and 71% a mixture of both. Comparing different ways of presenting
material, on a scale of 1 to 5 where 5 is a very suitable approach, Moodle Web Pages
rated 4.0, Video rated 4.2 and Moodle Books rated 4.4.

5 Evaluation

The two evaluation criteria outlined at the beginning of this article relate to pedagogy
and technology. From the pedagogical perspective, the literature highlighted the rel-
evance of the self-paced approach to overcome previous issues relating to diverse back-
grounds and skill sets. Students were able to go through the material in their own time,
using their own computer and moving backwards and forwards between sections in a
way which would not have been possible in class. Despite this, the large majority of the
students (71%) stated that a mixture of self-paced learning and classroom-based learning
was the most appropriate approach within the context of this topic. However, in many
cases it could be noted that a different type of interaction was taking place during the
practical sessions. Rather than the students working through the set material, many used
the opportunity to ask speciﬁc questions either related to the theory or to practical
problems they had encountered.

Presenting a diverse range of material – quizzes, Moodle Books, practical work to
apply theoretical knowledge, in-class exercises, in-class presentations – did indeed engage

the students, although the success of video technique was mixed. The use of video was
very well received by the students but it was difﬁcult to create video of sufﬁciently high
quality due to the restrictions in Moodle (video was restricted to 480*270 pixels due to
ﬁle size issues).

The self-paced approach taken to the teaching material, which allowed students to
apply theoretical knowledge of SQL directly to a practical situation as they encountered
each concept was very successful. This also allowed students to make mistakes and
attempt to solve them for themselves, rather than being assisted by colleagues or the
lecturer to ensure that they kept pace with the remainder of the group. Developing
independent problem-solving skills provides a solid grounding for dissertation work and
future employment.

From the technological perspective, both PostgreSQL/PostGIS and QGIS have
proven more than adequate tools to deliver material relating to the concepts outlined in
Section 2.1. In particular the standards-based approach used by PostGIS gives students
an excellent introduction to standards-based systems described by the OGC’s Simple
Feature Access standards (OGC 2010a, b) whereas Oracle Spatial uses its own storage
format, which can be seen as complex by some. QGIS connects directly to PostGIS, and
once data is imported students are able to easily view and edit data in the database or in
the GIS. Both selected packages were easy to install on the range of operating systems
likely to be used by the CEGE student cohort.

On a more general note, the use of Open Source software and data reﬂects a growing
trend in GIS, in part driven by the downturn in the economy which means that many
users cannot afford the expensive licenses for the mainstream desktop GIS and associated
datasets. The material delivered on this course was thus considered very relevant by the
students and also makes the course scalable to any number of students. Both the initial
informal review of available software and the more structured review presented here
highlighted the range of available products (databases and desktop GIS) that met the
requirements and were well-established enough to be considered as viable options.

In terms of the decision-making process when selecting the software, it was inter-
esting to discover that no information was available on the user-base (i.e. number of
installations) for the software packages – neither commercial nor FOSS. This would have
been helpful in terms of selecting the most commonly used software to ensure that the
skills developed by the students were as relevant as possible to their future careers. As
discussed in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 above, an attempt was made as part of the current
review to use ‘jobs requiring Skill X’ as a proxy for this measure. While information was
available for the database management systems, no listings for any of the FOSS Desktop
GIS were found on the websites consulted. This may lead one to question the relevance
to students of developing skills with FOSS GIS. Additionally, it should be noted that it is
the ‘Free’ in FOSS that is of relevance to this project (hence the inclusion of Oracle XE
in the list of databases) – many students are not necessarily competent enough in the
various programming languages to make a direct contribution to an Open Source
project, and for those with the skills, time pressures of the course may preclude them
from doing so.

Finally, two issues that arose in relation to teaching the more advanced concepts
using this approach are worth highlighting. Firstly, although students can now make
changes within their own local database installation, and see these changes in the GIS and
vice versa, they are not able to see the changes made by others as was possible when a
centralized Oracle server was used. Although a central PostGIS database could have been

conﬁgured, this would not be accessible from outside the UCL network (due to ﬁrewall
issues) and would additionally mean that students could not access the course entirely on
their own machines. The trade-off in moving from a central database server means that
they do not get to experience ﬁrst hand the real potential of a multi-user, multi-client
database, or to fully understand and engage with the concept of a database as a central
repository of data. A second issue relates to the requirement in QGIS to create temporary
tables in PostGIS when subsets (or views) of the data are required.2 This means that data
is copied, which goes against the ‘one fact one place’ concept that underpins all database
design.

6 Conclusion and Further Work

The combination of in-class learning for theory (e.g. E-R diagrams) and the more open
self-paced, hands-on approach for the practical skills required on this course has been
selected to enable the course content to meet the requirements of our own students and
has proved successful in this context. FOSS Desktop GIS, FOSS Spatial Databases and
Open Data are excellent tools to support teaching and the material developed has been
reused in subsequent MSc courses and two GIS summer schools.

Given the very high average marks on the initial quiz, further work is required to
develop quizzes that perhaps challenge the students more and provide a more in-depth
assessment of the learning process. Randomized questions, taken from a larger pool,
could also be used to address this issue. It has also been noted that the course material
will require a short process of re-evaluation every year to ensure that both the open
source technology and the data are still available as referenced, and that no signiﬁcant
version changes have occurred (for example since the start of the project, four new
versions of QGIS have been released).3 This could be mitigated through the provision of
a pre-conﬁgured virtual machine for each student. However, that would mean that
students are not then given the experience of installing and conﬁguring software them-
selves. Advanced students frequently demonstrate an interest in this process, and FOSS
enables any UCL student to make use of the tutorial.

It is anticipated that a revision of course content will be required in 3–5 years time
to incorporate updates in the ﬁeld of Spatial Databases. Additionally, during the review
process, group-based assignments were suggested as more appropriate than individual
work, as these more closely mirror the experience of databases that the students will
encounter in the real world (Kobben et al. 2010, Connoly and Begg 2006).

As with many Universities, interest in Spatial Databases at UCL is far more wide-
spread than CEGE – especially with the increasing understanding of the relevance of
geospatial techniques to ﬁelds as diverse as anthropology and architecture. Further work
to develop a stand-alone, self-paced version of the E-R diagramming and database design
components of the course is thus being considered as a pre-requisite to opening up this
course to a wider audience within CEGE and beyond. This will be accompanied by a
review of the course content as a whole – while having a good understanding of
conceptual, logical and physical modelling, SQL, spatial data storage and manipulation
is fundamental to a GIS or Geomatics graduate, it may be less relevant for someone who
simply wishes to use the database to integrate multiple datasets and then map them in a
GIS.

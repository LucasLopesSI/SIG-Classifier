Abstract A series of travel simulators have been developed in the past two decades
under the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) umbrella. They have addressed
issues such as reactions to advisory radio and variable message signs, use of
navigation systems, route diversion, and mode choice. The objective of this paper is
to present the design and implementation of a different kind of travel simulator.
GABRIEL (Gis Activity-Based tRavel sImuLator) has as a foundation the activity-
based approach and makes use of geographic information systems (GIS) as a
development environment. The simulation scenario consists of a commute trip
where two activities take place. En-route to the first destination, congestion occurs
and subjects are requested to take action based on a set of alternatives. The
simulator provides re-routing, destination substitution, dynamic geographic infor-
mation and real-time information to aid users in their decision-making process. As a
result it helps subjects in developing their ability to adapt given a particular scenario
and allow researchers in understanding trip making, activity rescheduling, and the
decision-making process from a comprehensive perspective.

technological innovations as well as new methodologies, philosophies, and practices
applicable to transport have been produced. These have contributed not only to the
reduction of the negative effects produced by the transport system (i.e., pollution
and congestion), but also to the increase in quality of the transportation network
and its services [26]. As part of the technological advancements Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS) and Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS)
emerged. Considerable research exists in these two areas, from the design
perspective [4]–[6], [42], [44], [45], [49] as well as from the effects and benefits
these technologies can bring [24], [27], [40], [55]. Vehicle navigation systems are a
result of some of the design developments achieved under these technologies [7],
[9], [11], [13], [16], [29], [30], [34], [35], [41], [54].

Vehicle navigation systems have been widely researched. However, the adoption,
use, and design of these systems has until today been difficult to estimate and plan
due to their societal and organizational effects and to the cost and time it takes to
implement them. Technology has become less of a concern to open the way to more
social, institutional, and geographic factors [26]. These are critical issues which are
not completely understood and result in questions partially or fully unanswered.
Examples include: how will these technologies affect individual travel behavior?
How do individuals respond to the technology? Who will adopt the technology?
What are the characteristics of the people adopting the technology? How do people
change their commuter behavior? Are people willing to pay for the new technology?
What do they think the new technology should include? Do they make use of all the
information provided by the technology? This research addresses some of these
questions and how they relate to the design of a navigation system under an
Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) context.

ATIS and its components under ITS are crucial in shaping how ICT relates to
transportation [23]. They are designed with the main goal of increasing efficiency of
existing transportation systems and substituting electronic communication for
movement. They contribute in improving access by providing information and
suggesting different alternatives to users. ATIS provide users with real time
information on driving conditions, routes, alternative destination choices, parking
availability, and other useful traveler information. Due to the complexity of these
systems,
it is important to involve the end users in identifying information
requirements that affect their travel behavior and decision-making process. There
are two experimental approaches to evaluating ATIS behavioral responses
according to Schofer et al. [49]: the stated preference approach and observational
studies. Studies under these two approaches have helped in understanding travel
behavior and in answering questions such as: how travelers use ATIS, how and when
do travelers use ATIS, why do travelers use ATIS, how do travelers perceive ATIS,
and what are the consequences of using ATIS [49].

These types of questions have been commonly addressed by the use of travel
simulators. Earlier versions of travel simulators were built to elicit individual_s
response to ATIS technology. This included navigation systems, advisory radio, pre-
trip information, and variable message signs. Over the years, travel simulators
developed giving origin to a classification system based on their uses. Polak and
Axhausen (as cited by [35], p. 146) classified simulators into one of three categories:
in-vehicle behavior research, driving behavior research, and travel behavior
research. Examples can be found in [1], [3], [5], [11], [29].

GeoInformatica (2006) 10: 469–493

The focus of this research is on the last category: travel behavior related to
travelers_ choices. A new simulator called GABRIEL: Gis Activity-Based tRavel
sImuLator is proposed where the development environment is a Geographic
Information System (GIS) and the theoretical base is the activity-based approach.
These are characteristics that distinguish it from previous simulators. GABRIEL
collects stated preference data based on a simulated scenario. The scenario
corresponds to a real life situation subjects experience on a daily basis. The design
follows the characteristics outlined by Kwan [37], which highlights the benefits of
combining GIS and the activity-based approach and the philosophy proposed by
Adler and Blue [4].

The paper is organized as follows. First, the underlying behavioral approaches
and the existing simulators are described. Then, the simulator design, architecture,
inputs, scenario, outputs, and implementation are discussed. Next results from the
data collection process and conclusions are presented.

2 Literature review

2.1 Spatial behavior and the activity-based approach

individuals are unaware of

Theories of spatial knowledge acquisition were developed based on the study of
spatial abilities such as the ability to: think geometrically, perceive spatial and
3D relations, recognize spatial patterns, direction, and distance, and understand
network structures. In a network environment,
for example, route creation,
route choice, and the ability to process information and how to relate it to a
location in space are linked to an individual_s spatial knowledge. However,
their ability to
spatial studies have shown that
acquire knowledge (refer to [19] for references on theories of the development
of spatial knowledge). They do not think of how they learn or make decisions
about spatial scenarios; instead they make use of the information they possess
in the form of landmarks and routes to carry out their choices. It is, therefore,
important to turn the attention to evaluating how people decompose the spatial
information they obtain to solve everyday problems. The level of knowledge
and availability of ICT people acquire and have access to, not only has an
effect in how people perceive ATIS technology, but also in how they use it to
advance their spatial knowledge. Learning how people acquire this spatial
knowledge and how they use it in their decision-making process is an important
component in the design of new information systems; the latter in particular is
of interest to this research.

Important to this research are also the cognitive mapping process and its
relationship to geographic information systems. As part of the cognitive-mapping
process, knowledge is created and used, leading to model creation. These models
incorporate decision-making processes based on the information and knowledge
that an individual has about their space [25], [36], [38]. Golledge et al. [20] examined
the relationship between cognitive mapping and GIS and concluded that the use of
GIS to simulate human decision-making in a given environment should be
promoted given that its use can lead to faster and more accurate spatial information
processing than humans are capable of.

472

GeoInformatica (2006) 10: 469–493

In a traveling environment, spatial decisions include where to conduct certain
activities and what routes to take to get there. These are influenced by the
individuals_ characteristics, their behavior, and the attributes associated with the
activities. Activities occur at uniform intervals in the life of an individual or
household, motivated by a need, a choice mechanism, and a spatial component. This
allows activities to be viewed as routines, which can be carried out daily, weekly, or
seasonally [19]. Routines allow the creation of patterns of behavior, which become
the appropriate object of analysis for understanding human spatial behavior.

The notion that mobility is a means for individuals to participate in activities
motivated the study of activity patterns and therefore promoted the use of the
activity-based approach. The activity-based approach emerged in the mid 1970s
based on an international discontent with the standard models being used in
transportation planning. New behaviorally oriented models were then developed,
with the primary focus being the individual. These models motivated the need for
the development of travel simulators.

Simulators are data collection tools designed to portray an experimental scenario
with the purpose of understanding human behavior. They rely on the premise that
individuals have a planned set of activities that require scheduling where trips must
be arranged between them. The motivation to travel generates from a need to carry
out an activity, which allows it to handle travel as a derived demand. The decision of
making a trip has three components: the range of possible activities, a set of
destinations offering suitable facilities for activity participation, and the character-
istics of the available transport system [17]. The resulting choice is a function of
these three factors and time and space constraints.

Given that engaging in an activity at a particular location is what generates a travel
demand and what causes the most common problems (traffic congestion) an ATIS
implementation tried to solve, the activity-based approach seems an appropriate
design methodology to adopt. According to Kwan [37] an activity-based travel
decision support system should provide rerouting, destination substitution, activity
rescheduling, handling of static and dynamic geographic information, and provision
of rules and procedures for producing a realistic choice to the user. Nevertheless,
some implementation difficulties associated with the application of the activity-
based method in an ATIS context exist. These include: the inability to handle and
process realistic spatial information about the environment, too many alternatives
for the user to handle, and the dynamic and recursive nature of activity scheduling,
which implies adjustments on the run. The next section describes travel simulators
and computational process models, which include some of the above characteristics
and account for some of these disadvantages.

2.2 Travel simulators and computational process models (CPM)

2.2.1 Travel simulators

Simulators have been developed mostly as experimental tools, to collect data and
test hypotheses and theories of behavior. They are computer programs, which vary
in level of sophistication, and simulate a scenario of interest. The following review
focuses on simulators developed for research purposes.

GeoInformatica (2006) 10: 469–493

473

Adler and McNally [5] present a comprehensive discussion on a set of travel
simulators. IGOR (Interactive Guidance on Routes) by Bonsall and Parry [9], is
the first simulator introduced, which simulates en-route travel through a network
and the provision of real-time information. Following IGOR_s path is VLADIMIR
by Bonsall et al. [10], which has as primary purpose to explore the influence of
route-guidance and information on drivers_ route choice. The next simulator,
developed at MIT by Koutsopoulos et al. [34],
is used to collect data and
calibrate a route–choice model incorporating concepts of fuzzy logic and fuzzy
set theory. Chen and Mahmassani_s [13] simulator follows, which presents a
complete system for pre-trip planning, en-route travel (diversion decision), and
post-trip evaluation, including a traffic simulation program and multiple driver–
participant capability.

Neither one of these simulators allows the user to actively seek information.
To control for this limitation, Adler et al. [3] introduced FASTCARS (Freeway
and Arterial Street Traffic Conflict Arousal and Resolution Simulator),
developed at the University of California at Irvine, which simulates pre-trip
and en-route travel decision-making using real-time information. FASTCARS
simulates ATIS components such as: variable message signs (VMS), highway
advisory radio (HAR), and in-vehicle navigation system (IVNS). FASTCARS_
main objective is to study the impact of perfect information availability on driver
behavior.

A different set of simulators have been evaluated by Koutsopoulos et al. [35]
based on network representation, traveler and driving task, and information
provision. Four are relevant to this research and include: Iida et al. [28], Allen
et al. [7], Vaughn et al. [53], and Polak and Jones [47]. Iida et al._s [28] simulator
objective is to study the dynamics of route–choice behavior as a function of the
drivers_ daily experience. Allen et al. [7] developed a system to compare the effect
of four navigation systems on driver diversion decisions when faced with traffic
congestion. Vaughn et al. [53] developed a system to model sequential route–choice
behavior. Finally Polak and Jones_s [47] simulator was developed to investigate the
impacts of the provision of reliable pre-trip information concerning
potential
expected travel conditions at different times of day and by different modes on the
behavior of travelers to large city centers.

In their evaluation Koutsopoulos et al. [35] discuss the advantages of travel
simulators based on their ability to collect stated preference data, which allows
simulators Bto capture latent preferences^ that determine actual behavior [35]. They
highlight the ability of simulators to control the experiment_s scenario and repeat
the simulations over and over again, making them cost-effective and safe, providing
more freedom and flexibility in defining the alternatives and in comparing
individuals_ behavior.

A more extensive summary on travel simulators is presented by Bonsall [8]. In
his set of selected examples he reviews all the simulators previously discussed.
He outlines the advantages and disadvantages of travel simulators an presents
simulators and the
some design considerations. Based on the previous
evaluation of their results, it can be said that they have proven to be a good
data-collection tool
for modeling behavior and to answer different transport
behavior questions.

2.2.2 CPMs

GeoInformatica (2006) 10: 469–493

CPMs are a different kind of simulation tool developed to emulate the way
people make choices regarding travel. A CPM is a production system that can
provide a more detailed description of an individual choice [18]. A production
system consists of a set of rules in the form of condition–action pairs that determine
how a task is solved. For example, if the task is to choose one alternative from a
choice set, the rules may specify what information to search for under different
circumstances, how to evaluate this information, and how the evaluations are
integrated if needed.

The first attempt at creating a CPM was the TOUR model developed by Kuipers
[36]. This was followed by NAVIGATOR [22], TRAVELLER [39], and Elmer [43].
These CPMs neglected the dependencies between different travel choices and
between travel and activity choices, which led to more sophisticated models being
developed. The list includes STARCHILD [48], SCHEDULER [21], the model
proposed by Smith et al. [50] and Clark and Smith [15], and the model developed by
Payne et al. [46]. Recently developed CPMs include: AMOS [33], PCATS [32],
GISICAS [37], SMASH [17], and SMART [51].

GISICAS is of particular importance to this research. GISICAS is a combination
of a GIS and CPM. The GIS is the spatial data-handling component that provides
geoprocessing capabilities, while the CPM emulates the individual_s decision-
making process in the computer.

CPMs provide insights into individual and household behavior. They are also
examples of how the activity-based approach and production systems can be
combined to build models that better represent human decision-making. Recently
new suggestions have been made to further improve these systems.

2.3 New generation of simulators

A new generation of simulators has been suggested based on new technological
developments and further understanding of what people want and expect of their
travel environment [4]. Peoples_ travel environment is determined by the type and
amount of travel
information they possess. According to how it is used by
individuals this information has the potential of: reducing travel time, reducing
driving anxiety, increasing knowledge of possible travel options, enhancing the
ability to avoid congestion, and reducing the possibility of getting lost [56].

Therefore, what is needed are systems that can increase the efficiency in travel
operations and that can influence travel choices beyond route choice [11]. These
systems should include at least some of the following characteristics:

–
–
–
–
–
–

–

provide travelers with more personalized assistance,
be able to simulate the way people make dynamic decisions,
consider decisions made under particular scenarios, on a day to day basis,
be able to adapt to people_s preferences and attitudes,
be able to analyze a set of alternatives and make the best choice,
learn the drivers_ characteristics and apply this knowledge in the decision-
making process, and
combine all/some of these characteristics resulting in a faster decision-making
process with limited user interaction.

This research proposes the use of GIS to implement a travel simulator under this
new generation. Using a GIS will allow for the inclusion of some of the above
characteristics and introduce advantages such as:

–
–
–
–
–
–

use of a detailed street network,
use of real time,
efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of spatial and aspatial objects,
realistic environment for querying and processing,
handling of spatial information about activity locations, and
use of inherent GIS functions to measure distance, travel times, and familiarities.

The use of GIS will also provide an example on how new spatial information
tools can be used to study travel behavior and how people respond to them. The
following section describes GABRIEL: Gis Activity-Based tRavel sImuLator
developed in this research.

3 Travel simulator design

GABRIEL is a Gis Activity-Based tRavel sImuLator. The use of the activity-based
approach as a framework facilitates the process of capturing the dynamic decision-
making process of drivers using real-time information. This is achieved by
incorporating the characteristics proposed by Kwan [37] outlined in Section 2.2.1.
In GABRIEL_s case the drivers_ experimental scenario represents the daily
commuting trip. The scenario is created by collecting information regarding
individuals_ routes and destinations through a phone survey. It consists of an origin
(Ohio State University—OSU main campus, Columbus, OH), a final destination
(home), and two intermediate activities performed by individuals on their way home
from work (these include activities carried out on a regular basis during the
commute trip, refer to Table 1 for a list). On the way to the first activity, individuals
face an unexpected congestion delay on the main road they are traveling to get to
their destination and are presented with a set of alternatives they can explore to try
to deal with the delay. The familiar commute allows subjects to make more accurate

decisions when faced with congestion. The subjects are recruited on a voluntary
basis by means of a newspaper advertisement and flyers placed on billboards
around the OSU campus.

GABRIEL uses as a development environment ArcView and ArcInfo GIS (both
developed by ESRI), and takes advantage of their characteristics to represent a
realistic setting. It uses the Columbus, OH street network, real activity locations
available in the city, and real origins and destinations provided by each individual
during the pre-trip phone survey. The scenario a subject is presented with varies
according to their pre-planned trip and can be completely changed or modified
using the different alternatives available.

A simple representation of GABRIEL_s different components is presented in
Figure 1. The box labeled Bsubject’s scenario^ includes the inputs (discussed in
Section 4.1) of the simulation process. Once the inputs are in the system, subjects
are presented with three different simulations corresponding to different congestion
time delays (20, 40, and 60 min). In each simulation subjects are asked to try
different alternatives from a set provided to account for the delay and to conclude
by selecting the alternative that best deals with the delay to suit their needs (this is
referred to: as the best or final choice). The simulations are presented in successive
order of increasing congestion delay severity.

GABRIEL is based on a client–server architecture [14]. In the current
implementation, ArcInfo GIS operates as the central processing unit mainly due
to its robustness in terms of processing capabilities and ArcView GIS operates as a
client. The simulator is implemented under a UNIX platform. It consists of a set of
Avenue Scripts (ArcView programming language) and AMLs (ArcInfo Macro
Language). This type of architecture was chosen since it provides a more realistic
representation of a system connected to a central processing unit. A disadvantage is
that as the number of clients working on the server increases, the processing speed
of the server decreases; therefore, affecting the server_s response time (no records
were kept of these response times).

Another factor,

in this implementation,

that affects the response time as
perceived by the subjects during the simulation is the time it takes for the display
to refresh the resulting route maps. To improve on the speed of the display, the
area of interest of the simulation is reduced (the southernmost zip codes in the
city of Columbus are dropped). Display is an intrinsic GIS function and it is
dependent on the complexity of the features being displayed. This could be
labeled as a disadvantage of the GIS. However, GIS still offers a developmental
environment suitable for the simulator implementation. There are three basic
reasons why GIS is chosen as the basic platform: programming language, spatial
capabilities, and data handling. These are attractive characteristics, especially
when using the activity-based approach, which requires making available different
spatial locations.

4 Implementation and data collection process

4.1 Input data

The input data used by GABRIEL are of two types: (1) static and (2) dynamic. The
static information is not modified during the simulation process. It is input into the
system before any experiment takes place and it can be updated or modified only
outside of the simulation process. The dynamic information changes and is updated
every time a new subject is selected to be a part of the experiment.

4.1.1 Static data

The static data consists of a street network and all possible activity locations. The
street network is an ETAK database which includes part of the Columbus, OH
metropolitan area (see Figure 2). The area used is chosen based on two simple
criteria: area of the city where the majority of the subjects who volunteered for the
simulation reside (as a result of test experiments) and speed of processing and
display during the simulation (speed improves based on area size, small area results
in faster processing speed). The network file contains a set of attributes such as
street length, address ranges for the left and right sides of the street, the name of the
street, alternative name of the street, zip code, and functional type (street
classification set by ETAK). An important attribute that is missing from the
database, but can be estimated, is travel time. Travel time is used as an impedance
factor to calculate the shortest path between destinations. This field is added to the
database and calculated based on the length and speed on each road segment. The
speed is matched to the functional type field (freeway, major street, local street,

Figure 2 Area of interest.

478

GeoInformatica (2006) 10: 469–493

etc.) with values ranging from 15 to 60 mph. The formula used to calculate the travel
time is distance (the length of the street link) multiplied by the speed (feet per hour
over that link).

The activity databases are ArcView shape files that contain the locations for all
possible destinations available to subjects. The first step in creating these databases
is to determine what activities should be made available to the subjects. The
selection of the particular categories is made based on previous literature that
studied commute trips and activity trip chaining [2], [13], [30], [31], [52]. The activity
categories used are presented in Table 1. These categories include food,
entertainment, shopping, and personal errands. Once the activities are identified,
particular locations are determined. For this purpose the Columbus, OH, yellow
pages phonebook (1996) is used as base and updated to reflect current changes. The
addresses of all the establishments under the different categories are geocoded using
ArcView GIS. The results of the geocoding process are a set of shape files, one for
each activity category.

The two static inputs constitute the base of the simulation scenario. They remain
the same for each subject in the sample and if needed can be updated and modified.
For example, if instead of Columbus, OH, Phoenix, AZ is used as base for the
experiment, the street network and the activity databases could be obtained and
substituted, allowing the simulator functions to remain the same. A view of the
street network and some of the activity databases are presented in Figure 2.

4.1.2 Dynamic data

The dynamic data consists of the congestion file and the planned trip for each
individual taking part of the simulation experiment. The planned trip is built based
on the pre-trip phone survey data collected during the recruitment process.
Individuals who participated in the experiment were asked to call in. During this
call, their home zip code was verified to see if it was within the area selected for the
experiment. If this was the case, a set of questions were asked to determine the
activities and routes taken during their commute trip. The relevant information
from this survey is presented in Figure 3.

This information contains location data in the form of addresses about the
subjects_ home and where they perform their particular activities. In many cases
subjects do not know the exact addresses of their destinations allowing for cross
streets to be used. Subjects are also asked for estimated travel times between
destinations. These values are used to calculate a total estimated time that can be
compared to the new travel time calculated during the simulation based on the
alternatives tried by the subjects. To set up the scenario in the GIS, the pre-trip data
is geocoded. In Figure 4 an example of a subject_s scenario is presented with the
commute origin as the Ohio State University main campus (which is the same for all
subjects), the home location, and the location of two activities that make part of the
commute trip. On this map an additional symbol can be identified (a stop sign),
which corresponds to the congestion.

The congestion file includes the street intersections where the traffic congestion for
each particular subject is located. The objective of the simulation is to collect data to
study how people deal with congestion on their daily commute trip. Therefore, a
congestion point is randomly set for each subject in the sample. Congestion points are

located in the route subjects take to get to their first activity destination (one
congestion point per subject). These locations are also geocoded and set as inputs in
the GIS (refer to Figure 4). The route taken to get to their first destination is
provided in the pre-trip survey. Given the large percentage of subjects in the sample
who live in the northern part of the city, the main road they take to get to their first
activity is often the same; thereby sharing the same congestion point.

4.2 Simulation scenario

Before subjects begin the simulation, they are given a brief introduction of what the
experiment is about and how to work through technical operations like spatial
queries. Subjects are told to imagine their commute trip back home (late afternoon,
generally from 5:00 to 7:00 P.M.), in which they are carrying out two intermediate
activities. This should be a typical weekday in which a routine is followed with a
given frequency. It does not have to be a particular day of the week, time of year, or
with specific weather condition, just a usual day. Subjects have been previously
made aware of this scenario when the pre-trip information is collected using phone
interviews.

The result is a simulation scenario consisting of a fixed origin (Ohio State
University main campus), two intermediate activities (from the category list in

480

GeoInformatica (2006) 10: 469–493

Figure 4 Planned trip for a subject.

Table 1 chosen by subjects), and a final destination, the individual_s home. Subjects
are told to imagine that given this scenario, congestion occurs on the main road they
travel to get to their first destination and they need to make a decision on what to
do with the situation. They are presented with a set of alternatives that can help
them handle the congestion problem and can try as many or as few alternatives as
they want. Emphasis is placed on the fact that the alternatives they should try
should be the ones they would actually consider if they were to face this type
of situation in the real world. At the end of each simulation session, the subject
has to choose one of the alternatives as being the best choice to deal with the
congestion problem.

The simulation consists of three sessions; each is exactly the same, except for the
severity of the congestion delay. Three time delays are used: 20, 40, and 60 min
(increasingly severe congestion). It takes a minimum of 45 min for the experiment to
be completed. The alternative actions individuals have to choose from remain the
same in each simulation session and can be selected from a group of six. The
alternatives are listed in Table 2.

Under the described scenario, alternative 1 is the simplest of all alternatives.
When selecting this alternative, the subject makes the decision to wait until the
congestion problem is cleared. There is no route calculation, no savings on travel
time, only an incurred delay that corresponds to the waiting time. Alternative 2
provides the subject with an alternative route to avoid the congestion. This route

corresponds to the shortest path between the congestion point and the first activity
destination without using the street where congestion is taking place. The remaining
legs of the trip remain the same.

Alternative 3 introduces more flexibility in modifying and handling the planned
trip than the two previous alternatives. In this alternative the subject has the
opportunity to change the location of his/her two activities. The subject begins by
modifying the first activity location. The new location can be selected in one of three
ways: (1) by distance, (2) by name, or (3) by name and distance. When the subject
specifies selection by distance, the simulator requires a distance in miles to generate
a circular buffer area around the congestion point in order to search for alternative
locations that correspond to the activity being performed. For example, if the
subject is going grocery shopping, the simulator will show all the grocery stores
within the mile radius specified, centered on the congestion. The option of selecting
a new activity by name will allow the subject to give the proper name of, for
example, a grocery store such as BKroger Co.^. The subject then is able to see the
different locations for that particular grocery store, and from the list make the
selection of which one he/she wants to go to.

The third method allows the subject to select a desired location by name within a
specified distance (a combination of the two previous methods). Each of the methods
results in a set of locations meeting the specified request. From the resulting list, the
subject has to make a choice of where he/she wants to go. Once the new location for
the first activity is determined, the subject is given the option to change the second
activity. They can choose from one of three options: (1) a new location for the same
activity, (2) a new activity, or (3) go home. In the first option, subjects choose a
different location for the second activity and follow the same procedure as in the case
of a new location for the first activity. The second option gives the subject a list of
possible activities that he/she can perform. Once the activity is selected the procedure
to select the location is the same as described before. The last option eliminates the
second activity and routes the individual home. Alternative 3 allows the subject to
modify all of his/her planned trip.

In alternative 4 the subject can select from the set of activity categories a new
first activity. For example, if the subject is going grocery shopping, now he/she can
decide to go to the post office or to any other place that is included in the activity
databases. Once the new activity is selected the process of locating the particular
location is the same as in alternative 3. The second activity can also be modified and
the subject can change all his/her planned trip.

In alternative 5 the subject drops the two activities and is routed home. The
simulator determines the shortest route to use from the congestion point home.
Finally, alternative 6 allows the subject to switch the order of the planned activities.
This means that if the individual is going, for example, grocery shopping and then to

482

GeoInformatica (2006) 10: 469–493

the post office, now he/she can go to the post office and then grocery shopping.
However, once the route to the first activity (previously the second) is calculated,
the subject is given the option to change the second activity, following the same
procedure as in alternatives 3 and 4. At the end of each simulation, the subject will
have to choose one of the alternatives tried as being the best choice to deal with the
congestion delay problem.

4.3 Implementation

GABRIEL has two main components: a user interface and a processing unit. The
user interface is mainly composed of message windows and dialog boxes. The
simulator environment is presented in Figure 5. Three different types of windows
appear during the simulation. The first window corresponds to the Map, where the
street network, the initial location (OSU), the final destination (home), the two
intermediate activities (which differ according to the subject), and the congestion
locations are displayed. The first are drawn as a set of lines, the rest as colored
symbols. The resulting route of each alternative selected by the subject is also
displayed on this map. The second type of window, the Message window, appears on
the top left of the screen (refer to Figure 5). This window displays dynamic
information provided to the subject during the simulation. The third window, the
Information window, appears on the bottom left of the screen (refer to Figure 5).
This window presents the subject with the different available alternatives and with
the results of each option.

Figure 5 Simulator environment.

GeoInformatica (2006) 10: 469–493

483

By means of these windows two types of information are provided: descriptive
and prescriptive information. The descriptive information is composed of incident
information and en-route information regarding available choices. The incident
information is provided in the form of congestion point locations. The available
alternatives constitute GABRIEL_s main feature and each one is accompanied by
information associated to the particular choice. For example, each alternative
provides the route resulting from the changes in the activities, the travel times, and
possible savings. Prescriptive information is associated with the textual directions
after a route has been calculated. It supplies a set of detailed guidelines to get to the
destination following a particular route. This kind of information is provided upon
subjects_ request.

Dialog boxes request input from the subjects at particular decision points
during the simulation (refer to Figure 5). They keep the subjects on track on the
flow of the decision-making process during the simulation. Route displaying is also
part of the user interface. Every time a route is calculated it is displayed as a layer
on the active map.

The processing unit has three tasks. The first task is the shortest path calculation,
which is the core of the application. Every time a subject selects an alternative (except
for alternative 1) a route is calculated and displayed. The route calculation is
performed in ArcInfo and the result is transferred to ArcView for display. The second
task is the location of a new activity. This procedure is repeated every time a subject
wants to select a new location to carry out his/her activity. The process consists of
building a selection set that meets the characteristics outlined by the subject through
the different inputs (details are explained in Section 4.2). The third task has to do
with modifying the second activity. Three alternatives are given to the subjects:
select a new location for the same activity, select a new activity, and go home.
The information flow in the program follows a three step process:

input,
processing, and output. In addition to the scenario, which is part of the pre-processing
procedure, input to the simulation consists of the alternative the subject wants to
experiment with. The processing step is composed of the different alternatives.
Alternatives 1, 2, and 5 are very simple, with alternative 1 requiring no processing.
Alternatives 3, 4, and 6 are more complex and require more information from the
subjects. Data collected are written into two output tables, the results and the
satisfaction tables. Once the three congestion scenarios are completed the simulation
experiment is complete.

4.4 Simulator output

During the simulation all the information and decisions made by the subject are
recorded. Two types of output are created: dBase tables and ArcView shape files.
There are three dBase tables. The first table is the results table, which stores the
decision-making process of the subject. It includes information about each one of
the alternatives tried by the subject such as activities, savings, type of search criteria,
search radius, travel times, and locational information. Information in this table is
stored every time a subject makes a decision during the simulation. The second
table, the satisfaction table, records the final choice of the subject in each
simulation. It includes the subjects_ ID, the simulation delay, the alternatives that
the subjects choose as their best choice to deal with congestion, and the alternatives

484

GeoInformatica (2006) 10: 469–493

they reported they would never consider. For each subject there are three records in
this table, each corresponding to one simulation (20-, 40-, and 60-min delay). The
third table is the users table, which stores the identification and name of the subjects
running the simulation.

The second type of outputs are the ArcView shape files, which correspond to
the routes calculated by the simulator for each subject in each alternative. These
routes are calculated in ArcInfo, using the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm,
converted into a shape file, and displayed by ArcView. The impedance used for
the shortest path calculation is travel time. In addition to these outputs a survey
is conducted after the simulation is completed. In this survey there are different
information categories, which include: the subjects_ personal information, activity
plan, familiarity, reasons for the final choices made, and overall evaluation of the
experiment. The parts of the survey that deal with the simulator design and
implementation are presented in Figure 6.

4.5 Advantages of the current implementation

The main advantages of the current implementation are based on its design and the
development environment. The system design is conceived based on the improve-
ments that can be achieved with the use of new technology and theory.

The use of GIS as a development environment provides flexibility in the manipu-
lation of data, of the user interface, and in general of the experimental scenario.
These result in a set of advantages. First, using the actual street network of Columbus,
OH portrays a realistic travel environment. Some of the earlier simulators used
Bmade-up^ networks not associated with a particular area, designed just for exper-

imental purposes. This type of network does not allow subjects to identify themselves
with their surroundings. In these cases, the decision-making process is not as close
to reality as it should be. Second, by setting a different scenario for each subject,
individuals can identify landmarks in the maps and on the main roads they take,
providing for a more realistic environment. By being able to situate themselves in
the network, subjects can make more informed decisions of their new destinations
and locations. Third, an interaction level is introduced by allowing subjects to make
changes in their planned trip at different points during the simulation. This is linked
to the provision of real time information to make decisions on the spot. By pro-
viding information about the savings in time, subjects can select the alternatives
they consider best. Finally GABRIEL records the subjects_ decision-making process.
It saves information regarding the different alternatives tried, new activities selected,
and new locations.

The GIS allows for an efficient representation and handling of spatial data, which
makes available a variety of alternatives for subjects to choose from. This makes
predicting the final choice more complicated, due to the diversity in patterns that
can exist, but helps in investigating scenarios that had not been explored before (in
the past only alternative routes had been modeled). GABRIEL then, moves a step
ahead of the previously reviewed simulators and provides a dataset with valuable
information that can be used for different purposes.

Combining the activity-based approach with the GIS can also help in under-
standing how to implement new ICTs. Carrying out activities is what makes people
take trips. Studying what kind of information, in what form, and by what means it
affects trip choices, will help in determining the characteristics of more appropriate
information-provision tools. For example, using GIS queries and discovering that
subjects can use and take advantage of them with minimal instruction, provides
some insight into people_s ability to acquire quick technological knowledge of tools
that are still beyond their daily reach.

GABRIEL is also a valuable tool for answering ITS questions. During the simu-
lation subjects identify the characteristics of each alternative as they work through
them, which contributes to the credibility of the experiment and consequently of the
data collected. With the data collected questions such as: how is individual behavior
affected when congestion information is provided; who will adopt the technology;
and do people make use of all the information provided; can be answered. A discus-
sion of the data collected is presented in the next section.

5 Data results

This section is not meant to provide a detailed description of the data collected
instead it provides an overview. The discussion includes descriptive statistics of the
sample; a summary of the differences in travel times, the characteristics important to
subjects in the sample, and alternatives chosen; and subjects_ opinion about
GABRIEL_s design and their use of the information provided. Descriptive statistics
obtained from the simulation are summarized in Table 3. Ninety-seven individuals
constitute the original sample; however, after cleaning the data the sample size was
reduced to 83, 52 male and 31 female. The low female count is the result of the
subject recruitment process; in general female subjects were less likely to volunteer.

During the subject recruitment process, anyone affiliated with OSU was a possible
candidate. However, given the monetary incentive ($10) to participate, students
volunteered the most. This explains the high percentage on the young age cohort
and the income levels. It is a highly educated sample, with 98% having completed or
in the process of completing an undergraduate education.

GABRIEL calculates travel times between destinations in the original scenario
and in the new scenarios resulting from each alternative tried by subjects. Travel
times increase in the new alternatives tried when compared to the originals. This
increase is due to the fact that to deal with congestion, based on the alternatives
provided and the information available, subjects can change their destinations and
move away from their original trip route, generating longer trips (i.e., selecting an
activity and a location far from the original destinations). Table 4 shows a summary
of the average travel time increases and the mean travel times for the original trip
and the final trip chosen by the subjects to deal with the congestion.

The importance of other characteristics regarding the activities is collected from
the subjects. A summary of these characteristics is presented in Table 5. Importance
is very subjective; what can be important for one person might not be for another.
These variables are originally measured in a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being most
important and 5 least important. Later they are modified into dummy variables
where 1 corresponds to categories 1, 2, and 3 (important) and 0 to categories 4 and 5
(not important).

A crosstabulation of the choices selected to deal with the congestion by simulation-
delay is presented in Table 6. The alternative selected in 45% of the cases as the best
choice is alternative 2, which corresponds to selecting an alternate route. In previous
studies choosing an alternate route is one of the most commonly proposed and used
adaptation strategies. This result suggests that it is not any different here. However,
55% of the sample selected different alternatives, which shows that many people find
them equally good or better. Alternatives 2 (alternate route) and 3 (new activity
location) are tried most frequently, and as the time delay increases the number of
subjects trying alternative 5 (dropping the activities and going home) does too.

Given the final choices made by subjects, it is important to know what charac-
terized their approach. They are given the following options: Byou tried to find a
reasonably good solution so that you did not have to spend a lot of time and effort to
find out the best among the six alternatives^, Byou tried to find the best solution in
terms of certain criteria^, or used an Bother^ criteria. Fifty-one percent select the final
choice to deal with congestion based on a Breasonably good solution^, and 48% based
on a Bbest solution^ criteria. The remaining 1% chose Ban alternative^ criteria.

Combining the three simulations, between 45 and 50% of the sample are very
satisfied with the choice they made, the remaining 55% are either satisfied, moder-
ately satisfied, or not satisfied at all. Eighty-six percent of the sample thinks the final
choice selected is very close to what they would have done if it was not a simulation.
Three issues can be discussed based on how information is provided to the subjects
(see Figure 6 for specific questions). First, the use of on-screen information in the
decision-making process: the message window and the information window are con-

sidered important by 70% of the sample. Textual descriptions are used with very low
frequency; therefore, the subjects do not perceive them as being of importance in
their decision-making process. Half of the sample makes full use of the map. From the
other half, 6% do not make use of the map at all and the 44% remaining makes use of
the map at an intermediate level (sometimes yes, others no; use is measured on a
ranked scale). Subjects are able to identify road closures, traffic flow direction, stops,
feasible turns, and other characteristics of the street network. Subjects that use on-
screen information either use all the information provided or do not make use of it at
all. Second, the usefulness of the information in the decision-making process: the
information provided by the GIS using the three windows, the map, and the dynamic
display capabilities are considered by 65% of the sample very useful in the decision-
making process. Last, the amount of information provided to the subjects: half of the
sample considers that the amount of information provided is appropriate. The other
half thinks it is either too much or not enough.

Subjects are comfortable with GABRIEL_s interface, which results in a valuable
dataset on subjects_ decision-making process when facing congestion. The most
important advantage of this dataset is the number of alternatives available to choose
from, which have not been explored by simulators in the past.

6 Conclusions

This research has presented GABRIEL: Gis Activity-Based tRavel sImuLator. It is
based on the need to develop a new generation of travel simulators that can better
represent people_s daily behavior, incorporate their preferences, evaluate a set of
alternatives, and give more personalized information to users when faced with traffic
congestion. The review of the literature shows that simulators of this type have not yet
been developed, and therefore the main objective of this research is to present a
simulator design and implementation that moves toward this new generation.

GABRIEL enters this new generation characterizing itself by the use of a city
network, the possible scenarios, the information provided to subjects, the routes
available, and the theoretical approach. The network used is a digital representation
of the actual Columbus, Ohio, street network within a GIS environment. This allows
the subjects to locate themselves within their surroundings and select familiar routes
bringing into the experiment their ability to make use of their cognitive maps. Given
that the experimental scenarios during the simulation are customized for each subject,
they are able to identify major highways and in many cases arterial roads frequently
traveled, as well as other characteristics of the network system. A scenario is prepared
for each individual, closely resembling what he or she does in a typical commuting
day. The information provided during the simulation is dynamic; it varies according to
subjects_ scenario and alternatives tried. Routes are the result of an interactive
process where alternatives are evaluated by subjects allowing for the original trip to
be modified. Routes are not final until a decision is made to deal with the congestion
experienced in their original route.

The activity-based approach is the theoretical framework for GABRIEL_s design.
Although this approach introduces additional complexity, the use of GIS allows for
greater flexibility in handling the data and user alternatives in the experiment. It also
provides a realistic representation of the network and travel environment, inherent
spatial capability as well as flexibility in handling spatial data, storage and mani-

489

pulation of information, and a programming language. Subjects are given control of
their simulation and are permitted to select which activities they want to perform,
change or drop. Using individual activities as the unit of analysis allows for a more
sophisticated design in terms of the possible alternatives for dealing with conges-
tion and results in a more realistic experimental environment. Alternatives such as
changing the activity category and location are available, but would not be if the
experiment consisted of fixed locations that are not known to the subjects. The
activity-based approach implementation under a GIS platform results in the creation
of a data collection tool that records the decision-making process of how subjects deal
with congestion. By recording the individual decision-making process, a better
understanding of this process and the variables that influence congestion decisions
and the final choices made can be achieved (see [12] for an example).

GABRIEL is useful in understanding how people make use of technology to make
decisions. People are not afraid of new technology as they were in the past. During the
experiment there were subjects with no computer knowledge; however, with the basic
instruction provided, they were able to successfully complete it. With younger gener-
ations, technology is not an issue given that they have been exposed to it earlier on.
This suggests that uses of technology in travel behavior scenarios are quickly under-
stood, which can help in identifying new methods and types of information to be
provided, for example, based on age group, furthering ATIS research.

The impacts of implementing systems, such as the one proposed, in a real envi-
ronment are two fold. First, there are benefits for users and non-users of the system,
and second, there are benefits for the transportation system and policy makers. The
users will benefit from the information provided to modify their planned routes to
suit their needs, while the non-users will also benefit from the improved trans-
portation conditions in the system resulting from those changes. The transportation
system will therefore improve as a whole, in terms of the number and location of
congested links. The data collected by GABRIEL, which is unique since it contains
recorded reactions to congestion, can be used as the basis to understand travel be-
havior, the decision-making process, and how people learn and process information.
By doing so it can provide some insight into what changes can be introduced in the
transport system to deal with congestion, and how people_s behavior can be in-
fluenced and modified by introducing new policies. In particular, the results show that
people do explore other alternatives besides route choice. They change their activi-
ties, their locations, and at times drop their complete planned trip.

Improvements can be introduced in the simulator design, especially in the method
used to provide information to the users and in the user interface. Instead of textual
descriptions, information could be provided in the form of auditory suggestions. This
would potentially generate fewer distractions from the driving task. The user interface
could be improved with additional landmark locations and a faster display speed. It
could also be set to work via the Internet to facilitate subject recruitment and exper-
iment administration. GABRIEL could be adapted to not only collect quantitative
information about individuals_ choices but also qualitative data in the form of voice
recordings about subjects_ feelings, perceptions, desires, and frustrations when ar-
riving at decision points in the simulation process.

GABRIEL can be easily tailored to collect data from a different city. The inputs
required would be: the new city_s street network and the activity databases. Each
subject_s scenario that would be part of the sample should be created in the GIS as
well as the corresponding congestion points_ file. GABRIEL can be used as a data

490

GeoInformatica (2006) 10: 469–493

collection tool to answer various spatial questions, not only those associated with
congestion problems. For example, it can be used to identify road construction
effects in behavior. It could also be used to try to understand spatial choices made
by individuals in terms of their locations and to determine measures of accessibility.
GABRIEL is an adaptable data collection tool that can be exploited to study a
variety of individual spatial choices.

Irene Casas is an Assistant Professor in the Geography Department at the University at Buffalo,
SUNY. Her interests lie in the areas of transportation, intelligent systems and models, and GIS.
Topics include routing, network analysis, location analysis, and travel behavior. Her current work
combines the use of GIS as a development environment, with tools and models from artificial
intelligence to understand travel behavior. She has also been working on the area of sustainable
transport, transport exclusion, disadvantaged groups, and the integration of information and
communication technologies (ICT) by marginalized communities.

Abstract. Rothermel’s model is the most widely used (cid:142) re behaviour model in
wildland (cid:142) re research and management. It is a complex model that considers 17
input variables describing fuel type, fuel moisture, terrain and wind. Uncertainties
in the input variables can have a substantial impact on the resulting errors and
have to be considered, especially when the results are used in spatial decision
making. In this paper it is shown that the analysis of uncertainty propagation
can be carried out with the Taylor series method. This method is computationally
cheaper than Monte Carlo and oŒers easy-to-use, preliminary sensitivity
estimations.

Introduction
Owing to changing rural land use practices, land abundance on the one side and
a growing urban-wildland interface on the other side, wildland (cid:142) res increasingly
threaten buildings, infrastructure and other valuables (Alexandrian 1996). The main
goal of wildland (cid:142) re management is to reduce the negative impacts of (cid:142) re to society
under the constraint of limited resources. One important step to achieve this is a
risk analysis (BUWAL 1999). The goal of a risk analysis is to describe the probabil-
ities and outcomes of a certain spectrum of events. In the case of the natural hazard
‘wildland (cid:142) re’, Bachmann and Allgo¨ wer (1998) propose a framework for the quantita-
tive spatial analysis of wildland (cid:142) re risk that allows the generation of individual and
collective risk maps. An important factor to be analysed is the (cid:142) re behaviour as
expressed in spread rate and direction.

A complete risk analysis requires the evaluation of various scenarios and situ-
ations, each involving several steps of modelling and data acquisition. The results
being statistically analysed and summarized are then ready for assessment considering
the societal context (Pyne et al. 1996, Miller et al. 1999). It is important that the
decision makers not only know the results of the risk analysis but that they are also
aware of inherent uncertainties and errors resulting from it.

Within the wildland (cid:142) re research community great eŒort is dedicated to the
investigation and improvement of (cid:142) re behaviour modelling and its bene(cid:142) t for opera-
tional use. In this context, all relevant input variables (fuels, climatic conditions,
topography and wind) require special consideration. However, sensitivity analysis
and uncertainty propagation for the various (cid:142) re behaviour models and their input

variables are rarely performed, although Salvador et al. (2001) do present an example.
The main goal of this paper is to evaluate which uncertainty propagation methodo-
logy is the most appropriate for (cid:142) re behaviour modelling in the context of risk
analysis. Additionally, we try to determine the contribution of uncertainties in input
variables to the errors of the most important predictions of (cid:142) re behaviour modelling:
rate of (cid:142) re spread, spread direction and eŒective wind speed.

2. Fire behaviour modelling
2.1. Rothermel’s model

In 1972, Rothermel from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
laid the basis for the most popular and still widely used (cid:142) re behaviour model. In
the wildland (cid:142) re research and management community, the model
is a ‘quasi’
standard. Rothermel’s (cid:142) re spread model (Rothermel 1972, Albini 1976) allows the
calculation of the behaviour of a surface (cid:142) re ((cid:142) res that mainly aŒect ground vegeta-
tion and that pass rapidly through a stand). It assumes that all input variables are
homogeneous for a su(cid:141) ciently small area and time period. The main outputs of the
model are the rate of (cid:142) re spread (ros [m sÕ 1 ]), the direction of maximum spread
(sdr [ß ]) and eŒective wind speed (efw [m sÕ
1 ]). Furthermore, (cid:142) re line intensity, heat
release per area and (cid:143) ame length can be derived. The latter group of outputs is of
great interest for the analysis of impacts due to wildland (cid:142) res. Rothermel’s model
was developed from a theoretical base; i.e. it represents the ratio between the heat
(cid:143) ux received from a source and the heat required for ignition by the potential fuel.
The corresponding basic equations have been solved not analytically but experiment-
ally. Given a horizontal plane and assuming no wind and homogenous fuels, a (cid:142) re
would spread evenly in any direction with exactly the same rate of spread. The shape
of a (cid:142) re front in such an idealistic situation would be a circle. Rothermel’s model
considers the in(cid:143) uence of the wind and of the terrain by an addition of weighted
wind and terrain vectors. The wind vector is given by the wind direction and the
wind speed at mid-(cid:143) ame height. Slope (steepest gradient) and aspect (exposition or
direction of steepest gradient ) give the terrain vector. The resulting vector indicates
the direction of maximum spread and its length the relative in(cid:143) uence on the rate of
spread. The eŒective wind speed denotes the wind speed along the direction of
maximum spread. In the presence of slope and wind the shape of a (cid:142) re front is no
longer a circle but is best estimated by a double-ellipse which is de(cid:142) ned by the rate
of spread, spread direction and eŒective wind speed (Anderson 1982).

2.2. Input variables

Rothermel’s model requires numerous input variables, which can be divided into

four groups: fuel type, fuel moisture, topography and wind.

The mathematical description of the structure and texture of a fuel type (vegeta-
tion type prone to burn) is a fuel model. The fuel model that is used with Rothermel’s
model consists of several variables that describe the properties of the particles (fuel
loading and surface-to-volum e ratio). Additional variables characterize the fuel bed
as a whole (Rothermel 1972, Burgan and Rothermel 1984). The set of variables
needed to de(cid:142) ne a fuel type is listed (showing variable names and indicating addition-
ally which ones are measured or held constant) in table 1. The acquisition of fuel
data in the (cid:142) eld by measuring all the required variables is very laborious and time
consuming, especially if sophisticated sampling point distribution methods are
applied (Anderson 1982, Brown et al. 1982, Allgo¨ wer et al. 1998). For large areas

and su(cid:141) ciently homogeneous fuels it is common to apply secondary data like
vegetation maps (derived from aerial- or space-borne data) and to assign fuel models
using photo guides (Fischer 1982).

Besides this rather static description of the fuel, the fuel moisture exhibits a more
dynamic behaviour. For each particle class the moisture content is described as the
percentage of water content compared with oven dry weight (variable names: md1 ,
md2 , md3 , mlh, and mlw; subscripts according to the schema of table 1). The amount
of water in dead fuel particles ranges 1–2 % in very dry conditions up to 30–35 %.
Live fuel moisture content is generally between 50% and 300 % (Pyne et al. 1996 ).
As already mentioned, the terrain is introduced (independently of the fuel) by
slope [ß ] (slp) and aspect [ß ] (asp), and wind is described as wind speed [m sÕ 1 ]
(wsp) and wind direction at mid-(cid:143) ame height (wdr).

3. Uncertainty propagation

The main goal of this study is to evaluate uncertainty propagation methods that
can be applied for wildland (cid:142) re risk analysis. Within the proposed risk analysis
framework we are primarily interested in the uncertainties of the intermediate model-
ling steps and results; that is, the results of (cid:142) re behaviour modelling are used for
subsequent (cid:142) re spread simulations. To study the propagation of uncertainties it is
su(cid:141) cient to determine them ‘locally’. In this context, ‘locally’ denotes the estimation
of the impact of variations of input variables with respect to any (cid:142) xed (nominal)
input values. By comparison, global methods can be used to determine uncertainty
and sensitivity measures over the whole range of input values (Saltelli et al. 2000 ).

3.1. Monte Carlo simulation versus T aylor series

Rothermel’s (cid:142) re behaviour model consists of about 80 equations. If used to its
full extent, it requires 17 input variables: eight describing the fuel type, (cid:142) ve for fuel
moisture, two for wind and terrain each. Most of the input variables are continuously
distributed in space—and many of them are correlated. At (cid:142) rst, the complexity of
the Rothermel’s model suggests the application of Monte Carlo simulations (Johnson
1987) as this does not require any conditions for the model itself but uses it as a
black box. Any desired level of accuracy of the method can be achieved by increasing

118

A. Bachmann and B. Allgo¨wer

the number of runs. Thus, it could be used to generate the ‘ground truth’ against
which other methods are veri(cid:142) ed. Yet, the problem with Monte Carlo simulations
is the generation of adequate random input data set realizations that consider the
joint distribution of all input variables. In the case of (cid:142) re behaviour modelling,
spatial and multivariate correlations of 17 input variables have to be considered.
There are several methods that allow the consideration of correlated input variables
(conditional simulation) , e.g. joint sequential Gaussian simulation. But their compu-
tational load is usually very demanding. This is combined with the fact that with
each change in the input variables the whole Monte Carlo simulation has to be
rerun. We decided to apply the analytical method of (cid:142) rst order Taylor Series
(Heuvelink 1998). At a (cid:142) rst glance, the derivation of around 80 equations looks
inhibiting, but the great advantage of this method is that the implementation work
has to be done once and can then be applied to any input data set without great
eŒort. By applying a (cid:142) rst-order Taylor series, an approximation error is introduced
that can be large if the variation of the input uncertainty is large compared with the
‘smoothness’ of the function. The preconditions for the application of the Gaussian
error propagation are (a) that the Rothermel’s model is continuously diŒerentiable,
and (b) that all variables have errors that follow a Gaussian distribution with an
expected value of zero.

Except for two equations that are not continuous functions over the whole range
of values, Rothermel’s model is continuously diŒerentiable with respect to all input
variables. The (cid:142) rst exception is the calculation of a moisture damping coe(cid:141) cient
that uses the ratio between fuel moisture and moisture of extinction. If the fuel
moisture content is higher than the moisture of extinction, the combustion processes
cannot take place and the rate of spread is zero. In the context of wildland (cid:142) re risk
analysis, this limitation is not a problem as (cid:142) res that burn under such conditions
are usually not of great interest: they burn only slowly and with very low intensities
which means that they can easily be suppressed and the chances for developing into
a (cid:142) re storm are very limited.

The second exception is a function that implements an upper limit for wind
speed. At higher wind speeds it is very probable that a (cid:142) re evolves into a crown (cid:142) re
and that spotting occurs (i.e. burning or hot particles are blown over hundreds of
metres which can start new (cid:142) res when falling into combustible vegetation) . This is
clearly a situation that violates the limitations for the application of Rothermel’s
model which was designed for surface (cid:142) res.

During all computations these two limitations have been tested and no case was

found where either fuel moisture or wind speed were critical.

3.2. Partial derivatives of ros, sdr and efw

Seventeen derivations of rate of spread had to be derived for the variables w0d1 ,
w0d2 , w0d3 , w0lh, w0lw, svd1 , md1 , md2 , md3 , mlh, mlw, d, mx, wsp, wdr, asp and slp. The
variance of the rate of spread s2 can then be approximated by (Heuvelink 1998).

is a system of around 80 equations, it is beyond the scope of this paper to reproduce
all relevant equations. The complete collection of formulae can be obtained from
the authors (http://www.geo.unizh.ch/gis/research/edmg/(cid:142) re/unc.html ).

4. Study case
4.1. T est site Malcantone

A small area in the Malcantone valley in Southern Switzerland was chosen as
test site (see (cid:142) gure 1). The Malcantone is representative of regions with winter
wildland (cid:142) res. The main (cid:142) re season is during March and April, before the onset of
vegetation growth and when the meteorological conditions are favourable for drying
the dead leaves from the preceding autumn (Conedera et al. 1996 ).

4.2. Fuel types

The fuel types were taken from Harvey (1996) who carried out a (cid:142) eld study
during the (cid:142) re season in late winter 1995. In order to optimize the number of
sampling points, four strata were de(cid:142) ned based on a forest vegetation map. For each
stratum a regular raster with random origin was laid such that the number of
sampling points was equal for all of the strata. At every point the fuel was collected
and analysed according to the methodology of Brown et al. (1982). Thorough cluster
and discriminant analysis provided three fuel types based on the averaging of the
values of all sample points of each stratum. Chestnut (Castanea sativa) is the most
frequent fuel model covering an area of 3.57 km2 (57 %) and is very typical for the
lower parts of the Malcantone and the southern Alps in general. Frequently burned
areas are characterized by various fern (Polypodium) and broom species (Genista)—
vegetation types that are prone to (cid:142) res. This fuel type covers about 5 % of the

Topography 1995.

120

forested areas. The third fuel type with coniferous species covers the smallest area
but has the biggest variation in its input variables.

The means and standard deviations of the sampled fuel properties are shown in
table 2 for each fuel type. Neither of them had dead fuel particles of the size class
2.5–7.6 cm. The standard deviation within each fuel type class is used as an estimate
of the uncertainty. The rest of the variables (table 3) were held constant for all of
the fuel types according to Andrews (1986).

One advantag e of analytical error propagation method is that correlations
between the variables can be explicitly integrated. Thus, the correlation coe(cid:141) cients
between all the variables in table 2 have been calculated for each fuel type based on
the original sampling data as shown in table 4.

4.3. Fuel moisture

The base moisture content was assumed to be 8 % and was corrected for height
and aspect according to the Fire Behaviour Field Reference Guide (NWCG 1992).
We assumed the standard deviation to be 0.8 %. These values were assigned to all
three classes of dead fuel particles. For the living fuel particles, values were taken
(NWCG 1992,
from the literature (150 % mean and 15 % standard deviation)
Ru¨ egsegger 1996).

4.4. T errain and wind

Slope and aspect were derived from a digital terrain model (cell size: 25 m) of the
Swiss Federal O(cid:141) ce of Topography (SFOT). The error in height (sz ) lays between
3 and 5 m (SFOT 2000). The slope angle was calculated in ARC/INFO which uses
the method of Horn (1981). The standard deviation of the slope is given as
szÓ 3/(4 cellsize). Aspect (clockwise angle from north) was also calculated in ARC/
INFO. The standard deviation could be derived in similar ways as shown for slope,
but we assumed s 5 10ß
for all cells as a study of Wise (1998) showed only weak
spatial variation. Correlations have been calculated between slope and aspect for
each fuel type area separately (table 5).

Owing to the lack of reliable data, wind speed and direction were set to constant
values for the whole area of interest. The authors are well aware of the fact that this
would not be su(cid:141) cient for realistic wildland (cid:142) re behaviour analysis. Since the main
interest of this study lays on the application of uncertainty propagation and not on
the expectation values, it is assumed acceptable. Wind speed was assigned an expecta-
tion value of 2.3 m sÕ
(wind coming
from the north, s 5 45ß ). However, these values are not completely arbitrary but are
characteristic for the main (cid:142) re season in the study area; they correspond to the mean
values for March and April (Ru¨ egsegger 1996).

4.5. Procedure

The test site (2.5 km3 2.5 km) was chosen so that all three fuel types are repres-
ented in order to have a wider variety of input values. However, not the whole area
is covered with fuel, so in the end 6324 cells contributed to the study. All data were
rasterized to a cell size of 25 m. In a (cid:142) rst step ros, sdr and efw were calculated for
all cells based on the local input variable values. Then, all partial derivatives for ros,
sdr and efw were calculated for all cells and (cid:142) nally summed up according to equation
(1) to obtain the variance. Finally, the partial derivatives together with the standard
errors of the input variables were analysed statistically in order to (cid:142) nd the most
important error contributors. It is noteworthy that the performed local sensitivity
analyses are preliminary as the linearization due to the Taylor method is likely to
fail if the model is nonlinear and the uncertainties of the input values are large. For
a deeper analysis of sensitivities global methods should be used (Tura´ ny and
Rabitz 2000).

5. Results

When looking at the results, the range of error values is striking. However, the
scope of this paper is not to explain how and why the results from (cid:142) re behaviour
modelling may vary to the extent it was observed during this study. The results
rather show that this is a very critical point, and that in (cid:142) re behaviour modelling
much more emphasis should be put on the assessment of input data and results.

5.1. Rate of (cid:142) re spread

In (cid:142) gure 2(a), the three fuel types can be distinguished very clearly based on the
diŒerent rates of spread. The fuel type on the burned areas produces the highest rate
1, or ca 860 m hÕ 1 , which is not really fast.
of spread with an average of 0.241 m sÕ
The remaining, within fuel type variation, re(cid:143) ects mainly the in(cid:143) uence of the terrain.
This is due to the fact that slope, aspect and fuel moisture are the only remaining
input parameters besides the fuel types that are not constant in the area of interest.
The spatial pattern of the coe(cid:141) cients of variation ((cid:142) gure 2(b)) shows only some
in(cid:143) uence of fuel characteristics. While the coniferous stands have quite uniformly
high values, the burned areas and chestnut types exhibit patterns that do not
diŒer greatly.

In table 6, for each fuel model, the mean value, standard deviation (s) and the
coe(cid:141) cient of variation (cv) are listed. It is important to note that s and cv denote
the averages of all individual, estimated si, resp. cvi (i 5 1..number of cells) within
each fuel type. They do not represent the standard deviation, resp. coe(cid:141) cient of
variation, of the individual rosi. Generally, the standard errors for the rate of spread
are very high, which is mainly a result of the great uncertainties in the input values.
This is especially true for the coniferous stands with, nearly exclusively, the highest
input uncertainties in the fuel variables. Generally, only very few variables contribute
to a signi(cid:142) cant part of the error. The main contributors are fuel bed depth d, wind
speed wsp and the surface-to-volum e ratio of the (cid:142) nest dead fuel particles svd1

.

5.2. Fire spread direction

The direction of maximum (cid:142) re spread is basically a function of wind and terrain.
As the the wind is held constant, the spatial pattern in (cid:142) gure 2(c) re(cid:143) ects again
primarily the terrain. For better interpretability, the spread direction is visualized as
absolute deviation from the south (direction where the wind is blowing to, white 5

small, black 5 high deviation) . The standard deviation ((cid:142) gure 2(d )) shows also some
in(cid:143) uence of the terrain: the errors are especially great on the south facing, steep
slopes. The most sensitive input parameters are for all three fuel types wind direction
followed by wind speed (see table 7).

5.3. EVective wind speed

EŒective wind speed denotes the relative contribution of wind speed to the rate
of spread. This leads to the low values on steep, south-facing slopes ((cid:142) gure 2(e)). The

124

standard error ((cid:142) gure 2( f )) seems to be higher where the eŒective wind speed is
smaller (white values), which is demonstrated by a correlation coe(cid:141) cient of Õ 0.97.
As listed in table 8 the main contributor of the estimated error is the uncertainty of
the wind speed.

6. Conclusions

The application of (cid:142) rst-order Taylor series for uncertainty propagation is very
helpful for analysing the contributions of the input variables’ uncertainties. The
experiences gained in the test case are promising. The analysis of uncertainties for
such a complex model like the Rothermel’s model will help to gain more insight
into the environmental process wildland (cid:142) re. However, further investigations have
to be carried out to verify that the approximation errors of the Taylor series approach
are negligible. In the case of local uncertainties this could be done by comparing
them to the results of a Monte-Carlo-Simulation . For the veri(cid:142) cation of the sensitiv-
ities global methods could be applied (Sobol’ 1993, Saltelli et al. 2000 ).

In the chosen test case, the most important result is that the ‘errors’ that are
largely due to a natural variation lead to a big error in the results. Another result
is that usually only a few input variables make up for the greatest part of the error.
Although, the results cannot be extrapolated, we liked to refer to the results of a
study presented by Salvador et al. (in press). They carried out a global sensitivity
analysis for the same Rothermel model in shrub vegetation of North-eastern Spain
and found that all variables had some noticeable eŒect.

The predominant in(cid:143) uence of few variables has been clearly demonstrated in the
case of direction of maximum (cid:142) re spread (sdr) and eŒective wind speed (efw) where
wsp and wdr are the key uncertainty contributors. It is not likely that the input
uncertainties of a wind (cid:142) eld will get smaller in future as the uncertainties are an
inherent property of it. Thus, ways have to be found to integrate this natural variation
adequately into (cid:142) re behaviour modelling and analysis.

In the case of rate of spread, it can be shown that the big errors (cv>1 ) stem
from the high input uncertainties. The three fuel types have been compared with the
13 standard NFFL fuel types (Anderson 1982). These fuel types cover the most
widely found fuel situations in the USA. They have been constructed for operational
use during (cid:142) re-(cid:142) ghting activities when rapid assessment of the fuel situation is
needed. In order to compare the various fuel types a no-wind and no-slope situation
is assumed. The uncertainties of the all input variables are equal to 10 % of the
variables values. Table 9 shows the relative contribution of w0d1 , svd1 and d which
are found, with some exceptions, to be the most important contributors to the error
of rate of spread.

A question that remains open is that of the causes and extent of uncertainties
in the fuel input variables. From the limited experience (unfortunatel y literature on
this topic is very scarce) of the authors, we believe that fuel is a highly variable

phenomenon and that coe(cid:141) cients of variation of 10 % in many cases are rather
optimistic. To overcome this, more research activities that focus on the analysis and
description of the spatial variability of fuel parameters are needed. This information
could then be used to produce more ‘realistic’ input data sets using stochastic
simulation (Ripley 1987). It is interesting to note that stochastic modelling techniques
are already being used for (cid:142) re spread simulation. Catchpole et al. (1989) used
Markov chains, cellular automata are applied by Wolfram (1984), Gonc¸alves and
Diogo (1994), Clarke and Olsen (1996). In all studies input variables are considered
in a completely deterministic way while the (cid:142) re spread process is simulated as a
stochastic process. It would be interesting to compare this with the results of the
combinations ‘stochastic input data—deterministic spread simulation’ and ‘stochastic
input data—stochastic spread simulation’.

For the application of Rothermel’s model in the context of wildland (cid:142) re risk
analysis, the results show that it was de(cid:142) nitely worth analysing uncertainty propaga-
tion. The considerable errors in the test case cannot be neglected and have to be
further analysed. In any case, they should not be used as a pretext for not applying
Rothermel’s model. On the contrary, they represent additional information about
the variation of wildland (cid:142) re behaviour and can be used for improving decisions in
the context of wildland (cid:142) re risk analysis.

Generally, we would like to revoke the suggestion that the Rothermel model is
a semi-empirical model with all its limitations that are inherent in such models.
Speci(cid:142) cally, the parameterization of the model is only feasible by reducing and
concentrating on some aspects of the real world process. Moreover, additional
research has to be carried out on how to communicate the uncertainties to the
respective research and user communities.

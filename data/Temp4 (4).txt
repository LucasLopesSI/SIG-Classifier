Abstract
Certain complex processes are most effectively modeled not on the macro-scale, but
from the bottom-up, by simulating the decisions of individual entities, or agents.
This  study  uses  an  agent-based  modeling  (ABM)  approach  to  simulate  residential
dynamics in an area of Boston that has increasingly experienced gentrification in the
past decades. The model is instantiated using basic empirical data and uses simple
decision-making  rules,  differentiated  into  four  classes,  to  simulate  the  process  of
residential dynamics. The model employs the consumption explanation of the cause
of  gentrification,  which  emphasizes  the  choices  of  individuals  drawn  to  urban
amenities,  while  testing  the  production  explanation,  which  suggests  that  major
investments  from  the  public  and  private  sphere  attract  and  explain  gentrification.
Verification shows that the processes in the model work according to its construction,
simulates complexity and emergent phenomena, and may be a valuable explanatory
tool for understanding and learning about some processes underlying gentrification.

1 Introduction

In many cities with strong creative and technological industries the presence of mobile
young  professionals  and  entrepreneurs  drives  up  the  real  estate  market,  resulting  in  a
phenomenon  termed  “gentrification”.  Although  this  process  is  not  new  and  has  been

studied by urban geographers and planners since the 1970s (e.g. Smith 1979, Clay 1979,
Lang  1982,  Hamnett  1991)  the  return  of  young,  wealthy  professionals  to  the  city and
reinvestment  in  older  urban  cores  has  received  renewed  attention  recently.  In  particular,
Florida  (2005)  suggests  that  cities  that  do  well  in  attracting  skilled  workers  in  the
creative and technological industries (the so-called “creative class”) will compete successfully
in  the  globalizing  economy  (cf.  Smith  2002).  However,  because  this  process  also
increases rents and home values in previously working-class city-center neighbourhoods,
it displaces the non-professional class and elderly from these areas (Sassen 2001). Boston,
with its thriving computer and biotechnology industries is an example of a global entre-
preneurial city that has also experienced extensive gentrification in the last 20 years.

Gentrification  is,  however,  a  complex  process,  and  it  is  often  difficult  to  predict
when and where this process will occur. Modeling complexity is best accomplished by
“describing a system from the perspective of constituent units” (Bonabeau 2002, p. 7280),
and  by  using  a  bottom-up  approach  (O’Sullivan  2002,  Torrens  and  Nara  2007).  The
mechanisms of the process of gentrification are not explicit, and like with other complex
processes the pattern “emerges” as a result of interactions of the underlying components
and is different from the action of the individual components (Gilbert 2000). Portugali
(2000), for instance, describes the “self-organizing” tendency of large groups of people
in the city. Benenson et al.’s (2001) model describes how people order themselves within
the city based on cultural, religious, or ethnic attributes in an ethnically  segregated  area
of Tel Aviv. Models such as these emphasize interacting individual components that represent
a  bottom-up  approach  and  fall  under  the  general  category  of  Agent-Based  Models
(ABMs), or more correctly Artificial Life Geospatial Agents (Sengupta and Sieber 2007).

ABMs  mimic  the  perceived  or  measured  behavioural  response  of  an  individual  to
an external stimuli using one of the many available computational models of boundedly
rational  decision-making  behaviour  as  impacted  by  social  networks  (Sengupta  and
Sieber  2007),  and can be used to represent individual people, businesses, or organizations
that act (e.g. change location or farming practices) on certain rules and constraints. Such
agents receive information about their local and global surroundings and use that infor-
mation differently to make decisions about whether or not to move, where to move, and
how to behave. Each agent “builds up its own representation of space and by acting, the
agent transforms the space for others” (Benenson 1998). Interactions between agents and
the  landscape  are  central  to  this  type  of  modeling.  Thus,  ABMs  describe  the  complex
interactions  between  entities  and  their  environment  inherent  in  natural  processes  better
than other spatial modeling techniques (O’Sullivan 2008), and are therefore able to
effectively model urban dynamics as a precursor to gentrification.

Here, we use ABMs to simulate the process of urban residential dynamics and land rent
change in a gentrifying area, using a case study of several inner-city Boston, Massachusetts
neighborhoods (Figure 1) to identify possible patterns of gentrification. The model uses
four classes of agents (“professionals”, “college students”, “non-professionals”, and “elderly”),
and a set of simple decision rules, to predict changes in land values (i.e. assessed value
of  properties  standardized  by  area)  from  2003  to  2007.  These  classes  were  selected
because they fit the demographic profile of the area and because they represent groups
typically  described  in  gentrification  scenarios.  The  decision  rules  governing  behav-
iours  for  each  of  these  four  classes  of  agents  were  obtained  from  a  literature  survey.
Ethnicity was not considered in the model, but as will be discussed in the conclusions,
does not seem to significantly affect the outcome in the area modeled. Further, investments
in the area are observed to show no significant correlation with increases in land rents.

2 Model Design

The Recursive Porous Agent Simulation Toolkit (RePAST) is used to build and run this
simulation (see http://repast.sourceforge.net for additional details). Within RePAST, the
model uses a raster surface with information on each location’s land rent and proximity to
certain amenities to inform the decisions and movements of the four classes of agents who
navigate the landscape using simple decision rules, which are based on the social class and
economic ability of the agent. Agent movement is also influenced in some cases by memory
of favorite locations, and for all agents by communication between friends of similar class.
A  raster  surface  representing  land  rents  (i.e.  assessed  value  of  properties  in  the
Fenway/Kenmore and Roxbury neighborhoods, standardized to a “per square feet” value)
in 2003 for the simulated region (Figure 1) was developed using Voronoi tesellation from
a point file containing assessed building and land values received from the City of Boston
Assessing Department. To this surface were added codes that represented distance from

desirable  amenities  (e.g.  restaurants,  pubs,  stores  and  clubs),  a  university  campus  (i.e.
Northeastern University), and commercial districts. This land rent surface was subsequently
used by the agents within the RePAST simulation interface to guide their residential choices.
The  design  of  the  spatial  information  used  in  the  simulation  (i.e.  the  raster  layer
described  above)  was  influenced  in  part  by  the  nature  of  the  agents’  decision-making
rules.  Myers  and  Gearin  (2001)  show  evidence  that  the  general  trend  in  the  market,
especially amongst wealthier populations is that there is an increased demand for dwellings
in  higher  density  areas  and  for  homes  that  are  closer  to  work  and  study  locations.
In  addition,  Ley’s  study  (1986)  showed  evidence  that  a  density  of  restaurants  and  art
galleries  shows  a  strong  correlation  with  gentrification,  establishing  a  foundation  for
broader  arguments  made  by  Florida  (2002)  and  Clark  (2004)  that  the  growth  of  old,
dense  cities  has  been  significantly  driven  by  the  preferences  of  young  professionals  for
diversity  and  proximity  to  amenity-heavy  locales.  The  evidence  from  all  four  studies
mentioned above necessitates a decision-rule for professional agents that describe their
preference  to  locate  near  dense  commercial  areas.  In  addition,  the  Myers  and  Gearin
(2001)  study  confirms  the  contribution  of  an  already  logical  decision-rule  assigned  for
college students, i.e. they prefer to live close to the campus (which is their place of “work”).
Agent classes are derived from Boston Housing Authority (2007) demographic data for
the area and are divided as such: college student, professional, non-professional and elderly,
and are assigned decision-rules accordingly. The number of non-professional and elderly
agents  in  the  simulation  are  static  (reflecting  the  demographics  of  this  area),  whereas
approximately 300 college students enter the simulation each year (presumably to attend
Northeastern University). Since student life is transitory, approximately one in eight students
migrate out of this class each year. Further, it is estimated that approximately 90% of
college  students  join  the  professional  workforce  (Chapman  and  Gray  1999).  A  similar
number of students therefore become “professional” agents each year. Similarly, because
there has been an increase in the number of college graduates who receive non-college wages
in recent years (Gottshalk and Hansen 1998, Chapman and Gray 1999), a certain percentage
(10%) of college students also migrate into the non-professional class upon graduation.
These transitions are a major part of the model’s demographic dynamics, and are thought
to contribute significantly to the process of gentrification (Smith 2005, Smith and Holt 2007).
Locational  decisions  of  the  various  classes  of  agents  are  based  on  several  factors:
(1)  the  location  is  unoccupied  by  another  agent;  (2)  that  the  location  is  close  either  to
the  college  campus  (for  college  students)  or  a  commercial  district  (for  professional
agents); (3) the location’s affordability; (4) the location has at least one neighbor of the
same  class;  (5)  agents  are  attracted  to  areas  recommended  by  friends;  and  (6)  some
agents are attracted to areas they found amenable previously in the simulation. Preference
for neighbor characteristics (factor 4) is based on a status/class rather than racial distinction,
a  technique  used  in  other  recent  models  on  urban  residential  dynamics  (Bernard  and
Willer 2007). Besides the factors of proximity to amenities, affordability and proximity
to  similar  neighbors,  two  additional  factors  influence  agent  decisions:  communication
and memory. Communication of favoured locations between like-agents simulates social
networks  and  further  reinforces  the  attractiveness  of  certain  locations.  With  spatial
memory, the model assumes that college students are likely to continue to return to the
areas  they  inhabited  as  students,  provided  their  basic  search  criteria  are  met.  This  is
based on the premise that students, as drivers of gentrification, often choose “favourite”
locations to which they return in the future following their transition to the “professional”
or “non-professional” class.

Figure 2 Average  number  and  type  of  locations  considered  by  a  professional  agent  in  its
search for a new location. For example, of the 100 locations searched that are unoccupied,
only 15 are also close to commercial districts. Of those that are both close to commercial districts
and unoccupied, two are found to also have at least one neighboring location inhabited by
an agent of similar class, and on average one out of two of those locations are affordable

The  four  factors  described  above,  along  with  the  influence  of  friendship  networks
and  memory  all  combine  to  form  the  decision-making  framework  for  the  agents.  For
example,  the  typical  steps  taken  by  professional  agents  in  searching  for  an  “ideal”
residential  location  is  described  by  the  diagram  in Figure  2,  and  the  decision  rules  are
elaborated for each agent class in Figure 3.

Another  issue  is  the  question  of  when  to  move.  Agent  mobility  is  driven  both  by
necessity  and  leisure. Benenson  (1998)  describes  residential  agent  movement  driven  by
local  cognitive  dissonance  (based  on  social  identity)  and  economic  imperative.  In  our
model,  agent  movement  is  driven  by  economic  imperative  in  that  an  agent  decides  to
look for a new location when it can no longer afford its current place. Cost was found
by Clark (1983) to be the second most common reason for household mobility behind
changes  in  household  structure,  thus  it  is  an  appropriate  representation  of  the  choices
of  residents.  Because  it  is  an  explanatory  model  and  movement  must  be  maximized  to
observe  the  patterns  of  geospatial  activity,  agents  are  also  programmed  to  move  regu-
larly even if not caused to do so by economic factors. This is similar to techniques used
in  other  such  research,  including  some  that  has  simulated  movement  of  residential
agents at regular intervals (Benenson 1998). The movement rules, as described here, are

increased by $2 per square foot, an estimation derived from data from a regional housing
study (Allen et al. 2002). The professional agents are programmed to cause an increase
in the land rent of their properties and those of their neighbors at the same rate. Finally,
it  is  noted  that  at  the  end  of  every  time  step  agents  who  cannot  afford  to  live  at  their
current x-y coordinate are removed from the simulation. Between this interval and every
fourth time step, agents of all classes except for the elderly increase their ability to pay
higher rents. Initially, agents are assigned random locations that may or may not meet
all their preferred requirements. Beginning at the fourth time step and every subsequent
fourth  time  step,  these  agents  relocate  according  to  the  rules  described  above.  The
demographic transition described earlier is also shown in Figure 4.

Having examined relocation schedules as well as location decisions, it is also helpful
to examine the initial parameters of the simulation to better understand how the model
is instantiated. The model displays five parameters that can be altered at the beginning
of each run of the simulation: the number of agents for each class, the rent abilities for
each  class,  the  amount  of  energy  an  agent  is  willing  to  put  into  the  search  for  new
housing, the number of friends one has, and whether or not the agent uses information
about prior residence in an area (e.g. memory). These were selected for the purpose of
verifying the simulated processes. The rent abilities for each type of agent are set relative
to one another based on data taken from the census and from an independent research
organization (Allen et al. 2002). These data showed that the rent paid by professionals
is approximately twice the amount paid by the non-professional class, and greater than
twice that paid by the elderly (Allen et al. 2002). No statistics to determine the relative
rent abilities of college students were found. It was reasoned, however, that as upwardly
mobile  individuals  with  some  disposable  income,  college  students  can  spend  more  on
rent than the average working class household. In our simulation, the average land rent
at the beginning of the simulation is $171 per square foot. Thus, the initial rent abilities
are distributed as shown in Table 1.

The  number  of  agents  used  in  the  simulation  is  another  major  parameter.  Tests
showed little difference in simulations using more than 4,000 agents, and increasing the
number much beyond this slowed the computations considerably. Thus, the number of
agents  being  modeled  represents  a  proportion  of  the  inhabitants  of  the  area,  with  the
proportion  in  each  category  determined  from  data  obtained  from  the  report  of  a  city
government agency (Boston Housing Authority 2007). At the start of the simulation, as
shown in Table 1, there are 1,184 college, 1,654 professional, 972 non-professional and
196 elderly agents in the simulated area. The search energy is initialized as 100, meaning
that agents will search a maximum of 100 locations before deciding to stop searching.
The number of friends of each agent is initialized as five, all of which are in the same class,

and are chosen randomly regardless of location. Finally, in most runs of the simulation,
unless explained otherwise in the results section, memory is included as a factor.

Evaluation  of  the  model  is  fairly  straightforward.  The  correctness  of  the  model’s
build  is  verified  through  sensitivity  analysis  procedures  described  in  the  following
section,  with  the  aim  of  verifying  that  the  model  captures  complex  and  emergent
patterns  in  the  system.  Then  the  differences  in  land  rents  between  2003  and  2007
from the city of Boston are compared against the spatial patterns of agent settlement
to  determine  whether  the  model  is  able  to  capture  processes  of  urban  residential
dynamics  and  land  rent  change.  Finally,  a  test  is  performed  to  determine  whether
specific  development  investments  further  explain  increases  in  land  rents  between  2003
and 2007.

3 Results

3.1 Simulation Results and Verification of the Model’s Processes

To verify certain processes in the model, multiple outputs of the simulation with minor
differences in the model’s initial parameters were analyzed. The effects of demographic
changes  in  the  system  were  observed  through  the  creation  of  a  measurement  tool  in
RePAST. Figure  5 shows population dynamics for the control run, where the simulation’s
initial parameters are not adjusted. In this simulation, the demographic profile responds
the  way  it  is  expected  to:  agents  gradually  leave  the  simulation  because  of  an  inability
to  find  affordable  locations  –  this  can  be  seen  in  the  decrease  in  non-professionals,
elderly, and college students. While the number of professional agents decreases initially,
the  population  quickly  rebounds  and  grows  as  college  students  transition  into  the
professional agent phase. Additional tests that confirm the complex nature of the agent

simulation  are  presented  below  in  Table  2  (with  notes  indicating  whether  the  results
were expected or not, as an indicator of complexity).

Verification of the effects of changes in rent abilities is one such test, and shows that
in  most  cases  the  model  performs  as  expected.  Tests  A  through  G  in Table  2  examine
the  effects  of  small  changes  in  agents’  rent  abilities  and  generally  verify  expected
processes, finding that all variations in these initial settings produce expected demographic
processes. From the way the model was constructed, one could hypothesize that should
the  rent  ability  of  professionals  decline,  their  populations  would  decrease  somewhat
as  well.  This  is  in  fact  the  case.  When  professional  agents’  rent  ability  is  decreased  by
10%, the professional population decreases as expected (as seen in Test B in Table 2).
When  the  professional  agents’  rent  abilities  are  increased  by  10%,  the  professional
population  stays  well  above  levels  reached  in  the  control  (Test  A).  Test  D  tests  the
interconnections between classes in the model: when the rent ability of college students
is decreased by 10%, the college student category decreases by 35%. Additionally, the
average  professional  population  also  decreases  by  10%.  This  shows  that  the  model
successfully  captures  the  area’s  demographic  transition,  where  students  who  graduate
become  professionals  and  decide  to  stay  in  the  area.  Test  E  reveals  some  important
information about the model – a minor increase in the non-professional’s rent abilities
causes a disproportionate (44%) increase in their average population, implying that the
rent  ability  of  the  non-professional  agent  is  at  a  tipping  point.  Tipping  points  occur
when  the  conditions  of  a  system  are  brought  to  a  point  where  minor  changes  would
cause  a  dramatic  increase  in  the  occurrence  of  rare  phenomena  (Gladwell  2000).  This
also  offers  evidence  that  the  model  captures  complex  system  dynamics,  where  changes
in rent abilities are not directly correlated with a set percent increase or decrease in the
various types of agents. Finally, a basic test was performed to confirm that the model’s
depiction  of  the  influence  of  professionals  on  land  rent  dynamics  works  as  intended.
Test  M  shows  that  when  the  code  which  enacts  agent-driven  landscape  change  was
made  inactive  the  rents  in  the  landscape  decreased  on  average  by  2%,  suggesting  that
the  rents  in  the  landscape  are  being  influenced  upwards  by  the  professional  agents  as
intended.

Besides  testing  the  effects  of  changes  in  initial  rent  abilities,  other  tests  were
compiled  to  show  whether  the  processes  expressed  in  the  model  are  the  processes
designed into the system. Test H, for instance, shows that as the search energy allotted
to  each  agent  increases  by  50%,  the  average  agent  populations  increase  substantially.
This is an expected outcome, given the structure of the model, because the more places
an agent can examine to find a suitable location, the more likely that agent will eventually
find one, and the less likely the agent will be removed from the area due to an inability
to  pay.  While  most  tests  shown  in  Table  2  exhibited  expected  outcomes,  verification
tests of a theoretical nature were also performed and are discussed below.

The  model  allows  the  user  the  option  of  making  “memory”  active  or  inactive,
thereby affecting the tendency of an agent to return to a favorite location. Memory was
used by Bennett and Tang (2005) within ABMs to simulate the return of migrating Elk
to certain locations, and its use here is analogous. In addition, because communication
within  friendship  networks  is  considered  to  be  an  important  input  to  the  residential
decision-making  process,  their  effects  on  the  outcome  of  the  proposed  model  are  con-
sidered.  Each  agent  initially  has  five  friends  with  whom  the  agent  can  communicate
information (e.g. message passing) throughout the simulation. By setting this number to
zero, the user effectively makes the message passing functionality in the system inactive.

Agent-Based Simulation of Urban Residential Dynamics

485

In this model, message passing through friendship provides a professional agent with the
ability to draw in another professional living outside of a commercial district and bring
him/her  to  a  location  that  may  otherwise  be  attractive  only  because  of  its  affordable
rent.  Thus,  when  a  professional  agent  is  “informed”  that  a  friend  has  found  a  good
location, it will choose to locate near the friend. Memory will also play a secondary role
in  this  choice,  as  the  agent  will  try  to  locate  itself  both  near  a  friend  as  well  as  in  a
previously  inhabited  area.  Such  message  passing  occurs  not  only  for  the  professional
agent class, but the case of the professional is highlighted because of its potential impact
on the land rent environment according to the model’s construction.

Tests  K  and  L  show  the  effects  on  the  model  when  memory  and  message  passing
are made inactive. In both cases, no changes in rents or populations were expected, only
that  fewer  agents  would  stay  in  one  location  for  the  duration  of  the  simulation,  but
results showed that populations of both professionals and non-professionals are affected
when spatial memory is made inactive. Observations indicate that with message passing
made active, several large clusters of professionals are formed. Conversely, when message
passing  is  removed  from  the  system,  the  professional  agents  are  not  as  clustered,  thus
gentrification occurs in more areas. This result was expected. However, in tests K and
L in Table 2, when communication between agents is made inactive, both professional
and non-professional populations are observed to increase. This effect was not expected.
One  explanation  may  be  because  of  the  structure  of  the  decision-making  process:  a
professional  agent  that  is  placed  on  the  property  a  friend  recommends  will  likely  stay
there until the rents increase and it can no longer afford that location. These agents are
subsequently  removed  from  the  simulation.  On  the  other  hand,  when  agents  are  not
given  any  suggestions  of  locations  from  friends,  they  then  choose  randomly  from  the
options  available,  and  find  locations  that  are  affordable  and  move  when  they  can  no
longer afford that location. Thus, these tests expose the need in the model to incorporate
a greater diversity of reasons for relocation by agents.

In summary, most analysis suggests that the model displays processes according to
its  design;  however,  there  are  situations  when  the  model  behaviour  deviates  from
expected  to  produce  emergent  behaviour.  Minor  changes  in  the  initial  rent  abilities  of
agents show expected changes in populations of their respective classes, some also causing
changes  in  populations  of  other  classes,  this  being  a  possible  indicator  of  complexity.
Rent ability tests also show that the model may have uncovered a tipping point for the
rent ability of non-professional which if attained, can cause a significant increase in their
populations in the given simulation. Tests of the effects of increasing the search energy
of agents and making agent-driven landscape change functions inactive verified that the
model  demonstrates  the  processes  it  was  intended  to.  Other  tests  offered  a  mix  of
surprises, and lessons for future models. When spatial memory and communication are
made inactive, results are not as expected, though reasons for these surprises have been
explained.  The  most  persuasive  evidence  that  the  model  captures  complexity  in  the
system  is  that  when  the  initial  rent  ability  and  population  of  professional  agents  are
increased,  the  population  of  non-professionals  is  significantly  impacted  (decreased),
because  of  competition  with  the  professional  agents.  Having  shown  that  the  model
works according to specification, it is now appropriate to evaluate the simulation results
for its verisimilitude to realistic outcomes. Model results are examined in the following
sections  by  analyzing  predictions  of  where  gentrification  will  occur  vis-à-vis  actual
increases  in  land  rents  between  2003–2007,  and  whether  the  incorporation  of  major
investments in the area could improve the model’s accuracy.

3.2 Areas of Gentrification

Two  factors  are  believed  to  be  an  effective  measure  of  gentrification.  The  first  is  dis-
placement, meaning a replacement of non-professionals, working-class or poor residents
with  a  wealthier  class,  usually  professionals;  the  process  is  indicated  in  demographic
analysis  by  a  relative  increase  in  the  presence  of  the  latter,  termed  as  “gentrifiers”
(Atkinson  2000),  and  a  decrease  in  the  presence  of  the  former,  i.e.  the  displaced.
Another  sign  that  an  area  is  gentrifying  is  that  it  experiences  an  increase  in  property
values of the area relative to those of the region as a whole (Galster and Peacock 1986).
Observations of increase in land rents between 2003–2007 compared to the final location
of  agents  in  the  simulation,  as  shown  in Figure  6,  suggest  that  these  processes  may  be
occurring in the regions circled. In running the simulation, it is possible to observe the
demographic transition and subsequent gentrification, as agents in these areas start out
as  college  students  looking  for  affordable  rents  in  a  historically  working-class/poor
neighborhood  (Roxbury),  and  then  become  professionals  and  return  to  live  in  these
areas.  The  process  of  college  students  becoming  professionals,  it  has  been  argued,  is  a
common  present  form  of  gentrification  (Smith  2005,  2007).  However,  it  is  difficult  to
draw conclusive results or make any predictions about gentrification in specific areas.

3.3 Testing the Theory of Structural Investment

There  is  a  structural  (production)  perspective  on  gentrification  that  suggests  that
investments  are  the  driving  force  behind  an  increase  in  land  values  (Smith  1979).  As
investment  is  not  accounted  for  in  the  agent-based  model  (which  follows  more  of  an
individual/consumption  perspective),  it  was  hypothesized  that  there  would  be  an  asso-
ciation between the location of actual investments and areas experiencing an increase in
land  rents.  To  test  this  structural  investment  perspective,  locations  of  large  investment
projects  that  were  either  constructed  or  under  construction  from  2003  to  2007  were
obtained  from  the  Boston  Redevelopment  Authority.  Addresses  were  geocoded,  and
land rent increases between 2003–2007 within 800 m (the distance of roughly two street
blocks in this area) from these locations were evaluated using buffers.

Results  indicate  that  areas  showing  increases  in  land  rent  were  not  significantly
associated  with  the  locations  of  investment.  A  t-test  showed  no  statistical  distinction
between  the  mean  value  of  the  difference  between  predicted  and  observed  land  values
for cells within 800 ft of investments ($27.7/sq.ft.), and cells further away ($27.2/sq.ft.).
In short, knowing the location of investments does not allow one to predict changes in
land value any better than the agent-based model already does. This supports the individual/
consumption  perspective  on  gentrification,  and  suggests  that  the  factors  accounted  for
in our model may be sufficient for this case study.

4 Discussion

The Agent-Based Model (ABM) described above uses simple decision rules and selection
criteria, yet manages to capture important elements of gentrification and demonstrates
the  potential  for  the  use  of  ABM  as  a  comprehensive  analytical  tool  for  this  complex
social process. However, to evaluate results, it is important to discuss model limitations
in detail.

4.1 How Many Rules, How Many Variables?

Rules chosen for this model are simple, in part because of data limitations, but also by
design. The aim of this research was not to capture the specific choices of each individual,
but  to  capture  broad  spatial  patterns  that  give  rise  to  gentrification.  The  demographic
transition modeled in our research better reflects the lifecycle transition experienced in
the city than would traditional household lifecycle models. Regardless, the relevance of
such lifecycle models for housing mobility is still a subject of debate (Clark 1983), and
should not be considered essential for the analysis. In our model, most college students
become  professionals  and  stay  in  the  area.  When  considering  locations,  professionals
decide  to  move  to  areas  where  they  once  lived  because  research  shows  that  where
students  decide  to  live,  gentrification  often  follows  (Smith  2005,  2007).  Other  explicit
measurements of housing dissatisfaction such as housing space, quality, and public services
of the neighborhood, are not considered for lack of available data. Further, note that in
Torrens  and  Nara’s  (2007,  p.  344)  model  (which  accounts  for  housing  choices  of
individuals),  there  are  many  more  variables  considered  when  compared  to  the  model
presented  for  this  research;  on  the  regional  scale  these  include  median  property  value,
housing  type,  median  economic  status,  median  property  size  median  accessibility  and
the ethnic profile, while the agent also considers these same variables for the individual
house or home. Incorporating more variables such as these, and those argued by Clark
(1983) to influence mobility would be the next step for the model’s development. However,
the  rules  chosen  for  our  model  seem  to  capture  at  least  some  essential  elements  of
complexity in the system being modeled.

4.2 Scale

The model incorporates three important levels of organization described in the literature
as essential to capturing the complexity of urban systems: the individual, the local and
the global. The local level refers to the states of the neighbors, and the global refers
to the characteristics of the whole city (Portugali et al. 1997, Benenson 1998). By comparison,
the  model  presented  herein  utilizes  all  three  levels  –  at  the  individual  level,  it  looks
at the choices of theoretical residents with specific economic and class distinctiveness; at
the  local  level  it  predicts  that  the  locational  choices  of  these  individuals  will  be  influ-
enced  by  the  potential  characteristics  of  neighboring  residents;  and  at  the  global  level
the rent increases simulated for the whole surface are derived from city-wide data, thus
the  movements  of  agents  are  impacted  by  known  global  economic  factors.  The  model
thus  makes  a  contribution  to  the  field  in  that  it  offers  a  relatively  simple  simulation
framework  that  involves  all  the  essential  levels  of  urban  organization  and  could  be
applicable for many case studies were certain data available.

4.3 Race and Ethnicity

Research on urban residential segregation indicates race and ethnicity as playing a major
role  in  the  location  choices  of  individuals  (Fossett  2006;  Clark  1986,  1992).  Indeed,
seminal work on modelling segregation by Schelling (1969), and Benenson et al.’s (2001)
work using agent-based models of residential location choice cite race and ethnicity as
key  factors  controlling  patterns  of  settlement.  However,  the  2000  census  block  group
data  for  the  modeled  area  suggested  that  the  largest  increases  in  land  rent  values  have

Figure 7 Percent change in land rent values between 2003–2007 as compared to percent
minorities (blacks and hispanics) by block group (2000 census)

occurred  in  minority-dominated  areas  (i.e.  block  groups  where  Hispanic  or  Black
populations  are  the  majority)  (Figure  7),  suggesting  that  gentrifiers  prefer  racially
diverse  neighbourhoods.  This  is  contrary  to  the  expectation  that  residential  location
choice  is  highly  influenced  by  racial  prejudice  and  suggests,  as  has  already  argued  in
other  urban  contexts  (Bruch  and  Mare  2006)  that  decision-making  with  respect  to
residential  choice  may  be  more  nuanced  and  not  significantly  influenced  by  race.  For
this reason, the model uses economic status instead of race during simulation. In other
words,  class  is  the  most  significant  factor  in  determining  the  categorization  and  thus
eventual location of individuals.

5 Conclusions

The agent-based modeling (ABM) approach presented herein uses basic empirical data
and  simple  decision-making  rules  to  simulate  residential  dynamics.  Further,  it  breaks
demographics  down  by  class,  not  by  race,  assigning  simple  preference  rules  for  each
residential agent. Simplified decision rules and lack of racial preferences notwithstanding,

verification of the model’s processes shows that the model construction is reliable and a
good start at capturing the complexity and emergent nature of urban residential dynamics.
The identification of a “tipping point” based on the rent ability of the “non-professional”
class, as well as the indirect impact of the rent abilities of the professional class on populations
of other classes, can be seen as indicators of complexity in the system. Further, consideration
of  infrastructure  investments  appears  to  add  little  value  to  explaining  increase  in  land
rent values. While the effectiveness of such a model in predicting gentrification is difficult
to validate, it is argued that this model of individual decision-making and agent-environment
interaction  is  a  valuable  contribution  towards  improving  the  understanding  of  some  of
the processes underlying gentrification dynamics in global, growing cities.

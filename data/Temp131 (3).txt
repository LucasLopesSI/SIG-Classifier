This article presents an improved algorithm for optimization 

and development of a digital bathymetric model (DBM) for 

Lake Azuei (LA) (Haiti) and Lake Enriquillo (LE) (Dominican 

Republic) using the ANUDEM method. Both sonar data and 

contour  lines  of  the  lakes’  layout  extracted  using  Landsat 

imagery  were  compiled  for  bathymetry  development.  We 

show  that  the  performance  of  the  ANUDEM  method  was 

strongly  dependent  on  the  density  and  irregularity  of  the 

spatial distribution of the data. Changing the resolution of 

the output grids and deriving auxiliary topographically cor‐

rected contours improved the ANUDEM performance and 

minimized  the  systematic  errors  of  the  method.  Statistical 

analysis  showed  no  significant  difference  between  meas‐

ured and interpolated depths, characterized by a root mean 

square error of less than 0.71 m (LE) and 0.96 m (LA), and a 

median difference of −0.009 m (LE) and 0.012 m (LA) on av‐

erage. The shape reliability analysis revealed a relationship 

between accuracy and the depth and slope values, increas‐

ing in the center of the lakes where they are deep and the 

slope is gentle.

Digital terrain models (DTMs) representing the gridded surface of features such as ground or reservoir bed/floor 

are typically derived from interpolation of topographic data. These digital representations of surface elevation 

and  subsurface  water  body  depths  are  central  to  many  research  efforts  dealing  with  water  resources,  clima‐

tology and environmental engineering investigations, and concern for example wind field modeling (Winstral & 

Marks, 2002), sunlight modeling (Dozier & Frew, 1990), soil erosion estimation (Bhattarai & Dutta, 2007; Lu, Li, 

Valladares, & Batistella, 2004), sediment movement (Jones, 2002), flood simulation (Bates & De Roo, 2000; Haile 

&  Rientjes,  2005),  catchment  studies  (Vogt,  Colombo,  &  Bertolo,  2003),  and  limnology  (Li,  Zhu,  &  Gold,  2005; 

Nolan & Brigham‐Grette, 2006).

Lake Enriquillo (LE) and Lake Azuei (LA) are located on the island of Hispaniola and have been subject to scientific 

research interest over the years due to their extensive expanding and shrinking patterns. Recent expansion (starting 

in 2004) has had significant implications for the region brought on by the inundation of arable land, local highways 

(impacting the trade routes between Haiti and the Dominican Republic [DR] in the border region), and even requiring 

the abandonment of villages (Boca de Cachon, DR) and subsequent resettlement. While the lake levels seem to have 

remained stable over the past 3 years, great interest persists (as attested to by verbal communications with represen‐

tatives of the Haitian and Dominican Republic governments) in understanding why they grew to these unprecedented 

levels and subsequently assessing what the future patterns may look like. To this end, a hydrologic analysis is needed 

that includes the lakes themselves, the watersheds of both lakes, in addition to details of past and future hydroclimato‐

logical data. Although previous research efforts have used the surface area and/or level fluctuations of the lakes for hy‐

drological studies (Benson & Paillet, 1989; Daut et al., 2010), it is really the volume of the lakes and their rates of change 

that are needed to formulate a water balance model that could yield a deeper insight into the lake behaviors (Mason, 

Guzkowska, Rapley, & Street‐Perrott, 1994). A necessary step for the volume calculations is thus to obtain a digital rep‐

resentation of not only the surrounding terrain (above lake level), but also the lakes’ bathymetry to construct a seamless 

digital surface (a “bathtub”) that includes the lakes’ topographical depression and that can be filled/emptied at will.

As the ubiquity of DTM representations has grown over the years, so have different methods of interpola‐

tion, namely deterministic interpolation (e.g. inverse distance weighting [IDW] and splines), geostatistical methods 

(e.g. kriging), and hydrologically correct methods (e.g. the Australian National University Digital Elevation Model 

[ANUDEM]—Hutchinson, 1989; Hutchinson, Xu, & Stein, 2011 and triangulated irregular networks [TINs]—Arun, 

2013; Leon & Cohen, 2012). The accuracy of a generated DTM depends largely on a number of factors including 

accuracy of data source (Gong, Zhilin, Zhu, Sui, & Zhou, 2000), density of data points (Aguilar, Agüera, Aguilar, & 

Carvajal, 2005; Chaplot et al., 2006; Gong et al., 2000), spatial and statistical distributions of data points (Gumus & 

Sen, 2013; Zimmerman, Pavlik, Ruggles, & Armstrong, 1999), the interpolation process itself (Aguilar et al., 2005; 

Arun, 2013; Gong et al., 2000), type of terrain (Chaplot et al., 2006; Gong et al., 2000; Zimmerman et al., 1999), 

and finally the required resolution of the output grids (Fisher & Tate, 2006; Kienzle, 2004). Any of these afore‐

mentioned factors may introduce errors or inaccuracies in the final product. Moreover, these factors influence 

the selection of a suitable interpolation method for a specific dataset (Ikechukwu, Ebinne, Idorenyin, & Raphael, 

2017). For instance, IDW and spline methods are known to be effective when the density of source data is high 

and  their  distribution  is  homogeneous,  because  these  methods  depend  largely  on  the  neighborhood  of  target 

points (Leon & Cohen, 2012). Tests have shown that IDW yields more accurate results than other methods when 

generating a DTM from a contour map, which is regularly spaced source data (Tan & Xu, 2014), while splines have 

been used successfully in cases where the data were more irregularly spaced (Ikechukwu et al., 2017). In contrast, 

the kriging approach, which is a statistical model, does not require homogeneity of the spatial distribution but 

requires more steps, such as the normalization of the dataset, and is thus more labor‐intensive (Ikechukwu et al., 

2017). Another method of generating DTMs is ANUDEM, a hydrological‐based interpolation with an underlying 

iterative finite difference technique (Hutchinson, 1989), similar to the use of splines (Lewis, 2001). This method

was developed for digital topography map generation incorporating drainage features, which makes this method 

suitable for hydrological and hydroecological analysis (Hutchinson et al., 2011), as evidenced by numerous appli‐

cations (Parker, Milbert, Wilson, Bailey, & Gesch, 2001; Whiteway, 2009; Yang et al., 2007; Zerger & Wealands, 

2004; Zheng, Xiong, Yue, & Gong, 2016). Moreover, this algorithm has also been used for bathymetry generation 

and  many  researchers  have  found  it  to  be  an  effective  tool  to  produce  DBMs  for  reservoirs  (Hradilek,  Bašta, 

Vizina, Máca, & Pech, 2015), lakes (Leon & Cohen, 2012; Popielarczyk & Templin, 2014), coastal areas (Parker et 

al., 2001; Whiteway, 2009), and seafloor (Daniell, 2008; De Araujo et al., 2016; Fretwell, Tate, Deen, & Belchier, 

2009; Hillenbrand, Trathan, Arndt, & Kuhn, 2014). Given that sometimes bathymetry generation for a water body 

requires special interpolation techniques due to the highly anisotropic distribution of observations as a result of 

how data were collected (Gold & Condal, 1995), we decided to utilize the ANUDEM method for modeling the LA’s 

and LE’s floor. Hydrographic survey data of lakes’ depth (Piasecki et al., 2016) and Landsat images were used as in‐

puts for the interpolation process. We derived and optimized the DBMs for both lakes by minimizing the errors of 

interpolation and removing artifacts created during the interpolation process, employing the void‐filling technique 

suggested by Zheng et al. (2016), which allowed us to also assess the accuracy of volume and depth estimations.

LA  and  LE  are  situated  in  close  proximity  (approximately  3  km  apart  at  their  closest  point)  along  a  west‐to‐east 

orientation and are separated by the Haiti/DR border. LE and LA were formed on marine deposits in the Cul de Sac 

Depression and feature a fairly rocky and steep shoreline, except on the western and eastern ends where the shore‐

line exhibits very gentle slopes. LE extends 43 km in the E–W direction and has a width of 15 km N–S, while LA’s 

dimensions are 30 km NW–SE and 10 km NE–SW, making them not only the biggest lakes on the island but also in 

the entire Caribbean region. The lakes are characterized by a high degree of water‐level fluctuations through time. 

On the north and south, the lakes are bounded by the mountain ranges of Sierra Neiba and Sierra Barahuco, which 

reach an elevation of more than 2,000 m above sea level. Figure 1 shows the valley and the location of the lakes.

The first bathymetry map available for LE was produced in 1992 (Araguás Araguás, Mchelen, Garcia, Medina, 

& Febrillet, 1995), followed by a second one published in 2005 (Buck et al., 2005) (cf. Figure 2). However, the lack 

of a digital representation or an open‐access dataset confines data to a paper print, which is unsuitable for any 

further analytical work. We could have digitized from the contour lines, but the size of the images was already 

quite small (also note the blurriness of image 2a), moreover the scale and a reference point were not available, thus 

not lending themselves to a digitizing effort. Due to the lack of information on how they were created, lacking 

scale, reference points, and reference datum, and the overall poor image quality, a scanning‐by‐hand approach 

in all likelihood would introduce additional errors. Hence our need to recreate the bathymetry in digital format.

Nevertheless, these figures are valuable in that they show the general shape of the LE floor, which features two 

distinct bowls, one to the north of Isla de Cabritos and a shallower but larger one to the south of the island. LA, in 

contrast, has been researched much less over the years and as a result, there is no prior publication on its bathym‐

etry. This lake features an elongated shape with steep edges on the north and south, bounded in three directions 

of N–S–E, and a broad shallow section on the west side as can be interpreted from Landsat images and the Shuttle 

Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM.

Our analysis is based on depth‐surveying data acquired from several cruise expeditions in 2013 for both LA and LE 

(Piasecki & Moknatian, 2018; Piasecki et al., 2016). The data available from this source are single‐beam soundings

F I G U R E   2  Previous bathymetry maps for Lake Enriquillo: (a) bathymetry map presented by Araguás Araguás 
et al. (1995); (b) bathymetry map presented by Buck and Brenner (2005)

(HumminBird sonar) with geolocation information provided by a GPS system. The survey soundings were subject 

to further quality checks and additional cleaning to remove erroneous points, such as rate‐of‐change filters, visual 

correction of unreasonable bottom features, and depth‐reading comparisons on intersecting track lines, before 

the data could be used for the interpolation process. Some inevitable errors, such as up and down bobbing on 

waves during the surveys and time lags between survey date and satellite image date (these were small, i.e. just 

a few weeks at most), were considered insignificant when targeting volume calculations, which was our survey 

focus, and thus were not addressed separately. Sedimentation resulting in a smaller estimate of the volume of 

water, thus introducing a potential error, has been reported in the literature (Rahmani et al., 2018; Sekellick, Banks, 

& Myers, 2012), but we decided not to consider this effect for a number of reasons. First, the streams flowing 

MOKNATIAN eT Al.    |  845

into the lakes are of ephemeral nature (i.e. they will only carry water [runoff] after substantial storm events in the 

mountains). In addition, the river discharge is relatively small because of the porosity (karstic formations—Draper, 

Mann, & Lewis, 1994; Gonzalez, Domingo, Gonzalez, & Comarazamy, 2011) of the surrounding mountains that 

permits high infiltration rates (i.e. much of the precipitation in the mountains actually enters the lakes through 

subsurface  flows  with  sediments  already  filtered  out).  Second,  much  of  the  slopes  are  made  up  of  vegetated 

retaining soil and are also comprised of rocky substrate that (a) moves slowly and (b) does not have a lot of mo‐

bilizable small‐size sediments. Third, recent work on the lakes involving coring (Sloan et al., 2017) showed that 

the amount of sediment added over decadal time scales is relatively small, suggesting that the lakes experience 

very low sedimentation rates, much below those reported by Sekellick et al. (2012) and Rahmani et al. (2018). We 

can also confirm from our own observations that the water in both lakes appeared quite transparent, with low 

turbidity. The final dataset has sufficiently high quality levels (class type 3: Reconnaissance) for our work (volume 

assessment), but would not correspond to a full lake bed survey needed for navigational chart quality‐type ba‐

thymetric representations or targeting detailed bottom feature mappings. This would have required adherence 

to higher‐level hydrographic data collection protocols. The single‐beam soundings contained depth values of the 

lakes at the time of expedition with reference to the water surface as the vertical datum along the cruise track line. 

After the corrections, we used GIS software (ArcGIS 10.0) to convert all data points to WGS84 (horizontal) and 

EGM96 geoid (vertical) reference datums.

The  spatial  extent/cruise  track  line  of  the  collection  campaigns  are  presented  in  Figure  3  for  reference. 

Soundings provided us with a total of 35,052 and 17,401 depth soundings for LE and LA, along 326 and 249 km of 

track line, respectively. The distance between the recorded points varied between one and a few hundred meters, 

with an average of 12.7 m (LE) and 14.4 m (LA). The distances between the transects were about 2 km (LE) and 

1 km (LA) on average (with a minimum of 0.5 km and a maximum of 6 km in some places), over surface areas of 
345.8 km2 (LE) and 138.3 km2 (LA).

In addition to the soundings, we used satellite images to extract and define the lakes’ outlines over time, to 

establish a relationship of depth (or volume) as a function of surface area. Note that this approach only works for 

a lake that has shallow sections and sloping shorelines (i.e. a basin with perfectly vertical walls would not expand 

in surface area while adding volume, thus rendering the use of satellite image data impractical). The extracted 

outlines provided us with extra depth contour lines in time, to aid in defining and mapping the lakes’ edges. These

contours filled the data gap along the shore at the time of survey (i.e. areas the survey vessel often could not 

get to). Toward this end, we performed an extensive search of the Landsat image archive reaching back 30 years 

(1984–2014) in order to identify cloud‐free images of the lakes. Out of the data pool of 372 images, 16 were identi‐

fied as suitable for both lakes. The Level 1 Terrain Corrected images were downloaded from the U.S. Geographical 

Survey (USGS) Global Visualization Viewer (http://glovis.usgs.gov) and the lakes’ shorelines were later extracted, 

using the normalized difference water index (NDWI), following Moknatian, Piasecki, and Gonzalez (2017) from 

Landsat images of Hispaniola island and extracting the LA and LE extents for 1984 to 2014. The extracted outline 

for the year 2013, closest to the date of the sonar readings (more specifically, the images taken on March 27, 2013 

[LE] and July 1, 2013 [LA]), was treated as the zero‐depth line defining the boundaries of the lakes, thus allowing 

us to use lake outlines from preceding years as depth contours (during these years the lake level was much lower). 

We note that not all of the bathymetry survey points fell exactly inside the lakes’ zero‐depth outlines (shorelines) 

due to the resolution of the Landsat images (30 × 30 m). To address this issue, we removed another 560 (LE) and 

463 (LA) points falling outside the shorelines, which make up about 2% of LE and 3% of LA total points of the 

bathymetric dataset, to produce consistent depths along the shoreline.

The corresponding depth values of each pre‐2013 lake outline‐based contour were assigned by masking the 

sounding points within a 2‐m distance around and along the corresponding contour and averaging the depth val‐

ues. Averaging helped in smoothing the differences between depth points and satellite‐generated outlines that 

occasionally occurred. Again, these are the result of a relatively coarse 30‐m resolution of the Landsat images 

which influences the lakes’ outline spatial accuracy, resulting in more than one depth value along the lake outline. 

Figure 4 shows two examples of Landsat images taken 10 years apart (2003 and 2013) of the two lakes; note the 

dramatic difference in shoreline.

3.2 | Gridding algorithm/DBM creation algorithm

3.2.1 | Spatial interpolation

Among  different  interpolation  methods,  the  ANUDEM  method  (hydrologically  correct  method)  has  shown  its 

utility to produce more accurate products (Arun, 2013; Šiljeg, Lozić, & Šiljeg, 2015; Tan & Xu, 2014). Its use yields 

terrain that features both smooth and steep sections by defining the local slope and curvature (Hutchinson, 2011; 

Pavlova, 2017). Moreover, ANUDEM allows the use of different concurrent input data types, such as data points 

and contour lines. The method combines two algorithms of interpolation and drainage enforcement to produce a 

smooth surface from elevation datasets with respect to hydrologic correction. During the interpolation procedure, 

a regular grid for the smooth surface is built using the point or contour elevation data by employing an iterative 

finite difference technique based on minimizing a discretized rotation‐invariant roughness penalty (Hutchinson, 

1989). The drainage features of streamline, lake ridges, and channels are also incorporated in the interpolation as 

constraints, while sink points will be removed during the drainage enforcement process.

For a DTM to be considered a “best representation of a given terrain,” it should not only yield consistent eleva‐

tion values but also accurately represent and be consistent with the slopes and curvatures of the real land surface 

(Kienzle, 2004). In ANUDEM, the curvature of fitted surfaces is controlled by user‐defined roughness penalties, 

defined in terms of first and second‐order partial derivatives of the fitted function, so that the DEM matches the 

sharp changes in terrain associated with peaks, streams, and ridges (Hutchinson, 2000).

ANUDEM  introduces  two  parameters,  namely  the  roughness  penalty  (RP)  and  profile  curvature  roughness 

penalty (PCRP). RP modifies the minimum curvature interpolation function by specifying the amount of potential 

to be added to the default total curvature penalty. This transformation helps the grid to fit to sharp changes in 

gradients, particularly at peaks. PCRP is defined as the curvature of the fitted surface in the downslope direction. 

This parameter is a locally adaptive factor that can be used to partly replace total curvature, helping the adjust‐

ment of the model to features such as rock outcrops, cliffs, and waterfalls (Hutchinson, 2000, 2011). Thus, the 

shape of the final product depends greatly on the proper selection of the RP and PCRP values (Hutchinson, 1989; 

Lewis, 2001). A combination of total and potential curvature has been found to yield better results when using 

point data rather than contour data. Therefore, RP values of zero and 0.5 are recommended when having contour 

and point data as main sources, respectively (Hutchinson, 1989, 2000, 2011). PCRP can range from zero to 0.9 

depending on the characteristics of a given case study (Hutchinson, 2011). Improvement in ANUDEM results can 

be achieved by optimizing the interpolation algorithm parameters of RP and PCRP, output grid resolution, and 

number of iterations (Yang et al., 2007), or by employing auxiliary topographic data (Zheng et al., 2016). In this 

study, we chose a 30‐m pixel resolution for the output grid in order to match the resolution of the surrounding 

SRTM DEM.

3.2.2 | Artifact detection

The highly anisotropic distribution of our survey soundings, especially in the center of the lakes, created large 

areas of no data. The distribution of these areas of no data created inside the smallest lake extent, in combina‐
tion with the track lines, showed that 90% of LE had spaces of no data larger than 1.8 km2, and 0.6 km2 for LA, 

requiring approximately 2,000 (LE) and 700 (LA) grid cells for the smallest space to be filled when incorporating 
the required 30‐m resolution of the output. The largest no‐data areas for each lake were 13.7 km2 (LE) and 14.16 
km2 (LA), respectively.

The areas with no data or sparse data are subject to artifact creation, introduced by the interpolation process 

(Arndt et al., 2013; Danielson et al., 2016; Moustier & Kleinrock, 1986). Once the raw gridded surface was created, 

we passed it through a thorough examination step to identify probable anomalous artifacts creation. We observed 

two sets of artifacts: (i) peak or sink shape patches (Figure 5a); and (ii) “rib” shape ridges (Figure 5b).

area; and (c) overlaying the survey track lines, extracted lakes’ outlines, and raw models

Visualizing the gridded model together with the bathymetric source datasets (Figure 5c) showed that the peak 

or sink shape patches appeared mostly along the strip line between the smallest and largest lakes’ extent outlines, 

while “rib”‐like features evolved in no‐data areas. Further investigation of these anomalies showed that the peak/

sink‐shaped patches are either due to the existence of submerged objects such as structures or trees, or overlap‐

ping of the lake’s outlines resulting in an artifact. Removing these artifacts required some degree of care, during 

which we examined each suspected spot separately, trying to find images that were from a point in time when the 

area was not inundated. The points or line segments related to those areas were either kept (if they corresponded 

to an existing structure or small hills/islands) or eliminated from the dataset (if there was no indication of structure 

or object). Note that this “mowing” surveying pattern helps with the interpolation process, but does not cause any 

appreciable error in the final volume calculations.

Comparing the raw modeled surface with other references, and also inspecting the consistency in the occur‐

rence of the “rib”‐like anomalous areas in large patches appearing in no‐data areas, suggested that these features 

did not represent the actual bed and are artifacts created by the interpolation algorithm. The profiles of the inward 

“rib” ridges running between the track lines were extracted and then compared to the slope profile of the closest 

track lines. It was noted that the slope of the bathymetry in between two adjacent track lines did not maintain 

the same elevation changes as the track lines would suggest, thus creating a smaller downhill slope causing “rib” 

shapes when viewed from the top.

To  create  the  initial  gridded  surface,  we  used  an  RP  value  of  0.5,  as  suggested  by  Hutchinson  (1988)  for  pri‐

mary data types such as elevation points, and a PCRP value of zero (default). Subsequently, we modified these two 

MOKNATIAN eT Al.    |  849

parameters to find optimum values that would result in the disappearance of the “rib” formations and thus correct 

slope and curvature. An RP value of zero (making the surface stiffer) seemed to result in some improvement for areas 

of gentle downslopes. Varying the PCRP value, however, did not seem to yield a noticeable change in the bathymetry 

results. We thus kept it near the lower limit of zero, despite the results of other research efforts suggesting that the 

PCRP value needs to be set higher in order to increase the slope of the profile (Yang, Van Niel, Mcvicar, Hutchinson, & 

Li, 2005; Yang et al., 2007). Changes in the RP and PCRP parameters did not seem to work for the steep areas of the 

site. It is worth mentioning that the number of iterations of the interpolation process did not improve the results either.

The reasons why changes in the ANUDEM parameters did not yield satisfactory results were related to the 

density of the source points and the irregularity in distribution of the track lines. This also meant that the initial 

choice of a 30‐m grid resolution proved unsuitable for the study area; in fact, the output grid resolution has a sig‐

nificant impact on ANUDEM performance. Thus, not being able to choose an optimum resolution for the outputs 

a priori introduced unwanted bias to the results. This was compounded by the highly irregular spatial distribution 

of sonar data over the lakes, with the distance between a target point and its four neighbors varying between 5 m 

(along the track) and 7 km (between two adjacent track lines).

If  the  best  output  resolution  cannot  be  predetermined,  some  guidance  has  been  provided  that  aids  in  se‐

lecting a good starting resolution based on both source data density and type of terrain. The optimal grid size is 

between the interval length of sample points and up to twice that when their spatial distribution is homogeneous. 

Otherwise,  the  DTM  may  be  generated  with  insufficient  information  in  one  case  or  altered  information  in  the 

other (William, Brian, Saul, & William, 1989). This means that the density of points in a unit surface (of the target 

resolution) should be between one and four. The data density investigation of input points for lakes showed a 
density of 101.7 and 126.3 points/km2 for LE and LA, respectively. Considering the desired 30 × 30 m resolution 

of the bathymetry, the required density reduced to an average of 0.08 (LE: between 0 and 556 points/unit) and 

0.1 (LA: between 0 and 144 points/unit) over the 30 × 30 m unit surface, while more than 94% of the grid cells 

contained no data at all. The density of points over the unit area of 30‐m resolution was far less than the limit of 

1–4 points/unit stated by William et al. (1989), thus indicating that the available source data density was actually 

not sufficient to generate an accurate 30 × 30 m cell size DBM.

3.2.3 | Introducing auxiliary contours using output resolution change

Because of the non‐ideal spatial distribution of the input data, we had to develop a different strategy to utilize the 

sonar data. Kienzle (2004) showed that the optimum grid size for a DTM should be coarser when the profile and 

plan curvature of the terrain are the target features (Kienzle, 2004). In the ANUDEM algorithm, the grid genera‐

tion starts from an initial coarse resolution, which is calculated from the average depth of all data values and which 

will then be interpolated onto a grid with a finer user‐defined resolution (Hutchinson et al., 2011). The average 

depth values of data points for lakes were 11.22 m (LE) and 11.54 m (LA), which was finer than our desired 30 m 

grid size. This also explains why the ANUDEM algorithm could not eliminate the spurious ridges during its correc‐

tion steps (i.e. the interpolation error propagates inside the no‐data areas due to the data distribution—Brasington 

& Richards, 1998; Fisher & Tate, 2006).

In order to help eliminate the problem of erroneous slope and curvature, we decided to focus on the grid size 

and assess its effect on the “rib” creations. Arndt et al. (2013) suggested decreasing the resolution of the output 

surface in order to remove the artifacts and also improving the local curvature. However, decreasing the grid size 

results in losing detailed information and also the smooth lake outline. We repeatedly applied this process to both 

lakes, spanning a selection starting at 30‐m grid (pixel) and going up to 1‐km resolution.

As can be observed from Figure 6, the coarser the resolution the better (smoother) the contour‐line presentation 

in terms of removing “rib”‐like artifacts in areas of no data. A common method for void filling is to use a coarser grid 

size in areas with no data (Reuter, Nelson, & Jarvis, 2007; Robinson, Regetz, & Guralnick, 2014; Zheng et al., 2016). 

However, through the process of scale change, some details are lost, resulting in changes to DEM characteristics and

consequently shapes of contour lines (Brasington, Rumsby, & McVey, 2000). Therefore, using topographic elements 

directly  from  low‐resolution  DEM  as  auxiliary  input  for void  filling  causes  discrepancies  between  fine  and  coarse 

DEMs, a loss of vertical accuracy, and topological inconsistency of the final output DEM (Zheng et al., 2016). To over‐

come these problems, Zheng et al. (2016) proposed an improved ANUDEM technique to fill voids in a DEM. In this 

method, they used contour lines derived from multi‐scale DEM (being coarse in areas of no data) as auxiliary input for 

ANUDEM. The information from the contours was corrected using the terrain topological structure before engaging 

the interpolation step. This method helped preserve the characteristics of the surface across different scales, recov‐

ering sharp terrain features in the resampled DEM, and reducing the inconsistency between the multi‐scale data. As 

a result, the void‐filled high‐resolution DEM had higher vertical accuracy and their method was proved to generate 

high‐quality auxiliary DEM data. Applying the same method, we decided to search for and identify the optimal grid 

size at which “rib”‐like artifacts start to fade away in no‐data areas, then extract extra contour lines for those areas, 

apply topographic correction, and subsequently insert them back into the bathymetry generation process as auxiliary 

contours. This is not a straightforward process, however, but requires iteration during which the number of contours 

and also their depth values need to be adjusted to match the depth soundings and lakes’ outlines.

3.3 | Accuracy assessment

To assess the quality of a DTM, both the accuracy of the interpolated depth values and the shape reliability of 

the  surface  have  to  be  validated  (Desmet,  1997).  Statistical  methods  applied  to  the  modeled  values  and  their 

MOKNATIAN eT Al.associated  errors  are  helpful  when  the  precision  of  the  interpolation  is  the  focus,  while  shape  reliability  can  be 

assessed by examining the spatial distribution of the errors. We first tested the performance and accuracy of the 

interpolation using mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) indicators, 

showing the degree of bias, deviation of the bathymetry from the surveyed data, and overall accuracy of the pro‐

duced bathymetry, respectively (Erdoǧan, 2010):

where ΔD represents the difference between overlapping datasets of the observed depth values from the input 
sources (sonar readings) and the interpolated/extracted depths from the bathymetry. For a DTM to be precise and 

unbiased, ME, MAE, and RMSE should be close to zero (Chen et al., 2016; Erdoǧan, 2010). These indices are general 

indicators summarizing the algorithm performance in only a single value containing no detail on local errors. The 

two sets of observed depths and interpolated depths can be further analyzed using statistical tests to see whether 

the two datasets exhibit significant differences. The type of statistical test needed has to be chosen based on the 

statistical distribution of the depth values (parametric/non‐parametric).

In order to investigate the randomness of the errors in the final product, we explored the statistical and spatial 
distribution of the residuals (ΔD). The statistical distribution of residuals shows the nature of the errors and can 
reveal whether the errors are following a distinct pattern, which is an indication of a systematic error produced by 

the interpolation method. In the same manner, identified patterns in the spatial distribution of the residuals indicate 

the distortion of the shape of a surface in the model. The two parameters which affect the spatial variability of the 

errors are landform type and interpolation method (Carlisle, 2005; Chaplot et al., 2006; Erdoǧan, 2010). The cor‐

relation between these factors and the model residuals can be tested using diagnostic methods such as regression. 

Erdoǧan (2010) used ordinary least squares regression and geographically weighted regression models to inves‐

tigate the spatial relationship between the error/accuracy of three different interpolation algorithms and surface 

characteristics. Having identified a significant relationship between the two factors, he pointed out that studying 

this relationship would help determine the location and distribution of the measurement points, depending on the 

complexity of the topography.

To produce the final product, we selected an RP equal to zero and a PCRP of 0.1 for both lakes. Successively varying 

the grid resolution, we noticed that at a resolution of 500 m the ribs faded away, while the contour lines were still 

smooth. At this resolution, the average density of data points increased to 20.46 (LE) and 24.25 (LA) points over the 

0.5 × 0.5 km unit cell. We then extracted the 1‐m contour lines located inside the smallest observed lake extent, 

inserted them into the ANUDEM algorithm, and modified them during each iteration until the desired 30‐m grid‐

based bathymetry was obtained. Note that this process may not yield a 100% perfect representation of the actual 

lake beds, especially in the center/middle of the lakes, because the results are optimized in terms of minimizing the 

errors. Our stopping criterion was set as “less than 1%” change (i.e. if a change in grid size did not yield more than a 

1% change in computed volume to the next, then we accepted the last grid size and its corresponding contour line 

distribution). The final generated bathymetry maps for both lakes with associated contour lines are presented in 

Figure 7a. Figure 7b also shows 3D views of the lakes.

MOKNATIAN eT Al.852  |    

While the final DBMs have less visible artifacts and also feature a smooth bathymetry, additional comparison 

with the original sounding datasets and also the remotely sensed lake shoreline is necessary to provide a post‐pro‐

cessing accuracy assessment with respect to depth, volume, and lake shape.

4.1 | Depth accuracy

The accuracy was assessed by utilizing ME, MAE, and RMSE indices which are, alongside the maximum negative 

and positive errors, as well as the median value of error, shown in Table 1. The statistical comparison of the two 

datasets (i.e. of the observed depths from survey and RS‐based outlines to corresponding extracted depth values 

from the generated DBMs) yielded non‐significant differences. This comparison showed probability values (p val‐

ues) larger than 0.05 (0.92 [soundings] and 0.87 [outlines] for LE and 0.49 [soundings] and 0.45 [outlines] for LA), 

meaning that the two sets have the same distribution with the same statistical parameters within the confidence 

level of 95% (α = 0.05). Because the distributions of the observed and extracted depth values were not normal, we 

used the statistical non‐parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test to compute p values.

The small values of the indices of ME, MAE, and RMSE for soundings and outlines suggest that the depth val‐

ues are well preserved in the final DBMs. Moreover, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) yielded 16% (LA) 

and 12% (LE) when comparing the overlapping depth values of the final DBM and soundings. The occurrence of 

negative and positive values for maximum error for both lakes, however, suggested meters of difference in some 

places, which needed further investigation regarding the systematic error detection and shape reliability.

While  the  distribution  of  the  residuals  followed  a  normal  distribution,  indicating  the  random  nature  of  the 

errors,  Figure  8  shows  that  the  larger  errors  are  spatially  concentrated  at  specific  locations.  Figure  8a  shows

that the lakes’ edges were the predominant locations for overestimation (green color) and underestimation (red 

color), while for points in the lake interior the errors were much smaller (yellow color) and also more randomly 

distributed. We attribute this to two reasons: first, gentle slope regions (such as in the center) adjust much better 

to the input data; second, the edges had higher data density, were steeper, and also featured two different dataset 

sources with sometimes differing data values. Figure 8b presents an additional view of the magnitude of the errors 

(larger dots mean larger errors), which are clearly more prevalent along the edges, establishing the influence of 

the surface/terrain characteristics on the spatial variability of the residuals, resulting in systematic errors in the 

final bathymetry models.

Considering the fact that small depth values pair with either gentle or steep slopes along the edges, while inte‐

rior points (especially in the bowl regions) have larger depths and smaller slopes, it is clear that the occurrence of 

errors and their signs are associated with the two surface characteristics of depth and slope. To find out how sig‐

nificant this relationship is, we carried out a regression test to evaluate the correlation of each of these parameters 

with actual and absolute error values. The regression analysis showed significant (α = 0.01) effect of surface slope 

values on the actual error (the sign of the errors), while absolute errors (magnitude) were changing significantly 

corresponding to the lake depth, confirming the statements made above.

In  addition  to  slope  and  depth,  we  also  tested  the  characteristics  of  the  survey  soundings,  to  see  if  they 

contributed to the spatial consistency of the errors. These parameters included the density of the survey points, 

contour lines density, and types of input datasets (points/contour lines), none of which showed a statistically sig‐

nificant correlation with either the actual or the absolute errors.

However,  contour  line  density,  in  combination  with  point  density,  gained  statistical  significance  when  cor‐

related with the absolute error, even though it was small (α = 0.1). The errors associated with contour line density 

added up with the errors associated with data point density and became significant when both densities for a 

specific area increased. The spatial distribution of systematic errors in the final model of the lakes resulted in sur‐

faces with a more uniform curvature (i.e. making gentler slope areas steeper and steeper areas gentler), and thus 

contributed to a less favorable adjustment to the high slope and curvature changes along the edge.

4.2 | Volume accuracy

Since lake volume measurement is a key goal of our work, we examined how the quality of the lake bathymetry 

and lake shape would affect the volume. Toward this end, we calculated the volume accuracy along the track line. 

We converted the sonar‐based depth soundings into grid cell depths and then computed the volume difference 

between these grid cells and the overlapping interpolated grid cells from the bathymetry model. While this could 

yield either positive or negative values, note that a zero difference does not mean identical lake shapes and depth, 

but rather that the overestimates and underestimates of the surface/depth cancel each other out (as depicted in 

Figure 9).

−9 and +6%. The average errors were 0.009% (LE) and 0.003% (LA), slightly underestimating the volume values. 

Note that the real/overall volume errors should be a little higher than the presented errors, since the interpolation 

worked better along the track line compared with using the spaces between.

As a final step, we compared the computed volumes of each lake based on the final bathymetry, and compared 

it to the raw and unimproved bathymetry to see how well the designed algorithm for eliminating the errors had 

worked. The result showed a 7.7% (LE) and a 4.2% (LA) difference, with the final product having the higher volume 

values. This means that retaining the “rib” shape features would have caused a significant underestimation of the 

lakes’ water volume and also highlights the need to go through quality control steps that remove these types of 

features to obtain both the true volume and the real shape of the bottom surface.

The final DBMs showed that at the time of the surveys (July 1, 2013), LA had a surface area of 137.84 km2 

(Landsat images with WGS84/UTM zone 19N projection). The lake had an elongated bowl shape with a slope of 

less than 0.5% in the center and on the west shallow edges and up to 10.53% in the southern part of the lake. The 

mean value of the slope was 1.05% with a standard deviation of 1.23%, while the volume value derived from the 
bathymetry was 1.997 km3. LE was characterized by slopes ranging between 0.001 and 6.63% (mean: 0.66%, SD: 
0.8%). The surface area of LE was 345.85 km2 with a corresponding volume of 3.8 km3 derived from the bathym‐

etry model (March 27, 2013). Both lakes have a similar maximum depth value of a little more than 30 m (31.86 m 

[LE], 33.61 m [LA]).

Based on sonar depth data collected during a campaign in 2013, as well as a dataset of lake outline extractions 

from Landsat imagery, we developed DBMs of Lakes Enriquillo and Azuei, using the ANUDEM module. The use of 

the ANUDEM method proved to be a suitable approach for developing accurate DBMs by utilizing the algorithm’s 

ability to permit different types of datasets, such as point clouds and polygons. Analyzing early DBMs created 

with ANUDEM showed how the density and spatial distribution of the input data, and the required DTM resolu‐

tion,  affected  the  result  of  the  interpolation,  resulting  in  the  creation  of  artifacts  along  the  edges  of  the  lakes 

inside no‐data areas. To eliminate the artifacts, we designed an iterative workflow to improve the accuracy of the 

lake DBMs by introducing topographically corrected auxiliary contour lines derived from low‐resolution models. 

These auxiliary contour lines act as “guidelines” during the ANUDEM run, improving the DBM model generation 

when switching to higher‐resolution grids. The algorithm we use is a combination of workflows in ArcGIS Model 

Builder, MATLAB codes, and several manual editing efforts.

We  introduced  statistical  concepts  to  assess  the  quality  of  each  newly  created  DBM  by  comparing  newly 

created DBMs with those created without any improvement steps. The outcome showed MAE of less than 0.5 m 

for both lakes’ depth representations and a 7.7% (LE)/4.2% (LA) improvement in volume estimation by removing 

inward “rib”‐shaped artifacts. We also observed systematic patterns in the spatial error distribution. Regression 

tests showed that the pattern is correlated with the complexity of the topography/curvature along the edges of 

the lakes and the inconsistency between the input data sources. Although it was expected that the high density 

of data would help increase the accuracy of the final model, it was observed that the inconsistency between the 

values of different data sources introduced errors to the DBMs.

Due to the existence of these errors, the final DBMs were more uniformly bowl‐shaped with smoothened cur‐

vature/slope differences. Despite this shape distortion, the accuracy analysis carried out for volume estimation 

MOKNATIAN eT Al.856  |    

resulted in less than 10% absolute errors and less than 0.01% average error for overlapping areas of the model 

and the underlying soundings. Based on these results, we conclude that the precision and accuracy of a DBM can 

be increased if one deploys error minimization techniques in addition to controlling the input data by designing 

the proper density and distribution pattern for track lines. These should be based on the terrain morphology and 

required map resolution, as well as a priori assessment of the different data types, subjecting them to a quality 

assessment procedure before inserting them into the ANUDEM algorithm.

To our knowledge, the developed DBMs for both lakes are the first publication of a digital representation of 

the lakes and can be requested from the authors of this article.

Abstract

In sharp contrast with the global trend in population growth, 

certain  developed  countries  are  expected  to  experience 

rapid national population declines. Considering future land 

use  scenarios  that  include  depopulation  is  necessary  to 

evaluate changes in ecosystem services that affect human 

well‐being  and  to  facilitate  comprehensive  strategies  for 

balancing rural and urban development. In this study, we ap‐

plied  a  population‐projection‐assimilated  predictive  land 

use modeling (PPAP‐LM) approach, in which a spatially ex‐

plicit population projection was incorporated as a predictor 

in a land use model. To analyze the effects of future popula‐

tion distributions on land use, we developed models for five 

land use types and generated projections for two scenarios 

(centralization and decentralization) under a shrinking popu‐

lation  in  Japan  during  2015–2050.  Our  results  suggested 

that population centralization promotes the compaction of 

built‐up areas and the expansion of forest and wastelands, 

while population decentralization contributes to the mainte‐

nance of a mixture of forest and cultivated land.

few  centuries,  and  this  trend  is  expected  to  continue  (Pereira,  Navarro,  &  Martins,  2012).  In  sharp  contrast  to 

the global trend in population growth, certain developed countries are expected to experience rapid population 

declines at the national level (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 

2015). Such historic changes in human population dynamics may affect land use patterns in both rural and urban 

areas, resulting in changes in the functioning of the ecosystem, which is the source of many goods and services 

that contribute to the economy and human welfare (Foley et al., 2005; Lambin & Geist, 2010).

In the last few decades, rural areas have suffered from severe population declines combined with rural‐to‐

urban  migration.  These  patterns  were  stimulated  by  an  economic  shift  from  agriculture  to  industry,  increasing 

job opportunities in the cities. Additionally, the recent expansion of large‐scale modern agriculture has caused 

a concentration of agricultural activities in areas with favorable conditions and the abandonment of unfavorable 

sites  (Aide  &  Grau,  2004;  Mottet,  Ladet,  Coque,  &  Gibon,  2006).  Land  abandonment  is  coupled  with  popula‐

tion declines in marginal agricultural landscapes, especially in mountain areas (Aide & Grau, 2004; Ray Benayas, 

Martins, Nicolau, & Schulz, 2007). Land abandonment may have both negative and positive consequences. It may 

decrease landscape heterogeneity, increase fire frequency, and result in soil erosion, a loss of biodiversity, and 

a loss of cultural and aesthetic value (MacDonald et al., 2000; Ray Benayas et al., 2007). However, abandoned 

land can provide a new opportunity to restore self‐sustaining ecosystems, providing various kinds of ecosystem 

services, if appropriate management for rewilding is conducted (Navarro & Pereira, 2012).

In  urban  areas,  population  decline  can  lead  to  the  hollowing  of  urban  landscapes.  Vacant  landscapes  may 

embody  the  unfavorable  legacies  of  past  uses  and  threaten  the  health,  safety  and  quality  of  life  of  residents 

(Nassauer & Raskin, 2014). Unmanaged vacant lands in urban and peri‐urban landscapes are a source of increas‐

ing mobility costs, energy expenditure, and emissions of CO2 and air pollutants. These areas may potentially be 
reclaimed as green spaces, which supply ecosystem services. For example, green spaces in urban and peri‐urban 

landscapes can reduce disaster risks (Liu, Chen, & Peng, 2014) and mitigate the heat island effect (Davis, Jung, 

Pijanowski, & Minor, 2016; Norton et al., 2015; Stone, Hess, & Frumkin, 2010). In other words, population decline 

may create opportunities for a transition toward more sustainable urban forms. There are two dominant and con‐

tradictory theories about sustainable urban forms: the “compact city” and the “dispersed city” (Geschke, James, 

Bennet, & Nimmo, 2018; Holden & Norland, 2005). The “compact city” is an urban planning concept that promotes 

high  residential  density  and  lowers  the  energy  requirements  for  housing  and  daily  travel  (Ariga  &  Matsuhashi, 

2012, 2013; Holden & Norland, 2005; OECD, 2012). However, such high‐density development may have an in‐

verse relationship with livability (Neuman, 2005). In contrast, a “dispersed city” suggests a relatively open urban 

structure, where buildings, fields, and other green areas form a mosaic‐like pattern. In both cases, the restructur‐

ing of urban forms may affect human well‐being and sustainability under future population declines by enhancing 

different ecosystem services. For example, in compact cities, large green spaces can be set aside, without human 

disturbance, thereby promoting the sequestration of carbon in the soil and contributing to the mitigation of global 

climate change (Collas, Green, Ross, Wastell, & Balmford, 2017). Dispersed cities may enhance the recreational 

use of urban green spaces (Soga et al., 2015), contributing to human health (Shanahan et al., 2016).

Future scenarios of land use change coinciding with depopulation are quite valuable to develop strategies to 

mitigate the negative effects of land abandonment and to exploit the emerging opportunity for land use restruc‐

turing  to  improve  human  well‐being  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas.  Spatially  explicit  population  projection  has 

played an important role in studies of the environment and sustainability (Bengtsson, Shen, & Oki, 2006), and land 

use scenarios under a shrinking population should be consistent with a high‐resolution population projection. A 

population‐projection‐assimilated predictive land use modeling (PPAP‐LM) approach, in which a spatially explicit 

population projection is incorporated as a predictor in land use models, can offer a powerful framework to draw 

future land use scenarios in the context of changing populations. However, previous studies have focused on a re‐

gional scale (Manson, 2006; Thorn et al., 2017), and no studies, to our knowledge, have developed and compared 

national‐scale future land use scenarios associated with population projections (but see Alig, Kline, & Lichtenstein, 

2004, which simulated change in U.S. urban land).

OHASHI et Al.    |  3

Diverse land use change models have been developed to analyze interactions between driving factors and 

land use changes and to predict future land use changes at various scales (Dietzel & Clarke, 2007; Lin, Chu, Wu, 

&  Verburg,  2011;  Verburg  &  Overmars,  2009;  Verburg,  Ritsema  van  Eck,  de  Nijs,  Dijst,  &  Schot,  2004).  Most 

existing land use models use process‐based approaches (Dietzel & Clarke, 2007; Verburg et al., 2004) and have 

been developed for countries with population growth expressed by a simple Markov process (Dietzel & Clarke, 

2007;  Verburg  et  al.,  2004).  Some  have  explicitly  incorporated  the  relationship  between  land  use  and  demo‐

graphic dynamics, especially in countries with population growth (Li et al., 2015; Luo, Xing, Wu, Zhang, & Chen, 

2018). However, population “shrinking” involves more complex processes and is not always explained by a simple 

mechanism (but see Verburg & Overmars, 2009). A machine‐learning approach (Castella, Kam, Quang, Verburg, 

& Hoanh, 2007; Faleiro, Machado, & Loyola, 2013; Li & Yeh, 2002; Verburg et al., 2002) is a powerful alternative 

tool that can be used to develop a national‐scale predictive land use model under depopulation. This approach can 

accommodate complex and spatially heterogeneous relationships between population distributions and land use 

patterns, and models can be selected with high predictive ability (Lin et al., 2011; Verburg et al., 2002). Moreover, 

this approach can be used to identify complex processes from spatial patterns in land use changes under a “shrink‐

ing” population that cannot be expressed by simple mechanisms.

In the 21st century, Japan has become one of the most depopulating countries in the world. Even before the 

detection of these problems at a national scale, Japan experienced a rapid population decline and land abandon‐

ment regionally after the late 1950s to 1960s. In rural areas, traditional agricultural landscapes have been altered 

by  land  abandonment  and  agricultural  intensification,  which  is  a  major  threat  to  biodiversity  (Fukamachi,  Oku, 

&  Nakashizuka,  2001).  Urban  areas  in  Japan  have  experienced  both  sprawl  to  the  suburbs  and  the  hollowing 

of old residential areas. To promote urban renovation to develop compact cities, the Japanese government es‐

tablished the Location Optimization Plan System in 2014, under the Act on Special Measures concerning Urban 

Reconstruction.  As  of  May  1,  2018,  161  municipalities  have  announced  their  own  location  optimization  plans 

(http://www.mlit.go.jp/toshi/city_plan/toshi_city_plan_fr_000051.html). Although a growing number of cities in 

Japan have set the compact city as a city planning goal under population decline, residents do not always respond 

positively to excessive population concentration (Tanaka, Iwamoto, & Nishina, 2014). In such a situation, social 

consensus about the desirable population and land use gradients in rural and urban areas is not established.

In this study, we developed land use change scenarios for 2015–2050 under a shrinking population in Japan 

by applying the PPAP‐LM and evaluated the effect of population distribution on future land use structure. We 

applied the model to two feasible spatially explicit population scenarios: centralization and decentralization (Ariga 

& Matsuhashi, 2012). We compared the consequences of different patterns of population distribution on future 

land use structure. We made the projected high‐resolution land use available online  ( https://doi.org/10.17605/

OSF.IO/A9QVY). It can be used to predict the effect of land use changes on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

PPAP‐LM is a machine‐learning approach used to project a high‐resolution land use change trajectory correspond‐

ing to a population change scenario. It consists of the following three phases: pre‐processing of data, construction 

of land use models, and projection of future scenarios (Figure 1).

2.1 | Study area

The  study  area  was  Japan,  an  archipelago  consisting  of  6,852  islands  with  a  total  land  area  of  377,972  km2 

(Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, 2017). Approximately 66.3% of the land is 

covered by forest, 11.9% is cultivated land, and 5.1% is developed (Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs 

and Communications, 2017). The total population of Japan in 2015 was about 127.01 million. One‐third of the

population resides in and around Tokyo, which is the capital and is situated on the central plain. Greater Tokyo is 

the most populous metropolitan area in the world. Between 2010 and 2015, the population of Japan declined by 

0.96 million, the first such occurrence since the Population Census began in 1920 (Statistics Bureau, Ministry of 

Internal Affairs and Communications, 2017). The population is expected to drop to 86.74 million by 2060 (National 

Institute of Population and Social Security Research in Japan, 2012). Japan is divided into 47 prefectures and has 

a total of 1,741 municipalities.

2.2 | Data description

Data were based on 30″ lat. × 40″ long. ca. 1‐km grids (Tertiary Mesh Units, TMUs: 367,705 units) covering the 

whole Japanese archipelago because most statistical information prepared by Japanese administrative agencies 

are  recorded  at  this  scale.  TMUs  enable  analyses  of  different  statistical  surveys  without  being  constrained  by 

differences in survey area. A summary of explanatory variables, variable names, and data sources used for the 

PPAP‐LM approach is provided in Table 1.

The “Land Utilization Tertiary Mesh Data” in the National Land Numerical Information (National Land Information 

Division,  National  Spatial  Planning  and  Regional  Policy  Bureau,  Ministry  of  Land,  Infrastructure,  Transport  and 

Tourism  of  Japan,  2015)  for  1976,  1987,  1991,  1997,  2006,  2009,  and  2014  were  used  as  longitudinal  land  use 
data. Land cover classifications were based on satellite images compiled in TMUs. Each record included areas (m2) 

of 12 land cover types in a TMU calculated from a 100‐m resolution land use map. Since the definition of some 

land use categories varied among survey years, these classifications were integrated into eight common categories

“Land Utilization Tertiary Mesh Data” in 

National Land Numerical Information for 
1976, 1987, 1991, 1997, 2006, 2009, and 
2014 (National Land Information Division,

comparable among years: paddy field, forest, wasteland, built‐up area, trunk transportation land (including roads 

and railways), waterbody (including beaches), golf courses, other agricultural land (including fields and orchards), 

and other artificial land. Other artificial land was defined as artificial land use, except for agricultural land and built‐

up areas, such as green space in urban areas, athletic fields, open space on factory sites, schools, and port areas.

To apply a PPAP‐LM approach to the land use change model, a set of land use data and population data for the 

same time periods is required. Therefore, longitudinal land use maps with irregular intervals (1976, 1987, 1991, 

1997, 2006, 2009, and 2014) were transformed to maps for the years with available population data (i.e. 1980, 

1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010). Inverse time‐weighted interpolation was applied to time‐series data, 

which is analogous to inverse distance‐weighted interpolation applied to spatial data (Figure 1). The calculation 

process was as follows. Let ȗ(t, s, v) be an interpolated value for land use type v at TMU cell s in year t based on 
observed samples, u (ti,s, v) in year ti (i = 1, 2, … , N) was calculated as follows:

as  defined  by  Shepard  (1968).  A  value  of  p = 2  was  used  as  the  power  parameter  to  avoid  overweighting  the 
nearest sample and to generate a smooth curve of ȗ(t, s, v) around ti. Through this interpolation procedure, the 
weighted average of the areas of the eight land use categories for each grid and each year was obtained.

2.2.2 | Population data at a national scale

Grid‐based  national  population  census  data  for  1980–2010  were  used  (Statistics  Bureau,  Ministry  of  Internal 

Affairs and Communications, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005; National Land Information Division, National Spatial 

Planning  and  Regional  Policy  Bureau,  Ministry  of  Land,  Infrastructure,  Transport  and  Tourism  of  Japan,  2017). 

The census was conducted every 5 years, and the number of residents was aggregated in the TMUs. Additionally, 

population data were aggregated at three distance scales, 1 (original data), 5 and 10 km, and used as explanatory 

variables.  Although  the  total  population  in  Japan  increased  during  this  period,  at  a  local  scale  many  rural  and 

urban areas had already experienced a population decline. A mixture of both population trends in the training 

data captures the characteristics of land use changes under both a shrinking and a growing population. Moreover, 

population changes can have a lagged effect on land use (Veldkamp & Fresco, 1996). Therefore, populations at 

three distance scales in a previous time step were used as explanatory variables.

2.2.3 | Topographical factors

The  land  surface  of  Japan  is  covered  by  mountains,  and  landforms  are  steep  and  rugged.  Plains  cover  only  29% 

of  the  land  surface  and  are  located  along  the  seacoast.  The  population  is  heavily  concentrated  in  these  limited 

flat areas. Therefore, topographical factors are important determinants of the spatial distribution of land use pat‐

terns. Information from the Japan Engineering Geomorphologic Classification Map (Wakamatsu, Kubo, Matsuoka, 

Hasegawa, & Sugiura, 2005) was used to determine geographic and topographical features of each tertiary mesh: av‐

erage elevation (m), average slope increment (tangent θ), relative relief (m), and geomorphological class. The original 

20 geomorphological classes were reclassified into four categories: lowland, diluvial upland, mountain, and volcano.

2.2.4 | Spatial factors

Unmeasured  variables,  such  as  climatic  factors  or  historical  events,  can  result  in  spatial  autocorrelation  in  the 

prediction error (Legendre, 1993). Therefore, spatial variables were included in the models to reveal geographical 

trends in land use to mitigate spatial autocorrelation (Márquez, Real, Olivero, & Estrada, 2011; Nakao et al., 2014). 

The longitude and latitude of each tertiary mesh were included as spatial variables in the models.

2.2.5 | Legacy effect of excessively artificialized land use

Excessively artificialized land use may leave legacies on future land uses, such as infrastructure and contaminants, 

when  areas  become  vacant  (Nassauer  &  Raskin,  2014).  Therefore,  to  express  the  legacy  effect  of  excessively 

artificialized land use, the sum of the built‐up area and other artificial land in the previous time step was included 

as an explanatory variable.

2.3 | Construction of predictive land use models

Classification and Regression Trees [CART] (Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, & Stone, 1984) were used to construct 

predictive land use models for five major land use types: paddy field, forest and wasteland, built‐up area, other 

agricultural land, and other artificial land (Figure 1). This method has been applied in various fields, such as medical 

OHASHI et Al.    |  7

diagnosis, meteorology, plant physiology, soil sciences, and wildlife management, and has recently been used to 

successfully model land use change (Du, Shin, Yuan, & Managi, 2018). CART models have various advantages: they 

are relatively immune to multicollinearity, robust to non‐normal distributions of variables, and capable of deter‐

mining complex interactions among explanatory variables, without specifying them a priori (Breiman et al., 1984). 

Additionally, these analyses are easy to interpret because they provide a hierarchical view of relationships among 

variables, allowing the identification of close correlations (Dea’th & Fabricius, 2000).

The CART model uses binary recursive partitioning, and the resulting models can be represented as binary 

trees. The tree is built by first including all observations together in the root node. Then, each explanatory variable 

is assessed in turn to determine the optimal split that divides observations into left and right descendant nodes. 

The fundamental idea is to select each split in a subset so that the data in each of the descendant subsets are 

“purer” than the data in the parent subset. Purity was calculated based on the Gini index. Optimality is defined as 

the split that results in the maximum reduction in the average impurity of the two (left and right) nodes. Tree con‐

struction continues until the number of cases assigned to each leaf is small or the leaf is sufficiently homogenous. 

However, a maximally grown tree is usually over‐fitted to training data (Therneau & Atkinson, 2018). Therefore, a 

computational step to constrain the tree to its best size is required to avoid the problem of over‐fitting. A common 

approach in tree‐based techniques is to freely allow the maximum growth process and then prune the overgrown 

branches of the tree.

In this study, 90% of the whole dataset was sampled as the training dataset to construct the model, and 10% 

was retained as test data to evaluate the model. Then, the initial tree was built using the training dataset, allowed 

to attain the maximum size, and pruned by 10‐fold cross‐validation. In the cross‐validation process, the training 

dataset was further divided into 10 parts; each subset was removed in turn and used as a test sample for predic‐

tions based on the remaining 90% of the training dataset. The average error rate based on 10 repeated calcula‐

tions was plotted against the tree size to obtain the complexity parameter, and the optimal complexity parameter 

for the tree was chosen as the smallest tree with an error rate within one standard error (SE) of the minimum. By 

using this complexity parameter, the tree with optimal complexity was obtained (Venables & Ripley, 2002).

The  final  model  with  optimal  complexity  was  applied  to  the  test  data.  The  following  four  frequently  used 

measures of model accuracy were evaluated: Pearson's r, mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), 

and root mean squared error (RMSE). Further, to evaluate the effect of “error propagation” by using the prediction 

result of the previous time step as the input for the current time step, a simulation was conducted for 1985–2010 

using the predicted value for the previous time step as the input for the current time step, and the predictions 

were compared with real data.

2.4 | Projection to future scenarios

Two  future  population  distribution  scenarios  were  considered:  a  “centralization”  scenario  and  a  “decentraliza‐

tion”  scenario  (Ariga  &  Matsuhashi,  2012;  Matsuhashi  &  Ariga,  2016).  These  population  scenarios  correspond 

to  the  centralization  and  decentralization  of  a  population  within  a  municipal  unit.  The  total  population  size  in 

each municipal unit was consistent with previous municipal population projections based on the data from the 

Population  Census  of  Japan  and  Vital  Statistics  of  Japan  (National  Institute  of  Population  and  Social  Security 

Research in Japan, 2008). Projections of population size are provided in each TMU every 5 years from 2015 to 

2050. The scenario was constructed by applying the following procedures recursively for every 5‐year period: (1) 

the population size in each TMU was projected using the cohort change ratio method; and (2) the population size 

was corrected with reference to a previous municipal‐level population projection. For each scenario, different sets 

of cohort change rates over multiple initial population size classes were applied to ensure the concentration and 

dispersion of the population distribution. The cohort change rates were determined with reference to observed 

values between 2000 and 2005 in centralized and decentralized municipal units (i.e. municipal units with increas‐

ing and decreasing intra‐municipal population size heterogeneity, respectively). Population size corrections were 

OHASHI et Al.8  |    

performed by multiplying a factor by the population size projected in each TMU using the cohort change ratio 

method to maintain consistency with previous municipal‐level population projections from the Population Census 

of  Japan  and  Vital  Statistics  of  Japan  (National  Institute  of  Population  and  Social  Security  Research  in  Japan, 

2008). Technical details of constructing population scenarios were presented in Ariga and Matsuhashi (2012). The 

datasets are available in the Kankyō Tenbōdai section of the National Institute for Environmental Studies website 

( http://tenbou.nies.go.jp/). Our land use–population model was projected using these two population scenarios, 

and the projections were compared among land use models.

2.5 | Example for two municipalities with different socioeconomic environments

Two municipalities were selected as examples: Toyota city and Joetsu city. Although both of these municipalities 

are aiming to become compact cities, they differ in socioeconomic conditions. Toyota city is located in the center 

of Aichi Prefecture in central Honshu. While this city is known as the “Motor City” of Japan, because it is a world 

leader in the automotive industry, it has rich forests that account for about 70% of the city's total area. The popu‐

lation of Toyota city in 2015 was 422,542. According to the latest population projection, the population in 2045 

will be 399,672—a 30‐year decline of 5.4%.

Joetsu  city  is  located  in  the  southwestern  part  of  Niigata  Prefecture  in  northwestern  Honshu.  Niigata 

Prefecture is famous for the Koshihikari variety of rice, and rice farming thrives in Joetsu city. However, the city 

is now facing a rapid population decline. The total population of Joetsu city in 2015 was 196,987 and is projected 

to decline to 143,032 in 2045—a 30‐year decline of 27.4%.

3.1 | Accuracy of the model

The accuracy of our model differed according to land use type. The model predicted the proportions of five land 

use types in test data with a high degree of accuracy (Table 2). Models for built‐up areas, forests and wastelands, 

paddy fields, and other agricultural lands showed relatively high accuracies (Pearson's r > 0.80, Table 2). However, 

the accuracy values for other artificial lands were relatively low (Pearson's r = 0.793, Table 2). The result was ro‐

bust to changes in the proportion of training data (Table S1). The simulation for 1985–2010 using predicted values 

from the previous time step as inputs for the current time step also showed high accuracy (Table S2), although the 

error was higher compared with that of the result using real data.

upland areas (Figure S1). The importance of variables was then, in decreasing order, population, spatial factors, 

and legacy effects (Figure 2). The proportion of paddy field increased slightly as the population in the surround‐

ing area increased and decreased as the proportion of excessively artificialized land use in the previous time step 

increased (Figure S1).

Similarly, the proportion of other agricultural land was most strongly determined by topographical factors in 

total. Among topographical factors, other agricultural land was affected by slope, and occupied a larger propor‐

tion of land in areas with a lower slope. Both paddy fields and other fields increased slightly as the population in 

the surrounding area increased and decreased as the proportion of excessively artificialized land use in the previ‐

ous time steps increased (Figure S1). The proportion of other agricultural land increased slightly as the population 

in  the  surrounding  area  increased  and  decreased  as  the  proportion  of  excessively  artificialized  land  use  in  the 

previous 5 years increased (Figure S1).

Additionally, the proportion of forest was mostly determined by topographic factors, followed by population, 

historical, and spatial factors (Figure 2). The proportion of forest was high in mountain and volcano areas. The 

proportion of forest decreased as the population increased and as the proportion of excessively artificialized land 

use in the previous 5 years increased (Figure S1).

The proportion of wastelands was determined by both spatial and topographical factors, followed by popula‐

tion and historical factors (Figure S1). The proportion of wastelands was large at high latitudes, in low‐lying areas, 

and in high‐elevation areas.

The proportions of built‐up area and other artificial land were most strongly determined by population, fol‐

lowed by legacy effects (Figure 2). Topographical and spatial factors had almost no effect on these two land use 

types (Figure 2). Built‐up area increased as population increased and also increased as the proportion of exces‐

sively artificialized land use in the previous 5 years increased. The proportion of other artificial land decreased 

as the population increased but increased as the proportion of excessively artificialized land use in the previous 

5 years increased (Figure S1).

3.3 | Future projection of land use change

We  projected  our  model  results  using  two  different  scenarios  for  the  population  distribution:  a  centralization 

scenario and a decentralization scenario. Paddy field and other agricultural land were predicted to decrease over 

time until 2050. Both land use types decreased to a greater degree in the centralization scenario than in the de‐

centralization scenario (Figures 3a and d). In the centralization scenario, the total area of paddy field decreased 

by 23.5% and other agricultural land decreased by 17.1% in 2050 compared to the observed total area in 2010

value; closed circle, predicted value in the centralization scenario; and open triangle, predicted value in the

(Figures 3a and d). In the decentralization scenario, the total area of paddy field decreased by 15.0% and other ag‐

ricultural land decreased by 11.9% in 2050 compared to the observed total area in 2010 (Figures 3a and d). Forest 

and wasteland were predicted to increase until 2020 in both scenarios and then to diverge between the scenarios 

(Figure 3b). The total area of forest and wasteland increased in the centralization scenarios and was 1.4% higher in 

2050 compared to 2010. However, in the decentralization scenario, the total area of forest and wasteland started 

to decrease after 2020 and decreased by 0.2% in 2050 compared to 2010 (Figure 3b). Total built‐up area increased 

until 2025 in both scenarios. Therefore, it decreased in the centralization scenario but continued to increase until 

2030  in  the  decentralization  scenario.  The  centralization  scenario  showed  a  greater  decrease  (Figure  3c).  The 

total built‐up area decreased by 6.0% in 2050 compared to the observed total area in 2010 in the centralization 

scenario and decreased by 4.4% in 2050 in the decentralization scenario (Figure 3c). Other artificial land increased 

until 2010 and continued to increase over time in both scenarios. The increase was greater in the centralization 

scenario than in the decentralization scenario (Figure 3e). The total built‐up area increased by 192.1% in 2050 

compared to the observed total area in 2010 in the centralization scenario and increased by 185.6% in 2050 in the 

decentralization scenario (Figure 3e).

When we evaluate the change in land use at a more local scale, we can see the difference in the spatial dis‐

tribution of each land use type between the two population scenarios. In Toyota city, where the total population 

is  predicted  to  remain  constant,  built‐up  area  expanded,  especially  in  the  decentralization  scenario  (Figure  4). 

Simultaneously,  the  proportion  of  paddy  fields  surrounding  the  densely  inhabited  district  declined.  Forest  and 

wasteland decreased at the grid cell scale in which built‐up area expanded. These trends were also obvious in 

the decentralization scenario. In Joetsu city, however, paddy fields decreased not only in the area surrounding 

the densely inhabited district, but also in the area dominated by forests, especially in the centralization scenario 

(Figure 5). In these areas, forest and wasteland expanded in the centralization scenario, while land use types re‐

lated to human activity (such as paddy fields, other agricultural land, and built‐up area) remained steady (or even 

increased) in the decentralized scenario.

In this study, we applied a machine‐learning method to construct a predictive land use model and applied it to two 

distinct scenarios for future spatially explicit population projections: centralization and decentralization scenarios. 

Our model successfully predicted land use changes in 1985–2010 in Japan with high performance (Table 2), indi‐

cating the effectiveness of the machine‐learning method for predicting land use change. Land use models usually 

combine remote sensing data, socioeconomic data, and other parameters to obtain high accuracy (e.g. Li et al., 

2015). However, our PPAP‐LM approach enabled us to obtain high accuracy with comparatively simple variables. 

This might be attributable to the use of the CART model based on if–then rules, which can capture qualitative as‐

pects of human knowledge and reasoning processes underlying decisions contributing to land use change (Sadok 

et al., 2009).

The total areas of paddy field and other agricultural land were predicted to decrease over time, especially in 

the centralization scenario (Figures 3a and d). In Japan, ownership transfer of agricultural land is restricted by the 

Agricultural Land Act, and efforts aimed at the relocation and accumulation of agricultural land are insufficient, 

although the area of agricultural land per farmer is small. Therefore, if a farmer leaves and becomes an absentee 

landowner, their lands tend to become abandoned (Kubo, 2011; Suginaka, 2005). These specific problems in the 

Japanese land system may promote land abandonment at a large scale, especially in rural areas. In these areas, 

promoting further migration from rural to urban areas (the centralization scenario) may cause a rapid decrease in 

land use related to agricultural activities in rural areas. Conversely, promoting backward migration from urban to 

rural areas (the decentralization scenario) may prevent the decline in land use related to agricultural activities in 

rural areas.

F I G U R E 4 (Continued)

While  forest  and  wasteland  increased  in  areas  with  a  low  proportion  of  excessively  artificialized  land  (like 

typical rural landscapes), other artificial land increased in areas with a high proportion of excessively artificialized 

land  (like  typical  urban  landscapes).  These  asymmetric  changes  suggest  a  “legacy”  effect  of  artificial  land  use 

under a population decline, as expressed by the effect of the proportion of excessively artificialized land use in 

the previous 5 years in our model. The proportions of paddy fields, forest and wasteland, and other agricultural 

land were negatively correlated with this variable, while the proportions of built‐up area and other artificial land 

showed positive correlations (Figure S1). Generally, agricultural land and forest in urban fringes are exposed to se‐

vere development pressure and tend to be converted into non‐agricultural land use (Nakahara & Hoshino, 2006). 

Previously (during population growth periods), built‐up area increased as the population increased in urban areas, 

and this increment was associated with a decrease in other land use types in surrounding areas. When the pop‐

ulation starts to decrease, a “legacy” effect of previous artificial land use may remain; “rewilding” may not occur 

naturally in areas that experienced intense artificial modification.

Although the total population was the same in the two scenarios, the total built‐up area became smaller in the 

centralization scenario than in the decentralization scenario (Figure 3c). This result may reflect the efficient use of 

built‐up area by a concentrated population in the centralization scenario, which supports the longstanding compact 

city theory (Holden & Norland, 2005). Therefore, the centralization scenario may be more effective for the preven‐

tion of the loss of agricultural land and forest due to sprawl in the fringe regions of urban areas, such as Toyota city

(Figures 4a–c) (Doygun, 2009; Yeh & Li, 1999). On the other hand, in agricultural areas, such as Joetsu city, central‐

ization may also accelerate the abandonment of agricultural land (Figures 5a, b, and d). In this situation, promoting 

the expansion of agricultural land per farmer might be necessary to maintain agricultural productivity and ensure 

future food security.

Our model did not consider the effects of future economic and climatic changes. Incorporating our land use 

model with a top‐down approach that accounts for economic change (e.g. Hasegawa, Fujimori, Ito, Takahashi, & 

Masui, 2017) may be useful for forecasting land use change under a shrinking population in the future.

Previous studies related to population distribution have focused on social aspects, such as the cost of public trans‐

portation or the amount of CO2 emissions. In this study, we examined an additional aspect of the effect of popula‐
tion distribution: effects on land use change. Our results illustrated that the spatial distribution of a population 

may affect various land use types, not limited to urban areas. During a population decline, the proportions of each 

land use type showed complex responses according to the “legacy” of excessively artificialized land. Population

centralization may improve the expansion of forest areas and enhance carbon storage, while population decen‐

land use. Our results can be used to analyze the effect of future population distributions via land use changes, 

such as effects on wildlife or ecosystem services. Further studies are required to reveal the effects of changes in 

population distribution via land use change, which can provide a basis for comprehensive planning to balance rural

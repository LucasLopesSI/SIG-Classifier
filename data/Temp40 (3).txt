AND SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY
AND APPLICATIONS WORKSHOP

Roger Shreenan
CIG Ottawa Branch Executive

Unmanned  Systems  Canada  took  the
podium.  Stewart  gave  an  overview  of 
the  current  state  of  Unmanned  Aerial
Systems in Canada.

After  a  quick  coffee  break,  Jean-
François  Dionne  gave  an  excellent 
case  study  on  survey  grade  RTK 
mapping  which  utilizes  a  UAV.  Jean-
François  is  a  UAS/UAV  Technical
Survey  Specialist  with  UKKO  (a  divi-
sion of Ag Business and Crop Inc.). We 
then had a second case study presenta-
tion  on  high-resolution  ortho-rectified
aerial  imagery  and  digital  surface 
models  by  Dominique  Chabot  from
ING Robotic Aviation.

During  a  catered  lunch,  Mark
Wuennenberg  from  Flight  Standards
Transport  Canada  presented.  Mark 

discussed  Canadian  regulatory  require-
ments for operating UAVs, which was a
topic  of  interest  to  all  participants  in 
the  room.  After  a  quick  break  and
chance to mingle with colleagues, Brad
Schmidt  from  Intergraph  Canada  took
the  podium.  Brad  presented  on  a  very
interesting application using Unmanned
Aerial  Systems  for  local  area  mapping
and  volumetric  measurements.  Brad
also demonstrated the workflow to take
raw observables to a final product.

Brian  Eggleston  of  Brican  Flight
Systems then presented on the evolution
of  the  TD100  UAS  and  its  payloads.
Brian  was  also  kind  enough  to  bring 
a  UAV  (TD100)  and  it  was  on  display 
for  the  day  in  the  main  lobby  of  the
museum.  Following  Brian,  Bob  Fligg
from  the  Surveyor  General  Branch  of
Natural  Resources  Canada  gave  a  pre-
sentation on a UAV pilot project at the
Rouge National Urban Park of Canada.
Finally,  to  close  the  workshop,  Claire
Samson presented. Claire is a Professor
of  Geophysics  in  the  Department  of
Earth  Sciences  at  Carleton  University.
She  presented  on  UAV  applications  in
Earth Sciences.

Without a doubt the entire day was
a  huge  success  and  the  organizers  and
presenters  should  be  commended.  The
branch  is  already  discussing  the  next
workshop which will surely interest many
of you. Please connect with the branch

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),
also  referred  to  as  Unmanned  Aerial
Systems,  are  quickly  becoming  a  tool 
of  choice  for  aerial  mapping 
in 
Canada  and  around  the  world. Advan-
tages  for  UAVs  for  aerial  mapping
include:

•
•

•
•

Lower costs of acquisition
Ability  to  enter  environments  that
are dangerous to human life
Capacity to carry various payloads
Lower mobilizations costs

On  May  26,  2015  the  Ottawa
Branch  of  the  Canadian  Institute  of
Geomatics held a one-day workshop on
Unmanned Aerial  Vehicles.  The  work-
shop was held in Ottawa at the Canada
Aviation  and  Space  Museum.  The 
popularity  of  the  topic  was  evident 
by  the  sold  out  event  and  substantial
waiting list.

The  focus  of  the  workshop  was  to
bring  presenters  and  participants  from
government,  academia  and  the  private
sector  together  to  discuss  relevant 
topics  of  interest  to  the  group.  After  a
mingling  session  with  morning  coffee,
the  first  speaker  Jeremy  Laliberté  took
the  podium.  Jeremy  gave  an  excep-
tional  presentation  on  the  history  of
UAVs  and  set  the  stage  perfectly  for 
following presentations. Jeremy is Assis-
tant  Professor  in  the  Department  of
Mechanical  and  Aerospace  Engineer-
ing  at  Carleton  University.  Following
Jeremy,  Stewart  Baillie,  Chairman  of

246 GEOMATICA                                                                                       dx.doi.org/10.5623/cig2015-215

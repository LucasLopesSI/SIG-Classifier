(Received 20 September 2006; in final form 12 December 2006 )

The Digital Elevation Model that has been derived from the February 2000
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) has been one of the most important
publicly available new spatial data sets in recent years. However, the ‘finished’
grade version of the data (also referred to as Version 2) still contains data voids
(some 836,000 km2)—and other anomalies—that prevent immediate use in many
applications. These voids can be filled using a range of interpolation algorithms
in conjunction with other sources of elevation data, but there is little guidance on
the most appropriate void-filling method. This paper describes: (i) a method to
fill voids using a variety of interpolators, (ii) a method to determine the most
appropriate void-filling algorithms using a classification of the voids based on
their size and a typology of their surrounding terrain; and (iii) the classification of
the most appropriate algorithm for each of the 3,339,913 voids in the SRTM
data. Based on a sample of 1304 artificial but realistic voids across six terrain
types and eight void size classes, we found that the choice of void-filling
algorithm is dependent on both the size and terrain type of the void. Contrary to
some previous findings, the best methods can be generalised as: kriging or inverse
distance weighting interpolation for small and medium size voids in relatively flat
low-lying areas; spline interpolation for small and medium-sized voids in high-
altitude and dissected terrain; triangular irregular network or inverse distance
weighting interpolation for large voids in very flat areas, and an advanced spline
method (ANUDEM) for large voids in other terrains.

Introduction

A Digital Elevation Model (DEM, or more correctly a Land Surface Model, LSM)
is one of the most useful sources of information for spatial modelling and
monitoring, with applications as diverse as: Environment and Earth Science, e.g.
catchment dynamics and the prediction of soil properties; Engineering, e.g. highway

construction and wind turbine location optimisation; Military, e.g. land surface
visualisation, and; Entertainment, e.g. landscape simulation in computer games
(Pike et al. 2007). The extraction of land surface parameters—whether they are
based on ‘bare earth’ models such as DEMs derived from contour lines and spot
heights, or ‘surface cover’ models derived from remote sensing sources that include
tree-top canopies and buildings, for example—is becoming more common and more
attractive due to the increasing availability of high-quality and high-resolution
DEM data (Gamache 2004). One of the most widely used DEM data sources is the
elevation information provided by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)
(Coltelli et al. 1996, Farr and Kobrick 2000, Gamache 2004), but as with most other
DEM sources, the SRTM data requires significant levels of pre-processing to ensure
that there are no spurious artifacts in the data that would cause problems in later
analysis such as pits, spikes and patches of no data (Chaplot et al. 2006, Dowding
et al. 2004, Fisher and Tate 2006, Gamache 2004). In the case of the SRTM data,
these patches of no data are pervasive (USGS 2006a) and must be filled or
interpolated, preferably with auxiliary sources of DEM data. This paper describes a
procedure to determine the most appropriate interpolation methods (with and
without auxiliary DEM data) for no data patches of different sizes and in different
terrain types. The rationale for this paper stems from a statement by Fisher and Tate
(2006) that no single interpolation method exists for the most accurate interpolation
of terrain data. Such a procedure is necessary for developing a high-quality global
DEM derived from the SRTM data where all no-data areas have been filled using
the best-performing interpolation algorithm available.

1.1 The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)

The 11-day Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) flew in February 2000, and
has provided publicly available elevation surface data for approximately 80% of the
world’s land surface area (from 60uN to 56uS), with a post spacing of 1 arc seconds
(often quoted as 30 m resolution) in the USA, and a degraded 3 arc second (often
quoted as 90 m resolution) product for the rest of the world. It is a snapshot of the
reflective surface of the Earth during the time period of the mission, and is about
100 times more detailed than other existing freely available global elevation data,
such as GTOPO30 (USGS 1996) and GLOBE (Hastings and Dunbar 1998). The
SRTM elevation data is derived from X-band and C-band Interferometric Synthetic
Aperture Radar (InSAR) (USGS 2006a, Werner 2001). This paper deals with the
better known and widely available C-band product, which we will refer to as SRTM
elevation data. As with all DEMs derived from remote sensing sources, the SRTM
elevation data include trees, buildings and other objects on the Earth’s surface and
therefore the data set is a surface elevation model (Rodriguez et al. 2005, 2006).

Several products have been derived from the SRTM data. First, the raw data was
processed by a suite of programs at JPL (Farr and Kobrick 2000), and was made
available primarily for research purposes. This was termed ‘unfinished’ data.
Further processing generated DEMs in full DTED compliance level, and these were
termed ‘finished’ data (Slater et al. 2006). For both data sets, elevations outside the
USA are degraded either by (i) averaging or (ii) by thinning (i.e. taking one sample
out of the nine available posts). The horizontal datum of the SRTM data is WGS84,
whilst the vertical datum is EGM96 which has implications for certain applications.
The C-band product has significant areas of missing data due to the nature of
radar data and the interferometric process used to create the DEM (figure 1). The

and desert areas and the northern extent of the SRTM data (60uN).

reasons for the missing data are geometric artifacts, specular reflection of water,
phase unwrapping artifacts and voids due to complex dielectric constant (see
Kervyn 2001 for further information). For example, the InSAR instrument used to
generate the SRTM elevation data had an incidence angle of between 30u and 60u,
making it difficult to generate images for terrain slopes corresponding to that range
of angles (Eineder 2005, Gamache 2004).

For the purpose of this paper, we define any areas of missing data that exist in the
SRTM data as voids. The number of remaining voids with different sizes in the
SRTM data are a considerable problem for many uses and applications, including
hydrological modelling, terrain indices, land surface characterisation, digital soil
mapping and many other geomorphometric models, and thus these voids need to be
filled to create a seamless DEM (MacMillan et al. 2000).

The ‘finished’ version of the SRTM data (described more fully in section 2.1)
provided by USGS (United States Geological Survey) and NASA (National
Aeronautics and Space Administration) still contains 3,399,913 voids accounting for
803,166 km2 (an area comparable to Pakistan or somewhat larger than Texas), and
in extreme cases, such as Nepal, they constitute 9.6% of the country area with some
32,688 voids totalling an area of 13,740 km2. Figure 1 shows the proportion of each
161 degree SRTM tile that is composed of void areas. Figure 2 shows two extreme
examples of regions where there are many voids, Libya (upper) and Nepal (lower).
Of the 210 countries covered by the SRTM data, two countries have void areas
larger than 10% of their country size, nine countries more than 5% and 14 more than
2%. In total, 44 countries have 1% or more of their area covered by voids. The void
size/frequency distribution of all voids in the SRTM data set is shown in figure 3.
Voids occur for different reasons in different terrain types: a void due to
shadowing will more likely occur in mountainous areas, whereas a void due to
complex dielectric constant is more likely to occur in desert areas like the Sahara.
Void frequency with respect to elevation has been demonstrated to have a bimodal
distribution with peaks of the distribution occurring in flat areas and in steeply

sloping areas (Falorni et al. 2005, Gamache 2004). This distribution is clearly seen in
figure 1.

Since this study focuses on methods of void-filling the SRTM elevation data, we
will not discuss the accuracy or the errors in the SRTM data, though it is worth
mentioning that the sensor error is stated to be ¡16 m (USGS, 2006a). Further
details on SRTM accuracy are available in the literature (Falorni et al. 2005,
Gamache 2004, Rabus et al. 2003, Toutin 2002).

data set (n53,339,913).

Fisher and Tate (2006) provide a thorough review of the causes and consequences
of error in DEMs. They classify errors into three different groups: (i) gross errors
(e.g. system malfunctions), (ii) systematic errors, which might be described by a
functional relationship (Thapa and Bossler 1992, p. 836 in Fisher and Tate 2006),
and (iii) random errors with/without spatial dependence that arise for different
reasons. Voids are one type of systematic error, which can be overcome with specific
algorithms.

1.2 Void-filling methods

Interpolation methods are widely used in the generation of DEMs. However, void
filling (VF) methods contain a special subset of interpolation algorithms with certain
restrictions, and also other methods such as the fill and feather approach (Dowding
et al. 2004). All interpolation algorithms for void filling DEMs use the elevation
data surrounding the void in the interpolation process. If auxiliary sources of
elevation (for example, ASTER DEMs, GTOPO30, digitised topographic maps and
land survey measurements) are available, then some of these algorithms can
incorporate this information to improve the accuracy of the interpolation. However,
there are often severe differences between the DEM and the auxiliary data that need
to be addressed before the void-filling algorithms can use auxiliary data. These
differences can occur in: (i) the spatial resolution, (ii) the vertical datum, (iii)
horizontal and vertical shifts, (iv) first- or second-order trends, (v) production
errors, (vi) the type of surface model (SRTM is a surface model, whereas a DEM
based on topographic data is a bare earth model); and, (vii) the spatial distribution
of errors (see for example Fisher and Tate 2006, Hutchinson 1989, Ka¨ a¨ b 2005).

H. I. Reuter et al.

VF algorithms can be categorised into surface- (Katzil and Doytsher 2000),
volumetric- (Vedera et al. 2003) or example-based methods (Sharf et al. 2004).
Alternatively, Katzil and Doytsher (2000) divide the algorithms into polynomials
(such as linear estimation, 1D and 2D polynomials of the third-order, cubic splines,
or iterative spline algorithms) and non polynomial approaches (such as kriging,
inverse distance weighting, fill and feather approaches or moving average).

Several authors have evaluated the quality of different algorithms to fill in voids
for radar data as well as other DEM sources. Katzil and Doytsher (2000) tested
linear estimation, kriging and cubic spline for elevation, but the evaluation was not
performed on real voids. Instead a method called cross-validation was applied
(removing one point and then comparing the elevation of the generated surface
against the elevation of the point), which showed no significant differences between
methods. Dowding et al. (2004) used a fill and feather (FF) approach (i.e. they used
an auxiliary elevation data set to patch the void area, and then smoothed the
transition zone between both data sets) to incorporate auxiliary information into a
VF algorithm. They selected seven voids with sizes ranging from 36 to 2541 pixels
and then compared the results both visually and against a reference DEM and
ground control points. The results showed differences between 0 m and 22 m for the
area of seven different voids against a reference DEM. Kuuskivi et al. (2005) used
seven real-world voids across different terrain types to evaluate the performance of a
commercial fill and feather algorithm that used high-quality auxiliary DEM data
against three freeware programmes: 3DEM (Visualization Software LLC, 2004);
VTBuilder (Virtual Terrain Project, 2004); and BLACKART (TerrainMap.com,
2004). The study clearly demonstrated the large differences in results that can occur
when using different VF algorithms and the potential improvements that can be
achieved with good quality auxiliary information. Grohman et al. (2006) presented a
geostatistical algorithm (Inverse Distance Weighting, IDW) together with a linear
adjustment of the elevation height called Delta Surface Fill (DSF) and compared it
against a FF approach using five artificially created voids in void-prone terrain
types from the SRTM data. The authors concluded that the performance of the
DSF algorithm produced better results based on visual interpretation and reduced
the standard deviation of the error surface.

Several other studies have presented algorithms that are capable of filling void
areas, but did not provide statistical results. For example, Hofer et al. (2006) tested
an advanced cubic spline method which keeps certain error bounds on nine voids
and evaluated the void filling results graphically. Almansa et al. (2006) evaluated
four different artificial voids at different locations by comparing three different
methods. Another example is Ka¨ a¨ b (2005) whereby a simple replacement of SRTM
by ASTER data was made without any further evaluation.

There are several observations that can be drawn from these studies. First, each
study typically compares three or four algorithms at most, whereas a GIS may
contain many more suitable algorithms (e.g. IDW, kriging, ANUDEM, spline, and
trend estimation). Second, some of the studies contain algorithms that are not easily
reproducible within a GIS or image analysis system because their description is too
vague or due to commercial interests. We argue that if an improved global DEM is
to be produced from the SRTM data, then the VF algorithms should be accessible
and repeatable. Third, the studies presented results based on a handful of voids
which may not be representative of the 3,339,913 voids in the SRTM data, and are
not sufficient for robust statistical analysis. A much larger sample of real-world

voids is required before we can suggest one algorithm over another with any degree
of confidence. Fourth, occasionally these voids were artificial and hence may not be
representative of real-world voids. We realise that unless a high-quality auxiliary
DEM is available, then it is impossible to assess the veracity of the results from void-
filling as there is no ground truth data. However, it is possible to create artificial
voids that are representative of real voids in terms of size, shape and terrain
location. Fifth, terrain can have a large influence on VF results. Katzil and Doytsher
(2000) acknowledged that terrain has an influence on the void-filling process;
however, they could not suggest a recommended method across three terrain types
(mountains, hilly and planar). Grohman et al. (2006) recognised the relief type for
their five voids, which lead to decreasing average standard deviation from rugged to
moderate to flat terrain. Again, the sample of voids should be sufficiently large
across a range of terrain types in order to assess the influence of terrain ruggedness
on algorithm choice and performance. Finally, void size is critical. It is much harder
to accurately fill a large void than a small one. Grohman et al. (2006) recognised the
importance of void size, but did not provide further insight. Again, the sample of
voids should include sufficient numbers of voids of sizes that are representative of
voids found in each terrain type.

In conclusion, there has been no thorough evaluation of the many (GIS-ready)
VF algorithms for DEM data using a sufficient number of voids of varying size
across different terrain types in order to determine the most appropriate VF
method(s).

1.3 Research objectives

The objectives of this study are to: (i) describe void characteristics in terms of size
and terrain unit; (ii) determine which VF algorithm performs best without any
auxiliary information on an exhaustive data set, with respect to terrain unit and void
size; (iii) determine if low-grade auxiliary information can improve the VF algorithm
performance; (iv) determine which VF algorithm performs best with respect to
terrain unit and void size using auxiliary information, and; (v) provide a global void
data set stating the best VF algorithm that should be used based on the results from
(ii) and (iv).

2. Study area and data

As shown in figure 1, data voids occur in all regions of the SRTM data, but after
consideration of the spatial distribution of voids and terrain units and computa-
tional limitations we limited our sample of voids to Africa, an area of approximately
29,800,000 km2 and containing 1,168,136 voids. This provided a sufficient number
of voids across a wide range of sizes and terrain units from which to perform the
sampling.

2.1 SRTM data preparation

SRTM data are available in different formats from different distributors (a
testament to its usefulness and popularity), and here we use the ‘finished’ 3-arc
second averaged SRTM data set that is available from the USGS EROS data server
(USGS 2006b). The pre-processing and editing of this data is described in USGS
(2006b), but the essential details are that spikes and pits in the data with
surrounding elevation differences greater than 100 m were removed, voids smaller

than 16 pixels were filled with a nearest-neighbour interpolation while larger voids
were left as were, and water bodies and coastlines were depicted as described in
USGS (2006c). The data are available in 161 degree tiles in 16-bit integer BIL
format. 3250 tiles were downloaded from ftp://e0srp01u.ecs.nasa.gov/srtm/version2/
SRTM3/Africa and were converted to ESRI2 grid format and mosaiced together in
ArcGIS 9.1# to create a continental DEM for Africa with extents 39uN–35uS and
30uW–60uE. Since these data have been edited for small voids, coastlines and water
bodies, we assume than any remaining land area which contains no elevation
information is a void.

For each of the 1,168,136 voids we stratified the voids based on the natural
logarithm of the number of void pixels and grouped them into eight size classes with
the following number of pixels (numbers in parentheses are minimum, average and
maximum) per class; [A] (1,10,25), [B] (26,50,80), [C] (81,120,140), [D] (141,240,400),

2.2 Auxiliary DEM data

As stated in section 1.2, some VF methods incorporate auxiliary DEM information
in order to improve the accuracy of the results. In this study we used the SRTM30
(Gamache 2004, USGS 2006d) and GTOPO30 DEMs (see sections 1.1 and 2.1 for
more details on these two data sets), as these are the only DEM data sets available
for all of Africa. These were stored in ESRITM grid format.

2.3 Terrain typology

The terrain typology is based on the SRTM30 data. A half-degree resolution, 15-
class terrain typology was derived from this DEM based on a combination of the
average SRTM30 elevation within each half-degree pixel and the relief roughness of
the SRTM30 data within the pixel, defined as the range of SRTM30 elevation values
in the pixel divided by half the pixel length connecting the centre of each grid pixel
(Meybeck et al. 2001). For simplification, we aggregated these 15 classes into six
major terrain units (TU), which have similar land surface characteristics. The relief
classes (1) plains, (2) mid-altitude plains and (3) high-altitude plains were grouped
into PLAINS; (4) lowlands, (6) platforms, (7) low plateaus, and (8) mid-altitude
plateaus were grouped into PLATEAUS; (9) high plateaus and (10) very high
plateaus were grouped into HIGH PLATEAUS; (5) rugged lowlands and (11) hills
were grouped into HILLS, (12) low mountains, (13) mid-altitude mountains were
grouped into MOUNTAINS; and (14) high mountains, and (15) very high
mountains were grouped into HIGH MOUNTAINS. Figure 4 shows the original
15 terrain classes for Africa and their grouping into six major terrain units.

These terrain units differ in size across Africa. Void size is also significantly
different between TU. Therefore we used void size as an additional stratification
factor, which allowed us to assess differences between TU (figure 5). The highest
percentage of void area per total TU area is reached in PLAINS, which can be
attributed to the dunes in desert areas, followed by voids in HIGH MOUNTAINS.
The PLAINS cover between 30% and 50% of all large void areas (void size groups G
and H), and about 20% for all other size classes. HIGH MOUNTAINS on the other
hand an increases from 20% to 30% over all size classes (except the H size class). A
decreasing percentage of voids can be observed for PLATEAUS, MOUNTAINS
and HILLS with increasing void size, whereas the HIGH PLATEAUS show a
strong increase in percentage of voids with increasing size class (figure 5).

2.4 Void selection

The voids were sampled using the following procedure. We first identified the terrain
unit of each of the 1,168,136 voids. For the few occasions where a void lay in the
boundary between two terrain units, it was assigned to the terrain unit in which the
greater area of the void lay. No TU was assigned in the very few cases where a void
was evenly distributed over two or more terrain units. In the cases where the half-
degree resolution TU map did not extend over coastal voids the closest TU pixel
(almost always PLAINS) was assigned to the void. Second, the previously discussed
size class was assigned to each void. The distribution of all the voids by terrain unit

and size class is shown in table 1. The distribution by terrain units agrees with the
findings of Falorni et al. (2005), but we have found no corresponding study for the
distribution of void sizes and void size by terrain unit.

Within each terrain unit we randomly selected 15 voids based on their size
distribution (i.e. we selected more small voids than large ones in a given terrain unit
if small voids occurred more frequently). We then duplicated each of these voids a
number of times, again in relation to their size distribution, and manually relocated
them to neighbouring locations within the same terrain unit, ensuring that the void
was relocated to a similar landscape and that it did not overlap with existing voids.
For example, a small void (size class A) in terrain unit PLAIN would be duplicated
15 times and moved to 15 neighbouring locations in terrain unit PLAIN to create 15
voids for analysis. Duplication of real void areas ensures that the shape, size and

*The total number of voids in this table does not sum to 3,399,913 due to some voids not
being assigned terrain units. The vast majority of these unassigned voids are in coastal areas
and should be classed as PLAINS.

orientation of the artificial voids are representative of real voids. However, it does
risk the creation of artificial voids in areas of the terrain that are not representative
of the terrain of the real void. To ensure that we relocated the voids to comparable
terrain, we employed (i) visual inspection of the terrain and (ii) computed the mean
and standard deviation of the elevation in a buffer zone surrounding the real void
and compared it with the mean and standard deviation of the elevation in buffer
zones surrounding the relocated void. No significant changes could be observed in
the standard deviation of the surrounding elevation between the groups of relocated
and the real voids across the original 15 terrain types (based on a t-test), except for
rugged lowlands and low plateaus. No differences were observed when the results
were aggregated into the six terrain units (results not shown). Therefore we assume
that the visual relocation was an acceptable approach for generating realistic
artificial voids.

In this way we created 1304 artificial but realistic voids based on real void
characteristics distributed across six terrain units and eight size classes (table 2).
These voids were stored as polygon coverages in ArcInfo.

2.5 Data pre-processing for the artificial voids

A working area for each single void was created by enlarging the maximum extent of
the void by 100 pixels in all directions and extracting the underlying DEM data
within this buffer zone. The number of pixels for this buffer was based on empirical
testing of the algorithm under different terrain units (results not shown). We then
‘punched out’ the void from this buffered area and used the remaining ‘ring’ of
DEM data to create (i) elevation spot heights or points, with one point for each
DEM pixel, and (ii) contours at 10 m intervals. There were occasions where it was
not possible to extract contours from the buffered region, for example where the
terrain was extremely flat. In these cases we employed an iterative process to
decrease the contour interval until a contour layer could be created (the lower limit
was 1 m). Where this process did not result in a contour layer, we extended the
buffer up to a maximum threshold of 0.1 degrees. These contours were stored as line
or point coverages in ArcInfo.

Auxiliary spot height elevation data was extracted from the SRTM30
and GTOPO30 at 30-arc second spacing unless either one of two restrictions
were met. The first restriction is the size of the void (coarse auxiliary data will
not help in the interpolation of small voids); and the second considered the shape
of the void (e.g. a long, thin void is better filled with only the surrounding DEM
data).

SRTM data have a high absolute accuracy in contrast to GTOPO30 and to
account for such differences we adjusted the elevation values in the GTOPO30
DEM as follows. For each void, the auxiliary DEM was re-sampled to the
resolution of the SRTM data set and the void area was punched out from this re-
sampled auxiliary data set. The difference in elevation between both data sets was
used to raise or lower the elevation values for the original resolution auxiliary data
set. Thereby we accounted for some differences between data sets (i, ii, vii) as
outlined in section 1.2. We did not make any adjustments for other errors (e.g.
geometrical location or trends in the auxiliary data). The spot heights were stored as
point coverages in ArcInfo.

The SRTM elevation from the void stamped area constitutes the ‘truth’ layer
against which the results from the VF algorithms were compared. Essentially, this is
equivalent to withholding pixels from the interpolation process and then comparing
the results from the VF algorithms against them afterwards (see also Yang and
Hodler 2000).

Thus, for each of the 1304 voids we created a truth DEM, a set of contours and
spot heights buffering an artificial void area, and where applicable, two auxiliary
spot height data sets.

3. Void-filling methods

The procedure for applying and evaluating the VF algorithms is outlined in figure 6
and described in detail
in the following sections. Unless otherwise stated, all
processing was carried out in ArcInfo Workstation 9.1 using Arc Macro Language
(AML) routines and standard ArcInfo interpolation functions from the Arc and
Grid environments. The results of the VF methods were projected from geographic
projection (latitude/longitude) into Mollweide Equal Area projection where the
longitude of the projection centre was the longitude of the centroid of the void, and
both vertical and horizontal units were in metres.

3.1 Void-filling methods

The following eight VF algorithms were implemented: (i) kriging (KR), (ii) spline
(SP), (iii) trend (TR), (iv) inverse distance weighting (IDW), (v) moving window
average (MW), (vi) fill and feather (FF), (vii) triangulated irregular network (TIN)
and (viii) ANUDEM (ANU).

The geostatistical methods (KR, SP, TR and IDW) require several

input
parameters, but we used default values wherever possible, since it was too complex
and too time-consuming to adjust the parameters for each method and each void.
One might criticise this approach since adjusting the parameters could improve the
interpolations on a case-by-case basis. However, since the VF algorithms are all well
known and long-standing implementations, we assume that the default values
provide reasonable results under most conditions.

The implementation for KR is based on McBratney et al. (1986), using a spherical
semi-variogram model with an automatically fitted function. We used a 10th-order
linear polynomial regression (based on manual testing, results not shown) for TR.
The SP method follows Franke (1982) and Mitas and Mitasova (1988) and performs
a two-dimensional minimum curvature spline interpolation resulting in a smooth
surface that passes exactly through the input points. In this case we used regularised
splines which yield a smooth surface. We did not test tension splines as in Mitasova

and Hofierka (1993), even though it is available as an option in ArcInfo. IDW was
implemented following Watson and Philip (1985) based on the 12 nearest
neighbouring points.

MW interpolates the void area by computing elevation values in the void pixels
next to the void boundary based on the local average of the neighbouring elevation
pixels. This process continues inwards until all void pixels are filled. For FF, we re-
sampled the auxiliary information to the resolution of the truth DEM, buffered it
inwards, filled in the void using this re-sampled auxiliary DEM, and closed any
remaining void pixels applying the MW method with a 363 pixel window. More
advanced approaches are possible, which alter the surface of the original DEM
(Dowding et al. 2004); however, these were not implemented here. MW and FF are
complementary in that MW is used where there is no auxiliary DEM, and FF is used
where there is.

H. I. Reuter et al.

For TIN, which is by definition a triangular network of mass points with 3D
coordinates connected by edges to form a triangular tessellation, the weed tolerance
(the minimal tolerance between two data points at a line) was set to 0.0001 of the
maximum extent of the input data set, whereas the proximal tolerance (minimal
distance between single data points) was set to the machine precision of the host
computer.

The ANU approach (Hutchinson 1989, Hutchinson and Dowling 1991) is
implemented in ArcInfo as TOPOGRID, and creates a hydrologically correct DEM
using a multi-resolution iterative finite difference interpolation (extended spline)
method, which ensures that ridges are maintained, streams are enforced and
spurious sinks are removed. The ANU approach contains three parameters which
are used for the smoothing of the input data and the removing of sinks (ESRI 2000).
The TOL1 tolerance was initially set to 5 m (half the height difference between
contours); however,
if the maximum elevation difference observed in the data
preparation data set was below the contour interval, it was set to half that value.
Values for the horizontal and vertical standard errors were set to one and zero,
respectively.

The authors limited the number of implementations to the above-described
algorithms, though even more advanced algorithms (Hofer et al. 2006, Soile 1991)
look advantageous. If needed, a more advanced algorithm, e.g. conditioned
simulations (Holmes et al. 2000), could be implemented in the processing chain.

3.2 Evaluation

For each void we applied the seven VF algorithms three times, once with no
auxiliary data, and once each with the SRTM30 and GTOPO30 information,
resulting in 21 DEMs, plus the reference DEM. A visual example of the results from
each VF algorithm for a set of voids is shown in figure 7. Figure 7a shows the void to
be filled, whereas the other examples ((b) to (i)) present the different VF results. The
effect of coarse resolution auxiliary data is clearly visible in figure 7i with the fill and
feather approach. In figure 7h the extrapolation by moving window shows some
limitation as extrapolation from the borders of the void occurs. The geostatistical
algorithms in figures 7d–f show only slightly different visual appearances, e.g. the
representation of the peak on the left side of the large voids. Finally, the TIN and
ANUDEM approaches show slightly different elevation surfaces, with TIN creating
a ridge in the major void (figure 7c), which is not visible in the hydrologically correct
ANUDEM surface (figure 7b).

We compared the elevation of the reference DEM (zRef) to the 21 DEM (zDem) by
computing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient
(r), the average difference (m), the sum difference (c) and the standard deviation of
the difference between both surfaces (s). Additionally, we computed the area for
each void.

We chose an evaluation based on the total area of the void similar to Grohman

et al. (2006) in contrast to a selected number of GCP (Dowding et al. 2004).

The RSME was computed between the reference elevation and the 21 elevation
surfaces. Each void-filled DEM patch was ranked from 1 (lowest RMSE) to 7—or
21 for a comparison across all variations—(highest RMSE). The distribution of the
ranking relative to terrain and void size was assessed by summarising the ranking
results by: (i) terrain unit, (ii) size class, (iii) terrain unit and size class and (iv)
auxiliary data sets.

Fisher and Tate (2006) argue that the RMSE is not necessarily a good estimator
of the error, recommending the mean error (ME) and the error standard deviation
(S), where n is the number of pixels in the void:

We performed the comparative analysis based on RMSE, ME and S and observed
consistent best VF results for different TU/Void size classes for RSME and S. ME
showed diverse rankings of different algorithms. For the remaining course of this
paper we provide results for RSME only, and discuss the S and ME results where
appropriate. We are aware that a global statistic was used to compare the filled
voids against the truth surface, rather than evaluation methods which take the
spatial pattern of errors into account or which identify the different factors which
led to that error.

4. Results

H. I. Reuter et al.

4.1 Evaluation of the void-filling algorithms with respect to terrain unit

Table 3 shows the statistical summary of the ranking results when the void is
classified by its terrain unit, irrespective of the size of the void. Table 3 shows the
mean and standard deviation (in parentheses) of the ranking of each VF method for
each terrain unit, with and without an auxiliary DEM. The geostatistical method
KR and the mechanical method SP (e.g. no assessment of the uncertainty of the
model is possible) are consistently the ‘best’ methods, with KR performing better in
flatter areas (Plains, Plateaus and High Plateaus) and SP performing better in
mountainous terrains (Hills, Mountains and High Mountains). Differences between
VF methods in RMSE can be large (e.g. see first row differences between KR (6.04
and SP 17.40)), which agrees with the Fisher and Tate (2006) statement that no
single interpolation method exists that is the most accurate for the interpolation of
terrain data.

Still, the ‘best’ method in table 3 sometimes contains groups of two different VF
methods, almost similar in RSME results. An example is the VF for PLAINS
without any auxiliary DEM, where KR (6.04) and IDW (6.44) show similar results.
On the contrary SP, MW and ANU are the most variable in terms of performance.
On the other hand, for certain TU, e.g. in HIGH MOUNTAINS, the algorithm SP
(4.06) shows the ‘best’ performance, with results of all other algorithms being quite
different.

Related to that last observation, the standard deviation, which is larger than for
all other VF methods in that TU, suggests that there were several voids where SP
performed poorly. Therefore the SD is a good indicator of the general applicability
of the VF algorithm for a given TU. In this case, it would be advisable to check
further to identify cases, which are not well handled (e.g. it could be an effect of the
void size) and to rerun the analysis.

Generally, the use of auxiliary information of the GTOPO30 data set increased
the RMSE for all VF methods except for small improvements in TR. This might be
attributed to the different types of errors not accounted for in our methodology (see
also section 1.2).

The use of SRTM30 as an auxiliary data set decreased the RMSE for most
cases, and decreased the standard deviation indicating less variation in the level of
improvement. This is not surprising since SRTM30 is an up-scaled and void-filled
derivative of the SRTM data. One could argue that the use of SRTM30 should be
preferred, however in practice this means that we are down-scaling data (SRTM30
to SRTM) from a previous up-scaling (SRTM to SRTM30)! This circularity may
be acceptable in certain cases if we know how the SRTM30 data was generated in
the area of the particular void we are filling. This problem is discussed further in
section 5.2.1.

4.2 Evaluation of void-filling methods with respect to void size

Table 4 shows the statistical summary of the ranking results when the void is
classified by size. Again, the table shows the mean and standard deviation (in
parentheses) of the ranking of each VF method for each size class, with and without
an auxiliary DEM. In this classification of voids, KR is consistently the best method
for small and medium sized voids, regardless of the use of auxiliary data. If auxiliary
data are used, KR performed best up to void size class F compared with up to void

size class D without auxiliary information. The reason behind this is probably that
the KR delivers an average elevation surface, which closer resembles the reference
DEM, in contrast to the TIN data set. In TIN the relationship between triangles and
their adjacent neighbours are handled more stringently, more closely resembling the
input data set.

For large and very large voids, the inclusion of an auxiliary DEM has an obvious
effect on the performance of the algorithms. TIN is better where there is no auxiliary
information, IDW is better where GTOPO30 is used and TIN or ANU are best
when SRTM30 is used. One might speculate on the differences between the auxiliary
data sets. One possible explanation is that TIN/ANU requires ‘good-quality’
auxiliary information, whereas IDW as a geostatistical algorithm generates an
‘average surface’ as mentioned earlier.

4.3 Evaluation of void-filling methods with respect to terrain unit and void size

Table 5 shows the best method for the final classification based on both terrain unit
and void size, resulting in 48 possible void typologies, although as can be seen from
table 5a, six of these typologies contain no voids (High Plateaus in particular is a
rare terrain unit) and the number of voids per typology varies from 80 to 3.
Tables 5a–c show the best-performing VF algorithm for each typology, again using
no auxiliary DEM (table 5a), GTOPO30 (table 5b) and SRTM30 (table 5c). The
table cells are shaded to help interpretation.

The first observation is that KR outperforms any other VF algorithm for very
small voids (Class A), except in High Mountains, where SP is better. Second, for
very large voids in mountainous terrain (arguably the most difficult voids to
interpolate), ANU and TIN are the best, with ANU being superior when SRTM30
is used. Other noticeable trends include IDW in planar areas for large voids with no
DEM or GTOPO30, and SP for medium to large voids (Classes C to F) for all
terrain units except Plains, and especially for Mountains and High Mountains.

A test of the SD of the RSME for the different methods showed a similar
distribution across all VF methods, void sizes and terrain units, which allows us to
be quite confident in the results presented here. One exception is, however, for the
largest void class (H) in the terrain unit PLAINS and PLATEAUS for the VF
method SP. The reason for that exception might be attributed to the relatively low
number of investigated voids in that class.

Looking across tables 5a–c, the use of coarse resolution auxiliary DEM data has
little or no impact on the results for void size classes A through D, but the possible
inclusion of such auxiliary information becomes important for the larger void
classes (E through H). If a VF algorithm is to be recommended for these void sizes
for global application, then we must differentiate between the three choices for
auxiliary information.

Table 5d shows the best-performing VF algorithm and the auxiliary information
that was used for all terrain units for size classes E through H. Looking only at the
auxiliary DEM results, we can see that SRTM30 is the preferred auxiliary DEM for
very large voids (size classes G and H), whilst there is no one recommended auxiliary
DEM for classes E and F. Looking at the VF method and auxiliary information
together, KR always uses SRTM30, and ANU always uses SRTM30, except for the
PLAINS, where a variety of methods is recommended based on the void size class.
A mixture of VF algorithm is recommended for medium size voids (E,F) based on
the TU (IDW for Plains, TIN for HILLS, and SP/ANU for the remaining TU).

It is interesting to see that certain algorithms deliver the best results without
auxiliary information (e.g. recommending SP without any auxiliary information for
size class F in high plateaus). Further investigation is required to determine why the
errors without auxiliary information are less than with VF algorithms that use
auxiliary information. One reason might be that we have not sufficiently
compensated for the errors in the data set (c.f. section 1.2) during the preparation
of input data for the VF and this may bias the results. Another observation is that
most of the recommended VF algorithms create a smooth surface which stays within
the elevation range of the input data. This means that mountain ridges for example
can not be represented properly, even if
the
approximation is best for the VF patch, and that the local noise structure of the
surrounding area is smoothed out. Finally, GTOPO30 is derived from a range of
topographic sources, and the variation in quality of these sources across Africa is
likely to have an impact on these results.

the RMSE/ME proves that

4.4 Evaluation of void-filling methods with respect to auxiliary information

To determine if the inclusion of low quality auxiliary information has any
improvement on the VF algorithms, for each void we computed the percentage
difference between the RSME with no auxiliary information and (i) RMSE with
SRTM30 and (ii) RMSE with GTOPO30. The results are summarised by void size
class and terrain (table 6) for all void sizes E through H.

Percentages lower than 100 indicate that the inclusion of auxiliary information
resulted in an improvement and vice versa. A percentage equal to 100 means that the
first restriction of the area threshold (c.f. section 2.5) has been met, however, due to
the second restriction (e.g. the shape of the void) the auxiliary data has not been
used.

As expected, overall, SRTM30 improves the VF results more than GTOP30, but
surprisingly both auxiliary data sets also degrade the VF results in several cases (e.g.
in mid-sized voids and in some terrain units—table 6). This suggests that the area
threshold should depend on the TU. For example, for VF algorithm KR in
MOUNTAINS using GTOPO30, an increase in accuracy can only be observed if the
void area is larger than void size class F. Below that void size class, GTOPO30 did
not improve the VF results and even decreases accuracy. For GTOPO30, the area
threshold should be only the largest class (H) for PLAINS, LOW PLATEAUS,
HILLS and HIGH MOUNTAIN. For HIGH PLATEAUS no recommendation
can be given (or even not to use coarse scale auxiliary information), and for
MOUNTAINS the area threshold should be class G.

SRTM30 not

surprisingly outperforms GTOPO30. Generally,

the largest
improvements for SRTM30 occur in large and very large void sizes (G and H).
Similarly to GTOPO30, the area thresholds and when to use auxiliary information
vary. For PLAIN, LOW PLATEAU and MOUNTAINS the void size class G is
recommended; for HIGH PLATEAUS again no recommendation can be given and
for HILLS and HIGH MOUNTAIN the area threshold should be set to H.

These results indicate that such coarse resolution auxiliary data are generally only
applicable to extremely large voids, and highlights the need to use higher resolution
auxiliary data sets in the void filling the SRTM data, rather than the SRTM30 and
GTOPO30 data sets used here.

4.5 Application of the ‘best’ VF methods to the global SRTM data

One of the objectives of this paper has been to provide a worldwide database of
voids, in which each void has an assigned ‘best’ method based on terrain unit and
void size. This has been performed based on the results in table 5, and the database
will be provided to the international user community at http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/ and
http://srtm.jrc.it/. The International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT),
through the Consortium for Spatial Information (CSI), has been providing ready
to use seamless (i.e. void-filled) SRTM elevation data since 2003. These derived data
have been gradually improved over three versions through the use of better
interpolation algorithms (currently ANUDEM) and auxiliary DEMs.

The database of ‘best’ VF methods could be used to create a fourth version of the
seamless SRTM elevation data by identifying the voids where there is no high-
resolution auxiliary DEM information available (which is currently the vast
majority of voids), and by then applying the recommended VF algorithm to the
remaining voids. Where high-resolution DEMs are available we recommend the
ANUDEM procedure.

5. Conclusions

5.1 General conclusions

The authors assume that each void occurs due to a technical reason, which can be
partly attributed to terrain, land use and other reasons. In the course of this analysis,
void areas in the SRTM data set have been quantified in terms of their terrain and
size, providing a statistically sound and extensive evaluation of different VF
algorithms over a wide range of terrain units and void sizes (objective i).

Different VF algorithms have been implemented in a GIS, and used to analyse
performance using RMSE/S on 1304 relocated voids. Based on these results a
decision table has been created, which provides an answer to an important question:
which VF method can be recommended for a void of a given size in a given terrain
unit? Contrary to some previous findings, the best methods can be generalised as:
kriging or inverse distance weighting interpolation for small and medium-size voids
in relatively flat low-lying areas; spline interpolation for small and medium-sized
voids in high-altitude and dissected terrain; triangular irregular network or inverse
distance weighting interpolation for large voids in very flat areas, and an advanced
spline method (ANUDEM) for large voids in other terrains (objectives ii and iv).
We have shown that coarse resolution auxiliary information was only helpful if
the void areas exceeded a certain size threshold (objective iii). Differences in
decrease of RMSE could be observed between use of the SRTM30 and the
GTOPO30 DEMs.

Finally, we have created a database that can be used to select a VF algorithm and
auxiliary DEM to fill each of the 3,339,913 voids in the SRTM data (objective v).

5.2 Further work

Issues with the SRTM30 data. In this paper we tested only coarser scale
5.2.1
resolution data as auxiliary information for the VF process. The VF using the
SRTM30 obviously creates a better result
than using GTOPO30 auxiliary
information (table 3). Still, SRTM30 is a seamless DEM based on the SRTM data
product and is therefore also influenced by the voids. Most voids in the underlying
SRTM data were interpolated in a 10610 averaging process that re-sampled the
data from 3 to 30. Voids that were too large to be interpolated in this manner were
filled using GTOPO30. Since the SRTM data does not have global coverage,
GTOPO30 data from areas above 60uN and below 56uS were fused with the SRTM
data to create the final SRTM30 data. No attempt was made to adjust the vertical
datum of either data set in this fusion. There are three observations to be made here.
First, the SRTM30 product will have variable quality in areas where there were
reasonably large voids within the 10610 re-sampling window. Second, there is no
advantage in using SRTM30 instead of GTOPO30 as an auxiliary DEM for
interpolating very large voids since the auxiliary information in these areas will be
almost identical. Third,
if the recommended VF algorithms and all available
auxiliary data sets are used to create a seamless 3 SRTM data set (as would be the
case in a fourth version of the CSI SRTM data), this in turn can be used to create a
higher-quality SRTM30 data set and other global coarse resolution derivatives.

5.2.2 Size thresholds for auxiliary data. A second question is the size of thresholds
influence results quite
for higher-resolution auxiliary data sets, which might
significantly. A conservative threshold for using auxiliary elevation information

Downloaded by [Universite De Paris 1] at 12:47 27 August 2013 1006

H. I. Reuter et al.

(void size class D) has been applied which was obviously not large enough (table 6)
under certain conditions. Further research is required to provide better information
on the required resolution and quality of auxiliary DEMs for filling voids of
different sizes.

5.2.3 High-resolution auxiliary data. We assume that high resolution DEM data
(e.g. based on ASTER or SPOT satellite-derived data, or digitised from fine-scale
topographic maps) should deliver superior results for void filling as the density and
distribution of the auxiliary data is superior. The degree of improvement offered by
these data has to be offset against the time and the cost of acquiring and processing
such information. Higher resolution may not necessarily mean higher quality;
relative ASTER DEM products show height differences of up to 600 m between
three different scenes for the same area and other ASTER DEM errors are specified
in Lo¨ nnqvist and To¨ rma¨ (2004). Inherent to the use of auxiliary information is the
question of how different errors can automatically be compensated for, as outlined
in section 1.2.

5.2.4 Better understanding of void-filling algorithms. This analysis has treated the
VF algorithms as black boxes in that we have only looked at the results of the
interpolation accuracy rather than attempted to investigate the reasons why one
method performs better than another. Interrogation and analysis of the inner
workings of these algorithms under different conditions would be a valuable aid to
researchers who need to select an appropriate method for a given problem.

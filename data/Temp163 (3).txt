Abstract
Satellite sensors have provided new datasets for monitoring regional and urban air
quality. Satellite sensors provide comprehensive geospatial information on air quality
with both qualitative remotely sensed imagery and quantitative data, such as aerosol
optical depth which is the basic unknown parameter for any atmospheric correction
method in the pre-processing of satellite imagery. This article presents a new method
for retrieving aerosol optical thickness directly from satellite remotely sensed imagery
for  short  wavelength  bands  in  which  atmospheric  scattering  is  the  dominant
contribution  to  the  at-satellite  recorded  signal.  The  method  is  based  on  the  deter-
mination  of the aerosol optical thickness through the application of the contrast tool
(maximum  contrast  value),  the  radiative  transfer  calculations  and  the  ‘tracking’  of
the suitable darkest pixel in the scene. The proposed method that needs no a-priori
, SPOT-5 and
information has been applied to LANDSAT-5 TM, LANDSAT-7 ETM
IKONOS data of two different geographical areas: West London and Cyprus. The
retrieved aerosol optical thickness values show high correlations with in-situ visibility
data  acquired  during  the  satellite  overpass.  Indeed,  for  the  West  London  area  a
logarithmic regression was fitted for relating the determined aerosol optical thickness

reproduced and estimates for these areas were generated with the proposed method

1 Introduction

Atmospheric pollution is a major issue that has received considerable attention from local
and global communities. Air quality monitoring stations have been established in major
cities and provide a means for alerts. The measuring stations are sparsely distributed and
they do not provide sufficient tools for mapping atmospheric pollution since air quality
is highly variable (Hadjimitsis 1999, Wald et al. 1999, Hadjimitsis et al. 2002, Hadjimitsis
and Clayton 2006).

Air  pollution  estimates  at  high  spatial-temporal  scales  are  critically  important  for
enforcing air quality regulations and to protect human health (Lipfert 1994, Wald et al.
1999).  The  limited  coverage  of  air  pollution  monitoring  and  conventional  methods  of
monitoring  air  pollution  pose  major  restrictions.  Indeed,  the  main  focus  of  various
researchers is on multiple strategies to generate spatially detailed estimates of air pollution
including  the  satellite  remote  sensing  which  has  been  advanced  considerably  in  terms  of
spatial-temporal coverage (Kumar et al. 2008). Advances in atmospheric remote sensing,
GIS  and  spatial  analytical  methods  provide  important  new  tools  for  computing  indirect
estimates of air quality at high spatial-temporal resolutions, which otherwise are difficult
to  estimate  by  the  conventional  ground-based  measurements,  because  of  limited  spatial-
temporal coverage of air pollution monitoring on the ground (Hadjimitsis et al. 2007b).
The  use  of  satellite  remote  sensing  to  assess  and  map  atmospheric  pollution  has
received extensive attention from researchers who have developed a variety of techniques
(e.g. Kaufman et al. 1990; Finzi and Lechi 1991; Sifakis and Deschamps 1992; Wald et al.
1999; Kanaroglou et al. 2002; Pawan et al. 2006; Hadjimitsis and Clayton 2006; Lim et al.
2007; Hadjimitsis et al. 2007a, b; Kumar et al. 2008). Satellite remote sensing is certainly
a  valuable  tool  for  assessing  and  mapping  air  pollution  due  to  their  major  benefit  of
providing complete and synoptic views of large areas in one image on a systematic basis due
to the good temporal resolution of various satellite sensors (Wald et al. 1999, Hadjimitsis
et al. 2002).

The key parameter for assessing atmospheric pollution in photochemical air pollution
studies  is  the  aerosol  optical  thickness  (Hadjimitsis  et  al.  2002),  which  is  also  the  most
important  unknown  of  every  atmospheric  correction  algorithm  for  solving  the  radiative
transfer  (RT)  equation  and  removing  atmospheric  effects  from  satellite  remotely  sensed
images.  The  aerosol  optical  thickness  has  been  used  as  a  tool  of  assessing  atmospheric
pollution  (Kaufman  et  al.  1990,  Hadjimitsis  1999,  Wald  et  al.  1999,  Hadjimitsis  et  al.
2002).  Indeed,  this  article  presents  a  new  fully-image  based  method  for  determining  the
aerosol  optical  thickness  through  the  use  of  the  contrast  value  principle,  the  radiative
transfer calculations and the ‘tracking’ of the suitable darkest pixel in the satellite images.

2 Background and Literature Review

2.1 The Need for Atmospheric Correction

The  atmospheric  contribution  to  the  satellite  signal  occurs  when  the  electromagnetic
radiation from the sun passes through the atmosphere, is reflected by the earth and then

again passes through the atmosphere and is detected by the satellite sensor as shown in
Figure  1.  The  interaction  processes  which  occur  during  the  two-way  passage  through
the atmosphere are mainly scattering and absorption processes. These processes add to
or  decrease  the  true  ground-leaving  radiance  and  their  intensity  is  dependent  on  the
wavelength. The basis of any correction of a satellite image is to identify and understand
the process which contaminates the image. In the case of atmospheric effects, the origin

for any attempt to perform atmospheric correction to satellite data is the setting up of an
equation (Forster 1984) which describes all the processes with the various atmospheric
parameters and variables that contributes to the attenuation of the signal received by a
satellite sensor (see Figure 1). This equation is called the radiative transfer (RT) equation.
Bearing  in  mind  that  the  atmospheric  effects  are  mainly  caused  by  scattering  and
absorption of atmospheric gases, aerosol and clouds, the most important point in order
to perform an atmospheric correction is to be aware of the optical characteristics of the
atmosphere:  mainly  the  aerosol  optical  thickness  and  secondly  the  single  scattering
albedo and the gaseous absorption. The main problem in atmospheric correction is the
difficulty in determining these optical characteristics (Hadjimitsis and Clayton 2004).

2.2 Methods for Determining the Aerosol Optical Thickness

The  atmospheric  aerosols  are  an  important  parameter  for  any  atmospheric  correction
method for satellite remote sensing and in climate change and air pollution studies. It is
also  one  of  the  most  uncertain  parameters  for  such  studies.  The  determination  of  the
optical  properties  of  aerosol  particles  is  the  most  difficult  part  of  any  atmospheric
correction method that is applied to determine the true reflectance values from satellite
remotely sensed imagery. The key factor that contributes significantly to the at-satellite
signal is the 

.
atmospheric aerosols

Since  the  optical  properties  of  aerosols  are  rather  difficult  to  estimate,  many
methods  for  determining  such  parameters  have  been  discussed  by  several  investigators
either as a separate procedure or as a part of other atmospheric correction methods (e.g. Hill
1993,  Hadjimitsis  1999,  Hadjimitsis  et  al.  2002).  The  methods  for  determining  the
aerosol optical properties such as the aerosol optical thickness include ground measurements
using  Sun-photometers  and  several  methods  applied  on  satellite  imagery  such  as  the
following:  ‘the  ocean  method’  applied  over  clear  water  using  visible  data  or  infrared
data (for example, Griggs 1975); the ‘brightness method’ applied above land using data
in  the  visible  spectrum  (Fraser  et  al.  1983);  the  ‘contrast-reduction  method’  applicable
over  land  (Tanre  et  al.  1979)  or  a  mixture  of  land  and  water  (Kergomard  and  Tanre
1989, Kaufman et al. 1990); the ‘dark vegetation method’ using long-wavelength visible
data  (Kaufman  and  Sendra  1988,  Kaufman  et  al.  1990);  the  ‘temperature  attenuation’
procedure  (Sifakis  et  al.  1998);  and  the  ‘differential  textural  analysis  method’  (Sifakis
and Deschamps 1992, Kanaroglou et al. 2002).

Holben et al. (1992) have reviewed many of these procedures and their limitations.
For applying any of these methods, with the exception of the ‘ocean’ and ‘temperature
attenuation’ methods, one needs to compare optical data sets and estimate variations of the
observed radiance values. The assessed optical thickness is considered relative to pollution
free conditions and is a linear function of the particulate content in the lower troposphere
(Fraser et al. 1983, Sifakis et al. 1998). The extraction of the optical thickness,  according
to  the  above  procedures  is  based  on  the  inversion  of  the  radiative  transfer  equation
except  for  the  ‘temperature  attenuation’  method.  Indeed,  this  method  is  based  on  the
retrieved change in ground spectral response and the optical thickness is estimated in the
infrared  portion  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum  over  clear  water.  This  method  is  flawed
because water vapour affects the retrieved reflectance values in the near-infrared bands
(Forster 1984, Hadjimitsis et al. 2007a). Griggs (1975), for example, found that MSS band
m) is not useful for aerosol determination due to the fact that radiances for
4 (0.8–1.1 
this band after accounting for water vapour content are very small. However, the literature

also shows that water vapour absorption has negligible effects in the short wavelength
bands  (Forster  1984,  Kaufman  1989).  Guoyong  et  al.  (1999)  show  that  the  aerosol
optical thickness of the blue band, estimated from the dark object approach, agrees quite
well  with  Sun  photometer  measurements.  Therefore,  the  use  of  the  blue  band  in  the
method proposed below increases its effectiveness as it avoids any water vapour effects.

The method described below is the ‘modified version’ of the one presented by Hadjimitsis
et al. (2003b).

7. Use  the  value  of  the  aerosol  optical  thickness  from  Step  6  and  correct  the  satellite
image. Check the new image contrast after atmospheric correction and by comparing it
with the result found from Step 2. At this step (#7), atmospheric effects must be ideally
removed.  This  means  that  the  aerosol  optical  thickness  after  the  perfect  correction
a = 0. Try different reflectance values from Step 4d until the highest
must be zero: τ
contrast  value  is  obtained,  i.e.  clear  conditions.  This  one  corresponds  to  the
corrected  image  with  the  maximum  contrast  value.  The  idea  is  that  a  sharp
contrast (i.e. high contrast values) is obtained when the atmospheric effect is minimized
and for very hazy atmospheres the contrast value is reduced (i.e. low contrast values).
8. Mark  the  surface  reflectance  value  from  Step  7  and  repeat  Step  5  with  the  same
values except the surface reflectance value (use the one found from Step 7). The result
is the final value of the aerosol optical thickness for the selected area of interest.

This method is useful with respect to the retrieval of aerosol optical thickness for images
where suitable dark objects can be easily tracked. Since the surface reflectance of a dark
object  is  small,  then  the  error  found  from  the  retrieval  of  the  aerosol  optical  thickness
is  also  relatively  small  compared  to  errors  over  bright  surfaces  (Griggs  1975).  The
shortcoming of the method occurs in the case where there is an absence of suitable dark
targets in the scene and the method does not work. The proposed method is an empirical
one  based  on  theoretical  calculations  of  atmospheric  modelling.  In  order  to  make  the
computations manageable, certain approximations about atmospheric parameters such
as  the  aerosol  single  scattering  phase  function  and  single  scattering  albedo  have  been
made. Based on the fact that with atmospheric modelling it is difficult to determine the
real atmospheric conditions (Griggs 1975), some errors are expected. Given the fact that
the method does not consider the effects of multiple-scattering and the relative humidity
is  assumed  not  to  have  a  significant  effect  on  aerosols  (absorption)  means  the  method
may not work efficiently for any scenario where these effects are significant.

4 Application

The method has been applied after the application of the pre-processing steps described
below to two different geographical areas: the West London (UK) and Paphos (Cyprus)
study areas.

4.1 Pre-processing

The following pre-processing steps have been applied to the available satellite remotely
sensed imagery:

Geometric  correction:  Geometric  correction  was  carried  out  using  standard
techniques with ground control points and a first order polynomial fit (Mather
2004).  Well-defined  features  in  the  images  such  as  road  intersections,  corners
of  large  buildings,  airport  runways,  bends  in  rivers  and  corners  of  dams  were
chosen as ground control points.

Radiometric  correction:  Calibration  in  units  of  radiance  or  reflectance  is  an
important  processing  step  before  atmospheric  correction  can  be  applied.
Satellite images were converted from digital numbers to units of radiance using
standard calibration values for each sensor. Then the next step was to convert
the  at-satellite  radiance  values  into  at-satellite  reflectance  using  the  solar
irradiance at the top of the atmosphere, sun-earth distance correction and solar
zenith angle (Mather 2004).

Radiation from the earth’s surface undergoes significant interaction with the atmosphere
before it reaches the satellite sensor. The aim of atmospheric correction is to recover, as
far  as  possible,  the  reflectance  at  the  ground  surface.  In  this  study,  the  darkest  pixel
atmospheric  correction  was  applied  to  every  image  since  it  has  been  found  to  be  the
most effective one for blue and red bands (Hadjimitsis et al. 2003a).

4.2 West London Area (UK)

The  proposed  approach  was  applied  to  LANDSAT-5  TM  band  1  (0.45–0.52  μm)
images of the London Heathrow area (see Figure 2) acquired on 17 May, 2 June, 4 July,
28 September 1985, and 28 June 1986.

There  is  evidence  that  the  visibility  is  related  to  the  aerosol  optical  thickness  as
shown  by  Tanre  et  al.  (1979)  and  Forster  (1984).  Therefore,  the  available  visibility
values (see Table 1) recorded at the Heathrow Meteorological Station during the satellite
overpass can be used to assess the proposed method for determining the aerosol optical
thickness. By relating the determined aerosol optical thickness with the visibility values
shown in Table 1, a logarithmic regression was fitted with a correlation coefficient r 2 = 0.82
(p = 0.2).

The  authors  reproduced  the  plots  obtained  from  Tanre  et  al.  (1979,  1990)  and
Forster (1984) and those data have been plotted on the same plot so as to compare their
results (Figure 3). The author’s results show an agreement with Forster’s aerosol optical
thickness vs. visibility results and a small deviation from Tanre’s model estimates. From
Table 1, it is apparent that for the image acquired on 4/7/85, the aerosol optical thickness
was significantly increased. This means that aerosol concentrations might be increased
on  4/7/85  due  to  high  emissions  from  primary  sources,  such  as  road  transport  and
industrial activities, which are the main sources of aerosol temporal variability (Department
of the Environment 1996). Therefore, the air pollution in the Heathrow area was more
significant in July and May and less significant in June. The visibility data found at the
satellite overpasses support this finding.

The values of the determined aerosol optical thickness as shown in Table 1 for the
images  acquired  on  28/9/85,  28/6/86  and  4/7/85  are  not  perfectly  correlated  with  the
visibility  data  (see  deviations  in  Figure  3)  due  to  the  possible  impact  of  water  vapour.
The relative humidity data acquired during the satellite overpass can be used to extract
useful  information  regarding  the  water  vapour  thickness  value  as  shown  by  Forster
(1984).  Indeed,  for  the  image  acquired  on  28/9/85  the  high  RH  value  of  68.4%  may
have affected the value of the determined aerosol optical thickness.

4.3 Paphos Area (Cyprus)

The proposed approach was also applied to: (1) LANDSAT-5 TM band 1 images of the
Paphos  Airport  area  acquired  on  the  11/5/2000,  11/9/1998,  and  3/6/1985;  (2)  an
IKONOS image of Paphos acquired on the 14/3/2000; and (3) a SPOT-5 image of Paphos
(and  the  Larnaka  area)  acquired  on  11/4/2003  (Figure  4).  A  positive  high  correlation
(r2 = 0.94) was generated between the visibility data measured at Paphos Airport and the

deduced aerosol optical thickness for each LANDSAT TM image. This clearly indicates
the potential of the proposed method for assessing the prevailing atmospheric conditions.
It is apparent that a hazy atmosphere occurred on 3 June 1985 (visibility = 15 km) and
clear atmospheric conditions were found for the 11 May 2000 (30 km).

For  the  IKONOS  and  SPOT  band  1  images,  the  determined  aerosol  optical
thickness  was  0.20  and  0.18,  respectively.  By  comparing  the  abovementioned  aerosol

optical  thickness  with  the  one  found  from  the  prevailing  visibility  values  there  was  a
very close agreement between those values.

5 Discussion

The  retrieved  aerosol  optical  thickness  values  show  significant  high  correlations  with
visibility  measurements  acquired  during  the  satellite  overpass.  Indeed,  for  the  West
London  area  a  logarithmic  regression  was  fitted  for  relating  the  determined  aerosol
optical  thickness  with  the  visibility  values.  A  high  correlation  coefficient  r2  =  0.82
(p = 0.02) was found as well compliance with the values obtained with Tanre’s model.
Such results increase the potential of the proposed method and the ‘track’ of many suitable
dark  targets  in  the  whole  LANDSAT  TM  image  may  lead  to  the  determination  of  the
aerosol optical thickness over the dark target location. In such cases, the spatially distributed
estimates of aerosol optical thickness values may be imported into a Geographic Infor-
mation System (GIS) and used by environmentalists, planners and scientists to develop
better, more efficient and cost effective approaches to air quality status planning. Satellite
remote sensing can be used to locate the monitoring stations on a synoptic map as well
to suggest future suitable areas for locating monitoring stations based on their determined
aerosol optical thickness found from the proposed new algorithm. For example, for areas
in  which  a  LANDSAT  TM  scene  covers  most  of  area  of  interest  (like  for  the  Cyprus
region), the proposed algorithm can be used in conjunction with a GIS for locating the
suitable  positions  of  mobile  air  pollution  stations.  Then  the  GIS  can  be  used  to  auto-
matically combine all of the data from the monitoring stations or from other sources.

6 Conclusions

The proposed ‘modified method’ shows how to determine the aerosol optical thickness
for a certain area of interest using only the image itself. The method is based on the use
of the darkest pixel atmospheric correction theory as well as contrast values for selecting
the suitable ground reflectance value for the selected dark object. It has been shown that
determined  aerosol  optical  thickness  in  the  Heathrow  area  is  highly  correlated  to  the
visibility  data  acquired  at  the  time  of  satellite  overpass.  The  linear-logarithmic  plot
between the aerosol optical thickness vs. the visibility data agrees with those presented
in  the  literature  such  as  Tanre  et  al.  (1979,  1990)  and  Forster  (1984).  Indeed,  the
plot  reproduced  in  Figure  3  can  be  used  as  a  reference  in  order  to  test  and  check  the
determined aerosol optical thickness for future acquisitions.

Further validation is needed to test the proposed algorithm by acquiring simultaneously
the  following  data:  air  pollution  data,  meteorological  data,  sun-photometer  data  and
satellite image data. The method is also straightforward and easy to apply for potential
users of Quickbird data.

The spatial structure of population subgroups is important for many reasons.
Information on the spatial concentrations of people in particular groups may be used
for guiding government policy and is central to understanding issues such as differen-
tial access to resources. In addition, any geographical analysis of populations is partly
a function of the spatial scale of variation of subgroups of the population. This arti-
cle applies variograms to characterise spatial variation in the population of Northern
Ireland. The speciﬁc interest in this context is the division of the majority of the pop-
ulation of the region into two major groups – those people whose religion is Catholic
or Protestant, and the case study presented contributes to previous research on residen-
tial segregation by religion. In 2001, the population was more spatially concentrated by
community background (‘religion or religion brought up in’) than by housing tenure,
employment or any of a range of other socio-economic and demographic characteristics.
In this article, previous analyses are expanded to account explicitly for the spatial scale
of variation in the population by religion across Northern Ireland using census data for
1971, 1991 and 2001. The primary focus of the analysis is on the use of global and local
variograms to explore spatial variation in the religion variable which is expressed as per-
centages or as logratios. Local variograms are a novel means of summarising the spatial
scale of population concentrations locally, and this article is the ﬁrst to use them in this
way. The analysis contributes to an enhanced understanding of the spatial distribution
of the population of Northern Ireland by religion. The analytical framework presented
offers a powerful means of capturing information which is likely to be important in a
range of contexts from assessing residential segregation to generating population grids.

Introduction

Population subgroups may be concentrated over small areas or large regions and quan-
tifying the spatial scales of these concentrations is important for a variety of reasons.
Residential segregation may be viewed as one form of population concentration, but most
existing measures of segregation do not account for spatial scale. If we are to characterise
change in population characteristics generally, or residential segregation speciﬁcally, then it
is necessary to assess changes in the spatial scale of variation of the population subgroups.
It may be, for example, that a given subgroup has an increasing tendency to cluster in
small areas, and larger spatial concentrations are tending to break down. The spatial scale

of these concentrations can be captured using a variety of segregation indices and more
general tools such as the variogram. This article contributes to recent important research
on the spatial scale of residential segregation (see, e.g. Reardon et al. 2008) by making use
of variograms to explore the religious geography of Northern Ireland in 1971, 1991 and
2001. The spatial scale of any population characteristic is likely to vary between different
localities. For this reason, this article has a speciﬁc focus on estimating and exploring local
variograms as a means of assessing residential segregation by religion. By using data for
common geographies (1 km grid cells) for several census years (1971, 1991 and 2001),
changes in the scale of segregation (or population concentrations generally) locally can be
assessed. Local variograms constitute a powerful means of characterising dominant scales
of spatial variation locally and this article is the ﬁrst to make use of local variograms in
this way. In essence, the coefﬁcients of local variogram models (if well ﬁtted) provide
summaries of population structures in terms of the composition of areas and the size (and
potentially shape) of socially, economically or culturally ‘homogeneous’ areas. As such,
this article makes a novel contribution to the literature.

Massey and Denton (1988) identiﬁed ﬁve dimensions of segregation represented by
different measures. Most commonly, unevenness and exposure are measured while some
studies seek to explore clustering (or spatial concentration). Ross et al. (2004) sought to
measure each of the ﬁve dimensions with respect to income in urban Canada. Reardon
and O’Sullivan (2004) and Johnston et al. (2007) argued that the ﬁve dimensions can be
collapsed into two – these are termed spatial exposure and spatial evenness in the ﬁrst
study, and separateness and location in the second. Here the variogram is used to explore
population spatial concentrations at different spatial scales. Measures of spatial autocorre-
lation (or spatial dependence, which is equivalent to positive spatial autocorrelation) like
Moran’s I and the variogram do not provide measures of segregation as such, although they
add information on one important element of population structure, as discussed below. In
terms of the dimensions detailed by Massey and Denton, this corresponds to ‘clustering’,
although at multiple (rather than single) spatial scales. One beneﬁt of such measures is that
they can be used to compare population structures given different variables, and the present
analysis provides a starting point for more general analyses of this nature.

The variogram is concerned with the spatial relationships between observations, but
most analyses of segregation are based on aspatial measures. That is, no account is taken
of the neighbours of zones and the derived measures are a function of proportions derived
within zones. With spatial measures, connections between zones are considered directly.
In some applications, zones which share boundaries with a given zone are considered
neighbours. In other contexts, a distance decay function may be used such that nearby
zones receive larger weights than more distant zones (see Fotheringham et al. 2002, for
a general overview). Wong (1993, 2002, 2004) detailed spatial segregation measures and
other studies are presented by Reardon and O’Sullivan (2004) and Reardon et al. (2008,
2009). Reardon et al. (2008) computed a measure of segregation using a distance decay
function and the index values for different bandwidths were plotted against the band-
widths to produce segregation proﬁles. A similar approach was applied by Shuttleworth
et al. (2011) who computed geographically weighted variants of the index of dissimi-
larity (D) and the index of isolation (mP∗
m, where m indicates a particular population
subgroup). Lloyd (2010a) computed Moran’s I using a geographical weighting (distance
decay) scheme and spatial autocorrelation was assessed for a range of variables. Global
Moran’s I can be decomposed into local I values and, similarly, with the approach of
Feitosa et al. (2007), global segregation measures are a sum of the local measures. Other
researchers have used local measures of spatial autocorrelation as a means of assessing

population concentrations (see Anselin 1995, for an introduction to methods, and appli-
cations by Brown and Chung 2006, Poulsen et al. 2010, Johnston et al. 2011). Reardon
et al. (2008) mapped geographically weighted proportions of members of particular groups
given different kernel bandwidths, and methodologically there are similarities with the
general approach of Feitosa et al. (2007).

As noted above, for a geographically weighted approach, different kernel bandwidths
can be used and the corresponding results compared. An alternative approach, as employed
in the present analysis, is to measure the difference or similarity between locations and
to relate the computed value to the distance by which the locations are separated. The
experimental variogram (or semivariogram) relates half the squared difference between
observations to the distance between them (direction may also be accounted for and semi-
variances only computed for observations which are aligned in a particular direction such
as a line running north–south). In this article, global and local variograms are computed
using data on the percentages of people who were Catholic or non-Catholic (primarily
Protestant) in Northern Ireland in 1971, 1991 and 2001. Table 1 gives the percentage of the
population which was Catholic in each of these years (computed from the 1 km grid square
data) while Figure 1 shows Catholics as a percentage of all persons by 1 km grid cell in
1971 (Figure 1a) and 2001 (Figure 1b). Residential segregation in Northern Ireland, with
respect to the distribution of the Catholic and Protestant populations, has been the subject
of a variety of studies (see, e.g. Poole and Doherty 1996, Shuttleworth and Lloyd 2009).
This is the ﬁrst study to assess change in population structures by religion globally and
locally over the period 1971–2001.

This article builds on the work of Lloyd (2010a) and Shuttleworth et al. (2011)
by directly assessing dominant spatial scales of variation in the population of Northern
Ireland by religion both globally and locally, and expressly addressing the question of how
the dominant spatial scales of residential segregation changed between 1971 and 2001.
Common approaches to assessing local variations in population characteristics comprise
splitting the population into geographically discrete regions such as counties. Reardon
et al. (2008) consider such regions with respect to different spatial scales of residential
segregation. In this study, rather than starting with a set of zones such as city boundaries,
instead a moving window approach is used whereby the n nearest neighbours are selected
locally and the variogram model is obtained given this data subset. The speciﬁc aim of
the research is to assess the utility of global and local variograms for characterising the
spatial structure of population concentrations, with a speciﬁc focus on religion. A core
objective is to demonstrate how local variograms (in particular) provide an explicit guide
to the spatial scale of population concentrations (the variogram range) and the magnitude

of differences (the nugget effect and variogram structured component(s), the sum of which
is the total sill). In terms of residential segregation, therefore, it is possible to characterise
both the scale and the degree of segregation locally with respect to the variables employed.
The range quantiﬁes the spatial extent of clustering while the sill quantiﬁes the degree of
difference between cells in terms of their populations and a high degree of unevenness will
correspond to a large variance. Although the case study is based on Northern Ireland, the
approaches detailed in this article are applicable in any region for which spatially refer-
enced numerical population data are available and, in that respect, the case study can be
seen as an illustrative tool as well as illuminating aspects of population concentration in a
particular area.

In the following section, the data and methods used in the analysis are detailed. The
article goes on to discuss the global and local variograms and to demonstrate how the
approach presented adds value to previous studies.

2. Data and methods
2.1. Data

The analysis makes use of data from the Northern Ireland Censuses of population for 1971,
1991 and 2001 (the last being the most recent data available at the time of writing). More
speciﬁcally, data from the Northern Ireland grid square product provide the basis of this
analysis. In Northern Ireland, counts for 1 km grid cells have been released as outputs
from all Censuses from 1971 onwards. In addition, counts for 100 m cells in urban areas
(1971, 1981 and 1991) and for all areas (2001) are available, although only the 1 km grid
cell data are used in this study. Among the variables included in the grid square product
are counts by religion (1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001) and community background (‘religion
or religion brought up in’; 2001 only). Community background was added to the 2001
Census to capture information on those who do not practice a religion, as well as those
who do. Those who stated that they belonged to a religion did not complete the community
background question. Data on community background include responses to the religion
question as well as responses to the community background question for those who stated
that they did not belong to any religion. This study does not utilise data for 1981 due to
problems of marked undercount in some areas (see Shuttleworth and Lloyd 2009, for more
information on this issue and for details of the grid square resource). The number of 1 km
grid cells used in the analysis were 5284 (for 1971), 5575 (1991) and 6071 (2001). Note
that the maps in this paper show only populated cells (only total persons and households
were reported for cells with less than 25 persons or 8 households, and thus only cells
exceeding those thresholds are included in this analysis).

2.2. Methods
The present analysis was based on two sets of variables derived from the religion and
community background counts. These are counts expressed as percentages and as logratios
(as deﬁned below). The percentages are

(cid:129) for 1971, 1991 and 2001: Catholics by religion as a percentage of all persons and
(cid:129) for 2001 only: Catholics by community background as a percentage of all persons.

Where the variables used sum to a constant (e.g. percentages sum to 100), use of raw
values may be problematic and Aitchison (1986) suggested the use of logratios as a
suitable approach; most applications of such approaches are with respect to analysis of

62

compositions with multiple parts. The present analysis is based on only one variable (reli-
gion or community background) with only two groups (Catholic or ‘non-Catholic’), which
can thus be expressed as a single ratio. However, Filzmoser et al. (2009) showed that
univariate statistical methods should not be applied directly to (raw) compositional data.
Furthermore, Pawlowsky and Burger (1992) argued that structural analysis should not be
conducted using raw proportions or percentages as the constant-sum constraint may lead
to a distorted picture of the spatial covariance structure and possibly erroneous interpreta-
tions. To prevent logging of zeroes, the logratios are generated given percentages computed
with n1 + 1 and n2 + 1, where n1 are the number of Catholics and n2 are the number of
non-Catholics for each 1 km cell. The same approach is applied by Lloyd (2010a, 2010b),
who provided a rationale for this. In short, given (for the 2001 data) small cell adjustment
of counts (see Williamson 2007) such an approach reﬂects the uncertainty associated with,
in particular, small counts. The logratios are, following Egozcue et al. (2003), given by

√

(cid:129) for 1971, 1991 and 2001: 1/

2× ln (Catholics by religion (%)/non-Catholics by

religion (%)) (where ln is the natural log) and

√

(cid:129) for 2001 only: 1/

2× ln (Catholics by community background (%)/non-Catholics

by community background (%)).

√

The term 1/
2 could be removed for the purposes of univariate analyses (Filzmoser et al.
2009), but it is included for consistency with previous research based on multiple variables
(Lloyd 2010a).

Religion in Northern Ireland has links to national identity; Catholics are often asso-
ciated with a desire for uniﬁcation with the Republic of Ireland, while Protestants tend
to be associated with a desire to remain a part of the United Kingdom (see Shuttleworth
and Lloyd 2009, for a related discussion). Note that, in 2001, some 97% of the population
of Northern Ireland were Catholic or Protestant and other Christian by community back-
ground. Thus, Northern Ireland can reasonably be treated as a two-group case and analyses
of segregation in Northern Ireland are generally concerned with the two main groups, since
all other groups are very small in number. The choice of Catholics as numerator in the ratio
is not signiﬁcant – selecting ‘non-Catholics’ (the large majority of which are Protestants)
would alter the sign of the logratios, but the results of the analyses would be the same.

The ﬁrst stage of the analysis is based on the Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation
coefﬁcient (equivalent to the correlogram) (Moran 1950, Cliff and Ord 1973). For row-
standardised weights, wij, between locations i and j (i.e. the weights sum to 1) Moran’s I
can be given by

I =

(cid:2)
(z(xi) − ¯z)2

where z(xi) is an observation at the ith location xi and the values have the mean ¯z. The
proximity between locations i and j given by wij is often set to 1 when locations i and j are
neighbours, and 0 when they are not, with wij = 0 when i = j (as in this analysis, and the
weights are subsequently row-standardised). Queen case contiguity is used in this study;
that is, zones sharing edges and vertices are included in the calculations.

The key tool in this analysis is the variogram, γ (h). The experimental variogram can

be estimated for the p(h) paired observations, z(xi), z(xi + h), i = 1, 2, . . . , p(h) with

where h is the lag (distance and direction) by which two observations are separated. The
size of the population from which percentages are calculated varies from place to place;
therefore there is spatial variation in the level of reliability of the data (Goovaerts et al.
2005). Various schemes have been developed to weight estimation of structure functions
according to the underlying population. Goovaerts et al. (2005) employed several different
population-based weighting schemes for the estimation of the variogram. The use of these
weighting schemes was explored in this analysis. However, partly as a function of the large
sample size (see Section 2.1) and the regularity of the samples (i.e. they are counts on a
grid), population weighting did not markedly alter the form of the variograms and so only
the standard unweighted variograms are presented.

A mathematical model can be ﬁtted to the variogram that can be used, for example, to
inform spatial prediction with kriging (see, e.g. Webster and Oliver 2007). In this article,
the widely used spherical model was applied. The spherical model is a bounded model –
that is the variance is ﬁnite and the variogram reaches a plateau. A nugget effect, which
represents measurement error and variation at a distance smaller than that represented by
the sample spacing, was also ﬁtted to the variograms in this study. Figure 2 gives an exam-
ple of a bounded variogram model with a nugget effect included. The range represents
the spatial scale of variation while the structured component represents spatially correlated
variation. In practice, multiple structures may be ﬁtted such that, for example, there may
be a nugget effect, two ranges and two structured components. Models can be ﬁtted by eye,
but a more common approach is to use a ﬁtting procedure such as weighted least squares
(WLS). More detailed accounts of the variogram and other structure functions are provided
by Webster and Oliver (2007) and Wackernagel (2003). Global variograms were estimated
and modelled (with WLS) using the Gstat software (Pebesma and Wesseling 1998).

In addition to global variograms, local variation in spatial structure was accounted for
through the use of local variograms. The principle of local variogram estimation and mod-
elling is discussed by Haas (1990) and Lloyd (2011). Currently, there are relatively few
applications which make use of local variograms in any context and there are none which
use local variograms to characterise the structure of populations. The procedure followed in
this case was as follows: (1) variograms were estimated in a moving window (e.g. using the
nearest 250 neighbours to a given location) and (2) models were then ﬁtted automatically
using the VARFIT WLS routine (Pardo-Igúzquiza 1999) such that there are then model
coefﬁcients for all data locations. VARFIT offers different weighting schemes (e.g. based

on numbers of pairs at a given lag). Here no weighting was employed as this approach was
found to provide the most meaningful results in terms of model ﬁts and interpretability.
In VARFIT, no prior values are required for the variogram model coefﬁcients. Models are
ﬁtted using the simplex method of function minimisation detailed by Nelder and Mead
(1965). The application of the MLREML routine provided by Pardo-Igúzquiza (1997) was
also assessed for local model ﬁtting. As noted by Lloyd (2010c), this approach is quite slow
and it was found to be impractical for the present purpose. Local variogram estimation was
conducted using a Fortran 77 program which estimated variograms locally given n nearest
neighbours and then called the VARFIT routine to ﬁt models.

Moran’s I is used as a means of assessing autocorrelation given immediate neighbours
of each cell. In contrast, the variogram is, here, used to assess the spatial scale of variation
(persistence of spatial dependence (positive autocorrelation) across spatial scales). So, the
aim is not to compare the two measures but to use them in a complementary manner.

3. Analysis
The maps of percentage Catholics in Figure 1a (1971) and b (2001) demonstrate the main
geographical trends in religion clearly. There were large proportions of Catholics in the
rural west and the south of Northern Ireland during both periods, with a predominantly
Catholic west of Belfast. Comparison of the map for 2001 with that for 1971 suggests
growth in the Catholic proportional share of the population in many areas, including west
Belfast. The next stage of the analysis is based on Moran’s I using queen contiguity. As
noted above, I is equivalent to the correlogram (rather than the variogram), but it is used in
common with previous work (Lloyd 2010a) and was regarded as a sensible ﬁrst step. Table
1 details Moran’s I for logratios and, for comparative purposes, raw percentages. Both sets
of values suggest that, from 1971 to 2001, there was a clear increase in spatial dependence
between cells with respect to religion. The large increase from 1971 to 1991 and the rel-
atively small difference between values for 1991 and 2001 is mirrored in the analysis of
Shuttleworth and Lloyd (2009), who were concerned with measuring the dimensions of
unevenness and exposure rather than spatial concentration or, as it is termed by Massey
and Denton (1988), clustering.

Moran’s I as implemented above relates only to contiguous cells. To account for mul-
tiple spatial scales, global variograms were estimated using the logratio data. Figure 3
shows variograms, and ﬁtted models, for the religion logratios (1971, 1991 and 2001) and
the community background logratio (2001). Two spherical structures were ﬁtted to each of
the variograms and the model coefﬁcients are given in Table 2. In short, these structures
demonstrate that there are two major spatial scales of variation in the logratios represented
by the two range values for each model. These appear to reﬂect urban structures (dominated
by Belfast; the smaller range ﬁgures) and region-wide structures (the larger range ﬁgures).
The smaller range ﬁgures correspond closely to the 5 km ﬁgure identiﬁed by Shuttleworth
et al. (2011), as being representative of the dominant spatial scale of residential segrega-
tion. The variograms suggest that there has been little change in the spatial structure of the
population from 1971 to 2001, since there is so little difference in the range values for each
census year. However, the relatively large differences in the structured component values
(and the total sill) reﬂect a large increase in the magnitude of variation from 1971 to 1991.
In short, the geographical pattern of religion persists across the study period, but the var-
iograms suggest that the difference between localities has increased over this period. The
variograms for 1991 and 2001 are very similar in form, suggesting minimal change over
this period. For completeness, data for 1981 were assessed, but the substantial undercount

in some areas was apparent in the markedly different values of Moran’s I, as well as the
semivariances.

The ﬁnal stage of the analysis was based on locally derived variograms. After
experimentation, a neighbourhood of 250 cells was selected for variogram estimation.
The objective with neighbourhood selection was to balance several factors including
the requirements for (1) a sample size large enough to robustly estimate the variogram,
(2) distances large enough to identify a range and (3) a small enough area that local
characteristics can be represented rather than trends over regions. The selected neighbour-
hood was judged to fulﬁl these requirements. Much smaller neighbourhoods would not
allow determination of a range coefﬁcient while variograms estimated given much larger
neighbourhoods would become closer to the global variogram as the neighbourhood size
is increased. In all cases, nugget effects and single spherical components were ﬁtted to
the local variograms. Figure 4 shows the structured components for models ﬁtted to local
variograms for 1971 (Figure 4a) and 2001 (Figure 4b; for religion). Comparison of Figure
4a and b with Figure 1a and b indicates that the structured component highlights regions
with neighbouring areas that have markedly different characteristics. For example, the
southern half of the Ards Peninsula (to the south-east of Belfast) includes discrete areas
with a Catholic or a Protestant majority. Comparison of Figure 4a and b suggests that

in some areas (most notably Belfast and parts of the mid-west), there was an increase in
variation between localities between 1971 and 2001. In other words, ‘Catholic areas’ and
‘Protestant areas’ were more deﬁned and distinct from one another in 2001 than they had
been in 1971. The local nugget effects (not shown) are generally small in the east and in
urban areas and large in rural areas, including much of the west of Northern Ireland. This
suggests greater similarity, on average, in adjacent cells in urban areas as against rural
areas. In other words, Catholic areas and Protestant areas are more spatially deﬁned in
urban rather than rural regions.

Figure 5 shows the ranges of the local variogram models for 1971 (Figure 5a) and
2001 (Figure 5b). In both maps, the ranges are generally small in the more sparsely occu-
pied rural west. Examination of Figure 4a and b suggests that the percentage of Catholics
is highly spatially variable in these areas. Large ranges occur in areas which border large
Catholic and Protestant areas. Areas which are very homogenous, in terms of the religion of
their occupants, may have small ranges as the data in the local neighbourhood may largely
comprise members of only one religious grouping and thus the range may represent (rela-
tively small) local variations in the share of the group rather than discrete concentrations of
one group as against the other. For many areas, the range values for 2001 are larger than for
1971. In Belfast, for example, a band of moderately large values running from north-east to
south-west is apparent in Figure 5b, but it is much less obvious in Figure 5a. This suggests
that the size of areas dominated by one group or the other (i.e. Catholics or Protestants) has
clearly increased in some areas. The general picture is one of increased spatial concentra-
tions of an individual group in the areas with the most pronounced concentrations in 1971,
with little change in many other areas.

While the models generally represented well the form of the local variograms esti-
mated, poor ﬁts may have an impact on results in some areas. Therefore, as a further means
of assessing the local variograms, the semivariances in the ﬁrst distance band (average dis-
tance close to 1 km) and the 10th distance band (average distance close to 10 km) were
extracted and the ratio of the second to the ﬁrst was computed. A similar approach was
used by Reardon et al. (2008) who computed the ratio H4000 m/H500 m, where H is the
spatial information theory index and the subscript refers to the bandwidth of a spatial ker-
nel used to compute the index. Figure 6 shows the ratios for 1971 (Figure 6a) and 2001
(Figure 6b). The maps suggest an increase in semivariances at the 10 km lag with respect
to semivariances at the 1 km lag. In the terminology of Reardon et al. (2008) (but with dif-
ferent speciﬁc deﬁnitions), this suggests an increase in macro-segregation with respect to
micro-segregation. This, in combination with the Moran’s I results (presented in Table 1),
suggests that micro-segregation increased from 1971 to 2001 (but most notably from 1971
to 1991), but that macro-segregation has also, in relative terms, increased.

4. Discussion

The analyses presented demonstrate changes in the religious geography of Northern Ireland
between 1971 and 2001. In particular, it is shown that spatial dependence in the religion
logratio (what could be termed micro-segregation), as measured by Moran’s I, increased
from 1971 to 1991, but the 2001 ﬁgure is similar to that for 1991. This ﬁnding supports the
conclusions of Shuttleworth and Lloyd (2009), who showed that unevenness and exposure
increased from 1971 to 1991, with much smaller differences between the ﬁgures for 1991
and 2001.

The global variograms capture dominant scales of variation across Northern Ireland
and they suggest minimal change in the religious structure of the population across the

whole area between 1971 and 2001. However, there is evidence of increased concentrations
in that Catholic-dominated and Protestant-dominated areas have become more spatially
deﬁned; this is supported in part by the ﬁndings of Shuttleworth and Lloyd (2009) who are
concerned instead with unevenness, exposure and the proportion of each group who lived
in areas with above a given proportion of that group. With regard to the latter, Shuttleworth
and Lloyd (2009) showed that the percentage of Catholics who lived in areas which were
dominated by Catholics increased markedly between 1971 and 2001, while there were
small equivalent increases for Protestants. This study adds to these ﬁndings by demon-
strating that variation within certain localities has decreased while differences between
these localities have increased. In short, the sizes of areas dominated by one group or the
other have increased in some regions. The variogram structured components (and total
sills) themselves reﬂect unevenness – as they increase, this suggests that the population
has become more unevenly distributed in terms of religion.

The local variogram model coefﬁcients do suggest quite large changes in some local-
ities. These support and exemplify the interpretations made from the global variograms.
That is, in some localities there is clear evidence of an increase in the magnitude of dif-
ferences between places, as indicated by the structured component maps (Figure 4). In
addition, the sizes of areas dominated by one of the two major religious groups (indi-
cated by the local ranges) have increased in some areas. These ﬁndings, in addition to
the Moran’s I results alluded to above, suggest that in terms of the clustering dimension
of Massey and Denton (1988), residential segregation increased from 1971 to 1991, with
little change (at the Northern Ireland scale) from 1991 to 2001. Polarisation of the two
religious groups (that is, increased concentrations of each group in discrete areas) is appar-
ent in the much larger total sill of the 1991 (and 2001) global variogram models when
compared with that for 1971. In contrast, changes to the spatial scale of variation of reli-
gion are apparent only from the local variogram ranges, and large changes are restricted
to speciﬁc localities, including the Belfast area. Clearly, the local range highlights domi-
nant spatial scales of variation and, in order to identify changes in the immediate locality
of a cell, other measures must be used. For example, local Moran’s I provides one such
measure. One important distinction with such an approach concerns how cells (or zones
generally) are compared. Local variogram values are obtained given paired observations
from all locations within a data subset, rather than values being computed with respect to
the central data location only. Thus, if the relationship between a speciﬁc cell and its imme-
diate neighbours is of interest, then the local variogram approach employed here would not
be suitable.

The ratio between semivariances for (approximately) 10 km and 1 km provides another
perspective. Where the ratios are small this suggests marked variation over short distances.
Thus, a rural area with a patchy (salt and pepper) appearance in terms of the percentage
Catholics would have a small ratio. A large ratio might represent a region with, in relative
terms, large homogeneous areas dominated by one group or the other. Comparison of, for
example, Figure 1b (percentage Catholics in 2001) and Figure 6b (ratios for 2001) supports
these interpretations. A case of a large ratio is the Ards Peninsula which Figure 1b reveals
to have quite large percentages of Catholics in the southern half and small percentages
in the northern half. The small ratios in the mid-west of Northern Ireland correspond to
highly variable percentages in neighbouring cells. This component has links to the analysis
of Reardon et al. (2008) who assess the slope of the segregation proﬁle given spatial kernel
radii of 500 m and 4000 m. Such a scheme could usefully be compared to the approach
employed here. Terminologically, small ratios represent cases where micro-segregation has
a greater role and large ratios correspond to areas where macro-segregation dominates.

The key advantage of the local variogram range is that the scale of variation is deter-
mined from the data rather than pre-specifying scale values such as the kernel radii of
500 m and 4000 m used by Reardon et al. (2008). Poulsen et al. (2010) considered the pos-
sibility of identifying an optimal bandwidth where geographically weighted approaches
are applied. The estimation and modelling of the (local) variogram is analogous in that the
range of the variogram model provides information on the main scales of spatial variation
in the same way that the ‘optimal’ bandwidth would correspond to some meaningful scale
of spatial variation in the variable of concern. The use of variograms could be adapted
in a variety of ways. Alternative automated model ﬁtting procedures may provide better
ﬁtting models than those used in this analysis. In addition, taking into account direc-
tional variations in population structures (i.e. employing an anisotropic model) may be
beneﬁcial.

5. Summary and conclusions

This article presents an approach to characterising the spatial structure of the population
globally and locally and demonstrates through a case study how the spatial structure of
religion in Northern Ireland changed between 1971 and 2001. The global variograms
provide a useful overview, but the local variogram models give a much richer picture
of the population structure by religion and this approach allows quite detailed assess-
ment of local changes over this time period. Local variogram models characterise the
scale and magnitude of segregation locally; such information is central to understand-
ing the nature of segregation speciﬁcally and population concentrations generally. The
ﬁndings of the case study support the research of Shuttleworth and Lloyd (2009) in
demonstrating marked changes in the population structure between 1971 and 1991, with
much smaller changes between 1991 and 2001. The local variogram results allow assess-
ment of regional variations in population structures, and these variations are shown to be
considerable.

The current analysis could be expanded in a variety of ways. The (global and local)
variogram is shown to be a useful summary of the structure of the population – here in
terms of religion. As well as a means of exploring population structures, the variogram
may provide the basis of a population reallocation procedure. Goovaerts (2008) detailed
a procedure whereby the point support variogram can be derived iteratively from the area
support variogram as a ﬁrst stage in reallocating population counts from areas to points.
Another approach to assessing changes in population spatial concentrations through time
would be to compute signiﬁcant clusters (as done by Lloyd 2010a, using 2001 population
data for Northern Ireland) and comparing the size of these clusters for different time peri-
ods. The present analysis could also be expanded to include other variables. This would
help in assessing further spatial patterns of segregation by religion and in understanding
factors which underlie micro- and macro-segregation (Reardon et al. 2008). A comparative
assessment of spatial segregation indices would be also worthwhile. In addition, an assess-
ment of an innovative new approach which treats attribute similarity and proximity among
observations as discrete components (Wong 2011) would enhance the analyses presented
here. This study terminates in 2001 and expanding its range to include data from the 2011
Census, as they become available, is a key objective. Finally, the use of local variograms
in other regions where there are multiple groups (e.g. by ethnicity) would enable fuller
assessment of the approach. Such analyses could be based on balances (see Egozcue and
Pawlowsky-Glahn 2005), an appropriate framework for the analysis of data expressed as
proportions.

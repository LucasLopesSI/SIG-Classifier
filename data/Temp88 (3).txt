Abstract
Climate-space models were constructed for 241 plant species from a sample of 86
nature  reserve  communities  in  Great  Britain.  Convex  Hull  climate  envelopes  were
used  to compile  Mutual Climatic Range diagrams  for  selected  species  at each  site.
Present-day and potential future climatic values over the next 100 years were compared
against the climatic ranges of the species. A new Combined Envelope (a quadratic
logistic regression probability surface constrained by a Convex Hull envelope) was
used in a Climate Change Trend Analysis to determine future climatic suitability for
species at each site (de(cid:222)ned as a change in probability of species(cid:213) presence). Results
indicate  that  the  warming  climate  could  favour  a  large  proportion  of  plants  on
Scottish reserves (excepting montane species) and be less favourable for many plants
on reserves in the south of England. The situation appears to be one of (cid:212)no change(cid:213)
for the majority of species on Welsh reserves and those further north in England.

1 Introduction

The general ethos behind nature reserve management, in Britain and elsewhere, has been
to maintain reserves for favoured species or communities (Parsons 1991). The limitation
of such a conservation strategy is apparent in the light of research which shows that the
eventual  response  to  climate  change  is  an  adjustment  of  species(cid:213)  ranges  (Huntley  and
Webb  1989,  Parmesan  1996,  Keinast  et  al.  1998).  As  range  adjustments  take  place,
currently  valued  communities  within  reserves,  which  have  been  the  focus  of  conserva-
tion  efforts,  may  disassociate.  In  Britain,  where  nature  reserves  tend  to  form  habitat

(cid:213)islands(cid:213)  for  species  in  a  landscape  dominated  by  other  land  uses,  the  possibility  of
species(cid:213)  colonising  other  habitat  islands  which  may  become  climatically  suitable  could
be  limited  (Markham  et  al.  1993).  Huntley  (1999)  suggests  that  reserve  communities
will lose species at a faster rate than potential new species can colonise, leading to a long
period of impoverishment for many reserves.

Relatively  few  attempts  have  been  made  to  quantify  the  possible  extent  to  which
individual  nature  reserves  or  nature  reserve  networks  might  be  affected  by  climate
change. deGroot and Ketner (1994) describe a study by Leemans (undated) which exam-
ined potential changes in Holdridge Life Zones for 2,618 nature reserves of over 1,000
ha  across  the  world,  using  climate  change  scenarios  from  four  GCM  experiments.
Between  16%  and  60%  of  reserves  were  projected  to  experience  a  shift  in  vegetation
class,  depending  on  the  scenario  used.  A  similar  study  by  Villers-Ruiz  and  Trejo-
V(cid:135)zquez (1998) for forest biomes in 33 protected areas in Mexico, found that 24 (72%)

time  between  the  middle  and  end  of  this  century).  By  the  same  methods  Halpin  (cited
in Rose and Hurst 1990) estimated changes in vegetation class for between 55%—80%
of the 243 terrestrial UNESCO (cid:212)Man and Biosphere(cid:213) reserves. 

The  main  limitation  of  the  modelling  methods  used  by  these  studies  is  that  they
  vegetation  type  to  another.  Accordingly,  they
illustrate  a  transition  from  one 
may not re(cid:223)ect the actual present-day vegetation or species composition at a particular
site. Therefore the projections made are theoretical and may have little potential applica-
tion in conservation planning.

potential

An alternative method, devised by Herman and Scott (1992, 1994) and applied to
Nova Scotia, consists of a system for scoring the sensitivity of species to climate change.
The  system  incorporates  environmental  variables  relevant  to  individual  species  at  a
given location. By ranking the scores, species most (cid:212)at risk(cid:213) due to their intrinsic climatic
sensitivities  and  particular  biological  attributes  can  be  identi(cid:222)ed.  By  combining  the
scores  of  the  species  it  contains,  this  approach  could  provide  an  indication  of  the
vulnerability  of  a  nature  reserve  to  climate  change.  However,  the  method  is  very  data
intensive and interpretation of scores is complex. In a similar British-based study, Telfer
and Eversham (1992) were faced with the problem of insuf(cid:222)cient autecological informa-
tion to calculate scores for many British species. 

The  aim  of  the  research  described  in  this  paper  was  to  develop  a  new  modelling
method, capable of providing climate change impact information that relates to actual
records for sites and could therefore be utilised by conservation planners, but which has
minimal data requirements. 

2 Background

The method adopted in this study originates with research dating back to the nineteenth
century,  which  endeavoured  to  summarise  species  distributions  graphically  in  climatic
terms.  Iversen  (1944)  describes  studies  dating  from  the  1820s  that  determined  the
(cid:212)thermosphere(cid:213) of a plant, described by the sum of temperature conditions encountered
within  its  distributional  range.  Iversen(cid:213)s  own  study  produced  (cid:212)limit  curves(cid:213)  for  Holly
Ilex  aquifolium
  in  which  the  values  of
mean  temperature  of  the  warmest  month  and  mean  temperature  of  the  coldest  month

at a number of meteorological stations were plotted. The boundary between where the
species  was  present  and  reproductive,  and  where  it  was  absent  or  not  reproducing,
indicated the climatic limit for the species. This approach was also used by Grichuk (1969)
who created a boundary around the set of values on the graph to form an envelope. 

These  studies  and  the  many  others  that  have  followed,  are  here  termed  (cid:212)climate-
space models.(cid:213) Climate-space models are a type of static correlative model that provide
a representation of the climatic range in which a species (or vegetation type) can exist,
generally visualised as a graph. The basis of climate-space modelling is the transforma-
tion  of  records  for  species  presence  or  relative  abundance  from  geographical  locations
to points on a graph that has axes representing climatic variables which are considered
to  act  as  controls  on  the  species  distribution.  Each  species  record  is  assigned  a  posi-
tion on the graph determined from the values of these variables obtained for the same
locations.  The  climate-space  may  be  a  simple  two-dimensional  representation,  or  an
n-dimensional hyperspace where each n axis represents an environmental variable.

In  order  to  produce  a  climate-space  model  that  encompasses  the  total  range  of
climatic  values  under  which  a  particular  species  exists,  in  theory,  the  complete  global
distribution of the species would need to be known. However, it has been demonstrated
Fallopia japonica
by Huntley et al. (1989) for 
that continental-scale distributions can be suf(cid:222)cient to encompass most or all of a spe-
cies(cid:213) climatic range. Climate—space models based on smaller geographic units (e.g. Great
Britain) have yet to be widely tested. Carey et al. (1994/5) produced an accurate climate-

climate and distribution data but concluded that this was because most of the climatic
variation across the range of this species is found within Britain, which may not be the
case for other species. They recommend that models forecasting changes in British dis-
tributions should ideally be based on data from a larger geographic region.

Agrostis curtisii

Various methods have been used in climate-space models to de(cid:222)ne a relationship that
describes the climate-space. This may entail creating some form of boundary or (cid:212)envelope(cid:213)
around the plot (e.g. the BIOCLIM model, Nix 1986; or the HABITAT model of Walker
and Cocks 1991), or involve de(cid:222)ning a mathematical relationship between the data points
and climate (e.g. using regression methods, Lenihan 1993) to produce a (cid:212)response surface(cid:213).
Atkinson  et  al.  (1986,  1987)  developed  a  novel  use  for  climate  envelopes  in  the
Mutual  Climatic  Range  method  of  palaeo-climate  reconstruction.  They  constructed
climate  envelopes  from  the  present-day  distributions  of  species  of  Coleoptera  (beetles)
using temperature variables. By overlaying climate envelopes of the same species found
together as fossils at particular sites, it was possible to estimate the past temperatures at
the site from the area of overlap of the climate envelopes. This area of overlap represents
the  shared  climate-space  of  the  assemblage,  or  the  (cid:212)Mutual  Climatic  Range(cid:213)  (MCR).
Sinka  (1993)  and  Sinka  and  Atkinson  (1999)  have  extended  the  method  to  other  taxa
(amphibians, reptiles and plants).

2.1 Using the Mutual Climatic Range Approach for Identifying Climate 
Change Impacts

The MCR method offers a fairly simple and easily implemented means of visualising the
climatic ranges of a large number of species from a location in relation to climatic values
at the site, and suggested a means for examining the potential future impacts of climate
change  on  the  current  species  assemblages  of  nature  reserves.  The  example  shown  in

Estimating Impacts of Climate Change

The  climate  change  values  shown  in Figure  1  were  derived  from  scenarios  based
on  the  results  of  three  General  Circulation  Model  (GCM)  experiments,  which  resolve
 resolution. An explanation of the construction of
global climate data at a 2.5
these scenarios follows next, as both the scenarios and the climatic variables previously
described (TMAX and TRANGE) contribute to the modelling process that is described
in Section 4.

3 Construction of Spatially Explicit and Time-dependent Climate 
Change Scenarios

The climate change scenarios used in this study were based on output from three global
General Circulation Models. This was to ensure that the results would provide a reason-
able re(cid:223)ection of the range of uncertainty both in the magnitude and spatial realisa-
tion of climate change projections, in accordance with the IPCC guidelines for assessing
climate change impacts (Carter et al. 1994). Two of the GCMs are equilibrium models,
UKHI  (Mitchell  et  al.  1989)  and  CCC  (Boer  et  al.  1992),  which  represent  the  climate
. One is a transient
change that would occur in response to a one-step doubling of CO
2
model  UKTR  (Murphy  and  Mitchell  1995),  which  represents  the  climate  change  asso-
.  Transient  models  give  a  more  realistic
ciated  with  a  1%  per  year  increase  in  CO
2
representation  of  how  climate  is  likely  to  evolve  and  have  now  replaced  equilibrium
models. The climate changes described by all of the GCMs used in this study are com-
parable  to  the  low  end  of  the  range  of  magnitude  given  by  the  most  recent  scenarios
produced  by  Hulme  et  al.  (2002),  based  on  the  HadCM3  climate  model  (Johns  et  al.
 grid as the 1961—90
2001). Output from the GCMs was interpolated to the same 0.5
baseline  climatic  data  by  Hulme  et  al.  (1994)  using  a  distance-weighting  technique
described  by  Santer  (1988)  and  was  made  available  to  this  study  through  the  Climate
Impacts LINK project (see http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/link/ for additional details).

The  interpolated  GCM  output  is  in  the  form  of  (cid:212)change  (cid:222)elds(cid:213)  i.e.  the  difference
between  GCM  (cid:212)control  run(cid:213)  simulating  current  climate  and  (cid:212)perturbed  run(cid:213)  simulating
C of global warming. In order
enhanced greenhouse gas induced climate, expressed per 
to  (cid:222)t  a  time-reference  to  these  change  (cid:222)elds  Hulme  et  al.  (1994)  used  an  (cid:212)upwelling
diffusion-energy balance(cid:213) climate model (MAGICC, Wigley 1994). Such models, though
based  on  simpli(cid:222)ed  physics,  give  similar  results  to  GCMs  when  globally  averaged
(Houghton et al. 1992). By running MAGICC for a particular IPCC policy-based emis-
sions scenario, in this case IS92a, choosing to exclude the effects of sulphate aerosols
as  they  were  not  modelled  in  the  GCMs,  and  opting  for  the  central  sensitivity  value
C,  the  mean  annual  global  temperature  change  was  computed  for  particular
of  2.5
decades. In the case of the equilibrium experiments, the change (cid:222)elds were multiplied by
C (2100s) and then added to
0.62
values from the 1961—90 data set (Hulme et al. 1993) to produce the (cid:222)nal scenarios. In
the case of the transient experiment, change (cid:222)eld data for selected model run years can
be  added  directly  to  the  baseline  data  set.  The  MAGICC  model  is  used  to  relate  the
global  warming  values  associated  with  those  run  years  to  calendar  years.  In  this  case,
model run years 31— 40 are associated with global warming of 0.68
C, which assuming
central climate sensitivity, is likely to be realised by 2023, and model run years 66—75
C,  and  likely  to  be  realised  by  2065.  The

This approach to scenario construction allows the different spatial representations
of  climate  change  portrayed  by  the  three  GCMs  to  be  taken  into  account  as  well  as
permitting the consideration of impacts at different time horizons. Figures 2b-d and 3b-
d illustrate these scenarios for TMAX and TRANGE for Great Britain in the middle of
the next century. The data for the present day climate and the climate change scenarios
plotted  on  the  MCR  diagram  in  Figure  1  are  obtained  by  extracting  the  values  from
maps such as in Figures 2 and 3 for the grid references of particular sites. As previously
mentioned,  Figure  1  shows  the  present-day  climate  correctly  positioned  within  the
MCR and indicates projected future climatic values moving away from or outside of the
MCR, i.e. outside the climate-space of one or more species. The question raised by this
observation  is  whether  those  species  would  be  able  to  persist  at  that  location,  under
climate regimes that are outside of their recorded climatic range. 

Although MCR diagrams are useful for illustration purposes, interpretation of potential
climate change impacts from the diagrams is limited. Where future climates fall outside
the MCR the only conclusion possible is that community composition at the site could
be affected by climate change as future temperatures are likely to change to values not
experienced  by  at  least  some  of  the  species  anywhere  within  their  current  European
range.  Nevertheless,  our  investigations  of  the  MCR  approach  suggested  an  alternative
location-based  method  for  assessing  the  impacts  of  climate  change,  which  can  be
expressed in terms of the likelihood of the continued presence of a species at a particular
site. The development and application of this method is described in the following section.

4 Method Development and Data Sources

An overview of the modelling process is shown in Figure 4. Put succinctly, plant distribu-
tional  data  (maps)  and  climatic  data  for  the  same  region  are  used  to  create  climate-
space models for a suite of species recorded at a particular nature reserve. Future climate
scenarios  are  constructed  and  the  climatic  values  from  these  scenarios  are  used  in
conjunction  with  the  climate-space  models  to  determine  the  likelihood  of  the  species
occurrence (probability of presence) at that location in the future as the climate changes.
The  direction  of  change  in  probability  of  presence  allows  an  insight  into  the  potential
impacts that climate change may have on individual species at that site, and consequen-
tially on plant communities, habitat and conservation management.

4.1 Plant Species Data

The  method  was  developed  for  plant  species  due  to  the  importance  of  the  (cid:223)ora  to  the
habitat  of  nature  reserves  and  because  of  the  dependence  upon  plants  by  other  organ-
isms for food and shelter. The analysis was made possible by the availability of suitable
digital mapped distribution data from the (cid:222)rst 10 published volumes of AFE. These map
around 18% of the total European (cid:223)ora and represent around 16% of the British (cid:223)ora
(based on estimates of numbers of species given by Webb 1978). 

Plant records for 66 nature reserves were supplied by managers of county Wildlife
Trust  sites,  National  Nature  Reserves,  and  by  the  Royal  Society  for  the  Protection  of
Birds. These constituted a total of 86 plant lists, representing either the complete (cid:223)oral

record of a nature reserve or relating to one or more distinct plant communities within
a particular site. From these 86 plant lists, AFE distribution maps were available for a total
of 241 species. These 241 species represent in excess of 15% of the (cid:223)ora in the majority
of cases (64 out of 86 lists; range 5— 42%). Therefore, the proportion of species included
in the analysis re(cid:223)ects the proportion of British species mapped by the 10 volumes of AFE.
The  emphasis  in  the  method  development  was  to  produce  a  model  that  would
provide acceptable results (determined statistically and explained below) for the major-
ity  of  nature  reserve  (cid:223)ora,  rather  than  to  create  the  best  individual  model  for  each
species. It was fundamental to the approach that all species should be considered in the
same  climatic  terms  to  enable  a  broad  assessment  of  the  potential  impacts  of  climate
change to be made. 

4.2 Selection of Climatic Variables and Model Form

Seven  combinations  of  eight  temperature  and  moisture  variables  were  tested  in  three
model  variants  —  a  Convex  Hull  model  (following  from  the  work  of  Sinka  1993),  a
logistic regression model and a quadratic logistic regression model — for a sample of 26
species  selected  to  represent  the  widest  possible  range  of  ecological  and  distributional
characteristics  (Table  1).  Both  the  variable  sets  and  model  forms  were  identi(cid:222)ed  as
potentially  suitable  candidates  based  on  an  extensive  review  of  the  literature.  The
combinations of climatic variables are shown in Figure 5 and were all derived from the
1961—90 dataset produced by Hulme et al. (1993).

4.3 Veri(cid:222)cation of the Models

Model  predictions  were  evaluated  by  comparing  them  with  the  recorded  patterns  of
presence/absence  from  which  they  were  derived.  Performance  was  measured  using  the
Kappa  statistic  (Cohen(cid:213)s  Kappa  coef(cid:222)cient  of  agreement;  Cohen  1960).  This  gives  a
measure of agreement between sets of categories.
The Kappa statistic is de(cid:222)ned as follows:

Parr  and  Eatherall  (1994)  utilised  a  similar  quadratic  model  for  simulating  plant
distributions. In that model the resulting regression equation was applied directly to the
climatic  values  at  each  geographic  location  in  the  AFE  study  area.  This  results  in  a
climatically-simulated  distribution  in  which  the  value  at  each  location  represents  the
probability  of  species  presence.  One  feature  of  distributions  simulated  from  regression
models is that the probability values returned by the regression operation (representing
predictions  of  plant  presence)  are  continuous.  Some  means  must  therefore  be  used  to
determine which probability values best represent (cid:212)presence(cid:213) and (cid:212)absence(cid:213). In the work
of Huntley et al. (1995) the allocation of p values to presence and absence classes was
determined  through  the  identi(cid:222)cation  of  a  probability  (cid:212)threshold(cid:213)  which  provided  the
best  match  between  the  probability-simulated  distributions  and  the  recorded  distribu-
tion. This provided a threshold value for presence/absence classi(cid:222)cation, which could be
applied to simulate future-distributions of each species under changed climate scenarios.
The  best  simulation  was  achieved  using  thresholds  ranging  from p  >  0.30  to  p  >  0.50
for the eight species Huntley et al. (1995) studied. 

In  this  research  the  highest  Kappa  values  for  the  majority  of  the  test  species  were
obtained using the variables TMAX and TRANGE with a quadratic logistic regression
and  a  threshold  of  p  >  0.50.  This  model  was  selected  for  use  in  all  further  analysis.
TMAX  and  TRANGE  are  highly  correlated  with  the  more  complex  bioclimatic  vari-
ables often used by other researchers and which are considered to be more closely linked
mechanistically to physiological processes in plants (e.g. see Woodward 1988, Huntley
et  al.  1995;  Figure  5).  This  association  suggests  that  a  model  using  TMAX  and
TRANGE  can  be  considered  biologically  relevant.  Unlike  these  other  sets  of  variables,
however, TMAX and TRANGE are not themselves inter-correlated, which make them
less problematic for mathematical manipulation. 

4.3 Application and Further Development of the Selected Model

The model was applied to all 241 species and produced (cid:212)acceptable(cid:213) agreement (de(cid:222)ned as
a Kappa statistic exceeding 0.40 — i.e. in the (cid:212)fair(cid:213) or better range as de(cid:222)ned by Monserud
and Leemans 1992) for 82% of 241 species included in the study, providing a measure of
con(cid:222)dence that the species(cid:213) distributions are related to climate represented by these variables,
and thereby con(cid:222)rming that the climate envelope is not an artefact with no predictive utility.

However, for the purposes of assessing impacts of climate, a climate-space model is
required that encompasses all records of a species(cid:213) occurrence, in anticipation that if it
can exist under particular climatic conditions in the present day, that it will be able to
persist  under  these  conditions  in  the  near  future.  The  thresholded  probability  model
does  not  provide  this  as  some  low-probability  locations  where  the  species  does  occur
may  be  excluded  by  the  threshold.  The  Convex  Hull  model  does  provide  such  an
envelope, but by itself, as previously discussed, this type of climate-space model pro-
vides limited information with which to evaluate potential impacts.

4.3.1 The Combined Envelope
An alternative use of the regression technique is to apply the equation to a grid repres-
enting the climate-space. This produces a probability surface as shown in Figure 6a for
Babington(cid:213)s Orache Atriplex glabriuscula, an annual plant of sandy or shingle beaches.
Applying  the  regression  coef(cid:222)cients  to  locations  in  climate-space  or  geographic  space
simply  provides  different  representations  of  the  same  data.  Combining  the  probability
surface  with  the  Convex  Hull  envelope  for  a  species  (i.e.  clipping  out  the  area  of  the
probability  surface  that  coincides  with  the  Convex  Hull)  produces  a  climate-space
model  which  summarises  the  range  of  climates  under  which  the  species  is  currently
found  but  also  indicates  the  area  of  the  climate-space  (where  p  >  0.50)  which  best
represents recorded distribution. This (cid:212)Combined Envelope(cid:213) prevents extrapolation from
the  probability  surface  beyond  observed  data.  By  plotting  the  present  climatic  values
relating to the location of a speci(cid:222)c nature reserve plus future values from the climate-
change scenarios onto this (cid:212)Combined Envelope(cid:213), it is possible to determine whether the
species is more or less likely to occur there in the future from the direction of the trend
in  probability  values,  and  also  whether  the  potential  change  in  climate  will  remain
within the recorded climatic range of the species. This is illustrated in Figure 6b, which
shows under the previously described scenarios, a decline in probability of presence over
the coming decades for this species at Oxwich NNR, with some scenarios by the end of
the century indicating climatic values outside of the recorded range of this species. (This
is termed an OE — (cid:212)outside envelope(cid:213) — result).

4.3.2 Deducing trends in probability of presence over time
Combined Envelopes constructed using these methods were employed in an analysis of
the plant list data provided for the nature reserves to determine the trend in probability
of  presence  over  time.  Arc/Info  AML  routines  were  written  to  plot  the  present-day
values of TMAX and TRANGE for the reserve in question in the appropriate position
on the Combined Envelope of each of the selected species in turn. The probability value
for that point of the Combined Envelope could then be extracted and read into a data
(cid:222)le.  This  process  was  repeated  for  the  TMAX  and  TRANGE  values  of  each  scenario.
The differences between present-day probability of presence, and future probabilities of
presence could then be calculated, thereby identifying a trend in probability of presence
over the coming decades.

4.4 Evaluation of the model

As previously mentioned, it was an important element of this study that a general model
should be developed that would allow a broad analysis to be made for a large number
of  species.  Hence,  it  was  considered  important  to  examine  if  the  regression  model

performed better (higher Kappa value) in terms of simulating the recorded distribution
with a threshold of p > 0.50 for some types of species rather than others. No signi(cid:222)cant
relationships were found between species(cid:213) rarity (given as percentage presence — i.e. the
proportion  of  occupied  grid  cells  in  the  AFE  area)  and  Kappa  value,  or  between  plant
life history type (i.e. annual, perennial etc.) and Kappa value. There was some evidence
that species of certain distributional characteristics (as de(cid:222)ned by Preston and Hill 1997)
produced slightly higher Kappa (notably biomes at both latitudinal extremes i.e. Arctic
Montane and Mediterranean) but overall, there was no statistically signi(cid:222)cant difference
relating to distributional type.

The  model  incorporated  climatic  data  at  mid  grid-cell  elevation,  from  a  choice  of
(cid:212)low(cid:213),  (cid:212)mid(cid:213)  or  (cid:212)high(cid:213)  (Hulme  et  al.  1993)  for  the  very  practical  reason  that  climate
change  scenario  data  were  only  available  at  mid  grid-cell  elevation.  Although  it  might
have  been  possible  to  improve  Kappa  values  for  montane  or  coastal  species  by  incor-
porating climate data at a more appropriate elevation, the over-riding consideration was
the  availability  of  scenario  data,  and  the  requirement  to  model  all  species  by  the  same
parameters. 

5 Results: The Climate Change Trend Analysis

For most plants the probability values extracted from the Combined Envelope indicated
a trend of increasing or decreasing probability of presence with time. As it is dif(cid:222)cult to
explain the relevance of a 5% increase or 8% decrease in probability, it was considered
that the most appropriate assessment of these values would be to de(cid:222)ne the trend-with-
time  for  each  species,  and  then  summarise  them  for  each  reserve  to  show  the  propor-
tion of plants expected to experience declining, unchanging, or increasing suitability of
climate over the course of the next 100 years (the period covered by the climate change
scenarios). These results were named the Climate Change Trend Analysis (CCTA). 

The CCTA was undertaken separately for each of the three scenarios (UKHI, CCC,
UKTR) to preserve the geographic variation in the magnitude of climate change shown
by each of them. As an example of the determination of a trend, if the percentage change
in  probability  from  the  present-day  value  under  the  UKHI  scenario  for  a  species  at  a
given  location  was  2020  =  0%,  2050  =  8%,  2100  =  17%,  then  this  is  counted  as  a
positive trend. Likewise, if change in probability under the UKHI scenario was 2020 =
- 4%,  2050  =  - 12%,  2100  =  - 25%,  this  is  counted  as  a  negative  trend.  Change  in
  2%  was  counted  as  (cid:212)no  change(cid:213)  in  climatic  suitability  (e.g.  2020  =
probability  of  +/-
0%,  2050  =  1%,  2100  =  2%,  was  a  (cid:212)no  change(cid:213)  result).  Under  this  threshold  across
all  scenarios,  species  and  sites,  48%  of  the  observations  fall  within  the  (cid:212)no  change(cid:213)
category,  whilst  the  positive  trends  account  for  36%,  and  declining  trends  17%  of
observations respectively.

All plants with Kappa values of 0.40 or less were excluded from the trend summary,
as it was considered that there was insuf(cid:222)cient demonstration of a relationship between
distribution and the climate variables used in the model for such species.

To  evaluate  the  (cid:212)robustness(cid:213)  of  the  CCTA,  the  results  tables  for  the  four  reserves
which  supplied  the  most  comprehensive  species  data  were  re-analysed  to  examine  the
trend using species only with Kappa values greater than 0.55 (i.e. in the (cid:212)good(cid:213) or better
ranges de(cid:222)ned by Monserud and Leemans 1992). This exercise indicated that the overall
proportions of species in each group (increase, no change, decrease) remained relatively

' Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003

360

T Dockerty and A Lovett

stable.  In  particular,  the  proportion  of  plants  shown  as  experiencing  an  increase  in
climatic  suitability  appeared  to  be  fairly  robust.  Excluding  species  with  (cid:212)fair(cid:213)  Kappa
values  changed  the  proportion  of  plants  in  this  category  by  only  2- 6%.  There  was
more variability in results when excluding species with (cid:212)fair(cid:213) Kappa values for the pro-
portion  of  plants  projected  to  experience  no  change  (- 15  to  +10%)  or  a  decline  in
climatic  suitability  (- 15  to  +12%).  The  overall  evaluation  of  the  CCTA,  which  must
be  considered  when  interpreting  the  results,  is  that  there  is  some  interplay  between
(cid:212)no  change(cid:213)  and  (cid:212)declining(cid:213)  trend  results  within  around  – 10%,  but  that  increased
trends  appear  to  be  fairly  reliable.  The  CCTA  was  therefore  accepted  as  providing  a
satisfactory basis on which to examine how nature reserves are likely to be affected by
climate change.

It  should  be  noted  that  for  each  species  it  is  possible  to  calculate  probability  of
presence  by  applying  the  regression  equation  to  future  TMAX  and  TRANGE  values
for  the  geographic  location  of  the  reserve  identi(cid:222)ed  in  the  Arc/Info  coverage  for  each
scenario. However, this method would not highlight an OE result. The bene(cid:222)ts of using
the climate envelopes are that the probability values at a location now and in the future,
in relation to the overall climatic preferences of each species, can be seen on one diagram
(as illustrated by Figure 6b).

The  results  of  the  CCTA  are  summarised  in Table  3.  This  indicates  that  the  CCC
scenarios tend to produce the most conservative assessments of change, whilst the UKHI
scenarios  produce  the  most  extreme  results  (more  declining  trends,  and  fewer  (cid:212)no
changes(cid:213)). UKTR scenarios offer an interpretation of climate change impacts somewhere
between the other two, but more closely resembling the UKHI projections. (It should be
noted however, that the time period of UKTR scenarios varies slightly from the UKHI
and CCC scenarios). However the most interesting feature of the results can be observed
when  they  are  plotted  geographically  in  the  GIS.  This  shows  a  gradient  in  the  propor-
tions of species in each trend category across Great Britain, with higher proportions of
species showing an increasing trend in probability of presence (indicating that the warm-
ing climate will become increasingly favourable) on Scottish reserves (with the exception
of  montane  species)  and  higher  proportions  of  species  showing  a  decreasing  trend  in
probability  of  presence  (indicating  that  the  climate  will  become  less  favourable)  for
many reserves in the south of England. The situation appears to be one of (cid:212)no change(cid:213)
for the majority of species on Welsh reserves and those further north in England. This
general  trend  is  illustrated  for  a  selection  of  the  sites  in  Figure  7  using  the  UKHI
scenario.  The  map  portrays  a  sample  of  the  sites  for  clarity  but  the  same  geographic
pattern was observed across all sites, and when grouping reserves by habitat type — i.e.
woodland  NVCs;  other  woodland  and  scrub;  grass,  heath  and  moor;  marsh  and  fen;
sand dune and salt marsh — see Table 3.

At  Loch  Lomond  NNR  and  Loch  of  Kinnordy  (an  RSPB  reserve)  in  Scotland,  in
excess of 60% of the species modelled are likely to bene(cid:222)t from higher temperatures. In
the  south  east  of  England  the  opposite  trend  is  apparent,  for  example  at  Pashford
Poors Fen, 56% of the species modelled are projected to experience a decline in climatic
suitability  under  the  UKHI  scenario.  Several  other  reserves  in  this  region  also  show
declining  climatic  suitability  for  around  40%  of  species.  These  results  indicate  that
the  method  is  capable  of  highlighting  regional  differences  in  projected  impacts  and
could  potentially  provide  a  tool  to  help  target  conservation  resources  towards
protecting  valued  communities  in  regions  least  likely  to  be  negatively  impacted  by
climate change.

The shifting trends in probability of presence suggest the potential for competitive
changes amongst plant communities, with species better suited to the warming climate
becoming  more  vigorous,  which  might  lead  to  increased  reproductive  capacity  and
abundance, at the expense of those species exhibiting a declining likelihood of presence.
Examining  the  results  for  the  suite  of  species  at  a  particular  site  might  enable  the
identi(cid:222)cation of those likely to become problem weeds, or allow different management
to mitigate against competitive pressures. Comparing the trends for the same species at
different  sites  could  assist  in  the  identi(cid:222)cation  of  sites  where  conservation  efforts  are
most likely to succeed.

6 Discussion

The geographical differences indicated by the results of the CCTA are not the result of
an  overriding  presence  of  any  particular  species.  Figure  8  indicates  the  frequency  of
occurrence of all of the species contributing to the CCTA (i.e. with Kappa values > 40)
and  re(cid:223)ects  the  fact  that  most  lists  are  composed  of  a  variety  of  both  commonly  and
more rarely occurring species. Currently the main limitations in applying the methodo-
logy  and  interpreting  the  results  arise  from  the  fact  that  for  the  majority  of  species  at
each site AFE distribution data are not yet available. In addition, species data provided
for the sites has not been comprehensive in every case. 

Figure 8 Frequency of occurrence of species in the 86 plant lists. Note: From left to right
the  (cid:222)gure  shows  that  most  species  occur  in  only  around  15%  of  the  86  plant  lists  in  this
sample with a few common species occurring in up to 75% of the plant lists

Obviously the inclusion of more species in the CCTA, as more volumes of AFE are
published, will greatly enhance the utility of the analysis to provide bene(cid:222)cial manage-
ment information. In many cases map data are currently not available to model species
identi(cid:222)ed  by  reserve  managers  as  of  high  management  priority.  The  AFE  volumes  are
published  in  taxonomic  order  and  this  means  that  some  entire  families  are  mapped,
whilst  others  remain  unmapped.  This  factor  would  bias  the  results  if  the  range  of  cli-
matic  tolerances  within  the  plant  families  which  have  been  mapped  are  substantially
different to those yet to be published. With the available data it is not possible to test if
this is the case but there is no reason to suggest that the unmapped plant families would
exhibit very different climatic ranges (Huntley, 2002, pers. comm.). The main bene(cid:222)t of
the  CCTA  methodology  is  that  it  allows  the  direction  of  the  potential  impact,  arising
from  temperature  change,  on  each  species  at  a  site  to  be  identi(cid:222)ed.  The  direction  of
change  identi(cid:222)ed  for  individual  species  at  particular  sites,  could  be  used  by  reserve
managers  to  inform  management  choices;  changes  in  plant  populations  at  each  site
could be monitored against these trends.

There  is  a  wide-ranging  literature  on  the  merits  or  otherwise  of  models  that  repres-
ent  species(cid:213)  distributions  in  climate-space  (e.g.  Davis  et  al.  1998,  Lenihan  1993).  For
example,  issues  relating  to  the  limitations  of  de(cid:222)ning  species(cid:213)  ranges  based  solely  on
biophysical factors when the realised distribution of a species may be constrained by a
number of other factors (e.g. competition or dispersal). This could suggest that a species(cid:213)
potential  climatic  range  is  greater  than  that  indicated  by  a  climate  envelope  produced
from  its  recorded  distribution.  Additionally,  there  are  arguments  as  to  whether  the
recorded distribution of a species is re(cid:223)ective of current conditions or of a past climate
to which present distribution has not yet adjusted (Malanson 1993). Nevertheless, as the
introduction to this paper indicated, there are few practical alternatives to such models
for simultaneously examining large numbers of species and sites (Box et al. 1993). 

7 Conclusions

The approach used in this study is different from other climate-space models that have
been  used  to  assess  climate  change  impacts,  as  those  have  examined  potential  shifts  in
the  distribution  of  species  (e.g.  Huntley  et  al.  1995,  Beerling  et  al.  1995,  Sykes  et  al.
1996, Bartlein et al. 1997). In this work the climate-space models have been applied in
a  different  way,  focusing  on  location,  and  been  used  to  assess  the  impact  of  a  shift  in
climatic suitability at particular sites for the suite of species that exist there. The (cid:212)impact(cid:213)
of climate change has been de(cid:222)ned as the trend in probability of presence for a species
at a location, associated with a change in temperature. A bene(cid:222)t of the method is that
any  number  of  climate  change  scenarios  can  be  plotted  onto  the  Combined  Envelope
and  included  in  the  CCTA,  allowing  assessment  of  the  degree  of  consistency  between
scenarios (or conversely, an indication of the uncertainty in the projections). 

The  CCTA,  like  the  MCR  method,  respects  the  observation  that  species  respond
individually  to  climate  change  (Huntley  and  Webb  1989)  but  allows  an  assessment  of
the potential direction of that response at particular locations. A further bene(cid:222)t of the
CCTA is that this response can be evaluated at a number of scales, from examining the
projected trend for an individual species at a given location; to considering the potential
ecological impacts of changes in the relative composition of species at a particular loca-
tion; or comparing responses for a variety of locations. The CCTA has also illustrated

T Dockerty and A Lovett

how  the  increasing  temperatures  indicated  from  these  scenarios,  will  lead  to  climates
that are more optimal for some species in some areas and less optimal for the same or
different species in other locations.

In conclusion, using only basic information  — species lists  from sites, species dis-
tribution  maps  and  climate  data  —  it  has  been  possible  to  develop  and  demonstrate  a
methodology that allows some indication of the likely impact of increasing temperatures
on  the  plant  assemblages  of  nature  reserves.  Further  details  are  given  in  Dockerty
(1998).  With  suitable  data  the  approach  could  be  adapted  to  other  taxa.  Additional
analysis  has  been  undertaken  focusing  on  an  ecological  interpretation  of  the  results,
which investigates the implications for individual reserves and examines the geographical
variation in results for reserves of different habitat types. The results of that analysis will
be reported elsewhere.

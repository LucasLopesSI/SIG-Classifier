Abstract
This paper discusses the quantification of vertical surface displacements by means of
grid-based digital elevation models (DEMs). The surface changes are quantified by
comparing altitude and different topographic parameters, which have a geomorphic
significance with respect to surface changes. This paper describes the choice of
different spatial calculation techniques, considering DEM accuracy and the
propagation of error for the different topographic parameters involved. The tech-
niques are illustrated on two grid-based DEMs from Finsterwalderbreen, a 35 km2
sized valley glacier on south-western Spitzbergen, Norwegian High Arctic.

1 Introduction

removing the landforms. The processes

Geomorphology studies the distribution pattern of landforms and their formation.
There is a dynamic relationship between the landforms and the processes building,
modifying or
include some form of
displacement of the earth’s surface material, which varies in relation to velocity,
direction, the amount of material removed and the frequency or return period of the
process (cf. Brunsden 1996). This gradually changes landform topography. Hence, the
type and magnitude of the surface changes give valuable information about type,
magnitude and frequency of the involved processes. In this context glacier ice is a
special case. Ice is a highly deformable viscous medium. The movement of glacier ice
results in a varying glacier surface topography. Surface changes are therefore useful in
describing the glacier’s mass balance and possible changes in the glacier’s movement
(cf. Etzelmu¨ ller and Sollid 1996, 1997).

Digital elevation models (DEMs) now make it possible to quantify a topographic
surface. With two DEMs generated from the same topographic surface with a certain
increment in time it is possible to achieve measures of horizontal and vertical surface
displacements. The quantification of horizontal displacements on images involves large
computational efforts if the aim is the analysis of spatially distributed velocity vectors.
Such information is important for process studies, and requires photogrammetric
techniques. Spatially distributed velocity fields have been extracted from air photos in
glacier studies (Finsterwalder 1931, Melvold 1992, Voigt 1966, Voigt 1967) or satellite
imagery (Rolstad et al 1997).

transport

The analysis of vertical surface changes results in measures of the magnitude of
vertical surface changes and how vertical changes are distributed spatially over the
topographic surface studied. In several studies of glacier changes (cf. Rensch et al
1990),
thermo carst processes
(Etzelmu¨ ller in press) or slope movement, the quantification of surface changes is
carried out by simply comparing differences in altitude at a single location. However,
the changes involving a spatial neighbourhood around a single location, such as the
change of slope or slope form (curvature), are also of interest with respect to
geomorphic process evaluation. It is therefore desirable to compare altitude derivatives
or other parameters derived arithmetically or statistically from a basic DEM.

(cf. Holmlund et al 1996),

This paper focuses on the quantification of vertical surface changes. Different
techniques are considered here in relation to DEM accuracy and the type of surface
parameterisation chosen. This study sought to estimate the reliability of the analysis
results and to show different ways of surface change quantification, which is a central
problem in geomorphology. The analysis schemes are illustrated by two DEMs from
Finsterwalderbreen, a 35 km2 sized valley glacier on south-western Spitsbergen,
Norwegian High Arctic.

2 Topographic Parameters and their Significance with Respect to Surface
Changes

2.1 Principles

The altitude of a surface describes the surface roughness function, and is continuous at
every point. This surface can conceptually be described as a combination of periodic
functions. The shortest significant wavelength (‘texture’, cf. Mark 1975) refers to the
smallest forms to be identified at a given DEM scale. The longest significant
wavelength refers to the major components of terrain, such as main valleys or peaks
(‘grain’, cf. Mark 1975). The varying amplitudes associated with these wavelengths are
the relief. The relationship between small sized and large sized forms in a terrain
describes the roughness of a surface. In terms of periodic functions roughness describes
how much of the terrain variation is represented by different wavelengths (cf. Pike and
Rozema 1975). The relationship between altitude distribution and surface area is
described by the hypsographic distribution of mass (Mark 1975).

The parameters related to this concept are estimated based on altitude matrixes.
For this study only a subset of topographic attributes described in the literature were
chosen. The point parameters, surface roughness parameters and hypsographic
parameters chosen here are believed to be relevant for describing surface changes.

Overviews describing topographic parameterisation, analysis and the role of
continuous surfaces in a variety of applications are given in Dikau (1989, 1994),
Evans (1972, 1986), Moore et al (1993a, 1993b), Nogami (1995), Pike (1995), and
Schmidt et al (1998).

2.2 Point Parameters

Point measures are parameters, which are calculated within a single location based on
its nearest neighbours. The most significant geomorphic parameters are slope (a)/
aspect (y) and curvature (c), which are the first and second derivatives of altitude,
respectively. These parameters are defined as:

tan(cid:11) (cid:136)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:14)Z
(cid:14)l

(cid:31) (cid:136)

(cid:14)2Z
(cid:14)l2

(cid:133)1(cid:134)

where (cid:14)Z is the altitude change along a distance (cid:14)l. Aspect (y) is defined to be
perpendicular to slope. Curvature denotes the change of slope and can be divided into
the change of slope in the vertical (profile curvature-f ) and horizontal directions (plan
curvature-v). Plan curvature identifies zones where surface mass flow is converging or
diverging, while profile curvature distinguishes flow acceleration/de-acceleration. In
many GIS systems allowing topographic analysis, the algorithms of Zevenbergen and
Thorne (1987) are applied for calculating these point measures. The algorithm adapts
the last nine terms of a quintic polynomial to a 3 (cid:2) 3 window, and then derives the
function.

In a dynamic system the change of altitude is the sum of the local mass balance and
a vertical velocity component (Paterson 1994). On glaciers this component may be
high, compared to river erosion and deposition for example where this component is
zero and this measure is directly related to erosion and accumulation of mass.

The change of slope displays the steepening or flattening of a surface. Most
geomorphological processes are of gravitational origin, hence rate and velocity of
water or other mass movement is a function of slope in addition to textural properties
of the mass. The localisation of slope changes and their magnitude give valuable
information for describing future events of movement. Changes of slope give
information on the relationship between mass input and mass flux. The steepening
of the surface often indicates that mass input is larger than the mass flux, which
normally leads to unstable situations in a dynamic system.

2.3 Surface Roughness Parameters

The surface roughness can be considered as a random variation of altitude. Parameters
that estimate the statistical variation (cf. Davis 1986) of a point measure in a local
neighbourhood around a single location (‘‘window parameter’’) then are measures of
surface roughness. The advantage of these measures is their simplicity of calculation.
The disadvantage is that they only give a value of variations around a mean without
giving information about how rapidly changes actually happen in space. For example,
the standard deviation of curvature is a measure of curvature magnitude regardless of
sign (Evans 1980) and thus a measure of the frequency of slope changes in a
topographic neighbourhood. The roughness factor (IR) introduced by (Mark 1975) is

(cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000

related to this measure. This parameter is calculated by a three-dimensional vector
analyses of slope (a) and aspect (y). First the vector strength is calculated by applying:

where X (cid:136) (cid:255) sin y sin a, Y (cid:136) cos y sin a and Z (cid:136) sin a (cf. Mardia 1972). The roughness
factor is defined as IR (cid:136) 1(cid:255)L, with L being the normalised vector strength L (cid:136) R/n, and
n is the number of observations. Small vector strengths denote a large dispersion of
slope and aspect, with short slope lengths. This results in large roughness values. Large
vector strengths indicate homogenous orientation of slopes with small variations and
long slope lengths.

The spatial dependence in a topography data set can also be considered as a
roughness measure. A strong spatial dependency or auto-correlation means small
surface roughness and thus smooth relief and vice versa. This can be quantified by
function, which is
geostatistical approaches, such as the semivariogram ((cid:13)(h))
calculated as (cf. Pannatier 1996):

(cid:13)(cid:133)h(cid:134) (cid:136)

(cid:137)z(cid:133)i(cid:134) (cid:255) z(cid:133)i (cid:135) h(cid:134)(cid:138)

1
2N(cid:133)h(cid:134)

XN(cid:133)h(cid:134)

i(cid:136)1

where h is the lag or distance between point samples z(i) and z(i+h). A large range of
the semivariogram indicates strong spatial dependence and vice versa. The range
determined by the variogram analysis is equivalent to the topographic grain or the
maximum wavelength of the spectral analysis (cf. Pike and Rozema 1975).

The quantification of roughness changes often demands geomorphic events leading
to rapid surface changes or changes with high magnitude. This is caused by the high
sensibility of roughness measures to DEM quality. For example, the movement of
glaciers is rapid, and large surface changes are often measured over periods of years to
decades. Here, there exists a connection between surface and bottom topography (cf.
Paterson 1994). Roughness changes are therefore functionally related to the object’s
geometrical properties (glacier thickness) and its dynamics. The same is valid for slow
continuous slope processes such as solifluction, frost heave or creeping permafrost
(rock glaciers).

2.4 Hypsographic Parameters

Hypsographic parameters estimate the relation between the area and altitude of a
topographic surface, and describe the distribution of mass above a datum line. A
common measure for describing this relationship is the hypsometric integral, which is
defined as the integral beneath a relative hypsometric curve. This integral is mathemat-
ically equivalent to the elevation-relief ratio (E) (Pike and Wilson 1971), defined as:

E (cid:136)

z (cid:255) zmin
zmax (cid:255) zmin

(cid:133)4(cid:134)

where z is the mean altitude over the entire surface, and zmin and zmax are minimum
and maximum surface altitudes, respectively. Low values refer to terrain, while high
values indicate a dissected landscape. This parameter is related to the skewness of
altitude (cf. Davis 1986) measured over a topographic surface (Evans 1972).

Quantification of Surface Changes

133

The change of the global hypsographic parameters, such as the hypsographic
integral and the altitude skewness, is related to the change of the relationship between
area in high altitudes to low altitudes. Non-significant changes mean that there are no
shifts or that we have an altitude decrease or increase equally distributed over the
whole area. Hypsographic changes are therefore an overall estimate of the dynamic
state of a geomorphically active topographic area. Hence, a glacier consists of an
‘‘accumulation area’’, receiving mass, which is transported down the glacier into the
‘‘ablation area’’, where we have mass loss. The overall change of the hypsographic
parameters will now indicate changes in the size relationship of the ablation and
accumulation area, which in turn, affect the dynamic equilibrium of the glacier.

3 The Quantification of Surface Changes – Principles and Error Propagation

3.1 Differential Surfaces

The most straightforward strategy to quantify surface changes are differential surfaces
which directly compare single relief parameter grids from different time steps, simply
by calculating the difference between two matrices on a cell-by-cell basis. This is here
called a local analysis (cf. Tomlin (1990); Figure 1). Differential surfaces are a measure
of the spatial distribution of mass displacement in a system.

When combining two spatial data sets arithmetically, the standard error of the
original data sources propagates and normally increases (Burrough and McDonnell
1998). Given an arithmetical relationship u (cid:136) f (cid:133)x1; x2; . . . ; xj(cid:134), with xj being different
information layers, the standard error of u for xj is:
v

where m denotes the mean error and r is the statistical correlation between

q

(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)(cid:129)

mu (cid:136)

for statistically independent observations. Thus, when the differences become small
then the relative errors increase. The advantage of local differential surfaces is that the
areas of mass change are both localised and quantified. The disadvantage is that the
DEMs have to be of very high accuracy.

With derivation of the altitude matrix, errors in the basic DEMs are accentuated.
Slope for example, is normally derived by maximising the gradient in the x- and y-
direction in a local neighbourhood. The gradient is then calculated by the difference
locations over the resolution K: u (cid:136) 2K(cid:255)1(x(cid:255)y). According to
between two cell
equations (5) and (6) this results in an addition of the mean errors; however, this error
can be reduced with the factor 2K(cid:255)1 and the spatial dependence in the local
neighbourhood. The differential surface of two noisy data sets gives large relative
errors. To reduce this effect one can decrease the spatial variability of the results by
measuring parameter differences or surface roughness over a larger area, either in a
local neighbourhood or by means of altitude interval averages. If assuming random

observations, the statistical mean error within each interval or neighbourhood can then
be derived by the standard errors of the estimate of the mean (Se) (cf. Davis 1986):

where s is the estimate of the standard deviation and n is the sample size within the chosen
zone or local neighborhood. The standard error of variance (Ss

2) is calculated after:

where M4 is the 4th sample moment, and s2 is the variance. As spatial data sets derived
from topographic surfaces often have a degree of dependency within a local
neighborhood, n in equations (7) and (8) is assumed to be lower than the sample size.
The spatial dependency and the optimal averaging or sampling block size has then to be
analyzed by, for example, variogram analysis (cf. Burrough and McDonnell 1998).

A combination of equations (6) and (7) was used to estimate the errors of the
parameters calculated over the entire surface. The error propagation of the elevation-
relief ratio (E), given in equation (4), can here be estimated as:

s

Quantification of Surface Changes

135

In this study, the differential surfaces are derived from local analysis via averages
over a local neighbourhood or zones to global analysis, including the entire surface
(Figure 1). The transition to global analysis leads to an increasing accuracy or
statistical reliability of the change measures, as sample means are normally used as
input data. However, local changes of a surface can not be identified and quantified
then.

3.2 Statistical Comparison of Surface Changes

An alternative approaches to differential surfaces are statistical techniques to quantify
surface changes. The techniques applied in this study were (1) local correlation and (2)
multi-dimensional classification.

Correlation coefficients can be calculated over the entire surface or in a local
neighbourhood (local correlation). The results describe then a statistical magnitude of
change. Local correlation is calculated by means of a moving window operation, where
a correlation coefficient is calculated between the correspondent kernel areas of the
input data sets for each window position. The calculation is similar to matching
algorithms in image analysis, such that:

(cid:133)10(cid:134)

where m{B1}i,j is the mean value in the window kernel with size N (cid:2) M at the grid
location (x,y) of the surface B1, s{B1}2
x,y is the standard deviation, cov{B1,B2}x,y is the
covariance, and r{B1,B2}x,y is the correlation coefficient between the grid surfaces B1
and B2 at the grid positions x,y. A correlation coefficient close to +1 indicates small
changes of local topography while a coefficient close to zero or a negative coefficient
shows large changes. The significance of a correlation coefficient is tested by a Students
t-test (cf. Davis 1986). The statistical reliability of the method increases with increased
window kernel size, as the sample size for calculating the local correlation coefficient
grows. However, larger window kernels result in a smoothing and a loss of spatial
variability in terms of the results.

A comparable qualitative measure is to classify the surface into homogenous
regions, using identical classification parameters for the two data sets which are to be
compared. The change of the class sizes and their location can then be investigated.
One method to classify a topographic surface is to use the topographic relief
parameters as independent variables in a multi-dimensional classification process (cf.
Sulebak et al 1997, Weibel and DeLotto 1988). The principle of this approach is known
as the geometric signature (as defined by Pike 1988), and it is commonly used within
geomorphometry and landform classification.

Both approaches give a statistical measure of change, where the errors can be
described in terms of probability. The approaches therefore give qualitative rather than
quantitative changes. However, areas where changes are likely to have occurred can be
identified. The classification approach is an especially useful but rough estimate of
surface change in areas where it is difficult to distinguish surface changes from
differences in DEM quality or differences in the classification procedure.

4 Surface Change Quantification Illustrated at Finsterwalderbreen, Svalbard

4.1 The Digital Elevation Models of Finsterwalderbreen

The DEMs are based on air photographs taken in 1970 and 1990, respectively. The
1970 DEM was derived by scanning and vectorizing the contours on a 1:20000-scale
contour map in ((cid:223)Norsk Polarinstitutt). Gridding to 25 m and 50 m resolution was
then carried out following Hutchinson’s (1989) procedure. Relative accuracies are
estimated to be below (cid:6)3m. The 1990 model was generated using an analytical plotter
(Fox and Nuttall 1997) based on 1:50000-scale air photos. Relative accuracy here is
better than one metre. Both data sets are statistically independent of each other as
different photogrammetric instruments, sampling methods and air photos were used
for deriving the DEMs. The topographic point parameters for both glacier surfaces
were calculated using the algorithms developed by Zevenbergen and Thorne (1987).
The index of roughness, the statistical derivatives of the point parameters, the local
correlation approach, the cluster analysis and the error propagation functions for the
glacier surfaces were implemented using ESRI’s raster-based GRID module and the Arc
Macro Language (AML).

The spatial dependence of the altitude point parameters for the 1970 and 1990
surface, slope, IR and total curvature was analysed using variogram analysis on data
sets taken from an test area. A linear trend was removed for the altitude data sets
before the analysis (Figure 2). The example illustrates that the estimated range for the
data sets is reduced when calculating topographic point parameters. This information
is important for optimal averaging and sampling of topographic parameters.

4.2 Differences of Altitude and Slope

Differences of altitude and slope and the relative errors of the resulting data set were
calculated on a cell-by-cell basis for the 1970- and 1990-surface of Finsterwalderbreen
(Plate 7, see plate section). The altitude differences were large at the glacier tongue, with
mass losses of more than 20 m in the measurement period. With the accuracy of the
basic DEMs this gave, however, relative errors of 30% and more, calculated according
to equation (6). Furthermore, more than half of the glacier surface showed small surface
changes (Plate 7). In these areas relative errors varied between 60% and 100%.

The glacier surface slope parameter was then first averaged over a 250-m local
neighbourhood before the two data sets were subtracted. The result indicated a
steepening over most of the glacier surface (Plate 7). Again, there were large areas with
relative errors of >100%. When the point parameters were averaged over altitude
intervals, the altitude and slope differences gave satisfying results, with errors normally
round 30% or less in most areas (Plate 7).

4.3 Differences of Roughness Parameters

The roughness differences on the glacier surface showed a pattern, with a tendency to a
more accentuated relief in the lowermost area of the glacier over time (Plate 8, see plate
section). However, the quantification of roughness changes using differential surfaces
revealed high relative errors, even with averaging over a larger area. The errors in
calculating the local standard deviation of plan curvature and slope in a 450-m

neighbourhood was of the same order as the values themselves. Thus, the relative
errors in relation to the differential surface become very large. Smaller relative errors
are expected when calculating differences of the roughness index (IR). This measure is
based on slope and aspect, and uses an average over a local neighbourhood. Hence, the
error here should be in the range of those for calculating local slope differences.

4.4 Global Differences of Topographic Point and Roughness Parameters

The global roughness changes, such as IR and the local standard deviations of point
parameters indicate an overall development towards a rougher surface with time
(Table 1). This also corresponded with the change of semivariogram parameters of
altitude (Figure 2), where the range showed a change towards rougher surfaces (Table
1). Relative errors in relation to some of the difference measures were lower than 10%
in the case of Finsterwalderbreen.

4.5 Differences of Hypsographic Parameters

Hypsographic parameters were calculated as global values measured over the entire
glacier surfaces. For the 1970-surface of Finsterwalderbreen with a standard error in
altitude of mZ(cid:136) (cid:6)3m, the standard error of E from equation (4) (mE) was estimated at

Table 1 Global morphometric measures and their changes on Finsterwalderbreen. For
calculation of the point parameters the method described by Zevenbergen and Thorne
(1987) was applied. Local measures were calculated with a 7 (cid:2) 7 kernel (350 m). m (cid:136) mean,
s (cid:136) standard deviation, cv (cid:136) coefficient of variation. Differences are calculated by
subtracting the 1970 values from the 1990 values. Range (semivariogram analysis) values
are defined as 95% of total sample variance. The variogram analysis was performed with
VARIOWIN (Pannatier 1996). Trends in the altitude data sets were removed by subtracting
a linear trend surface.

0.006 which corresponds to a relative error of 1.5% (equation 9). Taking the difference
of the elevation-relief ratio of 1970 and 1990, the relative errors increase to a maximum
of (cid:24)30% of the difference. Considerable larger errors are expected for low resolution

landscapes.

On Finsterwalderbreen there are changes in both altitude skewness and E. The
decrease in altitude skewness indicates that we have more areas in lower altitudes in
relation to higher altitudes, as mean altitude remained more or less unchanged. With
respect to E, this development leads to larger area-relief ratios (Table 1), and reflects
the overall steepening of the glacier.

4.6 Change of Surface Roughness Revealed by Statistical Methods

Local correlation coefficients for different roughness parameters between the two
glacier surfaces were also calculated for Finsterwalderbreen. They show that the most
severe changes happened in the lowermost areas of the glacier, as displayed for plan
curvature in Plate 9 (see plate section).

Further, slope and plan curvature was used as independent variables in a
multivariate classification process, following the principles described in Sulebak et al
(1997). These two parameters were chosen as they are supposed to be the most
significant in relation to glacier dynamics. The data sets were first normalised. The
unsupervised cluster analyses resulted in five distinct classes. A maximum-likelihood
algorithm, utilising the variance-covariance matrix established by an iso-cluster
analysis performed the allocation of individual cells to classes. The classification
algorithm was first trained on the 1970-surface, and then the parameters were applied
on the 1990-model. On Finsterwalderbreen a significantly higher number of cells are
classified in class two compared to class one in 1990 (Plate 9). This indicates areas of
increasing steepness in this period. The changes display a similar pattern to that
obtained in the local correlation analysis. Errors are here quantified in terms of
probabilities for an individual cell being allocated correctly to a certain class.

5 Discussion

5.1 Glacier Surface Changes Illustrated at Finsterwalderbreen

The results obtained on Finsterwalderbreen were useful for glaciological interpretation.
The analysis showed a glacier developing towards a steeper surface over most of the
glacier’s surface, with mass loss in the ablation area and even mass gain in the
accumulation area. However, average surface altitude nearby did not change,
indicating a near steady state concerning the overall mass balance. These factors
together indicate a glacier having an ice flux at the equilibrium line altitude (ELA),
which is lower than the total mass accumulation due to winter precipitation above the
ELA. The situation normally leads to a dynamic unstable state, which can result in the
triggering of a surge. This special type of glacier movement describes a periodic rapid
advance over a small time interval (Kamb et al 1985, Paterson 1994).

The roughness parameters indicate a development towards a rougher surface with
time (Table 1), especially in the lowermost ablation area. This pattern indicates high
wastage of nearby stagnant ice masses, which in turn is an expression of glacier dynamics
(cf. Etzelmu¨ ller and Sollid 1997). With time, ice thickness decreases. Hence, the glacier
surface topography may become an expression of subglacial topography rather than ice
flow. However, in this case it is difficult to ascertain whether the measured roughness
changes are due to physical changes of the surface or due to DEM noise.

The visual picture of the multi-dimensional classification (Plate 9) indicates a
noisier surface. This sounds realistic as different sampling and gridding approaches
were used for DEM generation. Also the large change in range of the variogram
analysis indicates different basic DEM qualities. On the other hand, the original
sampling density for the DEMs was 10 m, although they were resampled to 50 m using
bilinear interpolation prior to the analysis described here. This should have an
averaging effect, reducing much of the noise. Nevertheless, for the reliability of the
results it is important to have good knowledge of the DEM quality before any
quantification is performed.

In spite of relatively good quality DEMs and large changes of the glacier surface,
relative errors are high, especially when parameters other than altitude are involved.
Surface roughness in terms of curvature is nearly impossible to quantify directly. In this
case only statistical methods or roughness parameters calculated over the entire surface
may give interpretable results. It seems clear that the analysis of surface change
distribution is not possible based on older maps where accuracy is not better than
several metres, or the altitude information is not sampled densely enough for
generating high resolution DEMs.

5.2 Surface Changes in Geomorphology

In geomorphology there is a relationship between the size of a landform, the rate of a
process and the duration of the life of a landform. Large landforms, such as mountain
areas, change their overall pattern over periods of thousands of years. Fluvial action
forming valley floors often results in change over tens of years. Rill erosion may change
a surface in weeks to months over small areas (cf. Ahnert 1988). The relationship
between the DEM time increment and the process to be recognised determines the
required accuracy for data sampling.

The first step therefore is to determine the magnitude of a process with respect to
vertical changes per unit time, involving knowledge about whether the process is of
episodic, periodic or continuous nature. The second step is the analysis of how vertical
changes may help in quantifying the process. The type of information needed governs
the choice of comparison approach, DEM accuracy and resolution. Obviously, calcu-
lating flux rates in a single location demands better accuracy than flux rates calculated
over an entire catchment area. Furthermore,
it is important whether quantitative
measures or only qualitative measures are necessary to obtain the required results.

Surface changes over periods of tens to 100 years can be measured directly, using
existing stereo photographs. Changes over longer periods are often acquired by using
some form of reconstruction of the older surface, often by morphological landform
patterns such as end- or side moraines of glaciers or using mathematical models to
estimate process rates backwards in time (cf. Paterson 1994). This approach gives no
reliable estimation errors, and is only useful to calculate overall averages of change.

Using photogrammetry based on standard air photographs allows one to detect
changes of the order of a few metres with reasonable accuracy. However, continuous
slope processes, soil erosion or processes of fluvial erosion and accumulation are
normally relatively slow and demand either longer time intervals between air photos or
better DEM sampling accuracy. Otherwise, spatially distributed changes cannot be
quantified, and the only reliable estimates are qualitative measures, resulting in the
classification of areas where changes were likely to have happened versus those where
no changes are likely. With modern sampling techniques such as air-borne laser
altimetry (cf. Echelmeyer et al 1996, Kennett and Eiken 1997) and kinematic GPS (cf.
Eiken et al 1997) much better accuracy is obtainable, also over larger areas, and thus
smaller changes can be identified quantitatively and spatially distributed. This means
that time between DEMs can be shortened considerably and slower processes can be
quantified over
like SAR differential
interferograms may also be useful for detecting surface changes with high resolution
(cf Wang and Li 1999).

larger areas. Satellite-based techniques

The global analysis of surface change, however, gives the most reliable estimates,
and can be carried out on DEMs with poorer accuracy than those used in this study
from Finsterwalderbreen. Hence, parameters calculated over the entire surface may
give a good description of the state of a surface, in regional studies over larger areas.

6 Conclusions

With the increasing use of GIS and availability of DEMs, the quantification of surface
change is of high interest, not only in geomorphology. From this study the following
conclusions can be drawn:

l Surface changes are normally estimated by taking the differences of two DEMs,
which is, however, a dangerous operation with respect to error propagation (cf.
Burrough and McDonnell 1998). Thus, high resolution DEMs with good
accuracy are necessary to derive statistically reliable differential surfaces that give
a spatial picture of surface changes.
In the case of low magnitude geomorphic changes or poorer DEM quality, spatial
averaging and statistical analysis are suitable to estimate surface changes, at least
qualitatively.

l

l The principles of relief parameterisation and landform classification (Dikau 1989,
Moore 1996, Moore et al 1993a, Pike 1995) are very useful in the analysis of
surface changes. The range of applications is expanded in relation to traditional
altitude comparisons in this particular application.

l The approaches presented in this study gave physically interpretable results for

high magnitude landform changes, such as glaciers.

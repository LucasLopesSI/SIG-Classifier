(Received 8 August 2012; ﬁnal version received 11 August 2012)

Spatial ecology addresses how the spatial arrangement of organisms, populations and
landscapes affects ecological processes and is the intersection of geographical science and
ecology (Skidmore et al. 2011). The data explosion in both geosciences and biosciences,
comprising massive data sets ranging from molecular phylogenies to hyper-spatial, hyper-
spectral and hyper-temporal remotely sensed data, is creating increasing opportunities and
challenges for spatial ecological questions and methods.

This issue is the second special issue on Spatial Ecology published in the International
Journal of Geographical Information Science, with the ﬁrst being published in 2011
(issue 3 of volume 25). The papers in this and the ﬁrst special issue demonstrate the
breadth of applications for spatial ecology. The papers in the ﬁrst special issue addressed
applied and methodological themes in spatial ecology; these included methods of spa-
tial optimization and interpolation for landscape planning and management in support
of biological conservation, and studies of scale effects, error propagation, spatial non-
stationarity, optimal sampling and variable selection in modelling biotic distributions and
ecological processes. The papers in this issue continue many of these themes, as well as
describing new ones.

Most papers in GIScience comprise a combination of method, application and data,
with each normally having a primary focus on one aspect. The papers in this and the pre-
vious special issue are no exception to this although, as is to be expected for this journal,
much of the focus is towards the methods and data. It is, however, important to note that
the methods used in spatial ecology are sufﬁciently broadly applicable that they can be
applied to any organism with appropriate adjustments. After all, spatial analysis methods
are largely generic and come from a variety of research application domains. For example,
∗ statistic (Ord and Getis 1995) was developed in the context of human
the Getis–Ord Gi
geography, but can be equally applied to animals (e.g. Roger et al. 2007). Kernel density
estimators can be applied to any phenomena comprising objects or events (Sabel et al.
2000, Taylor et al. 2006, Scull et al. this issue).

S.W. Laffan et al.

Even with a primary focus on methods and data, the papers in this special issue deal
with a broad array of application areas. The focal organisms include plants (Burley et al.
this issue, Golicher et al. this issue) and vertebrates including mammals (Amboni and
Laffan this issue, Moudrý and Šímová this issue, Scull et al. this issue) and ﬁsh (Chee
and Elith this issue), with environments ranging from terrestrial (Amboni and Laffan this
issue, Burley et al. this issue, Scull et al. this issue) to marine (Hamylton this issue, Huang
et al. this issue) and ﬂuvial systems (Chee and Elith this issue). These are analysed across
geographic extents ranging from tens to hundreds of square kilometres (Scull et al. this
issue, Hamylton this issue, Huang et al. this issue), to regions (Burley et al. this issue,
Chee and Elith this issue, de Bie et al. this issue, Golicher et al. this issue), to continents
(Amboni and Laffan this issue).

More generally, data quality issues are an ever-present issue for GIScience, and spatial
ecology is no exception (e.g. Leitão et al. 2011, Livne and Svoray 2011). In this issue,
Williams et al. (this issue) provide a detailed set of recommendations for the selection of
data sets to use when building a biodiversity model. Golicher et al. (this issue) show a
potential consequence of using pseudo-absence data without due consideration. The fact
that a set of random ﬁelds can be selected by a standard variable selection process up to
17% of the time is an important cautionary note, especially given that we often only have
presence-only species occurrence data available to us (Newbold 2010) and must often use
methods that use pseudo-absences. Amboni and Laffan (this issue) assess the effects of
the four most commonly used methods to estimate species ranges on estimates of species
richness and phylogenetic diversity for marsupials across the Australian continent. As part
of a larger species distribution modelling process, Chee and Elith (this issue) describe
the development of a stream-link-based database of ﬁsh occurrences for a region in
Australia.

Scale is a common theme in spatial ecology (Miller and Hanham 2011, Propastin
2011, Wilson et al. 2011, Yoo and Trgovac 2011, Di Virgilio et al. 2012). Burley et al.
(this issue) explore the effects of spatial scale, in tandem with anisotropy and spatial
non-stationarity, on the rates of Myrtaceae species turnover across both geographic and
environmental spaces. Moudrý and Šímová (this issue) review the effects of scale, sample
size and positional accuracy on models of species distributions.

A further common theme in spatial ecology, and perhaps in any ﬁeld, is the assess-
ment, development and application of novel methods and extensions to existing methods
(Van Dessel et al. 2011, van Langevelde and Grashof-Bokdam 2011, Wilson et al. 2011,
Zhang et al. 2011). Scull et al. (this issue) demonstrate that the spatial analysis methods
for delineating animal home ranges vary in their effectiveness depending on the spatial
characteristics and environmental context of the animal movement data, with important
implications for wildlife management. Burley et al. (this issue) use generalized dissimilar-
ity modelling (GDM) (Ferrier et al. 2007), a method with considerable scope for improving
our understanding of biodiversity patterns.

As noted by Williams et al. (this issue), many of these analyses are made possible by
the availability of freely available software tools such as Biodiverse (Laffan et al. 2010),
GDM (Ferrier et al. 2007), MaxEnt (Phillips and Dudík 2008), and Spatial Analysis in
Macroecology (Rangel et al. 2010). Many such tools are also open source (Steiniger and
Bocher 2009) or run within open source analysis systems such as R (R Development Core
Team 2012), making it easier for researchers to improve or extend the tools. Many are also
being ported to online platforms to make very large analyses tractable (see, e.g. the Atlas of
Living Australia spatial portal, http://spatial.ala.org.au/, and the Lifemapper project, http://
www.lifemapper.org/).

Spatio-temporal data analyses are an area where there will be considerable advances
in future years. The emergence of freely available remotely sensed data sets such as from
the Landsat, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Advanced Very High
Resolution Radiometer programmes means that one can now analyse hyper-temporal data
sequences (e.g. Donohue et al. 2008). In this regard, de Bie et al. (this issue) describe
the development of a method to analyse such sequences for understanding land-cover
heterogeneity.

Even with all the examples in this and the ﬁrst special issue, we have barely scratched
the surface of the potential of geospatial data and analysis tools for addressing important
questions in spatial ecology. The papers in this and the ﬁrst special issue have presented a
sample of what can be done, but there remains considerable scope for future research at the
intersection of spatial ecology and GIScience, for example, analyses of animal movement
data (Riley et al. 1996, Laube and Purves 2011), molecular ecology (Kulheim et al. 2011),
disease ecology (David Walter et al. 2011, Laffan et al. 2011), invasive species ecology
(Vaclavik et al. 2012) and global change biology (Regan et al. 2012). We foresee spatial
ecology continuing as an important research theme in and alongside GIScience.

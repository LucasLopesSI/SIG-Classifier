Abstract Directional relation, as a kind of spatial constraints, has been recognized as being an
important means for spatial query, analysis and reasoning. Directional relation is conventionally
concerned with two point objects. However, in spatial query and analysis, there is also a need of
directional relations between point and line, point and area, line and line, line and area, and area
and area. Therefore, conventional definition of direction needs to be extended to include line
and area objects (i.e. the so-called extended objects). Existing models for directional relation of
extended objects make use of approximate representations (e.g. minimum bounding rectangles)
of the extended objects so as to produce some results with unrealistic impression. In this paper, a
statistical model is presented. In this new model, (1) an extended spatial object is decomposed
into small components; (2) the directional relation between extended spatial objects is then
determined by the directions between these small components which form a distribution; and
(3) two measures (i.e. range and median direction) are utilized to describe the statistical property
is based upon the (extended) spatial objects
of the distribution. This statistical model
themselves, instead of their approximate representations. An experimental test has been carried
out and the result indicates that the directional relations computed from this model is very close
to those perceived by human beings.

1 Introduction

Qualitative spatial reasoning has received great attention in many areas, such as geographic
information systems [15], [17], artificial intelligence [6], [13], [16], [31], [35], [36], [41],

databases [31], multimedia [40] and so on. It has been recognized as a valid complement to
Euclidean geometry in geographical space [28], where reasoning on spatial objects needs a
support from representations of topological, directional, ordinal, distance, size and shape
relations [20], [34]. Indeed, these spatial relations can also be used to support spatial
inferences and development of spatial query languages, allowing for the analysis of
similarities between different spatial configurations [5], [21], [22]. From literature it can be
found that three main kinds of spatial relations have been studied, namely, topological
relations [4], [8], [13], [15], [25], [35], [36], cardinal directional relations [22], [26] and
qualitative distance relations [18], [39].

In this paper, we concentrate on directional relations of all types of spatial objects (point
objects and extended objects, i.e. lines and areas). This kind of relations is used to describe
how spatial objects are placed relative to one another. The definition of directional relation
concerns a reference object, target object and reference frame. For instance, the description
“B north A” indicates that A is the reference object, B the target object, and north the
reference frame. As a reference frame could be relative or absolute, therefore directional
relations can be described in a relative sense or an absolute sense. In a relative sense, such
descriptors as front, back, left or right are often in use, while in an absolute sense the terms
east, west, south or north can be used.

In geographic information systems, directional relations have acted as a link between
visually perceived data and natural language [12]. So far, much attention has been paid to
the development of mathematical/computational models and identification of (target)
objects which have a specified relation with a given reference object [12], [27]. In this
study, we further confine ourselves to the modeling of directional relations between spatial
objects.

In the past 15 years, a number of models have been developed for directional relations,
e.g. [22], [26], [30]. The representatives include the cone-shaped model [23], [33], the
minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) model [30], the minimum enclosing rectangle (MER)
model [29], and the direction-relation matrix model [22]. Application of these models in
area in which part of the phenomena represented is influenced by the directionality has also
been explored [10].

However, it should be pointed out that the models mentioned above only approximately
capture directional relations between extended spatial objects [9], because the spatial
objects are represented too coarsely either in terms of their MBRs [30] or as a point [11],
[18], [33], so that
the resulting description might be quite misleading. In order to
overcome this problem, we propose a statistical model for directional relations between
spatial objects. Compared with existing models, our model differs in two aspects. First,
our model is based directly on spatial objects themselves instead of the approximation of
spatial objects (e.g. MER, MBR, or a point, etc.). Second, our model is derived from the
quantitative computation of the direction between two points, and then extended logically
to the cases involving line and area, thus it is suitable for all three types of spatial objects
in GIS.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of related
work and describes our strategy on modeling of directional relations between spatial
objects. Section 3 presents a measure for directional relations, i.e. direction interval,
which is used to represent the distribution dispersion of directional relations. In Section 4,
we propose another measure,
the median direction, to represent the distribution
tendency of directional relations. These two measures form a statistical model of
directional relations. Section 5 shows the testing results of our model. In Section 6 some
conclusions are made.

2 Related work and our strategy on modeling of directional relations

2.1 Frame of reference for directional relations: Absolute vs relative

As mentioned in previous section, directional relations can be defined in a relative or an
absolute frame of reference. Relative frames of reference use relative orientation in which
positioning of a simple object is made with respect to an oriented line or an ordered set of
points forming a vector [19], [24], [37], [38] or to some intrinsic properties of the reference
object, e.g. front and back, left and right [29]. Absolute frames of reference are often based
on cardinal directions with respect to a local meridian in large-scale spaces. In such a
reference frame, compass directions are often used to partition space around a reference
object, and then to analyze the intersections between a target object and the resulting tiles
around a reference object using either a cone [33] or projection-based approach [7], [18],
[19], [32], [39], [42]. In this paper, we consider an absolute frame of reference, although a
relative frame of reference can be also used for the development of our modeling. As a
result, only those typical models based on the absolute reference frames will be examined in
more detail in this section.

2.2 An examination of existing models based on absolute frame of reference

Several models capturing cardinal directions have been proposed. Most of them were
developed for two area objects. In such models, an area is approximated by a point or its
MBR (or a bounding box). Accordingly, these models can be classified into point-based
and MBR-based models.

In a point-based model, the reference object (area) is represented by a point (normally its
centroid) and the space around this representative point is divided into a number of
mutually exclusive direction tiles. In the end, the direction tile where the target object lies
characterizes its directional relation with respect to reference object. The simplest point-
based model (e.g. [18], [19], [26]) makes use of a representative point (most commonly the
centroid) for each area. Figure 1a illustrates the directional relation between A and B with
such a simplest model, where the cA is A’s centroid and cB is B’s centroid. In this case, cB
lies in the southeast tile of cA, thus their directional relation can be described as “B
southeast A”.

The cone-shaped model proposed by Haar [23] can be regarded as a point-based model.
In this model, only the reference object (area) is approximated as a representative point. The
model does not work well when the distance between two objects is small compared to their
sizes. That is, the centroid of the target object may not fall in the direction tile as visually
perceived. For example, in Fig. 1b, area B is visually perceived in the east of A, but B does
not fall into the east tile with reference to the centroid of A. Later the model was refined by
Peuquet and Zhan [33], in which the MBR of the reference object is used to determine a
representative point instead of its centroid. As shown in Fig. 1c, the two lines passing
through the two front corners of the MBR to form a perpendicular intersection determines a
direction title such that area B falls into the tile as visually perceived.

The cone-shaped model was further extended by Abdelmoty and Williams [1]. Figure 1d
shows the partition of space in this extended model. That is, the space external to an area
object is divided into four semi-infinite regions by four lines starting from the four corners
of the object’s MBR, with two lines in the narrower side forming a rectangle. Then, the
the
directional
components of these regions. In this case, the representative point of an area object is

replaced with a link line e.g. lA (or lB) in Fig. 1d. The Egenhofer’s four-intersection model
for topological relations [15] has been used to represent the resultant directional relations.
MBR-based models represent an area object by such two points that correspond to the
lower-left and the upper-right corners of the object’s MBR [30], as shown in Fig. 1e. The
directional relation between two spatial objects is defined on their MBRs, and described by
applying Allen’s [2] interval relations along the projections of the areas onto the x- and y-

ð1Þ

axes. Considering that there are thirteen possible relations between two intervals on each of
both axes, this model is able to differentiate 13×13=169 relations in a 2D space [30].
Another MBR-based model is the direction-relation matrix model [22], where the reference
object is approximated by its MBR but the target object remains the actual one. This model
can be expressed as follows:

Dir A; Bð

Þ ¼

NWA \ B

WA \ B OA \ B
SWA \ B S A \ B

NA \ B NEA \ B

where A is the reference object; B is the target object; and NA, NEA, EA, SEA, SA, SWA, WA,
NWA and OA (same direction) represent the direction tiles, as shown in Fig. 1f.

Indeed, this model partitions the space around the MBR of reference object (here A) into
nine tiles, and then records the tiles where target object (here B) falls into, so as to
characterize the cardinal directional relation of B with respect to A. For instance, in Fig. 1f,
Dir(A, B)={NE, E}. At a finer level of granularity, the model also offers the option to
record the percentage of the target object falling into each direction tile by recording the
area ratio of the target object. For example, in Fig. 1f, object B is 90% east and 10%
northeast of object A.

Another interesting development for qualitative description of directional relations is the

five-intersection model proposed by Billen and Clementini [3], i.e.

where A, B, and C represent three spatial objects; Leftside, Before, Between, Afterside and
Rightside correspond to the five basic projective relations, as shown in Fig. 2a.

This model is mainly used for reasoning the directional relations between a point (or an area)
and other two given points (or areas). For example, in Fig. 2a, object C is after of both objects
A and B, and the projective relations are described by a five-intersection in Fig. 2b. However,
it is necessary to determine and compute the two internal tangent lines and the two external
tangent lines between A and B, which is an issue to be discussed in detail in Section 3.

After a close examination of the point- and MBR-based models discussed above, two
problems can be identified. First, those models represent approximately the directional
relation between spatial objects due to the approximation of spatial object(s), which may
sometimes causes an inaccurate even wrong description for directional relations [22],
those models mainly focus on a qualitative description of directional
[43]. Second,
relations (e.g. four or eight cardinal directions) with exception of the direction-relation
matrix model, which to some degree indicates the coarseness of the description of
directional relations. Indeed, it is natural to develop a quantitative approach for such
problems.

Recently, Yan et al. [43] proposes a quantitative description model for directional
relations based on direction groups. In their model, four procedures are included, namely

1. Cartographic generalization of the objects;
2. Calculation of direction Voronoi diagrams (DVDs);
3. Construction of quantitative direction groups; and
4. Construction of qualitative direction groups.

This model does reduce the 2D problem of computing directions between extended
objects into 1D problem by using lines (DVDs) to represent directional relations, and thus
computation problem is simplified. Moreover, the model has such a property that Dir(A,
B) can be computed from Dir(B, A), and vice versa. However, this model is defined on the
objects after generalization. That is to say, this model is also an approximate capture of
this model does not
directional relations between spatial objects. More importantly,
consider the whole shape and size of the involved objects. For example, as shown in
Fig. 3, based on the model, the directional relations in a and b is identical, i.e. B is 50%
northeast (NE) and 50% east (E) of A. However, it sounds reasonable to say: “B is mainly
located in east (E) of A” for case a, and “B is mainly located in northeast (NE) of A” for
case b.

To propose a better quantitative and computational approach for directional relation

between two spatial objects, a new strategy needs to be developed.

2.3 A strategy on modeling of directional relations

It is well known that the directional relation between two points can be accurately defined
(see Eq. 3). But the computation of directional relations involving a line or an area object is
something arguable. As shown in Fig. 4a, for the reference object A and target object B, it is
more difficult to give a quantitative direction value to describe their directional relations.
On the other hand, one can determine the distribution range of the directional relation from
arbitrary point in A to arbitrary point in B, and vice visa. In mathematics, this distribution
range is able to be quantitatively determined by the azimuths of two internal tangent lines l1
and l2 between A and B. The distribution tendency of the directional relation between A and
B can be roughly determined by the azimuths of two external tangent lines l3 and l4
(Fig. 4b). From a statistical point of view, there are two classes of descriptors for a
tendency of the
statistical distribution. One class is used for measuring the central
distribution, including mean, median and mode and the other is used for measuring the
dispersion of the distribution, including range, variance, standard deviation, etc. In this
paper, we select the range as a measure to describe the distribution dispersion of directional
relations between two involved objects, and the median as a measure to describe the central
tendency of the distribution. These two measures construct a statistical modeling of
directional relations.

In the next section, the computation of the distribution range of directional relations for

various types of spatial objects (i.e. point, line and area) is to be discussed.

It has been mentioned in the Introduction that directional
determinations of reference object, target object, and reference frames. In this section, we
discuss the cases with point,
line and area as reference object and target object,
systematically. There are totally nine cases. In the following, we firstly investigate the
three cases with point as reference object.

3.1 Point as reference object

With a point as reference object, three types of combinations are possible for directional
relations, namely point–point, point–line and point–area. Since the point–point relation is

200

the basis for other relations, we firstly discuss this case, i.e. a point as reference object and a
point as target object.

3.1.1 Point as target object

In Fig. 5, A is the reference point, and B is the target point. Mathematically, the directional
relation Dir(A, B) between A(xA, yA) and B(xB, yB) can be accurately represented by the
azimuth of their linking line AB, i.e.αAB as follows:

Since target object may be a line or an area, there is a need to extend Eq. 3 to the cases
with line and area as target objects. In the following section, line as target object is
considered.

3.1.2 Line as target object

In Fig. 6, point A is the reference object and line segment B is the target object. According
to Eq. 3, we are able to compute the azimuths of AB1 and AB2, denoted by aAB1 and aAB2 ,
respectively. It can be found that, when a point (denoted as Bt) moves continuously from B1
to B2 along the route B1B2, the azimuth of ABt (denoted as aABt ) will change monotonously
and continuously from aAB1 to aAB2 . In other words, for any point Bt in the line segment B,
the azimuth of ABt (i.e. aABt ) is certainly in between aAB1 and aAB2 . Therefore, we are able

It can be seen from Eq. 4 that the direction interval aAB1

(cid:4)) represents
the distribution range of directional relation between A and B. A special case is that aAB1 is
equal to aAB2 . It means that point B1 is in the same direction as point B2 with respect to point
A (e.g. Fig. 6b). In this case, the directional relation between A and B in Eq. 4 is simplified
into a numerical value, i.e. aAB1 or aAB2. Further, we define such two points as B1 and B2 as
identical-direction points, and the line segment B as an identical-direction line.

From the viewpoint of visibility, we can analyze and conclude that for two identical-
direction points only one of them is visible with respect to a reference point. Also, for a line
segment which is linked by two identical-direction points, only one of its endpoints is
visible with respect to the reference point. As shown in Fig. 6b, for line segment B, only B1
is visible from reference point A, and all other points in the line segment are regarded as
identical-direction points of B1, therefore, the distribution range of directional relation
between A and B can be simplified and represented by aAB1.

When target object B is a polyline, with its ordered vertex B1, B2, ..., Bn, then in
geometry the line B consists of a set of line segments, denoted by B1B2, B2B3, ..., and
Bn−1Bn. Therefore, it is natural to extend Eq. 4 into the union set of all the direction
intervals between A and B’s line segments, i.e.

following paragraphs, we discuss two situations shown in Fig. 7 as typical examples.

In Fig. 7a, all the vertices in target line B are visible with respect to reference point A.

In Fig. 7b, some of the vertices in target line B are invisible from reference point A. This
indicates that a part of target line B is shadowed by its other part(s) from reference point A.
Therefore, this may be referred as a partially visible situation. For this situation, Eq. 7 will
satisfy at least one of the following two conditions (i.e. Eqs. 9 and 10),

In Fig. 7b, Eq. 9 is satisfied.
With the consideration of the connectivity of individual spatial objects in geometry, the
directional relation between A and B is able to be represented by a single interval, denoted

The main difference between these two cases with line as target object and area as target
object is that the latter is certainly partially visible. That is to say, target area B has only a
part of its boundary visible with respect to reference point A. In Fig. 8, for instance, only
line segment B1B9 is visible with respect to reference point A, and all other parts are
invisible. Therefore, the distribution range of the directional relation between A and B can
be represented as Dir A; Bð

(cid:4).

It can be found from Fig. 8 that a linking line between A and an arbitrary point in
invisible parts always has an intersection with its visible part (i.e. B1B9). For instance,
linking line AZ2 between A and invisible point Z2 intersects at Z1, and the linking lines
between A and B4, Z3, Z4 (i.e. AB4, AZ3 and AZ4) all have an intersection point (i.e. Z5)
with B1B9. According to Section 3.1, we can know that Z1 and Z2 are two identical
direction points, and that Z5 and Z4, Z3, B4 are all identical-direction points. Further, Z1Z2,
Z5Z4, and Z3B4 are identical-direction lines, respectively. Therefore, a target area can be
regarded as a combination of infinite identical direction line segments with respect to
reference point A.

Similar to the case with point as reference object, three categories of directional relations for the
case with line as reference object can be identified, namely, line–point, line–line, and line–area.

3.2 Line as reference object

3.2.1 Point as target object

As shown in Fig. 9, reference object A is a line segment with endpoints A1 and A2, and
target object B is a point. Similar to the analysis of the case with reference point and target
line in Section 3.1, we can compute the azimuth of A1B and A2B, i.e. aA1B and aA2B. It can
be easily proven that the azimuth of linking line between an arbitrary point in A and B is in
between aA1B and aA2B. In other words, the direction of B with respect to an arbitrary point
in A is in between aA1B and aA2B. As a result, we are able to represent the distribution range
of the directional relation between reference line A and target point B as follows:

ð13Þ

Þ ¼ aA1B; aA2 B

From Eq. 13, we can obtain the directional relation between A and B in Fig. 9 as
Dir A; Bð
(cid:4). A special case is that B locates in the prolongation of line A (see
Fig. 9b). In this case, aA1B ¼ aA2B, and thus the distribution range of directional relation
expressed in Eq. 13 becomes a single numeric value, i.e. Dir A; Bð

More generally, for a reference polyline A with its ordered vertex A1, A2, ..., An, the
distribution range of the directional relations between A and B can be represented as the
union of all the direction intervals between A’s line segments and B. Therefore, Eq. 13 is
extended as follows:

Dir A; Bð

Þ ¼ Dir A1A2; B

One can find that Eq. 16 is identical to Eq. 11 in form. Therefore, a comparison is

needed for such two converse cases:

Case II: reference line and target point.

In order to better analyze and represent the relation between these two cases, we select a

analyze the situation about point and polyline. According to Eqs. 5 and 12, we are able to
compute Dir A; Bð
(cid:4). For convenience, we may
represent the distribution range of directional relations in cases I and II in a general form,
(cid:4) and Dir B; Að
respectively. Let Dir A; Bð
(cid:4), then the relation between
cases I and II can be expressed as follows:

where α1, β1, α2, β2∈[0, 360);

directional relation Dir(A, B) is known, then we are able to derive its converse directional
relation Dir(B, A) according to Eq. 17. For example, in Fig. 9a, Dir(A, B) is computed as
[315°, 40°], then we are able to compute Dir(B, A) as [135°, 220°]. Moreover, interval width is
both 85° for Dir(A, B) and Dir(B, A). We call this property as reflectivity of directional
relations. This is also very consistent with qualitative spatial reasoning. For instance, if there is
A east B, then it can be reasoned to B west A, because east is the reflective direction of west.
From the viewpoint of visibility, it is obvious that the visible range between A and B in
above two cases is invariant. For instance, in Fig. 7b, the visible parts for the case with
reference point A and target line B are the same as those for the case with reference line B
and target point A, i.e. A and B1B2.

3.2.2 Line as target object

Let reference line A consist of n−1 line segments with ordered vertexes A1, A2, ..., An, and
target line B consist of m−1 line segments with ordered vertexes B1, B2, ..., Bm, then the

206

directional relation between A and B may be regarded as an extension of that between a
reference line and a target point, thus the distribution range can be represented as:

3.2.3 Area as target object

The distribution range of directional relation between a reference line and a target area is
able to be determined using a similar principle to that for the case with a reference line and
a target line. As a result, Eqs. 18, 19 and 20 can be used for this purpose.

3.3 Area as reference object

With an area as a reference object, there are also three classes, namely area–point, area–line
and area–area.

In the case with a reference area and a target point, there are two approaches for the
computation of the distribution range of directional relations. One is similar to the case with
a reference line and a target point. In such a case, Eqs. 13 and 16 can be combined for use.
The other is to compute its converse case, i.e. a reference point and a target area. In this
case, Eqs. 4 and 12 can be used to compute the directional relation between a reference
point and a target area; and then Eq. 17 can be applied to its converse situation, i.e. the
relation between reference area and target point.

The case with a reference area and a target line can be analyzed by using a similar
approach to that for the case with a reference area and a target point. Therefore, in this
section, we only consider the case with a reference area and a target area.

The distribution range of directional relation between a reference area and a target
area may be based on the case with a reference area and a target line, or the case
with a reference line and a target area. Alternatively, the directional relation between
a reference area and a target area can be represented by the visible boundaries
between these two areas. In Fig. 10, A is a reference area and B is a target area. Their
directional relation can be represented by the visible boundaries between them, i.e. A1A2

Geoinformatica (2008) 12:193–217

207

and B4B5B1. With the consideration of Eqs. 18, 19 and 20, the final expression is as
follows:

Dir A; Bð

Þ ¼ Dir A1A2; B4B5B1

¼ Dir A1A2; B4

In essence, it is also the maximum angle which is formed by their visible boundaries for

each other.

4 Distribution tendency of directional relations: Median direction

The proposed direction interval only represents the distribution range of the directional
relation between spatial objects. However, this measure is not good enough. For example,
in Fig. 11, the distribution ranges of the directional relations between A and B in a and b are
same, but in a B locates mainly in the east of A, while in b B locates mainly in the northeast
of A. That is, there is a need of another descriptor for the central tendency of directional
relations.

Considering the facts that median is more robust than mean and that median is less
influenced by the shape of objects [14], in this study, median direction is selected as the
measure of central tendency of directional relations. In order to compute median direction
accurately, there is a need of an interpolation processing for extended objects, i.e. lines and
areas. In the following sections, we discuss the computation of median directions for these
two cases.

distribution tendency of the directional relation between A and B in a is obviously different from that in b

4.1 The case of line

When the reference or target object is a line, we sample points with equal interval. In this
way, we can obtain a set of interpolated points. Figure 12a is an example of a reference
point (A) and a target line (B), where B is interpolated into a set of points with equal
interval. From Eq. 3, we can compute the azimuths of all the linking lines from A to the
interpolated points. Assume that there are n interpolated points, thus total number of
azimuths is (n+2) that can be obtained to represent the distribution of the directional
relation between A and B by considering the two endpoints of target line. The median
direction is then the middle number of the ordered (n+2) azimuths. If n is odd, then the
middle number is (n+3)/2; if n is even, then the middle number is (n+2)/2 or (n+4)/2.

To compute the median direction, each of these target line segments is partitioned into
10,000 sub-segments, respectively. A total of 10,001 azimuths can be obtained between A
and each of target line segments (i.e. B1Bi). The distributions of the directional relations

polating processing of a region

between A and these line segments are shown in Fig. 13. The median directions (denoted by
MedDir) between A and B1Bi (i=2, 3, ..., 6) are as follows:

MedDir A; B1B2

Þ ¼ 40:9(cid:2);
Þ ¼ 45:0(cid:2);
Þ ¼ 49:1(cid:2);
Þ ¼ 51:1(cid:2):

Likewise, the approach proposed above can be applied to the case of polyline. In Fig. 11,
for instance, the median directions are 82.3° for a and 36.8° for b, respectively, although the
distribution ranges for them are identical, i.e. [17°, 101°].

A more general case is with a reference polyline (A) and a target polyline (B). Assume
that A is interpolated into n parts, i.e. (n+1) points, and that B is interpolated into m parts,
i.e. (m+1) points. There are (n+1)×(m+1) linking lines from A to B and thus (n+1)×(m+1)
azimuths to represent the distribution of the directional relation between A and B. Without
any difficulty, median direction can also be obtained.

4.2 The case of area

When reference or target object is an area, a vector-to-raster conversion is carried out to
partition the area into small raster cells. Figure 14 shows an example of this rasterization
process, where the area is represented by 51 cells.

Þ ¼ 29:4(cid:2); 82:2(cid:2)

In addition, the distribution range of directional relations (which has been discussed in
Section 3) can also be obtained in the computation of the median direction. As a result, the
computation complexity of the directional relations between two objects is mainly
dependent upon the number of the partitions (i.e. number of points for a line and number
of cells for an area).

5 Experimental evaluations

In order to evaluate the usefulness of the statistical measures of directional relations
presented in Sections 3 and 4, some typical examples are used for experimental testing. The
first test is on the validity of these statistical models and the second is on the closeness of
the results to human cognition.

Five pairs of spatial objects are selected, including point–line, point–area, line–line,
line–area, and area–area (see Fig. 16). For each pair of spatial objects A and B, each object

Geoinformatica (2008) 12:193–217

213

is used once as reference object and once as target object. Such a design is made to better
discover the transformation relation between the directional relations of two converse cases.
The distribution range and the median direction among these pairs of objects are computed
and the results are also shown in Fig. 16.

From Fig. 16 it can be seen that the distribution range of the directional relations for the
two converse cases satisfy the transformation relation expressed by Eq. 17, and the median
direction also satisfies the relation:

MedDir A; Bð

Þ ¼ MedDir B; Að

Þ (cid:7) 180(cid:2)

ð21Þ

where MedDir A; Bð

target object A.

Þ represents the median direction between reference object A and target
Þ represents the median direction between reference object B and

Þ ¼ MedDir B; Að

Þ ¼ 52:1(cid:2) and MedDir B; Að

For instance, in Fig. 16d, MedDir A; Bð

Þ ¼ 232:1(cid:2), so that
MedDir A; Bð
Þ (cid:3) 180(cid:2). Therefore, once the two measures of the directional
relations from A to B, Dir(A, B) and MedDir(A, B) are obtained, then Dir(B, A) and
MedDir(B, A) can be easily obtained by using Eqs. 17 and 21. Specifically speaking, this
computational model proposed in this paper can validly represent the reflectivity property
of directional relations.

In order to further check whether the computational model of directional relations is

consistent with human’s spatial cognition, two psychological tests are designed.

In Test one, a four-step procedure is adopted. First, the five pairs of objects in Fig. 16 are
distributed to a set of 20 subjects (readers or audience); second, they are asked to draw a
straight line to represent the directional relation of each pair of objects; third, the azimuth of

each drawn straight-line is measured by using a protractor; and at last, the measured results
are compared with the computed results.

The measured results are listed in Table 1. Due to the reflectivity property of directional
relations, we only list the results of A as reference object and B as target object. These
results are also shown in Fig. 17, where the longest line in each sub-figure represents
median direction computed by the model proposed in this paper.

The median value from these twenty direction values of each pair of spatial objects (see
row 4 from bottom in Table 1) is compared with the median value computed from the
statistical model (see row 3 from bottom in Table 1), to analyze the difference between the
computed values and experimental results. It is surprising that the maximum difference is
only 1.9°, and a minimum difference is as small as 0.2°.

Mean is another commonly used statistical measure and is also used for comparative
analysis. The mean values are also in Table 1. One can find that there is no much difference
between corresponding median and mean values. This is mainly because the distribution is
not very skewed for the examples used. Figure 18 is an example. In such a case, both the
mean and the median can be used for the measure of the distribution tendency of directional
relations.

In Test two, first, the computed median direction line for each pair of spatial objects in
Fig. 16 is drawn on the same map; second, these maps are distributed to another 20
subjects; third, each subject is asked to answer if they “totally agree”, “agree” or “do not
agree” to the drawn direction line. The resulting answers include 17 “totally agree” and 3
“agree”, as shown in Fig. 19.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, a statistical modeling approach is proposed for directional relations between
spatial objects. In this approach, (1) an extended spatial object is decomposed into small
components; (2) the directional relation between extended spatial objects is then determined
by the directions between these small components which form a distribution; and (3) two
measures (i.e. range and median direction) are utilized to describe the statistical property of
the distribution. Tests have also been carried out to evaluate the validity of the model
presented in this paper. Based on the results, some conclusions can be made as follows:

–The model developed in this paper is able to more accurately depict the directional
relation than existing models as no approximation of objects has been made in this
new model;

–The new model works very well, according to experimental

testing. This also
validates our assumption that the distribution range of the directional relation for two
given spatial objects is completely dependent on the visible range among them.
–The new model is able to derive Dir(A, B) from Dir(B, A), and Meddir(A, B) from
Meddir(B, A) without complex computation, and vice versa.

–This computational approach can be used to determine the internal and external
tangent lines of two spatial objects, which will further serve as a basis of reasoning
systems on ternary relations.

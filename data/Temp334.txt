Abstract. This paper applies generalised linear statistical techniques in a GIS to
analyse wildlife data from a Kenyan wildlife reserve and its surrounding areas.
Attention focuses on the spatial distribution of elephant during nine successive
surveys, analysing their temporal and spatial relationship to 12 environmental
covariates. A principal component analysis identi(cid:142) es (cid:142) ve major determining fac-
tors, thereby reducing dimensionality in the data, while a simple spatial analysis

appearing in abundance models is found to be subject to large variations during
successive surveys with a minimum and maximum of four and eight variables,
respectively. Species from highly clustered populations are found to have over 20
times more observations within short distances compared to the rest. The study
concludes that a combination of generalised linear modelling and GIS gives
deeper insight into the dynamics of wildlife species in and around well-de(cid:142) ned
nature reserves.

1.

Introduction
A lot of data on wildlife populations are routinely collected through airborne
surveys. In most cases, these data are geographically referenced and therefore spatial
in nature. Quite often too, the surveys are replicated over time, resulting in large
amounts of spatial and temporal data that need to be translated into useful informa-
tion. The advent of computer technology, particularly Geographical Information
Systems (GIS), has led to better methods of data storage, retrieval and manipulation.
For example, wildlife surveys can now be carried out using sampling procedures that
are optimised through consideration of landscape features and environmental factors
stored in a GIS. Also, relationships between animal population dynamics and envir-
onmental factors can now be studied simultaneously. Suitable analysis techniques,
which are capable of handling spatial and temporal variability, are however,
indispensable in yielding useful and reliable information.

In most modelling situations, high correlation between and within variables
directly aŒect the precision of estimated model parameters. Buckland and Elston
(1993) use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and
eliminate correlation between covariates, while Augustin et al. (1996) models spatial
autocorrelation in the distribution of wildlife. Both studies, however, do not
simultaneously model spatial autocorrelation and correlation in the covariates.

On the other hand, several studies have con(cid:142) rmed strong association between
animal species abundance and environmental factors (Osborne and Tigar 1992,
Buckland and Elston 1993). Among the statistical techniques used to establish these
relations,
logistic and multivariate regression analyses have been predominant
(Nichols 1989, Li et al. 1997). A shortcoming of these linear models is the assumption
of a normal distribution for the response variable. In situations where this assumption
is not tenable, generalised linear models (GLMs) provide a useful alternative
(McCullagh and Nelder 1989, Dobson 1990, Pereira and Itami 1991). Both linear
models and GLMs rely on an assumption that data are independently and identically
distributed.

It is known, however, that factors in(cid:143) uencing animal distribution i.e. vegetation
cover, soil fertility, distance to water points etc., are spatial in nature. Therefore,
there is need to combine GLM and GIS in modelling animal distribution so as to
account for spatial dependence.

In the past, Walker and Moore (1988 ) interfaced the software package SIMPLE
with a GIS to model wildlife distribution. In a subsequent study to relate kangaroo
distribution to climatic conditions, Walker (1990) combined the package with GLMs
to obtain results that compared favourably with those from the rule-based CART
algorithm (CART 1984). This indicated the usefulness of GIS modelling as a strategy
to analyse wildlife data. In both studies, however, abundance was re-expressed into
presence and absence data, to allow the use of logistic regression in the modelling,
which led to some loss of information.

The objective of the current study is to analyse observed spatial and temporal
patterns of four wildlife species found in a Kenyan wildlife ecosystem. We use GIS
techniques to identify and relate environmental factors to observed counts. We carry
out a spatial correlation analyses as well as generalised linear modelling and reduce
dimensionality in the data by means of PCA. Finally, we outline the ecological
implications of these analyses to the management of the four wildlife species,
i.e. elephant
(Alcelaphus buselaphus), wildebeest
(Connochaetes taurimus) and zebra (Equus burchelli ). We often use data on the
elephant to illustrate certain procedures.

2. Study area

The Masai Mara ecosystem (Mara), lying between 0ß 45¾ and 2ß 00¾ S, and 34ß 45¾
and 36ß 00¾ E and situated in Narok district of Kenya, is part of the larger Serengeti-
Mara plains, which straddle the international border of northern Tanzania and
southern Kenya. It consists of Masai Mara National Reserve (MMNR), Loita, Siana
and Mara plains and covers an area of approximatel y 6650 km2 ((cid:142) gure 1).

High rainfall, tall grassland and permanent water make Mara an important dry
season refuge for the last great migrating herds of wildebeest and zebra (Delany
1982, Murray 1995, Fryxell 1995, Broten and Said 1995 ). These two species, together
with the elephant and kongoni are among the most important large herbivores found
in Mara. Mara is also important from an economical perspective because of attracting

many tourists who bring in foreign earnings (GOK 1984 ). All these have led to an
increasing interest in analysing factors that in(cid:143) uence the abundance and distribution
of wildlife over time (Sinclair 1995).

3. Materials and methods
3.1. Data

Data for this study are a subset of a comprehensive dataset of surveys conducted
in Mara, since 1977 by the Department of Resource Surveys and Remote Sensing
(DRSRS) of the Ministry of Planning and National Development. We concentrated
on post-1990 surveys because those carried out previously may not have been
su(cid:141) ciently uniform and were, therefore, subject to unrealistic variation. Typical
surveys simultaneously observe several animal species. A number of pre-determined
strip transects (18–55) are systematically (cid:143) own by a light aircraft at (cid:142) xed height
(typically 122 m) and (cid:142) xed strip widths (282 m or 304 m). These are designed so as
to cover a sampling fraction of between 3.5% and 11.8% for the Mara (Grunblatt
et al. 1995). Distances between transects may vary for successive surveys, but 2500 m,
5000 m and 10 000 m are typical values (Grunblatt et al. 1995 ).

Transects are usually divided into sub-units of 5000 m length for which x and y
co-ordinate s as well as the number of observed animals of diŒerent species are
recorded. Based on these co-ordinates, remotely sensed environmental data such as
vegetation cover, composition and greenness are associated with each sub-unit.
Similarly, the shortest distance to permanent rivers, major roads and the boundary

of MMNR are calculated. Legislative changes have placed MMNR under favourable
protection and conservation status as compared to the surrounding areas. EŒects of
this protection are studied by de(cid:142) ning an explanatory variable that assigns 1 to
areas within MMNR and 0 otherwise. Average soil fertility as well as extents of
agricultural and fallow land were also recorded for each subunit. Finally, the data
were veri(cid:142) ed and formatted before being stored into a GIS.

The three explanatory variables for distance to rivers, roads and MMNR were
derived by rasterising and resampling digitised topographic maps of a 1:250 000 scale
to pixels of size equal to 30 m. We obtained vegetation cover variables by a supervised
classi(cid:142) cation of georeferenced Landsat TM images, which were complemented by
ground-truthing . Further, Normalised DiŒerence Vegetation Index (NDVI) values
were calculated from NOAA-AVHRR images that had a resolution of 1.1 km. These
were georeferenced using the Landsat TM image and resampled to a 30 m pixel size.
Finally, the soil fertility map of Mara (Jeatzold and Schmidt 1983 ) was digitised,
rasterised and resampled to a 30 m pixel size. In all analyses, observed animal
numbers were treated as response variables.

3.2. GIS modelling

In most wildlife studies, GIS modelling focuses on de(cid:142) ning habitat suitability for
various animal species (Tomlin et al. 1983, Walker 1990, Pereira and Itami 1991 ).
However, for modelling wildlife populations, both permanent and dynamic data
recorded during surveys are required. Functional GIS layers, mainly containing
topographica l data like vegetation cover, drainage and road networks, can store
these data as observed or interpolated counts of individual animal species (Burrough
and McDonnel 1998). For this study, major roads, the MMNR boundary, and the
drainage pattern of permanent rivers form three such data layers ((cid:142) gure 2).

Modelling was preceded by a descriptive and correlation analysis of all variables
in this study. We restricted the analyses to survey 9703 of 1997 and only used data
on the elephant to illustrate the procedure of modelling spatial and temporal distribu-
tion. The elephant are an important indicator species, being protected and subject
to changing nutritional conditions (Delany 1982, Dublin 1995). They also possess
solitary and clustering characteristics and are easily observable due to their large
size. We hypothesised the elephant abundance to be related to several environmental
factors. The exact form of this relation being unknown, but able to be modelled
using a GLM. We used the 12 explanatory variables to represent diŒerent GIS layers,
whose combined overlay would have been too complex for interpretation (table 1).
We, therefore, started the modelling by making bivariate comparisons.

We followed a deductive modelling approach, although inductive modelling is
also common in GIS studies (Walker 1990, Pereira and Itami 1991). Deductive
models start from a general idea that is applied to speci(cid:142) c observations, while
inductive modelling derives general principles from observing many speci(cid:142) c examples
(Stoms et al. 1992 ). As a starting point, we utilised the knowledge that elephant
generally prefer tall grassland and shrubby vegetation (Rosero 1997). Similarly, past
studies of Mara suggest that elephant are mainly found in MMNR (Broten and Said
1995 ). We tested these ideas by successively overlaying observed elephant counts
with data layers for tall grassland, shrubby grassland, boundary of MMNR, perman-
ent rivers, major roads, average soil fertility and conservation status. A subset of
layers that indicated high correlation with elephant abundance was identi(cid:142) ed and a
combined overlay formed. We studied interaction between elephant and the other

animal species by analysing spatial patterns observed during the same survey. We
also modelled temporal changes in elephant abundance by analysing spatial patterns
in the nine successive post-1990 surveys.

3.3. Distance measure of spatial correlation

Landscape features and local conditions may govern the spatial variability
observed in wildlife data and hence aŒect distribution of diŒerent species. Some
species may cluster close to available nutrients but become increasingly sparse in
drier sub-areas. Such variability can be quanti(cid:142) ed by spatial correlation measures
dependent upon distances between neighbouring sub-units. A high occurrence of
short distances implies clustered populations. In this study we used Euclidean

distances between sub-units, together with absolute diŒerences in observed animal
counts to calculate a measure of spatial correlation.

The neighbourhood con(cid:142) guration for each sub-unit includes neighbours along
the transect as well as on adjacent transects. Therefore, distances from the centre of
a sub-unit to its adjacent neighbours equals 2500 m along the transect, 2500 m and
3536 m perpendicularly and diagonally to adjacent transects, respectively ((cid:142) gure 3).
We took the diagonal distance between two adjacent sub-units (longest separation)
to represent a unit d and classi(cid:142) ed all distances into multiples of d. We considered
clustering by counting the distances within intervals of d, 2d, 3d or 4d. We stand-
ardised the number of distances in each interval for comparison by determining
proportions with respect to all pairs of sub-units with non-zero counts per species.
We also calculated absolute diŒerences in abundance between pairs of sub-units
having non-zero counts. We expected most observations of sub-units with non-zero
counts from clustered populations to fall into intervals with the smallest distances
(d or 2d). This is the same as expecting most observed animals to be found
in adjacent sub-units leading to some similarity between this procedure and the
h-scatter plot (Isaaks and Shrivastava 1989: p. 52).

3.4. Generalised linear models

Most wildlife modelling involves transformation of the response variable (animal
counts) into a presence/absence outcome so as to allow use of the logit link (Buckland
and Elston 1993, Augustin et al. 1996, Li et al. 1997), which models the probability
of an animal’s presence without giving information on abundance. Further, for
animals in herds, equal weights are assigned to sampling units having only one
animal as to units with hundreds of animals. This is clearly undesirable when
modelling animal abundance for a wildlife reserve. Therefore, an alternative link
function is necessary to model wildlife abundance.

adjacent transects t and t 1 1. The longest nearest neighbour distance is that between
diagonal sub-units i and l, which is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem as
shown above.

GLMs allow (cid:142) tting of models to data without the requirement of normality by
letting the random component assume any distribution from the exponential family.
The random component is then related to the systematic component through a
monotonic diŒerentiable function known as a link function(McCullagh and Nelder
1989 ). Several link functions are available depending on the type of response variable.

In case of normality, g equals m and both can take any value on the real line
leading to the identity link of classical linear models. For count data, however, m
must always be greater than zero, which invalidates the assumption of normality
and the use of the identity link. We use a log link g 5

assumes a Poisson distribution for the observed counts and modelling proceeds via
log-linear models. Again we only used data on elephant abundance from the nine
surveys for this modelling.

3.4.1. L og-linear modelling

Poisson–like processes are best modelled using log-linear models, which avoid
the restriction imposed by equality of the Poisson mean to the variance. The log-
linear models used in this study assumed the following relationship between the
variance and mean:

Var(Y i) 5 dE(Y i)

The dispersion parameter term d is constant over the data, with d > 1 implying
over-dispersion and d < 1 under-dispersion. Since most wildlife species exhibit clus-
tering, we expect the variance to be higher than the mean (over-dispersion) . We,
therefore, assume a log-linear model of the form:

implying that

i 5 1, 2, ..., n

mi 5 E(Yi) 5

exp(gi) 5

p
exp(XTi b) 5 a
j= 1

exp (XTijbj)

This leads to a multiplicative relationship between mi and the covariate vector
Xi. From (4), we regress log (mi) on the set of covariates to yield the regression
equation:

log (mi) 5 b0 1 b1X1i 1 b2X2i 1

... 1 bpXpi

and we refer to this as log-linear regression, which is equivalent to generalised linear
modelling with a log link.

In common statistical software like S-plus, GLMs with the Poisson family imposes
an over-dispersion parameter of one. This limitation is overcome by using the quasi
family with a log link, which allows over-dispersion to vary from one model to
another. We then estimate parameters via the quasi-likelihood estimating equations
(qee) (McCullagh and Nelder 1989: p. 327). This yields similar coe(cid:141) cients but with
improved standard errors than those obtained via the usual maximum likelihood.

3.4.2. Principal component analysis

We use PCA to compose the original variables into linearly independent ortho-
gonal principal components (PCs) and thereby reduce dimensionality in the data.
Usually, there are as many PCs as there are variables, but with only the (cid:142) rst few,
which account for most of the variation in the data being considered in practice.
For example, a PCA involving p variables decomposes into the following linear
combination of original variables:

PCi 5 ji1X1i 1 ji2 X2i 1

... 1 jijXji 1

... 1 jip Xpi

(7)

where PCi is the ith PC and jij is the coe(cid:141) cient corresponding to variable Xji. The
coe(cid:141) cients jij form a matrix j composed of eigenvectors from the covariance matrix
of independent variables. Eigenvalues derived from the covariance matrix represent
the PCs’ ability to re(cid:143) ect the original variables. High eigenvalues imply high ability.
Using data from survey 9703, new variables are derived from the PCs and used in

841

a stepwise regression to determine which PCs best modelled the distribution of
elephant in Mara for 1997.

In this study, we use the geographical information system software ARC/INFO
7.2 and ArcView 3.0a (ESRI 1996) for map-production and spatial data analysis,
while generalised linear modelling and PCA are carried out using S-Plus 4.5 release
2 (Mathsoft 1997).

4. Results
4.1. GIS modelling

From descriptive statistics (table 2), short and shrubby grasslands collectively
account for nearly 70% of the vegetation cover type, with shrubby grassland being
nearly 10% more abundant than short grassland (39.05% and 30.12%, respectively).
We observe the highest correlation (0.654) between wildebeest counts and the number
of sub-units under agricultural or fallow land, implying a possible con(cid:143) ict between
man and beast. The negative correlation between the number of sub-units under the
most abundant vegetation cover (short and shrubby grassland ) and sub-units under
agricultural or fallow land indicate possible clearance of land for human encroach-
ment. The zebra are positively correlated with wildebeest as expected since both are
migratory species preferring similar habitats. The amount of tall grass appear to
decrease as one moves away from MMNR, which has a high conservation status as
indicated by a high negative correlation coe(cid:141) cient (Õ 0.495) between tallgr and
constat. The positive correlation between distreserve and distance to the river (dis-
trive) may be explained by the fact that permanent rivers in Mara are mainly found
within MMNR. The high correlation between distance to MMNR and land under
agricultural or fallow suggests that more agricultural activities are taking place close
to or even within MMNR.

We observe a high occurrence of sub-units under tall grass cover in MMNR
while modelling in GIS. This coincides with high elephant abundance in the same
area ((cid:142) gure 4(a)) thus supporting results from the correlation analysis. The many
sub-units with a high shrubby grassland cover and no elephant support a weak
correlation between shrubby grassland and elephant abundance. Other bivariate
overlays suggest occurrence of more elephant within or close to MMNR as well as
within short distances of permanent rivers compared to similar distances from major
roads. The combined overlay of observed elephant counts, major roads and perman-
ent rivers in Mara, as well as the boundary of MMNR reinforce this observation
((cid:142) gure 4(b)). Overlaying these counts on other factors like NDVI, sub-units under
agriculture or fallow land and human population density does not reveal a strong
relation ((cid:142) gure 4(c)). A high observation of elephant in MMNR, however, is in
apparent avoidance of
land under agriculture mostly found outside the reserve,
which suggests a negative relationship between elephant abundance and increased
agricultural activity in this ecosystem ((cid:142) gure 4(c)).

Occurrence of elephant and kongoni interacts negatively with each other as well
as with other species, as indicated by their occupation of spatially separate regions
of the study area ((cid:142) gure 5 ). We observe wildebeest and zebra in similar regions,
again suggesting high interaction between their habitats. These two species were
mainly concentrated in Loita plains, but were also observed in other areas of Mara.
From the nine successive surveys, elephant were mainly observed within or near
MMNR ((cid:142) gure 6). This supports the signi(cid:142) cance of distreserve in explaining the
abundance and distribution of the elephant. Their spatial patterns diŒer signi(cid:142) cantly

over time, with surveys 9102 and 9103 both being carried out in the same year but
giving very diŒerent patterns. Survey 9102 was carried out at the end of the dry
season (April), while 9103 was carried out after the rainy season (August), a period
when migratory species come to Mara from Serengeti (Murray 1995). This might
explain the higher elephant abundance for 9103 (181 animals) compared to 19
animals for 9102, and suggests that season may be an in(cid:143) uencing factor on elephant
abundance. This is, however, contradicted by observations in the following year
(1992) where two surveys 9202 (March) and 9204 (August) show nearly four times
more elephant during the dry season (498) compared to the wet season (127). Even
surveys carried out during the same month but in diŒerent years show little relation
in the spatial distribution of observed elephant. For example, surveys 9003, 9103,
9204 and 9604, which were all carried out in August, show much year to year
variation in their spatial distribution. These indicate the need to consider other
factors in explaining elephant distribution.

4.2. Distance measure for spatial correlation

We obtain measures of spatial correlation for the four animal species within
distance intervals by computing proportions of distances between sub-units having
non-zero counts (table 3). We also calculate sums of absolute diŒerences between all

contributing pairs of sub-units. For example, survey 9703 yields 20 sub-units with
non-zero elephant counts leading to 190 possible pairs. Three of these pairs are
within distance d, representing a 1.6% proportion and a sum of absolute diŒerences
equal to 113. A similar approach is taken for all other distance intervals per species.
The kongoni appear to be the least clustered of the four species by having a low
number of pairs in the lower intervals compared to higher intervals (2, 3, 9 and 9
for d, 2d, 3d and 4d, respectively). Elephant exhibit both solitary and clustered
behaviour by having comparable sums of absolute diŒerences in three of the (cid:142) rst
four distance intervals (113, 120 and 156 for d, 2d and 4d units, respectively). The
sum of absolute diŒerences for both zebra and wildebeest are much higher than for
kongoni and elephant in the (cid:142) rst distance class (1183 and 2047 versus 19 and 113,
respectively). We observe a similar situation in the other distance intervals indicating
that zebra and wildebeest are highly clustered and spatially correlated. For the four
animal species, this spatial correlation decreases with increasing distance as suggested
by an increasing number of observations within higher distance intervals as well as
large sums of absolute diŒerences.

4.3. Generalised linear modelling
4.3.1. L og-linear modelling

For each of the nine successive surveys, elephant abundance is modelled with
respect to the 12 independent variables (table 1). We consider signi(cid:142) cance at the 5%
level and present the results as a matrix showing only signi(cid:142) cant variables in each
model representing observations in one survey. The variables constat, distreserve,
distance to road (distroad ) and average soil fertility (avferti), are signi(cid:142) cant in six

out of nine models and hence, may be useful in explaining elephant abundance
(table 4). Other signi(cid:142) cant variables include distrive, tallgr and agrofall, all appearing
in four models each. Also, forest cover (forest) and short grassland (shotgr) are
signi(cid:142) cant in three models.

Coe(cid:141) cients for distreserve have a negative sign in all models indicating a reduc-
tion in elephant counts with an increase in distance from MMNR. Similarly, the
negative coe(cid:141) cients of agrofall suggest that an increase in agriculture or fallow land
lead to a decrease in elephant abundance. This is consistent with earlier results from

the correlation analysis. The year to year variation in model composition may be
attributed to diŒerences in the numbers of observed elephant caused by other factors
that were not studied here like periods of drought, seasonal changes, poaching etc.

sign, respectively, indicating an inverse relation between average fertility and
distance to MMNR.

Other variables do not signi(cid:142) cantly contribute to the (cid:142) rst (cid:142) ve PCs.
A stepwise regression of the variables derived from the (cid:142) ve PCs for survey 9703

5. Discussion

From results of the log-linear modelling, the distance to MMNR turns out to be
a strong variable in explaining elephant abundance. Its large, but negative contribu-
in the PCA reinforces the negative relation of elephant abundance to
tion to PC
1
being signi(cid:142) cant in a
distance from MMNR. This relation is con(cid:142) rmed by PC
1
stepwise modelling of abundance to derived variables (table 5). A possible explana-
tion of this relation lies in the fact that the three permanent rivers in the Mara
ecosystem i.e. Mara, Talek and Sand rivers, all drain MMNR. Since elephant are
water dependent, their distribution will be limited to areas close to permanent water
sources like MMNR.

Said (1993) and Rosero (1997 ) observed a similar inverse relation between
elephant abundance and the distance to MMNR. Rosero (1997) further reported the
African elephant to be intermediate bulk feeders that are not very selective. They
prefer grass to browse and are generally found in areas with high precipitation. This
may explain why in all models, the elephant were predominantly observed on the
western part of Mara. This is a region of (cid:143) at plains with open and woody grasslands,
which provide suitable habitat for the elephant.

The (cid:143) uctuation of elephant abundance in Mara over the nine successive surveys
may be related to poaching. In the 1980s severe poaching in Serengeti caused the
elephant to migrate to Mara and seek refuge in the protected MMNR, and thereby
limiting their ranging patterns (Dublin and Douglas-Hamilton 1987). This is sup-
ported by the consistent signi(cid:142) cance of distreserve in the elephant abundance models.
Although conservation status is a signi(cid:142) cant variable in several models of GLM,
its eŒect is suspect as its coe(cid:141) cient keeps changing signs from model to model. The
fact that it fails to contribute signi(cid:142) cantly to any of the PCs in the PCA also supports
this lack of signi(cid:142) cance. We, therefore, cannot establish a signi(cid:142) cant eŒect of conserva-
tion status on elephant abundance in this study. This is surprising because this
variable is highly correlated with the distance to MMNR, a protected area where
many elephant are found. On the other hand, Mara is composed of a gazetted
wildlife protected area (MMNR) plus adjacent group ranches that act as wildlife
dispersal areas. The size of MMNR has, however, changed several times over the
last 20 years with more land being de-gazetted to pave way for agricultural expansion
and human settlements (GOK 1984 ). This has reduced the elephant habitat and

may explain why agricultural or fallow land is signi(cid:142) cant in several models, as well
as contributing the largest negative loading to PC

We do not observe a signi(cid:142) cant eŒect of distance to road on elephant abundance
in the PCA mainly because of the di(cid:141) culty in detecting an eŒect at the coarse
resolution of data collection (2.5Ö 5 km). Similarly, although soil fertility in Mara
ranges from high to very low (Broten and Said 1995), it has an insigni(cid:142) cant eŒect
on elephant abundance in this study. Its alternating signs in the log-linear models
and its large loadings in the PCA only contribute to the less important fourth and
(cid:142) fth PCs.

in the PCA.

The four animal species in this study have diverse ecological characteristics and
social behaviour. The wildebeest and zebra are largely found in herds, elephant are
solitary but also aggregate into medium herds, while the kongoni are mainly solitary.
Further, the wildebeest and zebra are migratory, coming to Mara at the end of the
rainy season. This study shows the two migratory species to have overlapping niches.
Their dietary requirements, however, indicate diŒering trophic preferences, which
results in their sequential arrival into Mara (Delany 1982). The zebra, preferring tall
and less nutritious grass, move in (cid:142) rst, and their trampling and removal make grass
suitable for consumption by the wildebeest, which prefer short grasses with a large
proportion of leaf and a small amount of stem (Murray 1995). This intensive grazing
stimulates growth of new plants, which are preferred by the last of the migrating
ungulates, i.e. the Thomson gazelle (Gazella thomsoni). The dietary requirements of
wildebeest and zebra also lead them to congregate into large herds as observed in
this study.

The vegetation in MMNR mainly consists of tall grasses like T hemeda triandra,
setaria sphacelata and pennisetum mezianum (Sinclair 1975), which do not contain
the high protein and soluble carbohydrate s preferred by wildebeest. This may explain
why this species migrates to the Siana and Loita plains, where forage has richer
nutrient composition compared to MMNR. The apparent repulsion in habitat occu-
pation between the resident kongoni and migratory species may be due to interspecies
competition (Sinclair 1995). However, further research is needed to con(cid:142) rm this
hypothesis.

6. Concluding remarks

In this study, application of GIS allows the storage and analysis of wildlife data
for both single species as well as for interaction between several species. The usefulness
of GIS is highlighted by the ease with which we relate environmental data to both
spatial and temporal changes in abundance. Therefore, GIS oŒers a useful framework
for making precise statements about factors in(cid:143) uencing wildlife variability.

Currently, a de(cid:142) ciency of standard GIS packages is the lack of an elegant and
systematic method to simultaneously analyse spatial and temporal changes for
wildlife data. The reason being that most GIS software can only describe and display
geographical data, while lacking the ability to develop new hypotheses. Combining
GIS and GLM provides an opportunity to model the eŒects of environmental factors
on a quantitative response variable like animal counts, although not as a single step
procedure. This lead to a better understanding of spatial and temporal relationships
in wildlife data, as illustrated in this paper. This study also demonstrate s how taking
advantage of spatial statistical routines, especially in a GIS environment, can extend
standard statistical procedures.

An issue of continuing debate is the quality of data. In general, a lot of data

exists on diŒerent aspects of wildlife dynamics, and if the scale at which it has been
collected is (cid:142) ne enough, then conversion of diŒerent layers to a suitable resolution
is not a major problem. For purposes of monitoring abundance and distribution of
wildlife, these data can be considered to be su(cid:141) ciently reliable as long as the method
of collection is standardised over successive surveys. Any bias and/or imprecision is
assumed to remain constant, thereby allowing inferences to be made on any trends
in abundance.

The data from DRSRS used in this study are fairly reliable, having been obtained
through a consistent survey procedure. However, carrying out a more rigorous
spatial analysis turns out to be far from easy. In particular, calculation of the
variogram was unsatisfactory due to the structuring of data within transects. That
is why we propose a measure that allows modelling of spatial dependence in a simple
and straightforward way for wildlife data collected via transects. This is essential
because once spatial distribution has been modelled, abundance and distribution
can e(cid:141) ciently be monitored over time. Moreover, prediction of
future changes
becomes relevant when aspects of management are considered. For instance, the
procedures we propose in this study may indicate at an early stage, where and when
speci(cid:142) c interventions have to be taken in terms of preserving available water and
nutrient resources, or when faced with other threats like human encroachment.

Sampling is one of the main causes of poor abundance estimates (Caughley 1974,
Thompson 1992 ). Recent developments in sampling techniques such as distance
sampling (Buckland et al 1990) and adaptive sampling (Thomson and Seber 1996)
have been used to yield substantial improvements in estimation. With these tech-
niques, using correct models of distribution may further help to improve sampling.
For example, this study suggests that sampling eŒorts may be concentrated in sub-
areas close to MMNR, where elephant are more likely to be found. More research
is still being carried out to improve the sampling of dynamic populations.

This paper demonstrate s how deductive-analytica l spatial modelling in GIS can
be used to identify environmental preferences for diŒerent animal species. The proced-
ures outlined here are applicable in any situation where wildlife surveys are carried
out and indeed for any large herbivore. Although a method-sensitivity was not
carried out, the results obtained appear consistent with what is known about the
species studied. The gist of this paper is in highlighting how combining statistical
techniques with GIS provides a uni(cid:142) ed way of modelling animal distribution and
abundance while quantifying the associated uncertainty in data from wildlife resorts.

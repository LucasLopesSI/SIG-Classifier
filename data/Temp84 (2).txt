Abstract Statistical models for areal data are primarily used for smoothing maps
revealing spatial trends. Subsequent interest often resides in the formal identification
of ‘boundaries’ on the map. Here boundaries refer to ‘difference boundaries’, rep-
resenting significant differences between adjacent regions. Recently, Lu and Carlin
(Geogr Anal 37:265–285, 2005) discussed a Bayesian framework to carry out edge
detection employing a spatial hierarchical model that is estimated using Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Here we offer an alternative that avoids
MCMC and is easier to implement. Our approach resembles a model comparison
problem where the models correspond to different underlying edge configurations
across which we wish to smooth (or not). We incorporate these edge configurations
in spatially autoregressive models and demonstrate how the Bayesian Information
Criteria (BIC) can be used to detect difference boundaries in the map. We illustrate
our methods with a Minnesota Pneumonia and Influenza Hospitalization dataset to
elicit boundaries detected from the different models.

Geographical referencing depends upon the resolution of the data: when data
referencing is done with respect to the coordinates of the location (e.g. latitude
and longitude), we call them point-referenced, as is common in environmental and
ecological studies, while data aggregated over regions in a map (e.g. mortality rates
by counties or zip-codes) are called areally-referenced or lattice. In the domain of
public health, due to patient confidentialities, data are usually of the latter type
and are usually available as case counts or rates referenced to areal regions, such
as counties, census-tracts or ZIP codes, rather than the geographical location of
the individual residences. These regions offer a convenient way of grouping the
population and preserving confidentiality.

Statistical models for spatial data are primarily concerned with explaining varia-
tion, separating spatial signals from noise and improving estimation and prediction.
These models capture associations or correlations across space depending upon the
type of referencing in the data. For point-referenced datasets, models customarily
employ spatial processes to capture spatial associations as a function of Euclidean
geometric objects such as distance and direction. These models are popular in geo-
statistics (see, e.g., [4, 13]) and provide spatial interpolation or “kriging” accounting
for uncertainty in estimation and prediction.

For areally-referenced data, the association structures are built upon adjacencies
or neighborhood structures of the regions. Here the statistical models regard ob-
servations from a region to be more similar to those from its neighboring regions
than those arising from regions farther away. These structures underpin spatially
weighted regression models and spatial autoregressive models that have been widely
employed for smoothing maps and evincing spatial trends and clusters. They have
been applied extensively in econometrics (see, e.g. [1, 2, 23, 24]) and public health
(see, e.g., [4, 34]).

Subsequent inferential interest often resides not in the statistically estimated maps
themselves, but on the formal identification of “edges” or “boundaries” on the spatial
surface or map. The ‘boundary’ here refers to those on the map that reflect sharp
differences of the outcome variable between its two incident regions. Detecting such
boundaries for contagious diseases such as influenza, can help surveillance systems
control or at least slow down the spread of the infection and better manage local
treatment response (e.g. targeting vaccine delivery).

In this article, we offer a BIC based spatial autoregressive model to Minnesota
Pneumonia and Influenza Hospitalization data. We identify the boundaries that
separate the more affected areas from the less affected areas. These boundaries could
provide information to the government or other related departments to identify areas
of the most rapid change in incidence and prevalence for adjusting local treatment
response (e.g. targeting vaccine delivery).

2 “Wombling”: detecting boundaries of abrupt change on maps

This boundary detection problem is often referred to as “wombling”, after a foun-
dational article by Womble [36], much like “kriging” obtained its name from the
pioneering work of Krige. For point-referenced models, investigators often seek
boundaries that reflect rapid change on the estimated spatial surface. Applications
in the literature include detection of ecotones in forests [16] and the edges of

Geoinformatica (2011) 15:435–454

437

distinct soil zones. Fortin and Drapeau [17] reported that this technique correctly
detects boundaries in both simulated and real environmental data. For example,
raster wombling, also known as lattice wombling, operates on numeric raster data –
where the sampling locations are aligned in a rectangular grid, forming pixels.
Barbujani and Sokal [6] used raster wombling to identify genetic boundaries in
Eurasian human populations. Bocquet-Appel and Bacro [10] applied a multivariate
approach to genetic, morphometric and physiologic characteristics, and found that it
correctly detected the locations of simulated transition zones. Fortin [18] delineated
boundaries for tree and shrub density, percent coverage, and species presence-
absence. Recently Banerjee and Gelfand [5] developed a more formal statistical
inferential framework for detecting curves representing rapid change on estimated
spatial process surfaces.

While wombling methods have been applied extensively to point-referenced data,
they are relatively less visible in areal contexts. Areal wombling, also known as
polygonal wombling, has been addressed by Jacquez and Greiling [21, 22] to estimate
boundaries of rapid change for colorectal, lung and breast cancer incidence in Nas-
sau, Suffolk and Queens counties in New York. They proposed algorithms assigning
boundary likelihood values (BLV’s) to each areal boundary using an Euclidean
distance metric between neighboring observations. This Euclidean distance metric
is looked upon as a “dissimilarity” value. Dissimilarity values are calculated for each
pair of adjacent regions, adjacency being defined as sharing a border. Thus, if i and j
are neighbors then the BLV associated with the edge (i, j) is ||yi − y j||, where || · || is
some appropriate metric (for instance Euclidean for continuous responses, Hamming
for binary responses). Locations with higher BLV’s are more likely to be a part of a
difference boundary, since the variable changes rapidly there.

While attractive in their simplicity and ease of use, the algorithmic approaches
do not account for all sources of uncertainty and can lead to spurious statistical
inference. For instance, public health data are often characterized by extremeness
in counts and rates corresponding to certain thinly populated regions that arises due
to random variation in the observed data rather than any systematic differences.
Statistical models assist in capturing spatial variation and separating them from
random noise. A more detailed review of the existing algorithmic approaches and
their deficiencies can be found in Lu and Carlin [26], who proposed a statistical
modelling framework to carry out areal wombling. They considered disease count
data (Yi, Ei), where Yi and Ei are the observed and internally standardized expected
counts from the ith county and employed a spatial hierarchical model that is estimated
using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Statistical inference proceeds
from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Lu and Carlin [26], and Wheeler
and Waller [35] investigate different metrics (cid:2)ij for the BLV and identify boundaries
using the posterior means of the BLV. The CAR model, however, smooths across all
geographical neighbors, and can lead to over-smoothing and subsequent underesti-
mation of several (cid:2)ij’s.

To remedy this problem, Lu et al. [27] and Ma et al. [28] investigated estimating
the adjacency matrix within a hierarchical framework using priors on the adjacency
relationships. However, these models often involve weakly identifiable parameters
that are difficult to estimate from the data. Fairly informative prior knowledge
is required that is usually unavailable. Furthermore, they employ computationally
expensive MCMC algorithms that can be inexorably slow in converging to the desired
posterior distributions.

The current article focuses primarily upon areally-referenced models and de-
tecting “difference boundaries” on spatial maps. Our current work investigates a
middle ground between the algorithmic approaches that ignore sources of variation
and the fully Bayesian hierarchical modelling approaches that are computationally
prohibitive. We treat the areal wombling problem as one of model comparison and
seek to learn about difference boundaries from the data by considering the influence
of each edge on these models. For this purpose, we employ the Bayesian Information
Criteria (BIC) that has become a popular tool in statistical learning and data
mining to approximate the marginal posterior probabilities of the different models
and identify the influence of the edges. Exhausting all possible models will again
become computationally prohibitive, hence we consider a “leave-one-out” algorithm
that assesses the influence of each edge in the map, given all the other edges are
present.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 3 reviews spatial
autoregression models for areal data analysis. Section 5 discusses the Bayesian
inferential paradigm and the Bayesian Information Criteria. Section 6 illustrates the
BIC methodology for areal wombling using some simulated scenarios as well as an
appication to a Pneumonia and Influenza (P& I) dataset from Minnesota. Finally,
Section 7 concludes the paper with some discussion and indication towards future
work.

3 Statistical models for areal data analysis

Areal data are referenced by regions in a geographical map, which can be repre-
sented as an n × n matrix W, whose (i, j)-th entry, wij, connects units in i and j
spatially in some fashion. Customarily wii is set to 0. Possibilities include binary
choices, i.e. wij = 1 if i and j share some common boundary, perhaps a vertex (as
in a regular grid). Alternatively, wij could reflect “distance” between units, e.g., a
decreasing function of inter-centroidal distances between the units (as in a county
or other regional map). But distance can be returned to a binary determination. For
example we could set wij = 1 for all i and j within a specified distance. Or, for a given
i, we could get wij = 1 if j is one of the K nearest (in distance) neighbors of i. While
W is often symmetric, it is not necessarily so; for instance, the K-nearest neighbors
example provides a setting where symmetry may be violated. For the illustrations in
this article we will consider a connected map (i.e. no islands) and a symmetric binary
proximty matrix W.

As the notation suggests, the entries in W can be viewed as weights. More weight
will be associated with j’s closer (in some sense) to i than those farther away from i. In
this exploratory context W provides the mechanism for introducing spatial structure
into statistical models. To see this consider the symmetric binary specification for W
and let y = (y1, . . . , yn)(cid:2) be an n × 1 vector of outcomes where yi has been observed
in the i-th region. An intuitively appealing spatial smoother would smooth the
obervation in each region by taking the mean of its neighbors. Thus, each yi would
be predicted by the average of its neighbors, say ˆyi = 1
j∼i y j with ∼ denoting “is
wi+
a neighbor of” and wi+ being the number of neighbors of region i. A statistical model
for this smoother would relate the i-th observation to the mean of its neighbors.

iid∼∼ N(0, τ 2) is a stochastic
representing the strength of the spatial association and (cid:4)i
error or noise component for each observation. This error could be representative
of variability from a number of sources including unobserved explanatory variables,
sampling error and so on.

The key problem in statistical inference is to sensibly model spatial associations
over the map while yielding a theoretically valid joint probability distributions.
Letting ˜W be the row-normalized matrix with entries ˜wij, we can write the above
model as y = ρ ˜Wy + (cid:2), whence y = (I − ρ ˜W)−1(cid:2). Provided that the inverse exists,
we have the dispersion matrix of y as (cid:6)(τ 2, ρ, W) = τ 2[(I − ρ ˜W(cid:2))(I − ρ ˜W)]−1. Using
standard eigen-analysis (see, e.g., [1, 4]) it can be shown that (I − ρ ˜W)−1 exists
˜W. It is also true
whenever ρ ∈ (1/λ(1), 1), where λ(1) is the smallest eigen-value of
that λ(1) is real-valued and negative, but restricting ρ ∈ (0, 1) yields non-negative
elements in (I − ρ ˜W)−1. This seems to be more intuitive in spatial settings, where
negative associations between proximate locations is difficult to envision. With this
restriction on ρ, we obtain a valid joint multivariate Gaussian distribution y ∼
MV N(0, (cid:6)(τ 2, ρ, W)). This is called a Simultaneous Autoregression (SAR) model.
In public-health data analysis contexts, it is often desired to carry out spatial
inference after adjusting for certain important covariates that explain the large-scale
variation seen in the data. This leads to random effect or hierarchical linear models,

yi = x (cid:2)

i

where yi is the dependent variable, xi a vector of areally-referenced regressors and φi
are spatial random effects that model association between adjacent regions. Thus, we
would now let φ = (φ1, . . . , φn)(cid:2) follow a SAR model, i.e. φ ∼ MV N(0, (cid:6)(τ 2, ρ, W)).
A very important point, at least in our current context, is to note that the SAR models
are well-suited to maximum likelihood estimation but not at all for MCMC fitting of
Bayesian models. In fact, the log likelihood associated with Eq. 1 is

Though ρ ˜W will introduce a regression or autocorrelation parameter, the quadratic
form is quick to evaluate (requiring no matrix inverse) and the determinant can usu-
ally be calculated rapidly using diagonally dominant, sparse matrix approximations.
Thus maximization can be done iteratively but, in general, efficiently. On the other
hand, we note that the absence of a hierarchical form with random effects implies
complex Bayesian model fitting.

The SAR model, with the help of the proximity matrix, captures spatial associa-
tions by assuming that neighboring regions are likely to exhibit greater association
than regions that are not neighbors. This degree of association is controlled by the
so-called spatial autocorrelation parameter ρ. A consequence of this is that the SAR
model smooths the outcome across neighboring regions to produce maps that better
reveal regions where the response tends to cluster. However, smoothing across all
geographical boundaries may lead to oversmoothing resulting in maps that would
tend to conceal difference boundaries. Arriving at models that are formally selected
using a statistical paradigm will deliver the optimal adjacency matrix Wk and, in the
process, would have solved the “wombling” problem by identifying “true” edges that
should not be smoothed across. Indeed these edges are the “complements” of Wk in

440

being those entries that were 1 in W but are 0 in Wk, i.e., edges corresponding to the
1 entries in W − Wk.

Unlike SAR models, a Conditional Autoregression (CAR) specification would
model each effect conditional upon the remaining effects. Such a model specifies
conditional distributions

Besag [9] proved that these full conditional distributions specify a joint distribution
for the φi’s such that φ ∼ MV N(0, τ 2[D − ρW]−1). Now, one needs to make sure
that D − ρW is positive definite, a sufficient condition for which (see, e.g., [4]) is to
restrict ρ ∈ (1/λ(1), 1). Assuncao and Krainski [3] also provide discussion of the ρ
parameter and explanations that help the practitioner to view the covariance matrix
of a CAR model in a natural way. The CAR model has been especially popular in
Bayesian inference as its conditional specification is convenient for Gibbs sampling
and MCMC schemes. The relationship between the CAR and SAR models in terms
of resulting spatial correlations and their interpretations has been explored by Wall
[33].

4 Statistical detection of boundary effects

Returning to our primary problem of detecting difference boundaries, we formulate
this problem as one of comparing between models that represent different boundary
hypotheses. A boundary hypotheses corresponds to a particular underlying map
specifying which edges should be smoothed over and which should not. A few
issues, however, arise regarding the exact choice of the model. For instance, consider
the hypothesis of no difference boundaries at all in the map. What model would
correspond to this hypothesis?

If we believe there are no difference boundaries at all, should we consider the
map as comprising a single region? This implies having no region-specific effects
at all or, equivalently, W = 0 (the null matrix), thereby reducing Eq. 1 to a simple
linear regression model with no random effects and (cid:2) ∼ MV N(0, σ 2 I). Alternatively,
we could still regard yi as arising from n different regions but, given the absence
of difference boundaries, we would retain independent regional effects instead of
spatial structures in the model. This would amount to ρW = I so that Cov(φ, (cid:2)) = 0
and we obtain a linear random effects model with iid regional effects. The choice is
not straightforward and may depend upon the objectives of the analysis.

Here we will adopt the second approach, where we always retain random effects
and consider models varying in their specification of W that controls spatial smooth-
ing. At the other extreme all the geographical edges may in fact be difference
boundaries. Any intermediate model that lies between these extremes is completely
specified by modifying the original map to delete some edges.

Ideally we would like to consider a class of models M = {M1, . . . , MK} represent-
ing all possible models or all possible maps derived from W by deleting combinations
of geographical edges. In other words, let W = {wij} be the adjacency matrix of
the map (i.e., wii = 0, and wij = 1 if i is adjacent to j and 0 otherwise). Model
Mk will be a SAR model with the adjacency matrix Wk that has been derived by

Geoinformatica (2011) 15:435–454

441

changing some of the 1’s to 0’s in W. This amounts to dropping some edges from
the original map or, equivalently, combining two regions into one. However, now
we encounter an explosion in the number of models. To be precise, if W is the
W1/2 models to compare. This is infeasible
original geographical map, we have 21
and will require sophisticated MCMC Model Composition or MC3 algorithms (see.
e.g., [20]) for selecting models. These formal statistical methods will again become
computationally intensive and inconducive for learning of edge effects in large maps.
Therefore, we consider only models that arise by changing only one entry in the W
matrix. This avoids MCMC and resorts to the simpler Bayesian Information Criteria
that requires only the maximum likelihood estimates for the models.

5 The Bayesian information approach

By modelling both the observed data and any unknown parameter or other unob-
served effects as random variables, the hierarchical Bayesian approach to statistical
analysis provides a cohesive framework for combining complex data models and
external knowledge or expert opinion (e.g., [8, 11, 19, 32]). In this approach, in
addition to specifying the distributional model f (y|θ) for the observed data y =
(y1, . . . , yn) given a vector of unknown parameters θ = (θ1, . . . , θk), we suppose that
θ is a random quantity sampled from a prior distribution p(θ | γ ), where γ is a
vector of hyperparameters. Inference concerning θ is then based on its posterior
distribution,

p(θ | y, γ ) = p(y, θ | γ )
p(y | γ )

=

(cid:13)

p(y, θ | γ )
p(y, θ | γ ) dθ

=

(cid:13)

p(y | θ) p(θ | γ )
p(y | θ) p(θ | γ ) dθ

.

(3)

Notice the contribution of both the data (in the form of the likelihood p(y | θ)) and
the external knowledge or opinion (in the form of the prior p(θ|γ )) to the posterior.
If γ is known, this posterior distribution is fully specified; if not, a second-stage prior
distribution (called a hyper-prior) may be specified for it, leading to a fully Bayesian
analysis. Alternatively, we might simply replace γ by an estimate ˆγ obtained as the
value which maximizes the marginal distribution p(y | γ ) viewed as a function of γ .
Inference proceeds based on the estimated posterior distribution p(θ | y, ˆγ ), obtained
by plugging ˆγ into Eq. 3. This is called an empirical Bayes analysis and is closer to
maximum likelihood estimation techniques.

The Bayesian decision-making paradigm improves upon the classical approaches
to statistical analysis in its more philosophically sound foundation, its unified ap-
proach to data analysis, and its ability to formally incorporate prior opinion or
external empirical evidence into the results via the prior distribution. Statisticians,
formerly reluctant to adopt the Bayesian approach due to general skepticism con-
cerning its philosophy and a lack of necessary computational tools, are now turning
to it with increasing regularity as classical methods emerge as both theoretically and
practically inadequate. Modelling the θi’s as random (instead of fixed) effects allows
us to induce specific (e.g. spatial, temporal or more general) correlation structures
among them, hence among the observed data yi as well. Hierarchical Bayesian
methods now enjoy broad application in the analysis of complex systems, where
it is natural to pool information across from different sources (e.g. [19]). Modern
Bayesian methods seek complete evaluation of the posterior distributions using

442

Geoinformatica (2011) 15:435–454

simulation methods that draw samples from the posterior distribution. This sampling-
based paradigm enables exact inference free of unverifiable asymptotic assumptions
on sample sizes and other regularity conditions.

A computational challenge in applying Bayesian methods is that for many com-
plex systems, inference under Eq. 3 generally involves distributions that are in-
tractable in closed form, and thus one needs more sophisticated algorithms to sample
from the posterior. Forms for the prior distributions (called conjugate forms) may
often be found which enable at least partial analytic evaluation of these distributions,
but in the presence of nuisance parameters (typically unknown variances), some
intractable distributions remain. Here the emergence of inexpensive, high-speed
computing equipment and software comes to the rescue, enabling the application
of recently developed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration methods,
such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the Gibbs sampler. See the books by
Gelman et al. [19], Carlin and Louis [11] and Robert [32] for details on Bayesian
analysis and computing.

Bayesian inference proceeds by considering a set of models, say M =
{M1, . . . , MK}, each representing a hypothesis, and then selecting the best model(s)
using some statistical metric. Assuming that model M j has parameters, say θ j,
associated with it and we have specified priors p(θ j | M j) for each j, we will seek
posterior distributions of the model itself,

p(M j | y) =

(cid:2)

p(M j) p(y | M j)
K
k=1 p(Mk) p(y | Mk)

=

(cid:2)

p(M j) ×
k=1 p(Mk) ×

K

p(θ j | M j) p(y | θ j, M j) dθ j
(cid:13)

p(θ k | Mk) p(y | θ k, Mk) dθ k

.

(cid:13)

To compare two models, say M1 and M2, we form their posterior odds

If the odds are greater than one, we choose model M1, otherwise we opt for M2. The
Bayes factor is defined as

p(M1 | y)
p(M2 | y)

= p(M1)
p(M2)

× p(y | M1)
p(y | M2)

.

BF12 = p(y | M1)
p(y | M2)

and represents the contribution of the data towards the posterior odds. Often, we
will have no prior reason to favor one model over another and the posterior odds
will equal the Bayes Factor. Thus, one seeks to evaluate the marginal distribution of
the data, given a model, as

(cid:14)

p(y | M j) =

p(y|θ j) p(θ j | M j) dθ j.

Computation of the marginal distribution in Eq. 7 for general hierarchical models can
be much more complicated and has occupied plenty of attention over the last several
years. Many of these methods, while offering better evaluations and approximations,
involve computationally intensive simulation algorithms, such as MCMC methods,
that require much finessing and several thousands of iterations to yield accurate
results.

LeSage and Parent [25] provide a computationally simple and fast approach to
evaluating the true log-marginal likelihood for the SAR model. However, their
approach seems to be best suited to the Zellner g-prior on the regression coefficients

and may not be directly applicable to more general priors. LeSage and Pace [24, Ch.6]
also discuss the issue of comparing SAR models based on different adjacency matri-
ces W. They rely upon univariate numerical integration over the range of support
for the parameter ρ in the SAR model, which involves calculating log (det(In − ρW))
for every value of the parameter ρ. Computationally fast methods to compute the log
determinant terms are presented in Pace and Barry [29] and Barry and Pace [7] . Here
we approximate the marginal distribution in Eq. 7 using the Laplace-approximation,
which avoids the numerical integration over the parameter space.

In edge detection problems, as outlined earlier, we encounter a large number of
models. Hence, a faster approach will be to employ an inexpensive approximation
to Eq. 7. One such approximation is based upon a Laplace-approximation and some
subsequent simplifications (see, e.g., [30]):
(cid:7)

(cid:6)
y | ˆθ j
log p(y | M j) = log p

dim(M j)

log n + O(1),

(8)

where dim(M j) is the number of parameters that are being estimated in the model
M j. The Bayesian Information Criteria is derived from this approximation as
(cid:6)
y | ˆθ j
BIC j = −2 log p

+ dim(M j) log n.

(9)

(cid:7)

Therefore, choosing the model with the minimum BIC amounts to choosing the
model with the maximum posterior probability. In fact, if we consider the models
in M then we can estimate the posterior probability for each model as

p(M j | y) ≈

(10)

The advantages of computing the posterior model probabilities as Eq. 10 include
computational simplicity and a direct connection with the thoroughly investigated
BIC. While the justification of the approximation Eq. 10 is asymptotic in general,
this can also be looked upon as an approximation for a noninformative prior even
for moderate and small sample sizes.

6 Bayesian information criteria in SAR/CAR models to detect

difference boundaries: illustrations

6.1 Simulation experiments

We illustrate our model comparison approach first with some simulation studies
and then apply it to a real data analysis in Section 6.2. The simulation was set up
under two scenarios: with and without explanatory variables. The spatial adjacency
matrix was based on the Minnesota county map and in another scenario, the 8 × 8
rectangular grid. There are 87 counties and 211 boundaries between counties on the
Minnesota map, thus there are 211 different boundary hypotheses in our analysis.
We generated data {Yi} from a Poisson distribution whose true parameter values are
known.

Without the explanatory variables, we divided the Minnesota map into six regions,
and let μi ∈ {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5} with the true difference boundaries mapped on
Fig. 1. Note that two of the clusters are shaded white. The one in the interior

the interior comprising a single

comprises a single county (Sherburne) and has mean 0, while the other has a mean of

boundaries. Letting Yi be the simulated number of cases in county i, we generate
{Yi} ∼ Poisson(5 exp(μi)) for i = 1, 2, . . . , 87. Let Ei =
Oi be the expected
number of cases, where Oi is the population of county i, and N is the total number of
counties. Assuming equal population in all counties, we take the log standardized
morbidity ratio, yi = log(100 × Yi/Ei), as our outcome variable. Note that this is
essentially a relative rate expressed as a percentage and transformed to a logarithmic
scale to strengthen its Gaussian behavior.

β = β0, and {φi}’s follow a SAR and a
i
CAR distribution (see Section 3). There are 211 different boundary hypothesis in
our analysis, as there are 211 edges on the Minnesota County Map and each model
arises from deleting (hence not smoothing across) exactly one geographical edge.
We compute the BIC for all these models using Eq. 9, in which the log likelihood is
computed by Eq. 2. Therefore, each model corresponds to one edge and the models
with higher posterior probabilities provide evidence in favor of the corresponding
edge being a difference boundary.

As we know the 47 true difference boundaries on the map, we are able to obtain
the “true” detection rates (sensitivity) for the BIC approach by declaring the edges
corresponding to the top 47 models as difference boundaries. We compare the results
with the existing methods, e.g. Lu and Carlin [26] (LC). The average detection rate
of the 50 simulated datasets for the different methods are listed in Table 1. The
sensitivity of the BIC based model comparison approach is competitive with the

LC approach, especially when the SAR prior probability model is specified for the
spatial effects. Indeed, Table 1 reveals that the detection rate for the BIC based
approach using SAR spatial effects differs from the Lu and Carlin method by only
1.5%. With CAR spatial effects, this difference is slightly higher at 4.6%. Yet, the
inferential procedure in LC employs MCMC algorithms that involve substantially
greater computational demands. The BIC based model comparison approach that
we proffer here provides much quicker inference via generalized least squares, while
losing little sensitivity as compared to the LC method.

In another scenario, we conduct the simulation on an 8 × 8 rectangular grid. We
partition the 64 rectangular units into 5 areal clusters, as depicted in Fig. 2. We assign
four grey-scale values to these five clusters, with the clusters in the lower left and
the extreme right column having the highest true grey-scale value of 5.0. The region
in the upper middle has the lowest true value of 2.0, the upper-left has a true value
of 3.0, while the cluster in the lower middle has a true value of 4.0. Analogous to
the previous scenario, we generate {Yi} ∼ Poisson(exp(μi)), and use yi = log(100 ×
Yi/Ei) as the response variable in the model. The average detection rate of the 50
simulated datasets for the different methods are listed in Table 1. The detection rate

for the BIC based approach using SAR spatial effects differs from the Lu and Carlin
method by 6.2%. With CAR spatial effects this difference is slightly higher at 14.9%.
We also computed the BLV’s associated with the edges (see Section 2). These are
the absolute difference of the outcomes, i.e. (cid:2)ij = (cid:7)yi − y j(cid:7), computed for every pair
of adjacent counties. We identified the 47 highest BLV’s as difference boundaries
(see, e.g., Jacquez and Greiling [21, 22]). The last row of Table 1 presents the
average detection rates from the 50 simulated datasets based upon the (cid:2)ij’s. These
were 84.8% for the Minnesota county map and 78.5% for the 8 × 8 grid. While the
(cid:2)ij’s seem to provide a simple and practical way of identifying boundaries for the
outcome variable, this procedure is not model-based and will not apply to our next
scenario.

In our final scenario, we assume that there is an explanatory variable associated
with the outcome. In other words, we now set x(cid:2)
= (1, xi) in Eq. 1, where we generate
i
each xi from N(μi, σ ) with μi taking values in 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, depending upon
where county i lies in the map in Fig. 1, and σ = 0.5. We subsequently fix these
generated xi’s and draw the spatial random effects, i.e. the φi’s from a SAR model.
Next, we simulate Yi ∼ Poisson(exp(θ0 + θ1xi + φi)) with θ0 = 0, θ1 = 5. In fitting the
model and carrying out subsequent boundary analysis, we again use yi = log(100 ×
Yi/Ei) as our outcome variable, where Ei is as defined in the preceding scenarios.

When the model accommodates an explanatory variable, as in our current sce-
nario, the boundary effects of interest pertain not to the outcome, but the residuals
after adjusting for the explanatory variable. Since the residuals are never observed,
BLVs defined as Euclidean metrics between observations is no longer applicable for
detecting the difference boundaries on the spatial residual map. Nevertheless, the
BIC based approach and the LC method are both able to do so. True difference
boundaries are unknown in this case. As such, we compute the rank of each of the
211 models based on BIC, and compare them with the difference between the spatial
residuals produced by LC. Figure 3 plots the difference in spatial residuals from the
LC approach against the rank of the model using BIC. A locally weighted scatter-plot

smoother or “loess” [12] is also fitted ot the plot. The figure reveals a very clear
decreasing trend indicating that the model with a better fit (lower BIC) will tend
to have larger differences in the spatial residuals from the LC method. This indicates
consistency between the BIC-based methods and the LC method. Again, we note the
computational efficiency of the BIC-based methods as compared to the LC method.

6.2 Application to Minnesota P & I dataset

We apply our model comparison approach to a Pneumonia and Influenza diagnosis
dataset from the state of Minnesota. Residents of Minnesota who were 65 years
of age and older and who were enrolled in the Medicare fee-for-service program
as of December 31, 2001, were included in our study. This population had been
identified as part of a multi-year study regarding the impact of vaccination on elderly
Minnesota residents. The Medicare Denominator file for 2001 was used to define the
cohort. In addition to meeting the criteria for age and state of residence, to be eligible
for inclusion in the study the person had to be enrolled in both Medicare Part A and
Medicare Part B, not be enrolled in a Medicare Advantage health plan, and not have
end-stage renal disease. The Denominator file also indicated the county of residence
for each person. County-level average per capita income was obtained from the 2000
U.S. Census SF3 file.

Hospitalizations for pneumonia and influenza (P&I) were identified by the
Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) short stay inpatient file for the

different impacts of the influenza virus. Here we studied the number of hospital-
izations from P&I in both influenza and shoulder period among persons at risk
in each county. We adjust for the average income per person in each county by
incorporating it as an explanatory variable in our model. Therefore, the vector x

cases, where Oi is the population (age 65 and older) of county i, and N is the total
number of counties. Similar to the simulation study, we take log transformation
yi = log(100 × Yi/Ei) as our outcome variable under study.

The intercept from the SAR model was estimated to be 5.12 (mean) with a
95% credible interval (4.62, 5.63), while for the CAR model these were 5.13 and
(4.63, 5.63) respectively. The regression coefficient for average income per person
was estimated to be −0.017 with a 95% credible interval (−0.037, 0.003) from the
SAR model, while they were −0.017 and (−0.037, 0.002) from the CAR model. The
estimate of τ 2 from the SAR and CAR models were 0.097 and 0.095 respectively,
while ρ was estimated to be 0.072 and 0.127 respectively. The parameter ρ has
different interpretations for the SAR and CAR models and can be looked upon as a
measure of spatial smoothing. It is, however, dangerous to interpret this as a spatial
correlation in the strict statistical sense [33].

Tables 2 and 3 list the adjacent counties having the 50 largest boundary effects,
ranked by their BIC scores from the SAR and CAR models respectively. Forty-six
of the top fifty pairs are present in both tables (although they may not necessarily
agree in rank), while four (in bold) boundaries are unique. The top seven county
pairs also agree in their rankings. The fifty difference boundaries detected by the
model comparison approach using SAR spatial effects are highlighted in Fig. 4.
Figure 5 reveals a similarly consistent performance between the SAR and CAR
effects in detecting difference boundaries on this map. Models ranked higher (or

that fit better) usually detect boundaries with a big difference in the raw data, which
corroborates our approach. But some of the points with large differences in the raw
data are ranked low in the plot. This could be attributed to the smoothing and
borrowing of strength from neighboring regions that could diminish the strength
of the neighboring regions and dilute the difference in some cases. Figure 6 is the
choropleth map of the spatial residuals under the model which has a neighborhood
structure with fifty detected boundaries (i.e. non-smoothing boundaries).

7 Discussion and future directions

Clearly we have only skimmed the surface of the edge detection problem. In
fact, here we have investigated the Bayesian Information Criteria and its utility in
marginal probability approximations. Still, our approach of formulating the edge
detection problem as a model comparison problem is relatively novel. We view
our current work as a relatively simple data-mining tool that can suggest influential
boundary effects in health maps. The use of the BIC is straightforward in our leave-
one-out framework and can prove a useful tool for spatial analysts.

Our future methodolological investigations will focus upon three directions: (1)
more sophisticated model search algorithms such as MC3 (Markov Chain Monte
Carlo Model Composition) and Bayesian Model Averaging algorithms that exhaust
the space of all models (see [20]); (2) using Bayesian False Discovery Rates together
with a formal Bayesian hypothesis testing framework to make decisions regarding
wombling boundaries, and (3) to develop alternative nonparametric Bayesian mod-
els for areal data that would facilitate boundary detection.

The third direction merits some further discussion. Instead of incorporating
random “edge effects” 0 in Lu et al. [27], Ma et al. [28], one can explore an alternative
stochastic mechanism that would let us detect wombling boundaries by considering
probabilities such as P(φi = φ j | i ∼ j). Clearly using direct CAR specifications will
simply not work as it yields continuous measures for the φis, rendering P(φi =
φ j | i ∼ j) = 0. The challenge here is to model the spatial effects in an almost surely
discrete fashion while at the same time accounting for the spatial dependence. A
nonparametric Bayesian framework that models the spatial effects as almost sure
discrete realizations of some distribution comes to mind—the Dirichlet process [15]
has been employed extensively for modelling clustered data and presents itself as
a natural choice, but how do we accommodate the spatial dependence? These and
other issues will form a part of our future research plans.

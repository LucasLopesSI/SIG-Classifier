ABSTRACT
Space-time prisms envelop all spatio-temporal locations that moving
objects may have visited between two of their known spatio-tem-
poral locations, given a bound on their travel speed. In this context,
the known locations are often the result of observations or measure-
ments, and they are called ‘anchor points’. The classic space-time
prism, in isotropic two-dimensional space, as well as in transportation
networks, assumes that the measurements of these anchor points are
exact. Whereas, in many applications, we can assume that time can
be measured fairly precisely, this assumption is unrealistic for the
spatial components of measured locations (we think of Global

extend the classical prism from anchor points to circular ‘anchor
regions’ that capture the uncertainty or error on their measurement.
We deﬁne the notion of a space-time prism with uncertain anchor
points, called uncertain prism, for short. We study the geometry of
uncertain prisms in an arbitrary metric space to make this concept as
widely applicable as possible. We also focus on the rims of uncertain
space-time prisms, which demarcate the area that a moving object
can have visited between two anchor regions (given some local
speed limitations).

1. Introduction

The growing popularity and propagation of location-aware devices (such as mobile
phones, Global Positioning System (GPS), Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) result in the availability
of huge sets of mobility data (Giannotti and Pedreschi 2008). These collected data
in a two-
represent (essentially partial) trajectories of moving objects, for instance,
dimensional plane or on a road or transportation network, and we call them trajectory
samples. These samples are ﬁnite sequences hðx0; y0; t0Þ; ðx1; y1; t1Þ; (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ; ðxn; yn; tnÞi of
(measured) spatio-temporal points, with t0 < t1 < (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) < tn for the time values. One of
the earliest proposals to reconstruct trajectories from such samples is the use of linear
interpolation (Wolfson 2002, Trajcevski et al. 2004, Güting and Schneider 2005). Since
this interpolation method produces trajectories that move at constant (and minimal)
speed between sample points, it can be considered to be realistic when the sample is
frequent and regular in time. The problem of the uncertainty of the space-time positions
of moving objects in between measured space-time locations has received extensive

attention in the Geographic Information System (GIS) community, and the space-time
prism model has played a prominent role in this research (Hägerstrand 1970). We remark
that there are also other sources of uncertainty, like measurement errors, outliers in the
observations and missing data. In the formalism of space-time prisms, the observed
space-time points are referred to as anchor points, and we can say that a space-time
prism envelops all spatio-temporal locations that a moving object may have visited
between two of its known spatio-temporal locations, given a bound on its travel speed
(that may be physical in nature or law imposed, for instance). The spatial projection of a
space-time prism encompasses all spatial
locations that a moving object can have
visited in the available time interval (given the spatial locations of the anchor points
and the speed bounds). Geometrically, a space-time prism is the intersection of a
bottom and an upper cone in the space-time space. For an extensive overview of the
geometric properties of space-time prisms, both for free movement in an isotropic two-
dimensional space and for restricted movement on road networks, we refer to Othman
(2009).

The classical space-time prism model makes the unrealistic assumption that the
measurement of the anchor points is exact, both in space and in time. However, in
practice, when we consider sample points, obtained by a GPS measurement or via a
mobile-phone network, this assumption turns out to be unrealistic. Although, in many
situations, the measurement of the time component can be assumed to be very precise,
in general, the same cannot be assumed for the spatial components. A notable excep-
tion to this occurs in the context of self-reported activity data, where individuals will
often provide erroneous or uncertain location data, but also a vague or imprecise
temporal description of their activity. In this paper, we make abstraction of the temporal
error, for most of the presented results, and focus on the spatial error.

There are various causes for locational measurement inaccuracy, and the resulting
spatial error zones may take a variety of shapes, depending on the technology used to
obtain the spatial data. In the context of mobile-phone networks, the error zones may
have irregular shapes, typically in the direction of one of the antennas, and in cell
networks, they may have hexagonal shapes. Frequent causes for GPS-based equipment
to have an error margin (of even up to 10–15 m) include atmospheric conditions and the
poor visibility of satellites. Urban canyons, caused by high buildings in an urban
environment, that block satellite reception, are a good example of the latter phenom-
enon. The positioning error of GPS is often modelled by its error ellipse or by circular
probable error (Misra and Enge 2001). As a ﬁrst abstraction of the variety of shapes of
the spatial error zones, we consider circular error zones, in this paper. This is a practice
that is not uncommon in the area of moving object databases (MODs) (Wolfson 2002,
Trajcevski et al. 2004, Güting and Schneider 2005), and it considerably eases the exposi-
tion of the results. We remark that the extension of the results of this paper to other
shapes (such as ellipses) may quickly get technically involved.

In most of the earlier works on prisms, anchor uncertainty and its eﬀect on the space-
time prisms have hardly been studied. In this paper, we take the spatial error margin into
account and extend the space-time prism model to incorporate circular spatial error
zones on measured locations. Hereto, we deﬁne the notion of space-time prisms with
uncertain anchor points, called uncertain space-time prisms, for short. Therefore, we
accommodate the spatial uncertainty of the anchor points of prisms and replace the

notion of anchor point by that of ‘anchor region’. We remark that we pursue a purely
geometric approach to anchor uncertainty and uncertain space-time prisms, which
diﬀers from the work on anchor uncertainty on road networks of Kuijpers et al. (2010),
that starts from a probability distribution on the possible (not necessarily circular and
possibly disconnected) locations of anchor points and investigates the propagation of
this distribution on the space-time prisms.

We give our deﬁnition of an uncertain prism for movement in an arbitrary metric
space, but the examples that we have in mind are the real line R and the two-dimen-
sional real plane R2 equipped with their standard Euclidean distance. The case of the
real line is easily extended to cover interesting applications of prisms on, for instance,
road networks. As a ﬁrst result, we show that uncertain prisms are classical space-time
prisms that are truncated over time. We remark that this result can also be extended to
the situation where, additionally, there is a temporal uncertainty interval on the mea-
sured anchor points. We also focus on the rims of space-time prisms. Rims are relevant
because the spatial projection of the rim demarcates the area that a moving object can
have visited between two anchor points (given some local speed limitations). Various
researchers refer to the spatial area encompassed by the spatial projection of the rim of
a prism as the ‘potential path area’ (PPA) or the ‘activity space’ (AS) (see Patterson and
Farber 2015 for an overview), since all physically possible spatio-temporal paths (given
the speed bounds) are situated in this area. We give examples that show that, in the
presence of anchor uncertainty, the classical notion of a rim is no longer useful. We
deﬁne the more robust notion of an uncertain rim, which captures an error zone that
demarcates the area of possible visit. As a next result, we give a geometric characterisa-
tion of the uncertain rim. We also observe that uncertain rims, in the presence of too
large measurement errors, can also lose their meaning (at least partially) as a tool to
demarcate the area of possible movement. This is captured by the technical notion of
transversal uncertain prisms, in which the error zones are too large and the uncertain rim
is too coarse to encompass a meaningful area of possible movement. All the results that
we have mentioned so far are demonstrated in an arbitrary metric space. This means
that they can be applied to movement on road networks, to planar movement as well as
to movement in a three-dimensional space and movement on a sphere (like the surface
of the earth). We end this paper with two sections that apply our general results to the
cases of movement on a line (modelled as R) and movement in a plane (modelled as R2).
In these sections, we give more precise characterisations of uncertain prisms, uncertain
rims and their spatial projections.

We see the contribution of this paper as a step towards more realistic and semanti-
cally meaningful model of space-time prisms. The basic space-time prism model relies, in
more than one way, on unrealistic assumptions (for instance, the anchor points are
known, ﬁxed spatio-temporal points; instant changes in direction and speed are possi-
ble; and all points in a classical prism are equally likely to be visited). Our research
focusses on the ﬁrst of these three issues, and we see uncertain prisms are a natural
extension of space-time prisms that deal with a kind of uncertainty (anchor location
uncertainty) that was not available with classical space-time prisms.

The applications that we have in mind are the classical applications of space-time
prisms. More speciﬁcally, we envisage some application grounds, such as choice set

formation (Thill 1992) and activity-based models (Rasouli and Timmermans 2014, Drchal
et al. 2016). Spatial choices are often made from a large set of alternatives, and the
choice set of ﬂexible activities between ﬁxed activities at known locations (that are used
as origins or destinations) under some space-time constraints has been studied in the
context of individual activity patterns (Chen and Kwan 2012). Similar problems arise in
the context of activity-based models of travel demand forecasting, and their relation

uncertain space-time prisms can be used as a preliminary ﬁlter in choice set formation.
Speciﬁcally, when constructing a space-time prism with uncertain anchors without
constraints on the uncertainty regions, it is possible that there are parts of one anchor
region that are unreachable from another and vice versa. This eﬀect can cause a chain
reaction that propagates to other chained space-time prisms. If part of a region becomes
unreachable, then previous space-time prisms also cover part of space-time that is never
reachable and will have to be recalculated with this new constraint.

1.1. Organisation of the paper

In Section 3, we deﬁne classical space-time prisms and their rims in an arbitrary metric
space and illustrate these concepts in one- and two-dimensional space. In Section 4, we
deﬁne space-time prisms with uncertain anchor points and show that they are time-
truncated versions of classical space-time prisms. In Section 5, we deﬁne and discuss the
uncertain rims of uncertain prisms and give a general characterisation of these uncertain

transversality. In Sections 6 and 7, we apply the results of the previous sections to
prisms in R and R2, respectively. The paper concludes with a discussion of open
problems in Section 8. This section also contains a temporal extension of the main
result of Section 4.

2. Related work

The notion of space-time prisms ﬁrst appeared in the area of time geography in the early
1970s (Hägerstrand 1970). It was shaped by the earlier work of Hägerstrand (1957). Two
decades later, the space-time prism concept has found its way into the GIS community,
where it was used for analysing the potentiality of human activity in various environ-
ments (a well-known example is Miller 1991). In this context, apart from expressing
uncertainty of space-time locations between measure locations, prisms are also used to
measure the degree of access that individuals have to certain parts of their spatial
environment. The disjointness of prisms of two moving objects can be used as an
alibi, for instance,
investigation (Egenhofer 2003, Grimson et al. 2011),
whereas
their non-disjointness expresses potential contact between individuals
(Neutens et al. 2007).

Classical space-time prisms, as introduced by Hägerstrand, assume a local albeit
uniform travel velocity in an isotropic space such as the two-dimensional plane. This
assumption ignores the fact that the travel possibilities of an individual are often
conﬁned to some type of transportation network, which has link-dependent travel
velocities. This insight has led to the study of space-time prisms on transportation

networks (Miller 1991, Kwan and Hong 1998, Wu and Miller 2002, Kuijpers and Othman
2009) and in constrained spaces (Delafontaine et al. 2011).

Various computational methods and analytical tools for describing prisms in one- and
two-dimensional space have been developed (Miller 1991, 2005a, 2005b, Kwan and
Hong 1998, Yu and Shaw 2008). These tools have been applied not only in transporta-
tion planning (Timmermans et al. 2002) but also in other areas, such as social and crime
analyses (Kwan 1999, Ratcliﬀe 2006) and risk assessment in the context of epidemics and
environmental issues (Löytönen 1998, Jacquez 2000, Jacquez et al. 2005).

In the past decade, the space-time prism model has found its way into the MOD
research (Wolfson 2002, Trajcevski et al. 2004, Güting and Schneider 2005). The strong
theoretical foundations from Othman (2009) and Kuijpers and Othman (2010) pave the
way for the practical development of query languages for MODs that include uncertainty
via space-time prisms.

In some of the early publications in this area, space-time prisms were referred to as
‘beads’ and chains of prisms were called ‘lifeline necklaces’ (Pfoser and Jensen 1999,
Hornsby and Egenhofer 2002).

In the context of network-based implementations of space-time prisms, it is often
assumed that the anchor points are exactly known and located on the network. In
practice, a pre-processing step involves a ‘map matching’ of these measured locations to
a network (Quddus et al. 2003). Indeed, in reality, measured points obtained by GPS or
other location methods are prune to measurement and sampling errors (Hammand and
Karimi 2004, Miller 2005b). Two-dimensional errors on GPS measurements are some-
times modelled by some bivariate Gaussian distribution in the two-dimensional plane
(Pfoser et al. 2005), and this probabilistic approach was also pursued to deal with anchor
uncertainty of prisms on road networks. For example, the work on anchor uncertainty on
transportation networks of Kuijpers et al. (2010) starts from a probability distribution on
the possible locations of the anchor points and investigates the propagation of this
probability distribution on the space-time prism. In this paper, we largely ignore tem-
poral
(and combinations of spatial and temporal) uncertainty on anchor points.
Especially in the context of self-reported activity, activity planning and travel scheduling,
temporal uncertainty becomes increasingly important (Chen et al. 2013, Liao et al. 2014).
In Delafontaine et al. (2011), combinations of spatial and temporal uncertainty are
considered, also for movement in constrained spaces with obstacles.

3. Classical space-time prisms

In this section, we give the deﬁnition of classical space-time prisms in an arbitrary metric
space S with distance function d (also denoted ðS; dÞ). The space S serves as the spatial
component and the corresponding spatio-temporal space is S (cid:3) R, where R is the set of
the real numbers, which is used to model the temporal component. The examples that
line R and the two-dimensional real plane R2,
we have in mind for S are the real
equipped with the standard Euclidean distance, but S could as well be a road network
with a suitable distance function deﬁned on it.

capture, for instance, a spatial measurement error. With this notation in place, we
can give the deﬁnition of space-time prisms with spatially uncertain anchor points.

for short) given by the anchor points ð(cid:1)pi; tiÞ and ð(cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1Þ, the spatial error margins

The uncertain prism is the set of space-time points that a moving object potentially
has visited when travelling from some point in the error zone Ui to some point in the
error zone Uiþ1 with a speed bound of vmax.

4.2. Uncertain space-time prisms are time-truncated classical prisms

In this section, we give a basic property of space-time prism with uncertain anchor
points for arbitrary metric spaces ðS; dÞ. The following property shows that uncertain
prisms are time-truncated classical space-time prisms.

Theorem 4.2: Let ðS; dÞ be a metric space. Let ð(cid:1)pi; tiÞ; ð(cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1Þ 2 S (cid:3) R be two spatio-
temporal points, with ti < tiþ1. Let εi; εiþ1 > 0 and vmax > 0 be real numbers. The uncertain prism
UPð(cid:1)pi; ti; εi; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞ equals Pð(cid:1)pi; ti (cid:4)

the points in

means that our formalisms can ‘correct’ the error zones.

4.3. The application of uncertain prisms to road networks

Space-time prisms with uncertain anchor points can be applied in various settings, as
illustrated in Section 4.2, for movement on a line and in the two-dimensional plane. We
can apply the one-dimensional case to the more interesting setting of movement on a
road network. On an intuitive level, we need to ‘bend’ or ‘fold’ the one-dimensional
uncertain prisms over the road network, taking into account bends in the network and
all possible ramiﬁcations at crossings of roads. However, in the setting of road networks,
we have to take the speed limitations per road segment into account. Hereto, in Kuijpers
and Othman (2009), a suitable distance function on the road network, called road
network time, is used. By road network time, we mean the single-pair shortest-path
distance (with respect to the above distance labelling of the road segments), that is not
uncommon in graph theory. Since road network time is a distance function on a road
network, our deﬁnitions and results, which are formulated for arbitrary metric spaces,
can straightforwardly be applied to road networks. This distance function can be
eﬃciently computed by the well-known algorithm of Dijkstra (Goodman and Weisstein
2017). This implies that uncertain prisms on road networks can be eﬃciently computed.
We refer to Othman (2009) for details on prisms on road networks and their computa-
tion and to Kuijpers et al. (2010) for an exposition of uncertain prisms on road networks.

polylines above the road network.

Figure 4 shows an example of a simple road network with two road segments
(Seg1 and Seg2 in brown). It also shows a chain of two uncertain prisms above this
road network. The ﬁrst uncertain prism UPð(cid:1)pi; ti; εi; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; viÞ (in grey), starts
above Seg1 and ends above Seg2. The error zones of (cid:1)pi and (cid:1)piþ1 are over both road
segments. Above the ﬁrst prism, a next uncertain UPð(cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; (cid:1)piþ2; tiþ2; εiþ2; viþ1Þ
is shown in green. Since at (cid:1)piþ1 these prisms share the same error zone (given by
εiþ1), these consecutive prisms seamlessly ﬁt onto each other.

5. Rims of space-time prisms with uncertain anchor points

In this section, we deﬁne the rim of space-time prisms with uncertain anchor points, and
we study these rims for S (cid:3) R:, with (S, d) an arbitrary metric space.

In the context of a spatial error margin on the anchor points, the delimitation of the
possibly visited spatio-temporal points (and their spatial projection) also becomes
uncertain. Obviously, since UPð(cid:1)pi; ti; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; vmaxÞ is a time-truncated version of the
classical prism Pð(cid:1)pi; ti (cid:4)
; vmaxÞ between ti and tiþ1, we could, as a ﬁrst
attempt, regard the spatial projection of the rim of Pð(cid:1)pi; ti (cid:4)
; vmaxÞ as
the spatial area which the moving object can have visited. We could refer to this rim as
the crisp rim of an uncertain prism. However, this crisp rim does not reﬂect, as a
delimiter, the uncertainty caused by the spatial error margins on the anchor points.
Another problem is that the uncertainty on the spatial location of the anchor points may
be too big and the crisp rim of the prism Pð(cid:1)pi; ti (cid:4)
; vmaxÞ may be cut
away (partially) in UPð(cid:1)pi; ti; εi; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞ: This phenomenon is illustrated in
Figure 5, which depicts the uncertain prisms of Figure 3, be it with εi increased from
3
5 to 3. This increase in error margin causes the rim of the truncated prism to be cut
away, at least partially. For instance, the spatio-temporal object in the left of Figure 5 is
(cid:6)
the uncertain prism UP 0; 0; εi; 1; 2; εiþ1; 4
10 . Since the value
3
of εi is too large, the left rim point of Pð0; (cid:4) 9
; (cid:4) 31
, falls outside
80
4
the temporal interval ½0; 2(cid:6) of this uncertain prism. This left rim point is indicated by the
red dot in the left part of Figure 5. This implies that there would be no left point in the
crisp rim of the classical prism to delimit the possibly visited locations of the moving
object in the setting with uncertainty. The same phenomenon appears in the right part
of Figure 5, where the rim of a time-truncated classical prism in R2 also disappears
partially outside the time interval. These examples show that the crisp rim of an
uncertain prism and its spatial projection does not suﬃce to delimit the area of possible

movement. The inﬂuence of the size of the error regions on the shape of the uncertain
rim is discussed in more detail
in Section 5.3 in the context of the notion of
‘transversality’.

The following deﬁnition incorporates the spatial uncertainty of the anchor points in
the deﬁnition of the rim of an uncertain prism and takes care of the above problem, as
we also show in the examples further on.

The

with the temporal interval slice S (cid:3) ½ti; tiþ1(cid:6).

Again, the spatial projection πSðρUPð(cid:1)pi; ti; εi; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞÞ gives an (uncertain)
delimitation of the spatial area, which a moving object can have visited when travelling
from ð(cid:1)pi; tiÞ to ð(cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1Þ with a speed bound of vmax, given the spatial error margins εi
and εiþ1. This area is the PPA or AS that we mentioned in Section 1. In Section 5.3, we
discuss its meaning in more detail.

5.2. A general characterisation of the uncertain rim of space-time prisms with
uncertain anchor points

The following theorem gives a characterisation of the uncertain rim of an uncertain
space-time prism in an arbitrary metric space S. In this theorem, the notation Ac is used
to indicate the complement of a subset A in S (cid:3) R, that is, Ac :¼ ðS (cid:3) RÞnA: We denote
εiþ1
the topological interior of the set A by A(cid:7). We also use the abbreviations t(cid:8)

We refer the reader, interested in the proof of Theorem 5.2, to Appendix B. We
illustrate this theorem with a ﬁgure for the case S ¼ R. For the case of movement on
line R, Figure 6 shows an uncertain prism UPð(cid:1)pi; ti;

UPð(cid:1)pi; ti; εi; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞ, which is shown in grey in the ﬁgure.

5.3. Transversality of uncertain space-time prisms

We end this section with a discussion of the nature of the uncertain rim of an uncertain
prism. Figure 6 already gives an example for the one-dimensional case, where the
uncertain rim consists of two parallelograms. However, the situation in R is not always
that simple. The particularity of the example of Figure 6 is that the error zone Uiþ1
cannot be reached from the error zone Ui, via a straight path of constant speed vmax.
Figure 7 shows an example of the case where Ui and Uiþ1 can be connected by such a
path. In this case, the uncertain rim is transversing from bottom to top and is no longer
the disjoint union of two parallelograms, as is illustrated in Figure 7.

We call such uncertain prisms ‘transversal’, and we now give a general deﬁnition for

ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ (cid:4) εi; vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ þ εiÞ have a non-empty intersection.

To explain this deﬁnition, we observe that the points ð(cid:1)p; tiþ1Þ 2 S (cid:3) R that can be
reached by a straight-line path of velocity vmax from some (cid:1)q 2 Ui ¼ Dð(cid:1)pi; εiÞ are located
on the circle Cð(cid:1)q; vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞÞ at time tiþ1. Using some elementary geometry, we
Cð(cid:1)q; vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞÞ is the disc Dð(cid:1)pi; vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ þ εiÞ if
can show that

εi; vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ þ εiÞ if εi < vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ, on the other hand. Therefore, in both
cases in the deﬁnition, the requirement that this disc or annulus has a non-empty
intersection with the disc Dð(cid:1)piþ1; εiþ1Þ expresses that there exist a straight-line path of
velocity vmax from some point in Ui to some point in Uiþ1:

; vmaxÞ and Cþð(cid:1)piþ1; t(cid:4)

In practice, we are more interested in the cases where the error zones are rather small
and the uncertain prism is not transversal. We explain this geometrically. In the case of a
transversal uncertain prism, the cones C(cid:4)ð(cid:1)pi; tþ
; vmaxÞ, appearing
i
in Theorem 5.2, do not intersect and the uncertain rim has no hole in it. In the case of a
non-transversal uncertain prism, these two cones do intersect. This intersection creates a
hole in the uncertain rim. The projection of this hole is the intersection of the PPA of all
classical prisms involved in the deﬁnition of the uncertain prism (see Deﬁnition 4.1). This
hole in the projection is illustrated in Figure 11 for movement in a two-dimensional case,
as the inner (white) ellipse. This white area can be regarded as the certain PPA, meaning
that all points in this area can certainly be reached, whatever points we start from and
end in the error regions. The projection of the uncertain rim represents also a possible
PPA, but in a less certain sense. This means that not all points in the error regions give
rise to spatio-temporal paths that visit these points. This less certain PPA corresponds to
the red area between the two ellipses in Figure 11.

B. KUIJPERS AND W. OTHMAN

The following property gives a characterisation of non-transversal (and thus also of
transversal) uncertain prisms. In Theorem 5.2, we have encountered the bottom cone
C(cid:4)ð(cid:1)pi; tþ
; vmaxÞ: It is easily checked that the top
i
of this bottom cone is contained in the interior of the upper cone if and only if

which is equivalent to the condition that says that the top of this upper cone is in the
interior of the bottom cone. The following property says that this condition captures non-
transversality. We refer the reader, interested in the proof of this proposition, to Appendix C.

6. Uncertain prisms and their rims in R

Now, we turn our attention to the uncertain rim of an uncertain prism in R. The
following property is a direct corollary of Theorem 5.2, when we take S ¼ R. As is
usual in one-dimensional geometry, we use x and xi to denote spatial variables and
points (rather than the notation (cid:1)p and (cid:1)pi for an arbitrary metric space).

Corollary 6.1: Let xi and xiþ1 be two points in R and let ti < tiþ1 be two moments in
the uncertain prism

time. Let εi; εiþ1 > 0 be error margins. The uncertain rim of
UPðxi; ti; εi; xiþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞ in R is given by the constraint formula

The ﬁrst line of inequalities in this corollary describes the truncated classical prism.
The further inequalities describe the bottom and upper cones that are removed from it.
This is already illustrated in Figure 6, where the uncertain rim consists of two parallelo-
grams, and in Figure 7, where the uncertain prism is transversal.

However, the more interesting case for practical applications is given by the situation
where the error zones are rather small and the uncertain prism is not transversal. The
following corollary of Corollary 6.1 describes the situation for that case. The proof of this
corollary is a straightforward computation, which we omit. In order to contain the size of
the expressions, we abbreviate vmax(cid:2)ðtiþ1(cid:4)tiÞ
by Li (half of the maximum distance that can
be travelled between the anchor points at constant speed vmax) and the average tiþ1þti
of the time components by (cid:1)ti.

spatial projection of the rim coincides with the spatial projection of the uncertain
prism itself.

7. Uncertain prisms and their rims in R2

The following property is a direct corollary of Theorem 5.2, when we take S ¼ R2. As is
usual in two-dimensional geometry, we use ðx; yÞ and ðxi; yiÞ to denote spatial variables
and points (rather than the notation (cid:1)p and (cid:1)pi for an arbitrary metric space).

Corollary 7.1: Let ðxi; yiÞ and ðxiþ1; yiþ1Þ be two points in R2 and let ti < tiþ1 be two

The ﬁrst three lines of inequalities in this corollary describe the truncated classical
prism. The further inequalities describe the bottom and upper cones that are removed
from it.

Now, we give some illustrations of Corollary 7.1. Figure 9 shows the uncertain prism
UPð0; 0; 0; εi; 0; 2; 4; εiþ1; vmaxÞ, for εi ¼ 2
10 , εiþ1 ¼ 3
In this case, the
uncertain prism is not transversal, as illustrated by the hole in the uncertain rim
(shown in red in the ﬁgure). If we increase the error zones to εi ¼ 11
10 , we
obtain the rim of the uncertain prism shown in Figure 10 (again, in red). This uncertain
prism is transversal. We can see in this ﬁgure that the uncertain rim is an almost
complete uncertain prism with a bottom and upper cone taken out of it.

In the remainder of this section, we study the uncertain rim and the spatial projection
of the uncertain rim. As in the one-dimensional case, we distinguish between non-
transversal and transversal uncertain prisms. To contain the length of these explanations
and the length of the expressions involved in them, the following property describes the
uncertain rim of a non-transversal uncertain prism for the situation where the anchor
points are above a line parallel to the y-axis, that is, xi ¼ xiþ1. This choice is general
enough, in any case, since an arbitrary prism can be brought into this form by a spatial
rotation (that aligns the second anchor point above the line, parallel to the y-axis
through the ﬁrst anchor point). For a formal justiﬁcation of this transformation process,
we refer to Section 2 of Kuijpers and Othman (2010), where prism-preserving transfor-
mations of R2 (cid:3) R are described as compositions of spatio-temporal translations, spatial
rotations and time scalings. We refer the reader, interested in the proof of Proposition
7.3, to Appendix D.

Proposition 7.2: Let ðxi; yiÞ and ðxiþ1; yiþ1Þ be two points in R2, with xi ¼ xiþ1, and let
ti < tiþ1 be two moments in time. Let εi; εiþ1 > 0 be two error margins such that the
uncertain prism UPðxi; yi; ti; εi; xiþ1; yiþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞ is not transversal.

Then, the spatial projection of the uncertain rim of this uncertain prism is an area

delimited by two ellipses and is given by the equations

The following property covers the case of transversal uncertain prisms.
Proposition 7.3: If the uncertain prism UPðxi; yi; ti; εi; xiþ1; yiþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞ is trans-
versal, then the spatial projection of the uncertain rim is the spatial projection of the
uncertain prism UPðxi; yi; ti; εi; xiþ1; yiþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞ, which is contained in the area

8. Conclusion and discussion

We extend the classical space-time prism by allowing for spatial error margins on the
anchor points of the prism. We study these so-called ‘uncertain prisms’ and their
‘uncertain rims’ in an arbitrary metric space, in which we also give geometric char-
acterisations of them. We also study the uncertain rims of uncertain prisms as tools to
demarcate the spatial area of possible movement. By means of the notion of trans-
versal uncertain prism, we explore the limitations of the more robust notion of
uncertain rim.

Our approach to deal with uncertainty has been a purely geometric one which
contrasts with the work on anchor uncertainty on road networks of Kuijpers et al.
(2010). There, the authors start from a probability distribution on the possible locations
of the anchor points and investigate the propagation of this probability distribution on
the space-time prism. We can envisage a similar approach in our setting, where our
geometric approach is augmented with a probability distribution on the anchor regions.
This distribution would also propagate to the uncertain prism, its uncertain rim and its
spatial projection.

We continue this discussion with an extension of Theorem 4.2 to uncertain prisms
that have additionally uncertainty on time on their anchor points. The spatio-temporal
uncertainty region around the anchor point ð(cid:1)pj; tjÞ would be the set Uj (cid:3) ½tj (cid:4) δj; tj þ δj(cid:6),
where δj expresses the temporal error on the measured time tj (for j ¼ i; i þ 1). In this
case, the anchor region is a cylinder. In this context, we would consider uncertain prisms
of the form UPð(cid:1)pi; ti; εi; δi; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; δiþ1; vmaxÞ, where the uncertainty on the anchor
points is expressed by the strictly positive numbers εi; δi; εiþ1 and δiþ1. Using the set-
theoretic techniques of Section 4, we can then easily obtain the following result that
says that also in this setting the uncertain prism is a truncated prism.

Theorem 8.1: Let ðS; dÞ be a metric space. Let ð(cid:1)pi; tiÞ; ð(cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1Þ 2 S (cid:3) R be two
spatio-temporal points, with ti < tiþ1. Let εi; δi; εiþ1; δiþ1 > 0 and vmax > 0 be real num-
bers. The uncertain prism UPð(cid:1)pi; ti; εi; δi; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; δiþ1; vmaxÞ equals Pð(cid:1)pi; ti (cid:4) δi (cid:4)
εi
; vmaxÞ \ S (cid:3) ½ti (cid:4) δi; tiþ1 þ δiþ1(cid:6).
vmax

; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1 þ δiþ1 þ
How the additional uncertainty on the temporal component aﬀects the uncertain rim
is less obvious. We leave this as a topic for future research. Another open problem is
how the approach of this paper can be generalised to other spatial error zones like
elliptical shapes (relevant to GPS measurements).

ﬁrst equality in Lemma 4.3.

Proof. To prove the inclusion from left to right, we assume that ð(cid:1)x; tÞ 2 [
(cid:1)qi2Ui

C(cid:4)ð(cid:1)qi; ti; vmaxÞ, that
for which ð(cid:1)x; tÞ 2 C(cid:4)ð(cid:1)qi; ti; vmaxÞ and we have to show that ð(cid:1)x; tÞ 2

ÞÞ. The triangle inequality gives dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)xÞ (cid:5) dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)qiÞ þ dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)xÞ and
ÞÞ, which

is, there exists a (cid:1)qi 2 Ui

that dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)xÞ (cid:5) vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) ðti (cid:4)
by the assumption, we have dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)qiÞ þ dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)xÞ (cid:5) εi þ vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ ¼ vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) ðti (cid:4)
is exactly what we had to prove.

For the other inclusion, we assume that ð(cid:1)x; tÞ 2 C(cid:4)ð(cid:1)pi; ti (cid:4)

; vmaxÞ and ti (cid:5) t and we have
to show that there exists a (cid:1)qi 2 Ui for which ð(cid:1)x; tÞ 2 C(cid:4)ð(cid:1)qi; ti; vmaxÞ; that is, there exists a (cid:1)qi with
dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)piÞ (cid:5) εi and dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)xÞ (cid:5) vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ. We distinguish between the case dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)xÞ (cid:5) εi and the
case dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)xÞ > εi. In the ﬁrst case, we can simply take (cid:1)qi to be (cid:1)x and we obviously get dð(cid:1)x; (cid:1)piÞ (cid:5)
εi and dð(cid:1)x; (cid:1)xÞ ¼ 0 (cid:5) vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ, since t (cid:4) ti (cid:9) 0. In the second case, we take (cid:1)qi to be the point
on the line segment that connects (cid:1)pi and (cid:1)x at distance εi from (cid:1)pi. Then we have dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)xÞ ¼
dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)qiÞ þ dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)xÞ and thus dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)xÞ ¼ dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)xÞ (cid:4) dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)qiÞ ¼ dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)xÞ (cid:4) εi (cid:5) vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ þ εi (cid:4) εi (cid:5)
vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ. This completes the proof.

Proof. We start by explaining the equations that specify the sets that appear in the statement
of Theorem 5.2. From Theorem 4.2, we know that UPð(cid:1)pi; ti; εi; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞ is the set
Pð(cid:1)pi; ti (cid:4)

satisfy the ﬁrst three lines of the equations that follow the statement of the theorem.

ρPð(cid:1)qi; ti; (cid:1)qiþ1; tiþ1; vmaxÞ: Each point ð(cid:1)p; tÞ of a rim of a crisp prism Pð(cid:1)qi; ti; (cid:1)qiþ1; tiþ1; vmaxÞ connects
two paths of constant speed vmax: one straight-line path connecting ð(cid:1)qi; tiÞ with ð(cid:1)p; tÞ and one
straight-line path connecting ð(cid:1)p; tÞ with ð(cid:1)qiþ1; tiþ1Þ.

We claim that

(1) All points ð(cid:1)p; tÞ that belong to a path of constant speed vmax with a starting point ð(cid:1)qi; tiÞ, with

(cid:1)qi 2 Ui, are described by the conditions

Since, as we have argued above, the points ð(cid:1)p; tÞ that belong to the uncertain rim
ρUPð(cid:1)pi; ti; εi; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞ; are exactly those that satisfy both the conditions in (1)
and the conditions in (2) (that is, their conjunction), we have ﬁnished the proof if we have
proven Claim (1) and Claim (2). Indeed, the conditions appearing in (1) and (2) are exactly
those that describe the sets whose intersection makes up the uncertain rim, as they are
given following the statement of Theorem 5.2 and as we have shown at the beginning of
this proof.

Since Claim (2) is a time-reversed version of Claim (1), its proof is completely analogous to that
of Claim (1). Therefore, we only give the details of the proof for Claim (1). To prove this claim, we
have to show that a point ð(cid:1)p; tÞ belongs to a path of constant speed vmax with a starting point
ð(cid:1)qi; tiÞ, with (cid:1)qi 2 Ui if and only if it satisﬁes the conditions ti (cid:5) t, dð(cid:1)p; (cid:1)piÞ (cid:5) vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) t(cid:4)

For the only-if direction, we assume that there exists a ð(cid:1)qi; tiÞ, with (cid:1)qi 2 Ui, such that ð(cid:1)p; tÞ
belongs to a path of constant speed vmax with a starting point ð(cid:1)qi; tiÞ. This immediately implies
ti (cid:5) t. To show that dð(cid:1)p; (cid:1)piÞ (cid:5) vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) t(cid:4)
i Þ is a consequence of the assumption, we observe that
(cid:1)qi 2 Ui implies that dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)qiÞ (cid:5) εi. The fact that ð(cid:1)p; tÞ belongs to a path of constant speed vmax with
a starting point ð(cid:1)qi; tiÞ implies that dð(cid:1)p; (cid:1)qiÞ ¼ vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ. Using the triangle inequality, we obtain
dð(cid:1)p; (cid:1)piÞ (cid:5) dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)qiÞ þ dð(cid:1)p; (cid:1)qiÞ (cid:5) εi þ vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ ¼ vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) t(cid:4)

Using

from dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)qiÞ (cid:5) εi, we
thus obtain the desired inequality vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ (cid:5) dð(cid:1)p; (cid:1)piÞ þ εi:

ð(cid:1)qi; tiÞ.

< t ! dð(cid:1)p; (cid:1)piÞ (cid:9) vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tþ

We have to show that there exists a spatial point (cid:1)q in the plane t ¼ ti such that dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)qÞ (cid:5) εi and
such that ð(cid:1)q; tiÞ belongs to the upper cone Cþð(cid:1)p; t; vmaxÞ. The latter
implies that
dð(cid:1)p; (cid:1)qÞ ¼ vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ, which means that (cid:1)q should be located on the circle Cð(cid:1)p; vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞÞ in
the plane t ¼ ti. We distinguish between two cases: (a) ti (cid:5) t (cid:5) tþ
i

For Case (a), we only have the information ti (cid:5) t (cid:5) tþ

i Þ. All straight-
line paths of constant speed vmax from ð(cid:1)p; tÞ intersect the plane t ¼ ti in a circle with centre (cid:1)p and
radius vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ. Because dð(cid:1)p; piÞ (cid:5) vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ þ εi, the circle Cð(cid:1)p; vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞÞ and the
circle Cðpi; εiÞ must intersect or one must encompass the other. Since vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ is the smaller
radius, the circle Cð(cid:1)p; vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞÞ must be contained in the disc Dðpi; εiÞ. This guarantees
existence of the point (cid:1)q we seek, which lies on the vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ-circle and inside the εi-disc.

Any such point ð(cid:1)q; tiÞ can serve as a base point to reach the point ð(cid:1)p; tÞ via a straight-line path of

For Case (b), we have the information tþ

vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) t(cid:4)
rewritten as εi < vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ and

i Þ and, additionally, we know dð(cid:1)p; (cid:1)piÞ (cid:9) vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tþ

< t (or, equivalently, vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ > εi); dð(cid:1)p; (cid:1)piÞ (cid:5)
i Þ: These inequalities can be

vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ (cid:4) εi < dð(cid:1)p; (cid:1)piÞ < vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ þ εi:

For Case (b), similar to Case (a), all straight-line paths of constant speed vmax from ð(cid:1)p; tÞ
intersect the plane t ¼ ti in a circle with centre (cid:1)p and radius vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ. The same argument
as in Case (a) works here to show that this circle must intersect the circle with centre pi and
radius εi or one must encompass the other. Since εi is the smaller radius this time, Dðpi; εiÞ
would be contained inside the circle Cð(cid:1)p; vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞÞ. We now show that this cannot happen.
If we assume that
then
i Þ > dð(cid:1)p; pÞ, which violates the
vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ (cid:4) εi ¼ vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tiÞ (cid:4) vmax (cid:2) ðtþ
assumption that vmax (cid:2) ðt (cid:4) tþ
i (cid:5) t. Therefore, also here, the existence of
the point (cid:1)q, such that ð(cid:1)q; tiÞ can serve as a base point to reach the point ð(cid:1)p; tÞ via a straight-line
path of constant speed vmax, is guaranteed.
This completes the proof of this theorem.

Appendix C. Proof of Proposition 5.4

In this appendix, we give the proof of Proposition 5.4.
Proof: For the if-direction, we assume that tþ

iþ1 and dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)piþ1Þ < vmax (cid:2) ðt(cid:4)

i Þ. For the
sake of contradiction, we assume that the uncertain prism UPð(cid:1)pi; ti; εi; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞ is
transversal; that is, there exists a (cid:1)qi 2 Ui and there exists a (cid:1)qiþ1 2 Uiþ1, such that (cid:1)qiþ1 is reachable
from (cid:1)qi by a straight-line path of velocity vmax. This implies that dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)qiÞ (cid:5) εi, dð(cid:1)piþ1; (cid:1)qiþ1Þ (cid:5) εiþ1
and dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)qiþ1Þ ¼ vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ: Therefore, using the triangle inequality twice, we obtain vmax(cid:2)
ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ ¼ dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)qiþ1Þ (cid:5) dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)piÞ þ dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)qiþ1Þ (cid:5) dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)piÞ þ dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)piþ1Þ þ dð(cid:1)piþ1; (cid:1)qiþ1Þ (cid:5) εi þ εiþ1 þ
dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)piþ1Þ < εi þ εiþ1 þ vmax (cid:2) ðt(cid:4)

i Þ ¼ vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ; which is a contradiction.

For the only-if direction, we assume that the uncertain prism UPð(cid:1)pi; ti; εi; (cid:1)piþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞ is
iþ1 and

not transversal. For the sake of contradiction, we assume that tþ
i
dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)piþ1Þ (cid:9) vmax (cid:2) ðt(cid:4)

i Þ ¼ vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ (cid:4) ðεi þ εiþ1Þ:

In the ﬁrst case, we have tþ
i

iþ1 or vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ < εi þ εiþ1. We consider the line ,i
connecting (cid:1)pi and (cid:1)piþ1 (or any line ,i through (cid:1)pi, if (cid:1)pi ¼ (cid:1)piþ1). Let (cid:1)qi be a point on ,i \Cð(cid:1)pi; εiÞ
and (cid:1)qiþ1 be a point on ,i \Cð(cid:1)piþ1; εiþ1Þ, such that dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)qiþ1Þ ¼ dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)piþ1Þ þ εi þ εiþ1. Therefore, we
have dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)qiþ1Þ (cid:9) εi þ εiþ1 (cid:9) vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ. Since (cid:1)pi and (cid:1)piþ1 belong to the prism, we have
dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)piþ1Þ (cid:5) vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ. Because of the continuity of the distance function d, there is a
point (cid:1)q0
iþ1 between (cid:1)qiþ1 and (cid:1)piþ1 (and
thus in Uiþ1), where dð(cid:1)q0
iþ1Þ reaches the intermediate value vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ: This contradicts the
i
non-transversality assumption.

In the second case, we have tþ

i Þ ¼ vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ (cid:4)
ðεi þ εiþ1Þ: Again, we consider the line ,i connecting (cid:1)pi and (cid:1)piþ1 (or any line ,i through (cid:1)pi, if
(cid:1)pi ¼ (cid:1)piþ1) and (cid:1)qi and (cid:1)qiþ1 with dð(cid:1)qi; (cid:1)qiþ1Þ ¼ dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)piþ1Þ þ εi þ εiþ1, as in the previous case.
Therefore, we
have
dð(cid:1)pi; (cid:1)piþ1Þ (cid:5) vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4) tiÞ. The same continuity argument then shows that there is a point (cid:1)q0

between (cid:1)qi > and (cid:1)pi > and a point (cid:1)q0
iþ1Þ ¼ vmax (cid:2) ðtiþ1 (cid:4)

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

Proof: We give a sketch of the proof under the assumption xi ¼ xiþ1. The outer boundary of the
spatial projection of the uncertain rim of this uncertain prism is given by the spatial projection of
the classical prism Pðxi; yi; ti (cid:4) εi=vmax; xiþ1; yiþ1; tiþ1 þ εiþ1=vmax; vmaxÞ of which the uncertain
prism is a temporal truncation. From Section 3.2.2, for the case xi ¼ xiþ1, it is easily veriﬁed that
the spatial projection of the rim of this classical prism is the ellipse, given by the ﬁrst equation in
the statement of this proposition, with (cid:5) replaced by ¼ .

According to Theorem 5.2, the inner boundary of the spatial projection of the uncertain rim of
this uncertain prism is determined by the intersections of the bottom cone C(cid:4)ðxi; yi; ti þ
εi=vmax; vmaxÞ and the upper cone Cþðxiþ1; yiþ1; tiþ1 (cid:4) εiþ1=vmax; vmaxÞ. And indeed, from the non-
transversality of UPðxi; yi; ti; εi; xiþ1; yiþ1; tiþ1; εiþ1; vmaxÞ it follows, from Proposition 5.4, that these
two cones intersect. The intersection of this bottom cone and upper cone form the classical prism
Pðxi; yi; ti þ εi=vmax; xiþ1; yiþ1; tiþ1 (cid:4) εiþ1=vmax; vmaxÞ. From Section 3.2.2, for the case xi ¼ xiþ1, it is
easily veriﬁed that the spatial projection of the rim of this classical prism is the ellipse, given by the
second equation in the statement of this proposition, with (cid:9) replaced by ¼ . This concludes the
proof.

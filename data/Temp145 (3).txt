Abstract

Traffic  congestion  represents  an  ongoing  serious  issue  in 

many  large  cities.  Many  public  facilities,  such  as  hospitals, 

tend to be centrally located to ensure they are most acces‐

sible to local residents; as a result, they may contribute sig‐

nificantly  to  a  city's  traffic  congestion.  In  this  study,  a 

multi‐objective spatial optimization model was provided to 

help formulate hospital relocation plans, taking into account 

both  traffic  congestion  and  hospital  accessibility.  Using 

intra‐urban movement data, we proposed a method to esti‐

mate  the  area‐wide  traffic  congestion  caused  by  hospital 

visits and to identify potential hospitals to be relocated. An 

NSGA‐II (Non‐dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) algo‐

rithm was applied to solve the hospital relocation optimiza‐

tion problem; we applied our model to study optimal hospital 

relocation plans in Beijing. Analysis results provide a trade‐

off between traffic congestion relief and hospital accessibil‐

ity.  We  discussed  plans  that  significantly  reduce  traffic 

congestion while maintaining a high level of hospital acces‐

sibility.  Our  study  has  significant  policy  implications  and 

provides insights for future facility planning and transporta‐

tion planning.

In recent years, urban traffic congestion has become a worldwide concern that not only negatively affects resi‐

dents’ daily lives, but also presents a barrier to economic development as a result of slower employment growth or 

decreased rates of productivity caused by traffic congestion (Boarnet, 1997; Hymel, 2009; Zheng, Capra, Wolfson,

&  Yang,  2014).  Therefore,  determining  how  to  effectively  reduce  traffic  jams,  especially  in  severely  congested 

areas, is critical for improving quality of life and promoting economic growth. To address traffic congestion, a large 

body of research has been developed to infer traffic flows (Castillo, Menéndez, & Sánchez‐Cambronero, 2008; 

Dimitriou, Tsekeris, & Stathopoulos, 2008; Kong et al., 2016; Kwoczek, Martino, & Nejdl, 2014), analyze traffic 

congestion patterns (Tsekeris & Geroliminis, 2013; Wang, Zhu, Li, & Wu, 2013; Wen, Sun, & Zhang, 2014; Xu, Yue, 

& Li, 2013), and formulate strategies to alleviate traffic congestion (Almselati, Rahmat, Jaafar, & Yahia, 2015; Sun, 

Hu, Xie, & Zhang, 2014; Walraven, Spaan, & Bakker, 2016). Previous studies have shown that traffic congestion 

has a close relationship with land use, accessibility, and job–housing imbalance (Cervero, 1996; Woudsma, Jensen, 

Kanaroglou, & Maoh, 2008; Mondschein, Taylor, & Brumbaugh, 2009). As indicated by Yang et al. (2016), due to the 

preference for better hospital services, patient visits to high‐quality hospitals can contribute greatly to the traffic 

congestion around them. Cohen and Lee (1985) suggested that patients’ choice of hospitals can be affected by the 

hospital congestion level. More recently, Sweet (2014) examined the impact of local and regional congestion on 

five types of urban activities (i.e. finance and insurance, health care and social assistance, manufacturing, real es‐

tate and rental/leasing, and wholesale trade) and found that the finance and health care industries are most sensi‐

tive to regional traffic congestion and are more inclined to relocate when the current traffic situation is congested.

Beijing is facing a notorious traffic congestion problem, with far more rapid increase in car ownership than 

road capacity. Statistics show that the average congestion duration—including severe and moderate congestion—
in Beijing was 1 hr and 55 min on weekdays in 2014,1  resulting in an economic cost of 7,972 RMB (approximately 
1,152 U.S. dollars) per person during this year.2  During the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the Beijing municipal 

government first rolled out odd/even license plate restrictions as a trial run. Subsequently, additional measures 

have been adopted gradually, including a driving restriction policy, a driver's license lottery policy, and heavier 

penalties for traffic violations. Many researchers have studied traffic congestion in Beijing and made suggestions 

for improvement, such as comprehensive policy instruments (e.g. combination of congestion tolls, parking fees, 

fuel taxes, and high‐speed transit facilities), adoption of clean vehicles, and the use of more sustainable modes of 

transportation (Sun, Zheng, & Wang,  2014; Wang, Xu, & Qin, 2014). Despite all the efforts, Beijing remains one 

of the 15 most congested cities in the world according to the TomTom Traffic Index 2016 (https://www.tomtom.

com/en_gb/trafficeindex). To greatly reduce Beijing's traffic congestion, the municipal government has launched a 

policy recently to phase out non‐capital functions (mainly manufacturing, logistics, wholesale markets, and several 
educational and medical organizations), with some public facilities being moved from the inner city to rural areas.3 

Regarding the relocation design of public facilities, locational analysis has demonstrated its effectiveness in 

seeking the optimal spatial configuration of facilities for accomplishing service availability, accessibility, or other 

purposes. Since the 1960s, various location models have been developed to help solve real‐world location prob‐

lems (Koopmans & Beckmann, 1957; Cooper, 1963, 1964; Hakimi, 1964, 1965; Balinski, 1966; Revelle & Swain, 

1970;  Church  &  Revelle,  1974;  Murray,  Matisziw,  Wei,  &  Tong,  2008;  Gerrard,  Church,  Stoms,  &  Davis,  2010; 

Straitiff & Cromley, 2010; Li & Yeh, 2005; Rahmati, Hajipour, & Niaki, 2013). Applications can be found widely in 

both the public and private sectors, including plant location analysis (Barahona & Jensen, 1998; Fard, Kibert, & 

Chini, 2016), warehouse location problems (Akinç & Khumawala, 1977; Askin, Baffo, & Xia, 2014), emergency fa‐

cility siting (Oxendine, Sonwalkar, & Waters, 2012; Tong & Murray, 2009), and analysis of accessibility and facility 

location (White, 1979). Moreover, numerous studies have been conducted to examine hospital location problems, 

including effective hospital marketing (Cokelez & Peacock, 1994), regulating the health care system (Mitropoulos, 

Mitropoulos, Giannikos, & Sissouras, 2006), and preventive or primary health care facility location optimization 

(Gu, Wang, & McGregor, 2010; Tanser, 2006). Although a single objective has been the focus in these studies, such 

as minimizing costs or maximizing the overall service coverage or accessibility, multiple objectives have also been 

studied  that  aim  to  achieve  two  or  more  goals  simultaneously  (Daskin  &  Stern,  1981;  Dökmeci,  1979;  Rahman 

&  Smith,  2000).  For  example,  in  medical  facility  planning,  Stummer,  Doerner,  Focke,  and  Heidenberger  (2004) 

proposed  a  two‐phase  multi‐objective  approach  for  determining  the  location  and  size  of  medical  departments 

in a hospital network. In addition to service availability or accessibility, the facility relocation strategy can also 

WANG et Al.    |  3

be applied to address traffic congestion problems (e.g. studies that include locating service facilities to reduce 

insufficient  coverage  and  congestion;  Berman,  Krass,  &  Wang,  2006),  to  incorporate  congestion  in  preventive 

health care facility network design (Zhang, Berman, & Verter, 2009), and to investigate dynamic effects of traffic 

congestion and demand uncertainty on facility location design (Jouzdani, Sadjadi, & Fathian, 2013).

While previous location modeling has mainly focused on achieving accessibility (i.e. minimizing travel distance/

time) to the service facilities of interest, this article also examines the minimization of regional traffic congestion 

caused by visits to public medical facilities. Relocating hospitals in Beijing may greatly help alleviate traffic conges‐

tion in the city. First, as the political and economic center of China, Beijing has a number of high‐quality hospitals, 

including  military  hospitals,  specialized  hospitals,  and  maternity/children's  health  hospitals.  These  hospitals  at‐

tract a large number of patients from surrounding cities seeking high‐quality health care services (Wu, 2016). As a 

result, hospital visits account for a significant portion of traffic in Beijing. Second, these high‐quality hospitals are 

located in the central area and suffer greatly from traffic congestion, especially during rush hours. We thus use the 

city of Beijing as a case study to examine alternative plans for hospital relocation to ease traffic congestion while 

maintaining acceptable hospital accessibility at the same time. A new multi‐objective facility relocation model is 

proposed, with one goal of focusing on achieving the highest level of accessibility and another goal of seeking 

maximal traffic congestion reduction. We use a human mobility dataset to analyze traffic congestion caused by 

hospital visits over an area‐wide road network. Considering the non‐linear relationship between traffic conges‐

tion and the spatial configuration of hospitals, an NSGA‐II (Non‐dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) algorithm 

was developed to solve the optimization problem. Our research has significant policy implications and provides 

important insights for urban planning and transportation planning.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the study area and datasets. Section 3 

summarizes  the  methodology  of  the  research.  Section  4  presents  details  of  the  delineation  of  hospital  service 

areas, estimation of traffic congestion, and identification of potential hospitals to be relocated. Section 5 intro‐

duces  the  hospital  relocation  model  and  describes  the  NSGA‐II,  which  was  developed  to  solve  the  relocation 

problem. Section 6 presents the modeling results, and Section 7 offers conclusions and future research directions.

2.1 | Study area

In 2015, Beijing, the capital city of China, had 16 districts with a total area of more than 16,000 km2 and a perma‐

nent resident population of 21.7 million. Considering that among the 16 districts, Yanqing, Huairou, Miyun, and 

Pinggu are by far the most suburban districts and only account for a small portion (7.43%) of the total residential 

population (see https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/), we included the other 12 districts in our study 

area. A map of the study area is shown in Figure 1.

2.2 | Data description

The data used in this study mainly include hospital data, taxi trajectory data, and Baidu traffic congestion data. 

The hospital data were obtained from the Beijing Health Statistics Yearbook 2014 and the Beijing basic medical in‐

surance designated medical institutions. There are 178 hospitals in Beijing, 166 of which are within the study area. 

The hospital data contain information on hospital name, type, grade, address, administrative area, and number of 

beds. The taxi trajectory data include the global positioning system (GPS) trajectories of approximately 17,200 

taxis in three consecutive months (May to July 2013). Each taxi trajectory record contains information on taxi ID, 

positioning time of occurrence, latitude, longitude, direction, speed, and status. The Baidu traffic congestion data 

were derived from the Baidu real‐time traffic information map via the Baidu application programming interface 

around the same time. Baidu, one of China's three internet giants, offers powerful navigation services. The dataset 

WANG et Al.4  |    

F I G U R E   1  Location map showing the study area

contains a traffic congestion index developed by Baidu to assess the degree of roadway congestion. The conges‐

tion index ranges from 1 to 4, where 1 indicates smooth, 2 indicates slow moving, 3 indicates congested, and 4 

indicates severely congested. Although the taxi trajectory data and traffic congestion data are not in the same 

period of year 2013, previous studies have shown the regularity and stability of resident trip characteristics (Liu, 

Kang, Gao, Xiao, & Tian, 2012).

The taxi dataset serves as a proxy for traffic congestion caused by hospital visits in this study. Research shows 

that taxi trips account for 20–30% of all trips to general hospitals in another city—Shenzhen, China (Chen & Song, 

2014)—and the percentage would be larger for Beijing, given that Beijing's high‐quality hospitals attract a large 

number of patients from other parts of the country who might be likely to use taxis. Lack of effective regulation of 

taxi drop‐offs/pick‐ups around hospital entrances would also contribute to traffic jams caused by taxi visits. The 

big volume of taxi data may be sufficient to depict the traffic condition, and the detailed origin–destination (OD) 

information enables us to redistribute the flow for traffic congestion reduction. While individual patient travel 

data are more ideal, considering their unavailability due to privacy, the taxi dataset used in our study can serve as 

a good proxy to estimate hospital visits and associated traffic patterns.

The methodology in our study is structured as follows. First, hospital service areas are delineated, and OD trips 

are  constructed  using  taxi  trajectory  data.  Afterwards,  traffic  congestion  is  estimated  using  a  simplified  travel

distance calculation method. Next, hospitals that contribute the most to traffic congestion are identified to con‐

struct the relocation set. The traffic congestion index is estimated based on the taxi trip data and is combined with 

Baidu traffic congestion data to select potential hospitals for relocation. The use of both datasets is necessary: de‐

termining congested hospitals only from taxi data might be insufficient because of the limited temporal availability 

of the taxi data. Thus, the Baidu traffic congestion index is used as supplemental information. After determining 

potential hospitals to be relocated, a hospital relocation model is built, aiming to reduce traffic congestion while 

maintaining  hospital  accessibility.  Finally,  an  NSGA‐II  algorithm  is  designed  to  solve  the  multi‐objective  spatial 

optimization problem. The flowchart of our research methodology is shown in Figure 2.

4.1 | Hospital service areas

Hospital service areas (HSAs) portray hospital choices by patients, and an accurate delineation of HSAs is impor‐

tant for health care management and resources allocation (Gittelsohn & Powe, 1995; Jia, Xierali, & Wang, 2015; 

Klauss, Staub, Widmer, & Busato, 2005; Wang & Luo, 2005; Wang & Zhang, 2005). With the widespread use of 

location‐aware  devices,  such  as  GPS  receivers  and  mobile  phones,  a  large  volume  of  data  can  be  collected  to

study individuals’ movements and location choices (Kang, Ma, Tong, & Liu, 2012; Liu et al., 2012). Considering the 

unavailability of patient data, we utilized taxi trip data to estimate patients’ visits to hospitals and to delineate the 

To derive HSAs and estimate area‐wide traffic conditions, we first constructed hospital visit trips. To associate 

taxi trips with hospital visits, we selected the taxi pick‐ups or drop‐offs falling in the 200‐m buffer zone of each

hospital and established the corresponding OD trips. An OD trip is denoted by a vector from

where (x,y) represents the coordinates of the start/end point and t represents the time. According to a previous

study on the same dataset (Kong, Liu, Wang, Tong, & Zhang, 2017), a 200‐m buffer zone is applied based on an 

estimate of the reasonable walking distance and the existence of multiple entrances to a hospital.

Next, we discretized the study area into 1,000 × 1,000 m grids and then computed patients’ pick‐up/drop‐off 

points within each grid to depict the geographic distribution of a hospital's patients. Such a distribution was then 

used to approximate the hospitals’ HSAs in this study. Based on the sum of drop‐offs in three months, we selected 

82 hospitals for further analysis, each with a minimum number of 2,000 visits in this period. The hospitals chosen 

accounted for 92% of the visits to all the 166 hospitals in the study area. Figure 3 shows four typical HSAs. The 

distribution of hospital visits shows where patients come from and can be used to delineate hospital service areas.

4.2 | Traffic congestion estimation

Regarding traffic congestion estimation, GPS‐equipped vehicle trajectory data have been shown to be very ef‐

fective,  and  a  number  of  performance  measures  have  been  studied,  including  spatiotemporal  average  velocity 

(Kong, Zhao, Wei, & Liu, 2013), traffic density state (Li, Chen, & Zhang, 2014), travel time state (Feng, Hourdos, & 

Davis, 2014), and the amount of traffic volume (Xu, Chen, Kong, Zhai, & Liu, 2016). In this study, traffic conges‐

tion is estimated by the volume of taxi trips that originated from or ended at a hospital. For each hospital, the 

amount of traffic volume corresponding to hospital visits was approximated by the sum of these taxis passing by 
each 1,000 × 1,000 m grid along the OD trips. The regional traffic congestion caused by hospital visits was then 

estimated by summarizing all the traffic for the entire study area.

Given that traffic congestion is more severe in the morning and evening peaks, we focused on travel during 

the periods of 6–10 a.m. and 4–8 p.m. The estimated traffic congestion corresponding to hospital visits during the 

morning and evening peak hours is shown in Figure 4 (adjusted classification based on the Jenks natural breaks 

classification method). In our study, since we are interested in the area‐wide spatial trend of the traffic condition, 
traffic congestion is estimated using 1,000 × 1,000 m grids. Our estimated traffic congestion is also consistent with 

that found in a previous study by Wang, Lu, Yuan, Zhang, and Wetering (2013).

4.3 | Determining potential hospitals to be relocated

We first identified the hospitals that significantly contributed to traffic congestion for relocation consideration. 

The traffic congestion evaluation based on the taxi data provides an estimate of the area‐wide traffic volumes, 

which are often highly related to traffic congestion. We used the estimated traffic congestion with the Baidu traf‐

fic congestion index to select potential hospitals for relocation. The Baidu traffic congestion index ranges from 1 

to 4, indicating smooth, slow‐moving, congested, and severely congested traffic conditions. The estimated traffic 

congestion corresponding to hospital visits ranges from 0 to the maximum number of hospital visits. Given that 

the two indices are not of the same magnitude, we performed the selection of hospitals for relocation by combin‐

ing both indexes.

The selection of potential hospitals for relocation is conducted through the following procedures:

F I G U R E   4  Traffic congestion estimation using taxi trip data: (a) morning peak (6–10 a.m.); and (b) evening 
peak (4–8 p.m.)

F I G U R E   5  Spatial distribution of hospitals in different categories evaluated based on the traffic in the 
surrounding 5 × 5 km window: (a) morning peak (6–10 a.m.); and (b) evening peak (4–8 p.m.)

1.  For the estimated traffic volume based on the taxi trip data, we computed the local traffic volume for each 
hospital  based  on  a 5 × 5  neighborhood  window.  Hospitals  are  considered  as  relatively  congested  based  on 

taxi trip data if their average neighborhood traffic volume is higher than the average area‐wide traffic volume; 

otherwise, they are tagged as less congested based on taxi trip data.

2. A similar evaluation to that described in (1) is performed for hospitals using the Baidu traffic congestion index, 

resulting in more congested hospitals and less congested hospitals.

3.  Hospitals that have been identified as more congested based on both the taxi trip data and Baidu traffic data 

are selected as potential hospitals to be relocated.

Selection is conducted for both morning and evening peak hours, resulting in a total of 48 potential hospitals to be 

relocated. The selected hospitals (in red) are shown in Figure 5, and they form the set of hospitals to be relocated in 

the hospital relocation model to be discussed in the following section.

5.1 | The hospital relocation model

The objectives of the hospital relocation model include minimizing the region's traffic congestion condition and 

maximizing the overall hospital accessibility. The first objective addresses area‐wide traffic congestion reduction. 

Traffic volume is applied as an adequate indicator for this objective, as mentioned above. The second objective 

concerns overall hospital accessibility, which is often assessed by provider‐to‐population ratios, travel impedance 

to the nearest provider(s), and gravity model‐based measures (Gautam, Li, & Johnson, 2014; Guagliardo, 2004). 

Although several studies have revealed that travel time—not travel distance—is a major deterrent to hospital utili‐

zation (Cohen & Lee, 1985; Shannon, Skinner, & Bashshur, 1973), studies have used both travel distance (Doerner, 

Focke, & Gutjahr, 2007; Doherty, Rispel, & Webb, 1996) and time (Branas, MacKenzie, & ReVelle, 2000; Toregas, 

Swain,  Revelle,  &  Bergman,  1971).  In  this  study,  we  also  used  travel  distance  to  measure  hospital  accessibility 

because of the lack of travel time information.

Objective (1) aims to minimize the overall system‐wide congestion condition after the hospital relocation ef‐

fort. Objective (2) seeks to minimize the total patient travel distance. Constraint (3) computes the demand at area 
i. Constraint (4) specifies that a hospital can be relocated to at most one site. Constraint (5) states that a candidate 

WANG et Al.10  |    

site  can  receive  at  most  one  relocated  hospital.  Constraint  (6)  gives  the  number  of  hospitals  to  be  relocated. 

Constraint (7) establishes the new demand‐to‐hospital assignment as a function of the spatial configuration of 
hospitals after relocation. Constraints (8) and (9) compute the travel distance from area i  to hospital h and evaluate 

the congestion level after the hospital relocation. Constraint (10) imposes the binary integrity constraints on the 
decision variables. More discussion on the l, 𝜋, g functions linking hospital relocation scenarios with demand real‐
location, travel distance, and traffic conditions will be provided below.

In  our  research,  health  insurance  is  not  considered,  given  the  lack  of  data.  Hospital  demand  reallocation 

is  often  complicated  and  difficult  to  accurately  predict  because  it  involves  an  individual  patient's  decision  on 

whether to choose a new hospital or choose the previous hospital at a new site, even though it might involve a 

longer travel distance. There is little discussion in the literature on the number of patients who choose to go to 
the same hospital after relocation. In our HRP, the patient allocation function  l  for hospital relocation scenarios 

are simplified using a hospital attraction ratio. Further discussion regarding this parameter will be given in Section 
5.2.3. The 𝜋 function, which is used to evaluate hospital accessibility, is calculated using the average Euclidean 
distance from patients to the most frequently visited hospital, which is obtained from the current health care 

service choices estimated from the taxi data. Because traffic congestion usually occurs in some vulnerable parts 

of a network (Rempe, Huber, & Bogenberger, 2016), when evaluating traffic congestion, we pay special attention 

to  congested  regions  through  an  evaluation  of  the  locations/local  areas  where  the  traffic  congestion  index  is 

significantly high.

5.2 | Solving the hospital relocation problem

Two approaches can be used to solve a location problem, exact methods and heuristic methods (Church & Murray, 

2009; Tong & Murray, 2012). Exact methods ensure that the optimal location can be found. However, many loca‐

tion problems are NP‐hard (non‐deterministic polynomial‐time hard) (Mirchandani & Francis, 1990); it is unlikely 

that these kinds of problem can be solved in a given polynomial time, and obtaining the optimal solution using 

exact methods can be computationally challenging. Hence, heuristic methods are also relied upon for problem 

solution.  Heuristics  are  ad  hoc  strategies  that  can  often  find  approximate  or  sometimes  optimal  solutions  in  a 

fast manner. Common heuristics, including simple interchange (Teitz & Bart, 1968), greedy algorithms (Sviridenko, 

2000), simulated annealing (Yu & Lin, 2014), Tabu search (Abyazi‐Sani & Ghanbari, 2016), ant colony (Gao, Wang, 

Cheng, Inazumi, & Tang, 2016), genetic algorithms (Tong, Murray, & Xiao, 2009), and NSGA‐Π algorithms (Pires, 

Antunes, & Martins, 2012), have been applied effectively to solve location problems.

Similar to many other location problems, solving the HRP exactly can be computationally challenging. Solving 

the problem exactly is particularly difficult considering the non‐linear relationships among the congestion level, 

the travel distance, and the demand–hospital allocation after relocation. Therefore, in this research, we developed 

a heuristic to solve the HRP. Among other heuristics, NSGA‐II is a well‐known and widely used multi‐objective 

evolutionary algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) with the idea of maintaining diversity of non‐dom‐

inated solutions. In recent years, it has demonstrated effectiveness in solving multi‐objective optimization prob‐

lems, including the reactive power dispatch problem (Jeyadevi, Baskar, Babulal, & Iruthayarajan, 2011), the water 

distribution network design (Atiquzzaman, Liong, & Yu, 2006), and the waste load allocation models (Yandamuri, 

Srinivasan, & Murty Bhallamudi, 2006). We used NSGA‐II to solve the HRP, considering its effectiveness in solving 

multi‐objective optimization problems (Pires et al., 2012).

5.2.1 | The NSGA‐II algorithm

NSGA‐II, an elitist non‐dominated sorting genetic algorithm, was first introduced by Deb, Agarwal, Pratap, and 

Meyarivan (2002) based on the NSGA (Srinivas & Deb, 1994). While the overall evolving process of NSGA‐II is 

very similar to that in a GA, some improvements were made in NSGA‐II to generate more diverse solutions in a

fast manner. The flowchart of the NSGA‐II algorithm used in this work is presented in Figure 6. Beginning with the 

initial population, non‐dominated sorting is applied to rank the solutions and then the best solutions are chosen to 

generate offspring until the iteration ends. Important components of our NSGA‐II, including chromosome encod‐

ing, fitness function evaluation, fast non‐dominated sorting, crowding distance evaluation, and offspring genera‐

tion, are presented in the following sections.

5.2.2 | Chromosome encoding

Chromosome encoding is an important component of a GA. In addition to the usual binary string representation 

with  fixed  length,  many  other  schemes,  such  as  variable‐sized  or  fuzzy  membership  chromosomes,  have  been 

WANG et Al.12  |    

effectively  applied  (Kim  &  Jin,  2015;  Yang,  Kuo,  Chien,  &  Quyen,  2015).  Recently,  an  integer  vector  encoding 

scheme to represent one possible solution with each integer indexing a candidate facility site has been applied to 

solve a maximal covering location problem (Tong et al., 2009) and the p‐median problem (Alp, Erkut, & Drezner, 

2003). We also adopted the integer encoding schedule to represent hospital sites before and after relocation. In 
particular, each chromosome consists of two parts, as shown in Figure 7: the first part is a vector (X1,X2, … ,Xsl) of 
length sl indicating the hospitals to be relocated and the second part is a vector (Ch1,Ch2, … ,Chsl) of length sl repre‐
senting the new sites after relocation. Each chromosome/solution therefore records the information on a hospital 
at site Xi that is going to be relocated to site Chi (i = 1,2, … ,sl).

5.2.3 | Fitness function evaluation

f1)
The fitness of a chromosome is evaluated based on two objective functions. The first fitness function 
(

on  the  traffic  congestion  objective  is  evaluated  using  the  traffic  volume  estimated  in  an  area.  Because  special 

 based 

attention is paid to some significantly congested regions, the number of grids/areas where the traffic volume is 

significantly higher (i.e. nine standard deviations) than the regional average is computed to evaluate the fitness 

for the first objective.

For the second objective, the fitness function 
(

f2)

 is evaluated using the system‐wide average Euclidean travel 

distance based on the new patient–hospital assignment after relocation. The patient–hospital assignment after 
relocation is estimated as follows. As mentioned earlier, we adopted a hospital attraction ratio (𝜆) to roughly esti‐
mate the percentage of patients who still go to the old hospitals at the new sites. It is very difficult to determine 

this ratio, considering patients’ personal preferences and varying types of hospitals; note that health insurance 

is not taken into account. However, Beijing has gathered almost all the best hospitals in the country, and these 

hospitals have attracted a large number of patients from other provinces. The chances are high that many patients 

will still seek medical services in their previous hospitals, even if they have been relocated. Thus, in the HRP, an 

assumption is made that 70% of patients would continue to go to the old hospitals, even if this would require a 

longer travel distance. For the remaining 30% of patients in an area, we assumed that every patient would go to 

the hospital that is most frequently visited by the people computed in the initial scenario (i.e. the hospital at the 

top of the most popular hospitals list). Therefore, if the most popular hospital was relocated elsewhere, then the 

second or third most frequently visited hospital would be their choice; otherwise, the patient would go to the 

nearest hospital. Therefore, similar to many other studies, an underlying assumption of our HRP is that the hospi‐

tals relocated are uncapacitated.

With the current spatial configuration of hospitals, the number of significantly congested regions for (f0

and the overall average travel distance (f0
were normalized using their corresponding values before the relocation (fi

2) is 4.8 km. When evaluating relocation scenario  i , the fitness values

We note the importance of the hospital attraction ratio in the HRP. When 𝜆 is higher, more patients will go out‐
side the central city to seek medical services after hospital relocation, resulting in a reduction in overall hospital 

accessibility, but likely with more improvement on overall traffic congestion.

5.2.4 | Fast non‐dominated sorting and crowding distance

The fast non‐dominated sorting operator is a ranking process implemented on populations Rt (see Figure 6) that 
returns a list of non‐dominated fronts. First, all non‐dominated solutions in the current population are found and 

F I G U R E   7  Encoding scheme used in this study

WANG et Al.    |  13

assigned to Front 1. Front 2 is formed similarly by removing all solutions in Front 1 in the current population. This 

procedure iterates until all solutions are assigned to a front. Thus, for each front, the crowding distance value of a 

particular solution is the average distance of its two neighboring solutions, and a large crowding distance suggests 

better diversity in the population. Solutions with smaller front ranks and larger values of crowding distance are 

viewed as better solutions.

5.2.5 | Selection, crossover, and mutation

Selection is the process of choosing solutions to form parents for producing offspring based on non‐dominated 

characteristics and crowding distance. Usually, a smaller front rank corresponds to a higher probability of being 

chosen for reproduction, and if two solutions have the same front rank, then the one with the larger crowding 

distance will be selected. In our study, after selection, a one‐point crossover operation was applied to generate 

new chromosomes, and a 100% crossover probability was used. Next, we performed the mutation operation to 

introduce new genes into the current population. In our study, a higher mutation probability of 0.4 was used to 

avoid being trapped in local optima.

The proposed HRP was solved by applying the NSGA‐II discussed previously. In particular, 48 hospitals were 

found to contribute significantly to traffic congestion and serve as potential candidates for relocation. Regarding 

relocation sites, a total of 51 candidate hospitals located outside the fifth beltway of Beijing, with summed drop‐

offs of less than 2,000, were chosen. Figure 8 shows the geographical location of these hospitals. The number p 

of hospitals to be relocated was from 5 to 15. A fixed population size of 10 was used, and the search process was

terminated when the iteration reached 100 times. In the application, the NSGA‐II was coded in Python, and the 

experiment was conducted on an Intel(R) Core(TM) 3.60.0 GHz desktop computer with 8 GB RAM.

6.1 | Parameter sensitivity

Figure 9 shows the Pareto optimal solutions solved by the NSGA‐II for p = 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15. As shown in the fig‐

ure, with increasing p, Objective 1, which is related to the traffic congestion condition, decreases, indicating that 

the relocation of more hospitals helps reduce more traffic congestion. However, the traffic congestion relief after 

hospital relocation is at the cost of an increase in overall travel distance, and the travel distance increases with the 

number of hospitals relocated. For example, compared with the current hospital configuration, when p = 5, one 

solution from the Pareto front is that Objective 1 (traffic congestion) is reduced by 27% and Objective 2 (travel 

distance) is increased by 14%, and when p = 15, a solution indicates that traffic congestion is reduced by 74% at 

the cost of an increase in travel distance by 81%. Thus, mitigated traffic congestion and shorter travel distance 

cannot be achieved at the same time; as a result, a tradeoff between traffic congestion and accessibility provides 

important  insights  into  the  priorities  to  be  given  to  each  objective.  Also,  as  the  number  of  relocated  hospitals 

increases, the reduction in traffic congestion and increase in travel distance present a non‐linear relationship.

The hypervolume (HV) indicator (Zitzler & Thiele, 1999) is used in this research to evaluate the heuristic per‐

formance. HV identifies the volume enclosed by the specified reference point and the non‐dominated solution 

set. In our study, a normalized metric, the hypervolume ratio (HVR), is employed. Here, the HVR is the proportion 

of the maximum hypervolume covered by HV, within the range [0, 1]. Solutions with higher HVR values are con‐

sidered better solutions, based on both convergence and diversity.

Figure 10 shows the performance metric HVR for evaluating the Pareto optimal solutions to all the problem 

instances. A small number of relocated hospitals appears to imply a better HVR value; however, the disparity is 

F I G U R E   9  Pareto optimal solutions based on normalized objective functions

WANG et Al.    |  15

F I G U R E   1 0  NSGA‐II performance metric HVR

not enormous among p = 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. When p = 15, the HVR metric has a significantly low value. Figure 10 

suggests that, when the number of relocated hospitals increases greatly, the traffic congestion is abruptly reduced 

by substantially sacrificing the accessibility—with traffic congestion reduced by nearly a factor of 2 compared to 

the original configuration. As far as accessibility is concerned, the number of relocated hospitals p = 15 may not 

represent a good choice. This can also be seen in Figure 9, where the travel distance has increased about 1.8 times 

while the traffic congestion reduction is not as dramatic. For p = 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13, the relief of traffic congestion 

and the increase in travel distance are comparable and consistent with similar HVR values. Thus, apart from other 

financial and environmental factors, the overall quality of the solution should be carefully considered when decid‐

ing on the number of relocated hospitals.

This study aims to reduce the traffic congestion while maintaining hospital accessibility. Based on the param‐

eter sensitivity analysis, maximal traffic congestion reduction and shortest travel distance cannot be achieved at 

the same time, and traffic congestion mitigation for a large number of hospitals (like 15 in this case) is at a very 

high cost in terms of overall travel distance. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between the two conflicting objectives, 

and decisions need to be made on the balance between them. As for Beijing, relocating a smaller number (<15) of 

hospitals might be better in order to maintain hospital accessibility.

6.2 | Optimization results

As discussed above, different relocation plans exist for varying p. Here, we take p = 5 as an example to show the 

solution characteristics and illustrate the tradeoff between the two objective functions. For p = 5, our NSGA‐II 

heuristic method identified two distinct optimal solutions (Figure 9). Since our emphasis is placed on traffic condi‐
tion, we focus on the solution that gives the highest congestion reduction (fi
= 0.7391); this solution is shown 
in Figure 11. According to this relocation scenario, hospitals at locations 6, 27, 122, 113, and 132 (in yellow) would

be relocated to new hospital sites at locations 117, 30, 126, 55, and 45 (in green), respectively. That is, hospitals 

located  in  Dongcheng  and  Chaoyang  districts  need  to  be  relocated  to  Tongzhou,  Chaoyang,  Shijingshan,  and 

Daxing, mainly from the central area to the outskirts of Beijing. This relocation strategy gains an overall traffic 
congestion reduction of fi
= 1.145. With the initial number of

significantly congested regions being 23 (f0

tion process helps us reduce the congested regions to 17 (26%), though accompanied by a slight increase of 0.6 km

= 0.7391 and a travel distance increase of fi

(14%) in the average travel distance. This is a desirable result, since a 600‐m travel distance increase (less than 1‐

min travel time for cars) would benefit all the cars passing through six 1,000 × 1,000 m grids. For most areas in 

Beijing, as the background color in Figure 11 shows, the traffic change (traffic volume after relocation minus that 

before relocation) remains slight. Obviously, there are significant traffic volume reductions in areas where the five 

hospitals have been relocated from. We also note traffic volume increases along the paths and in areas where the 

five hospitals have been relocated to. Though the overall system‐wide traffic volume increases, the significant 

reduction of traffic volume in the central areas leads to an overall traffic congestion relief.

Figure  12b  shows  the  estimated  traffic  congestion  after  hospital  relocation  specified  by  the  solution  in 

Figure  11.  The  new  traffic  congestion  pattern  is  found  to  be  moderately  similar  to  that  before  relocation,  as 

shown in Figure 12a. Before the relocation, traffic congestion was mainly distributed in the central areas, whereas 

in Figure 12b the central area has fewer congested grids/areas and there are several new paths of increased con‐

gestion leading to rural areas of Beijing. This is caused by the relocation of five hospitals as shown in Figure 11. 

WANG et Al.    |  17

F I G U R E   1 2  Traffic congestion patterns when p = 5: (a) before relocation; and (b) after relocation

More precisely, as shown in Figure 12 (manually defined breaks), the number of severely congested grids/areas 

whose traffic volume is larger than 50,000 taxis before relocation is 19, while after relocation this number has 

decreased to 15. Note that a traffic congestion reduction does not necessarily imply a reduction of the total traffic 

volume over the entire study area. In fact, in this case, the overall traffic volume increased because of the longer 

system‐wide  travel  distance  (14.5%  increase).  However,  the  optimal  solution  found  in  our  study  results  in  the 

traffic being more widely distributed in the network, leading to fewer congested areas in the central city of Beijing.

The optimization result for relocating five hospitals in Beijing shows that hospital relocation can help to sig‐

nificantly alleviate traffic congestion in central Beijing. Hospital candidate sites in Tongzhou district appear to be 

more suitable, as it is beneficial for Tongzhou to be the capital subcenter and help solve Beijing's traffic congestion 

at the same time. While we focus more on strategic planning of hospital relocation, other political, financial, and 

environmental factors should also be taken into account for the actual implementation.

The parameter sensitivity and optimization results in our study show that, using taxi data, the relocation of 

hospitals  can  reduce  severely  congested  areas  in  Beijing  with  only  a  slight  increase  in  travel  distance.  Though 

maximal traffic congestion reduction and maximal hospital accessibility cannot be reached at the same time, a 

small number of hospital relocations can obtain a significant traffic congestion reduction at the cost of a minimal 

decrease  in  hospital  accessibility.  Wu  (2016)  theoretically  proposed  releasing  non‐capital  functions  by  moving 

quality medical resources to new urban development areas, which is consistent with our finding of relocating hos‐

pitals to Tongzhou district. In addition, the study by Meng (2014) shows that through promoting road congestion 

charges we can increase the outward impetus for pushing Beijing's medical resources outside the central area. 

Our work for the first time developed such a relocation strategy to ease urban traffic congestion in Beijing, with 

the results obtained.

In this study, we assumed a fixed hospital attraction ratio to specify the number of patients who would follow 

their  previous  hospital  after  relocation.  We  note  that  preferences,  hospital  types,  and  health  insurance  could 

also contribute to whether patients stick to their previous hospitals. Basically, for a hospital with a higher attrac‐

tion ratio, after hospital relocation more patients will go outside the central city to seek medical services at the 

relocated sites, leading to improved traffic congestion in the central area. As for hospital types, higher‐quality 

hospitals would have a larger attraction ratio since people often prefer better medical services. If a medical insur‐

ance‐designated hospital is relocated, people will need to travel to the new hospital location. In other words, all 

these factors can affect the hospital attraction ratio, as discussed in Section 5.2.3.

Currently, it is recognized that the adjustment of public facility locations, which is essentially a spatial optimiza‐

tion problem, is beneficial to relieve traffic congestion. Apart from multiple objectives, another difficulty hidden 

in this problem is the tradeoff between the spatial distribution of traffic flow and overall system accessibility. In 

this article, a multi‐objective spatial optimization model (HRP) was developed to relocate hospitals in Beijing to 

reduce traffic congestion while maintaining hospital service accessibility. An NSGA‐II algorithm was employed to 

solve the HRP. The results showed that relocating more hospitals can relieve traffic congestion more. Because 

of the multi‐objective nature of the HRP, solutions in the optimal Pareto front provide different levels of hospital 

accessibility and are associated with different traffic congestion patterns. Hence, decision‐makers should choose 

a solution that balances the two potentially conflicting objectives. Regarding the number of relocated hospitals, 

higher  values  do  not  necessarily  mean  better  solutions  because  moving  more  hospitals  outside  central  Beijing 

comes at a high cost in terms of additional travel, even without considering other political or financial factors.

Our study demonstrates the importance of spatial optimization in policy making and facility siting when at‐

tempting to achieve multiple goals. Its purpose is not to suggest a single optimal solution; rather, it is to provide 

alternative feasible plans in light of urban traffic congestion. Other public facilities—such as manufacturing, logis‐

tics, and wholesale markets—can also be relocated using our framework in order to further relieve traffic conges‐

tion and achieve other objectives. The strengths and weaknesses of using taxi data to identify congestion areas 

surrounding a hospital should be acknowledged. The large volume and detailed OD information provided by the 

taxi data enable us to examine traffic patterns dynamically and can help us understand different relocation strat‐

egy results. Unfortunately, the lack of purpose‐related information (hospital visits vs. non‐hospital visits) or travel 

data of individual patients prevents us from obtaining precise health care‐seeking behaviors and refining varying 

hospital attraction ratios. The proposed analytical framework in our study can effectively identify hospitals that 

contribute most to traffic congestion and identify the best relocation strategy using two objectives. If additional 

data are available, our framework could provide a more accurate evaluation of alternative relocation scenarios. 

Hence, future research can be conducted in two directions. First, travel time instead of Euclidean travel distance 

is more appropriate in evaluating medical facility accessibility since it takes transportation network traffic condi‐

tions into account. Second, the availability of patient travel data would provide a more accurate estimate of the 

parameters used in the model, including possible changes in hospital choice by patients after hospital relocation.

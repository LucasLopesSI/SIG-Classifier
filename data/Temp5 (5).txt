Abstract. Spatial databases are used in many natural resources management
applications. These databases help decision-makers to design location speci(cid:142) c
plans for resource management. In this paper, a geographical information system
is used to develop a spatial energy information system model. The model has
been used to examine the energy situation in a rural area of a developing country.
It can help energy planners to assess the need for energy interventions speci(cid:142) c to
certain regions in the planning area.

Introduction
More than three-quarters of the population of developing countries live in rural
areas. In some developing countries, as much as 90% of the population lives in rural
areas (FAO 1994 ) where people depend heavily on local resources for their livelihood.
In rural areas, farming is the main economic activity and biomass is the main source
of energy.

An energy (cid:143) ow path for a rural area, shown in (cid:142) gure 1, illustrates various stages
of transformation in energy (cid:143) ow from resources to end-uses. Reverse arrows shown
in the (cid:142) gure indicate that energy resources such as crop residues and animal manure
might have other competing non-energy uses that need to be considered while
planning for allocating these resources for energy purposes. Some of the energy
resources can also be converted to other useable forms of energy. In (cid:142) gure 1,
conversion of fuelwood to charcoal, animal manure to biogas, and crop residues
to briquettes are shown.

The four major energy consuming sectors in rural areas are households, com-
merce, production, and agriculture. However, more than 90% of energy resources
are used to meet household energy needs (Best 1992, Hill et al. 1995 ) and energy
consumption is ine(cid:141) cient causing economic hardship, environmental degradation,
and health problems (Adhikary 1988 ). A small improvement in household energy
consumption could, therefore, reduce some of the ill eŒects of ine(cid:141) cient energy use
(Joshi 1988 ). Energy planners have attempted to address these problems by prescrib-
ing the installation of new technologies such as biogas and photovoltaic systems
and the distribution of e(cid:141) cient end-use devices such as e(cid:141) cient fuelwood stoves.

However, in most cases, these broad-brush prescriptions have failed because they
lack systematic planning and spatial information as to rural requirements.

A rural energy plan should focus on smaller regions so that energy demand,
energy supply, and potential for new energy technologies could be assessed with less
di(cid:141) culty (FAO 1990 ). For such micro planning, maps and diagnostic factors can be
combined to provide location speci(cid:142) c energy intervention options (Morse et al.
1984 ). Since geographical information systems (GIS) oŒer opportunities to combine
maps and attributes, one is used to develop a spatial energy information system
(SEIS) in research reported here.

2. GIS and energy information

Energy consumption and supply points are location speci(cid:142) c. Therefore, a GIS
can be used for capture, analysis, and management of energy data. A model that
uses GIS to develop a SEIS is shown in (cid:142) gure 2.

To develop an SEIS, spatial information such as land use and resources need to
be collated. Supplementary data may be collected by a rapid rural appraisal; a
methodology which has been shown to be eŒective in collecting data pertaining to
rural livelihood by (Conway and McCracken 1990, Preston 1994 ).

The SEIS is divided into two modules ((cid:142) gure 2): 1. The energy resource module
is itself divided into two sub-modules, biomass and non-biomass. A biomass sub-
module consists of information on fuelwood, charcoal, crop residues, animal manure,
and biogas and the non-biomass sub-module consists of information on solar, hydro,
and wind energy potential; 2. The energy demand module is created by adding

energy consumption attributes to the population layer. The use of non-local energy
sources such as kerosene and grid electricity depends upon the energy consumption
pattern. Therefore, these imported energy sources are considered as a part of the
energy demand module.

The energy resource and energy demand modules are overlaid to obtain energy
balance information that shows regions with energy surplus, energy de(cid:142) cit, or energy
balance within the planning area.

3. Study site

A rural area in Nepal was chosen for implementation of the SEIS because of a
perceived need for resource management, as well as data availability, and the
researcher’s familiarity with the location. The study area, Phewatal (lake in Nepali)
watershed, covers about 120 km2 in western Nepal. A lake in the eastern end of the
watershed is the source for irrigation water and power generation and is a popular
tourist destination. As shown in (cid:142) gure 3, there are six village development committees
( VDCs) in the watershed. One VDC may have more than one village (or settlement).
There are more than 100 villages in the watershed and majority of them are in the
northern part.

Continuous population pressure on forests in the watershed has resulted in
livelihood (Rowbotham
increased soil erosion and landslides aŒecting the rural
1995 ). With the current soil erosion rate of about 40 tons haÕ 1 yearÕ 1, the lake will
be (cid:142) lled up with silt in about 70 years compared with a life span of over 450 years
with a sediment load of 10 tons haÕ 1 yearÕ 1 (Impat 1981 ). Fuelwood extraction is
the major cause of forest denudation in the watershed (ARDEC 1984 ) leading to
such a high erosion rate. Therefore, forest management for fuelwood extraction is
necessary.

The maps acquired for the study are shown in table 1. These digitised and stored

using ARC/INFOâ GIS. A preliminary spatial database was produced and a rapid
appraisal was conducted at the site for a month to validate the database, assess
energy consumption, and to understand resource management practices.

During the appraisal, it was found that almost 95% of the energy consumed in
the watershed are used to meet household needs. Therefore, it was decided that only
household energy consumption would be considered for analysis.

The major streams in the watershed are Andheri Khola (stream in Nepali ),
Sidhane Khola, Handi Khola, and Harpan Khola. The (cid:142) rst three streams have
higher slopes in the head waters and gentle slopes downstream and are therefore
suitable for hydropower generation. Andheri Khola, Sidhane Khola, and Handi
Khola join to form Harpan Khola, which is the principle stream. Harpan Khola has
a gentle slope and irrigates cultivated lands in the valley, therefore, it is not considered
for hydropower generation.

The major land use pattern in the watershed is shown in (cid:142) gure 4. Forests, mostly
of hardwood species, cover almost 44% of the watershed. Spatial analysis shows that
about 2% of forest areas have a slope of more than 100%. These areas are considered
to be inaccessible for fuelwood collection in Nepal (DFRS 1999 ). About 25% of the
forest area are protected by the government and are not accessible for fuelwood
collection. Neither of these inaccessible areas are considered for estimation of
fuelwood.

Almost 40% of the watershed area is cultivated. While the Harpan Khola valley
is cultivated with one crop a year, the up lands are cultivated with two to three
crops annually. The cropping intensity is about 250% in uplands and about 150%
in the lowlands (DECORE 1991 ).

Livestock are also important, providing nutrition, organic manure and cash when
sold. Black smithy and gold smithy are also practised in the watershed but charcoal
consumption for these activities is not signi(cid:142) cant.

The distributions of the human and livestock population in diŒerent VDCs are
given in table 2. While data on the human population are essential to assess energy
consumption in each VDC, data on livestock population and households are required
to calculate the availability of animal manure and potential for biogas installation.
A random and multistage sampling of households was done during the appraisal
and energy consumption data were collected for each VDC. Data analysis indicated
an insigni(cid:142) cant variation in the energy consumption pattern among VDCs. Therefore,
a single energy consumption value, shown in table 3, was used for the analysis. The
average per capita household energy consumption in the watershed is 6.13 GJ per
year, of which 85% energy was required for cooking. Fuelwood supplies about 92%
of energy consumption.

Grid electricity is available to almost all households in Sarangkot, Kaskikot,
Pumdi Bhumdi, Chapakot, and a few households in Dhikur Pokhari. However, in
Bhadaure Tamagi, kerosene is the only option for lighting at present. For the purpose
of illustration, an average value of kerosene use is shown for lighting in table 3.
Kerosene is also used for fuelwood kindling throughout the watershed. The per
capita kerosene consumption for kindling is much higher than that for lighting.

Animal manure is not burnt for energy purposes in the watershed, but is used as

organic manure. There are a few biogas plants in the watershed mostly installed
around Harpan Khola valley. Charcoal is used mainly for clothes ironing.

Two hydro turbines are operating (about 5 kW and 10 kW capacity, respectively)
in Handi Khola and Sidhane Khola for grain processing. In addition, a waterwheel
(about 1 kW) operates at Andheri Khola. These sites have potential to generate
electricity. An eŒort to generate 1 kW of wind electricity in Sarangkot was made in
1990, but it did not succeed because of technical problems with the wind turbine
and lack of interest in the extension of grid-electricity in the area.

4. Spatial analysis and results

The spatial model shown in (cid:142) gure 2 was used with the above information to
study patterns of energy resource and consumption in the watershed. In the following
section energy resource and energy demand modules and energy balance information
are discussed.

4.1. Energy resource module

To calculate fuelwood availability, forest sources were disaggregated by forest
density and forest type. Sustainable fuelwood yields parameters for Nepalese forests,
obtained from WECS (1987 ), are shown in table 4. These values were added to forest
information layers to obtain fuelwood intensity of forest areas around the watershed
and to calculate sustainable fuelwood supply.

Based on the above attributes, the spatial distribution of fuelwood density from
diŒerent forests was calculated and mapped to forest patches ((cid:142) gure 5). The total
accessible fuelwood supply in the watershed was found to be about 11 000 tons
yearÕ 1 .

Earlier studies estimated a household’s fuelwood consumption to be between 378
to 875 kg personÕ 1 yearÕ 1 (DSCWM 1980, DECORE 1991 ). However, several
measurements carried out in the watershed during the appraisal in 1996 revealed
that the average fuelwood consumption is about 340 kg personÕ 1 yrÕ 1, which is
used to calculate demand in this paper. The fuelwood supply based on the sustainable
yield is compared with demand based on this value of household demand to calculate
surplus de(cid:142) cit per VDC (table 5). Data clearly indicate that if sustainable fuelwood
yield were managed on a VDC basis, only three VDCs would have fuelwood de(cid:142) cit.
However, if fuelwood supply was managed and fuelwood were allowed to be trans-
ferred from one VDC to another, then there would be net fuelwood surplus, and
therefore, no forest encroachment for fuelwood.

The cultivated land was disaggregated to calculate the availability of crop residues
in the watershed. Although the total cultivated area in the watershed is only about
4600 ha, the total cropped area is more than 9600 ha, due to the higher cropping
intensity in the watershed.

The type of crops cultivated in the watershed and their yield in diŒerent types
of land (for example, slope, valley, or terrace), the ratio of crop residues that are
used for fodder were obtained from Decore (1991 ), which estimates that about 50%
of paddy residues, 80% of maize residues, 90% of wheat residues, and 50% of millet
residues are currently used as fodder. Based on the above information, a crop residue
intensity map was developed. The result presented in table 6 shows that only about
20% of total crop residues could be used for energy in the watershed.

WECS (1994 ) estimates that about 55% of animal manure produced in Nepal
can be collected and used. Assuming this ratio for the collection of animal manure
in the watershed, about 10 000 tons of dry animal manure would be available each
year in the watershed (table 7). As there is no practice of burning animal manure in
the area, only the potential for biogas installations is considered here.

Three factors were considered for evaluating the number of potential biogas
plants —at least four large livestock per household to install a family sized biogas
plant, water availability in the immediate area (to reduce water collection time for
operating the biogas plant) and the average annual temperature of about 20ß C. The
watershed areas below 1 000 m met the criteria for water and temperature and were
chosen for further examination. The spatial analysis showed that one village in each
of Dhikur Pokhari and Kaskikot, two in Bhadaure Tamagi, eleven in Chapakot,
three in Pumdi Bhumdi, and four in Sarangkot were suitable for biogas installations

and these are shown in (cid:142) gure 6. This type of location-speci(cid:142) c information helps in
the form of better plans for biogas installation.

The analysis suggests that more than 140 biogas plants of 10 m3 capacity (an
average family-size biogas plant), could be installed. The average annual biogas
production and potential savings in fuelwood consumption with biogas in diŒerent
VDCs are given in table 8. Such savings are signi(cid:142) cant in the longer term.

The possibility of electricity generation was examined by basin analysis. The
analysis showed that only three basins in the watershed (Andheri Khola, Sidhane
Khola, and Handi Khola) are larger than (cid:142) ve square kilometres. During the appraisal,
it was found that these were the only non-seasonal streams in the watershed.
Therefore, minimum water(cid:143) ow in each of these streams were measured at (cid:142) ve
diŒerent locations along the streams and the potential sites for electricity generation
were located ((cid:142) gure 7). Since the scale of electricity generation is not large, these
two parameters are considered to be enough for the identi(cid:142) cation of potential
electricity generation.

The electricity potentially available from three hydropower sites is given in
table 9. Since grid based electricity is accessible in Chapakot, electricity generated in
Handi Khola could be distributed to nearby households in Bhadaure Tamagi. The
energy values shown in table 9 incorporates all transmission and distribution losses.
The lowest monthly solar radiation on a horizontal surface at Pokhara and
Lumle (two sites close to the watershed ) are between 315 W mÕ 2 and 344 W mÕ 2
(WECS 1984 ). As a worst case scenario, it was assumed that a minimum of 315 W/m2
of solar radiation falls on a horizontal surface in the watershed. However, for the
optimum absorption of solar energy, the surface should be inclined to an angle equal
to the latitude of the site. The energy conversion charts provided by Du(cid:141) e and
Beckman (1980, (cid:142) gures 1.7.1a to 1.7.1e pp. 19–21) were used to convert solar absorp-
tion on the horizontal surface to an inclined surface for a given latitude. Based on
the charts, the worst case optimum solar absorption in the watershed was estimated
as 440 WmÕ 2. For a day length of 10 hours, the average energy absorbed by an
inclined surface would be about 4.5 kWh mÕ 2-day or 6.8 GJ mÕ 2 yearÕ 1 .

Solar energy can be used for either water heating or photovoltaic-based electricity
generation. Since there was a very limited demand for water heating, only photovol-
taic-based electricity generation was considered. Stout et al. (1979 ) suggest that an
11% conversion e(cid:141) ciency and an 85% inverter e(cid:141) ciency (converting from direct
current to alternating current ) are most realistic in PV applications. The e(cid:141) ciency
of energy storage batteries and the battery control unit are assumed to be 70% and
the e(cid:141) ciency of distribution as 75%. This assumption reduced the deliverable solar

energy to 0.28 GJ mÕ 2 yearÕ 1. That is, the overall e(cid:141) ciency of converting solar
energy to electricity and distributing it to the consumer was only about 5%.

To identify sites for the installation of a photovoltaic system, it was assumed that
the site should be in barren land (to avoid land use con(cid:143) ict), have a gentle slope
(5–10%) and be south facing. To reduce the transmission losses,
it was further
assumed that the site should be located within 500 m of a settlement. Spatial analysis
with the above assumptions showed 11 sites suitable for solar-based electricity
generation. The spatial distribution of selected sites and electricity potential are given
in (cid:142) gure 8.

Table 10 shows the potential electricity generation and the number of potential
households that could use photovoltaic-based electricity. The use of solar electricity

can reduce the electricity load in the grid. The analysis showed no solar potential in
Pumdi Bhumdi because no barren land was available within 500 metre of the
settlements.

4.2. Energy demand module

To obtain an energy demand estimates, the energy demand attributes were added
to the population layer. Energy demand information was obtained for each fuel so
that it could be matched with energy resource layers. In the proposed SEIS, energy
demand information can be evaluated by fuel and end-uses. A map of energy demand
is given in (cid:142) gure 9.

Information on energy consumption by fuel type and by end-uses is also given
in tables 11 and 12. As seen from the tables, the energy consumption in Dhikur
Pokhari is the highest and that in Pumdi Bhumdi is the lowest. Also, because of
fuelwood kindling, the consumption of kerosene is large in all VDCs.

4.3. Energy balance information

Energy balance information was obtained by (cid:142) rst developing an energy resources
potential map and then overlaying the potential map on the energy demand map.
The total energy balance thus obtained is shown in (cid:142) gure 10. Such maps could be
drawn for each fuel type. Figure 10 shows that all of the VDCs are in energy surplus,
meaning that if interfuel substitution was technically and economically feasible and
if all energy resources could be e(cid:141) ciently distributed and used then the watershed
would have a self supporting energy system.

The energy balance information based on best energy use practices is shown in
table 13, which indicates that the northern VDCs have a large fuelwood de(cid:142) cit. This
could lead to the conclusion that either the forest areas in these VDCs are being
encroached upon for fuelwood, or there is an unrecorded cross-VDC (cid:143) ow of fuelwood
from the southern VDCs to the northern VDCs. Having examined this, energy
planners could develop plans to reduce fuelwood consumption to sustainable limits.
This could be done by either transporting fuelwood from the southern VDCs to the
northern VDCs, or installing e(cid:141) cient fuelwood stoves and biogas plants. Since more
than 95% of surveyed households in these VDCs use traditional fuelwood stoves,
installation and use of e(cid:141) cient fuelwood stoves can save as much as half of current
fuelwood consumption in the watershed.

The data show that even if all the hydropower and PV potentials in the watershed

electricity demand is to be met in the watershed, either more photovoltaic systems

should be installed or the electricity grid should be extended. The net electricity and
kerosene supply are in de(cid:142) cit because they are imported into the watershed.

Biogas installation alone in three northern VDCs can reduce fuelwood require-
ments by more than 90 tons each year. A plan could be devised to attract more
people to install biogas in these VDCs. In the southern VDCs, however, the proximity
of the households to the forests, and hence the ease of access to fuelwood, impedes
an enthusiastic response to biogas installation.

5. Conclusions

The example presented here, employs three levels of spatial analysis. First at the
watershed level forest areas were disaggregated from major landuse patterns. Second,
the energy situation such as fuelwood supply demand in each VDC was studied.
Third, at the local level, potential sites for biogas and solar PV installations were
identi(cid:142) ed. Although the area considered here is very small, it is expected that the
spatial analysis methodology can be seamlessly transferred to larger areas.

This paper shows that a spatial energy information system is one of the better
ways to develop a location speci(cid:142) c energy resource and consumption pro(cid:142) le. A
spatial analysis helps in locating potential sites for energy generation such as biogas,
hydro, and solar. Such information is helpful in identifying location speci(cid:142) c energy
programs. For example, by knowing VDCs with fuelwood de(cid:142) cit, authorities can
initiate or encourage energy conservation and fuel substitution programs targeted
to those VDCs.

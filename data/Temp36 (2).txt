Abstract A rock fall occurs when a fragment of rock is detached from a cliff and travels down-
slope at high speed. Rock falls are a constant hazard in mountainous regions and pose a
significant threat to the population. In this paper, a comparison of software designed to model
rock falls is presented. The computer codes selected for the experiment are STONE and
RocFall®. STONE is a research code for the 3-dimensional simulation of rock falls. RocFall® is
commercial software widely used for the 2-dimensional simulation of rock falls along user
defined topographic profiles. The two computer programs require similar input and provide
comparable outputs, allowing for a quantitative evaluation of their modelling results. To
compare the software, the Monte Salta rock fall, in northern Italy, was selected. Specific tests
were designed to compare the ability of the software to predict the maximum travel distance of
the falling boulders, and the distance from the ground of the computed rock fall trajectories.
Results indicate that the two rock fall modelling codes provide similar—but not identical—
results. In general, STONE computes higher and longer rock fall trajectories than RocFall®, and
allows identifying a larger area as potentially affected by falling boulders.

1 Introduction

A rock fall is a very fast mass movement that occurs when a fragment of rock (a block) is
detached from a nearly vertical cliff, and travels down-slope by bouncing, flying and rolling

[5, 9, 34]. Rock falls represent a constant hazard in mountainous regions worldwide, and
pose a severe threat to structures, the infrastructure, and the population [6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17,
20, 27, 34]. Investigators have long attempted empirical and mathematical modelling of
rock falls, and estimates of rock fall hazards and of the associated risk [3, 13, 18, 24, 33].
Several computer programs are available to model the behaviour of rock falls [2, 4, 8, 11,
15, 16, 19, 21–23, 25, 30, 31]. These programs adopt different strategies (e.g., lumped
mass, rigid body, hybrid, kinematics modelling) to model rock falls in 2- and 3-dimensional
schemes. It is not the scope of our work to discuss the different approaches used to model
rock falls, or to compare the results of multiple models. In this paper we limit to comparing
RocFall®, a widely adopted 2-dimensional, hybrid rock fall code [28, 29], to STONE a 3-
dimensional research code developed jointly by the Italian National Research Council and
the University of Milano Bicocca [11]. The two modelling software were selected because
they adopt similar strategies to model rock falls (an hybrid approach for RocFall® and a
lumped mass approach for STONE), and they differ in their geometrical approaches (a 2-D
approach for RocFall® and a 3-D approach for STONE). The comparison aims at outlining
advantages and limitations of 2-D versus the 3-D modelling of rock falls. Furthermore, our
comparison aims at testing the ability of the two modelling software to provide information
useful for rock fall hazard assessment and risk evaluation. For the purpose, the maximum
travel distance of individual rock falls, and the vertical distance to the ground of the
computed rock fall trajectories (rock fall bounce height) are compared.

2 Setting

To compare the two modelling software, the Monte Salta rock fall was selected (Fig. 1).

The rock fall is located along the northern side of the Vajont valley, at the border
between the Veneto and the Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions in northern Italy. The mass
movement originates from the uppermost part of the southern slope of Monte Salta, at an
elevation of about 1,500 m a.s.l. The landslide deposit is the result of multiple landslide
events and covers an area of about 5×105 m2 between 1,250 and 850 m of elevation, for an
estimated total landslide volume of 2.5×106 m3.

The source area of the rock fall is controlled by the presence of the Monte Borgà
regional thrust that superimposes the Vajont Limestone Fm., Jurassic in age, on the Scaglia
Rossa Fm., Cretaceous in age [10, 20]. Emplacement of the thrust sheared the rock and
produced a highly fractured rock mass. Above the thrust zone, folded and fractured bedding
dips steeply toward the slope free-face, producing instability conditions prone to rock falls.
Field surveys conducted in the landslide source area revealed unstable prismatic rock
blocks with individual volumes exceeding 1×103 m3 (Fig. 2). The unstable rock blocks are
separated by fractures up to 2 m wide and 15 m deep. Field mapping of the fractures
allowed identifying two main fracture systems striking N30 and N110, respectively.

Analysis of the unstable rock blocks, of the attitude of the fracture systems in the
landslide source area, and of topography along the rock cliff, the rock fall deposit and the
neighbouring slopes, allowed identifying two main rock fall hazard scenarios. The first
scenario consists of individual or multiple blocks detached from the landslide source areas
and reaching the village of Casso, located at an elevation of about 950 m a.s.l. The second
scenario consists of rock blocks detached from the same landslide source areas and reaching
the secondary road connecting Casso to State Road SS 251 (Fig. 1).

The identified scenarios are supported by information on historical rock falls. The
eastern part of the village of Casso is built on an ancient rock fall deposit of unknown age.

A quarry was opened to the east of Casso to exploit the landslide materials for construction
purposes and to obtain a retaining zone to protect the village from the falling boulders. The
first known rock fall event in the study area occurred in 1674. In the 1960s, large boulders
reached the secondary road connecting Casso to SS 251. Since 1990, minor rock falls were
reported repeatedly down slope from the quarry and in the vicinity of the village. The last
reported rock fall event occurred in 2001, when five blocks detached from the Scaglia
Rossa Fm. cropping out above the village of Casso, fell for about 300 m from 1,050 m a.s.l,
and reached the outskirt of the village.

3 Available data

For the study area, information available for rock fall modelling includes:

1. Topographic base maps, at 1:5,000 scale, used to perform the field mapping and to

prepare a detailed digital representation of the topographic surface.

2. Black and white (1996) and colour (2001) ortho-photographic maps, at 1:10,000 scale,
used as an aid during field mapping, and to portray and visually test the results of the
rock fall modelling.

3. Seven sets of stereoscopic aerial photographs taken in the 46-year period from 1954 to
1999 at scales ranging from 1:15,000 to 1:33,000. The photographs were used to locate

4. A map showing the location of the rock fall source areas, at 1:5,000 scale. The rock

6. A map showing the estimated average grain size of the surface deposits. The map, at
1:5,000 scale, was prepared through field mapping and the interpretation of large scale,
stereoscopic aerial photographs.

7. A 5×5 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) prepared by linear interpolation of elevation
information shown by 5-m contour lines obtained from the available topographic maps
at 1:5,000 scale. To improve the representation of the terrain roughness, chiefly where
debris deposits—including the ancient rock fall deposit (Fig. 1)—are present, a 1×1 m
DEM was obtained resampling the 5×5 m DEM and adding a random noise to the
elevation data. Selection of the “height” for the random noise was based on the
estimated roughness of the surface deposits (Fig. 3).

8. Parameters controlling the loss of energy at impact points and where boulders are
rolling, obtained by re-coding the maps showing surface geology and the estimated
average grain size of the surface deposits.

4 STONE model

First, the computer program STONE was used to investigate the Monte Salta rock fall.
STONE is physically based software capable of modelling rock fall processes in three
dimensions [11], and of providing relevant information to ascertain rock fall hazard and risk
[3, 12, 13]. The software adopts a “lumped-mass” approach to model rock falls. The falling
boulder is considered dimensionless (i.e., a point) and a kinematical simulation is
performed. The input data required by STONE include (Table 1): (1) the known or inferred
location of the detachment areas of the rock falls, (2) the number of boulders falling from
each detachment area, (3) the starting velocity and the horizontal starting angle for each
rock fall, (4) a velocity threshold below which the boulder stops, (5) a digital elevation
model used to describe topography, and (6) the coefficients of dynamic rolling friction, and
of normal and tangential energy restitution used to simulate the loss of energy when rolling
and at impact points. STONE copes with the natural variability in the input data by
“launching” a variable number of blocks from each detachment cell, and by varying
randomly the starting horizontal angle, the dynamic rolling friction coefficient, and the
normal and the tangential energy restitution coefficients. The software produces raster maps
portraying, for each DEM cell: (1) the cumulative count of rock fall trajectories that passed
through each cell, (2) statistics of the computed rock fall velocity, and (3) statistics of the
computed rock fall distance from the ground (Fig. 4). The later is the vertical distance
measured at any given point from the computed rock fall trajectory to the underlying
topographic surface.

For the simulation, twelve rock fall source areas were selected (shown in red in Fig. 2),
and fifty boulders were “launched” from each source cell. Five percent variability was
allowed on the input model parameters, to cope with natural variability and uncertainty in
the input data. Information on historical rock fall events that have occurred in the study
area, including rock fall trajectories and the location of single and multiple rock fall
boulders, was used to calibrate the model parameters and to validate the model results.

For the first simulation, a DEM with a cell size of 5×5 m resolution was used. Results
were validated using available historical data and field evidences. The computed rock fall
trajectories were longer than those reported by field surveys. The difference can be
explained by the resolution of the DEM that does not capture fully the roughness of the
topographic surface. To obtain more realistic simulations, the 5×5 m DEM was re-sampled
to a 1×1 m resolution DEM. In the process, a random noise was added to the elevation data
based on the debris cover grain size (Fig. 3). Visual comparison of the map of rock fall
counts obtained by STONE using the modified 1×1 m DEM—a proxy for a map of the
areas potentially affected by rock falls—with the known location of the stopping points of
recent and historical rock falls, confirmed that STONE provided a reasonable spatial
representation for the potential extent of rock falls in the study area.

5 RocFall® model

Next, the computer program RocFall® was used to investigate the Monte Salta rock fall.
RocFall® is a commercial 2-D modelling code designed to assess rock fall hazard [1, 28,
29]. The software performs the rock fall simulation along a user defined topographic
profile, adopting a “hybrid” approach. RocFall® implements a lumped mass approach to
model the flying and the rolling phases of a rock fall, and a rigid body approach to model
the impact of the boulder on the ground. RocFall® requires coefficients for the dynamic
rolling friction, and for the normal and tangential energy restitution to simulate the loss of
energy when rolling and at the impact points (Table 1). To account for uncertainty in the
definition of the input parameters, stochastic variability is used. This is accomplished by
specifying the standard deviation of the model parameters. Along the user defined
topographic profile, RocFall® calculates the rock fall “bounce height” (i.e., the vertical
distance of the rock fall trajectory to the ground), the rock fall velocity and associated
energy, and the location of the rock fall stopping points (called “rock end-points” in
RocFall®). To obtain the rock fall energy from the rock fall velocity, the shape and density
of the falling boulder must be specified. Results of the rock fall modelling, including
statistical distributions for the computed parameters, are shown using graphs and tables.

Rock fall modelling with RocFall® was performed starting from the same twelve source
areas used to perform the simulations with STONE, and using as topographic profiles, the
profiles identified by STONE as those with the larger number of possible rock fall
trajectories, for each source area (e.g., the most likely rock fall paths shown by a dashed
line in Fig. 5a). For model consistency and comparability, the same dynamic friction

coefficient and normal and tangential energy restitution coefficients used by STONE were
used. In addition, the same starting (3.0 m·s−1) and stopping (0.5 m·s−1) velocities used by
STONE were used for the RocFall® simulations. A rock density of 2,500 kg·m−3 was used
to calculate the rock fall energy. This is consistent with the type of rock cropping out in the
source area. Figure 5 shows the model results obtained by RocFall® for one of the twelve
selected source areas (source area #1).

6 Comparison of the rock fall models

The computer programs STONE and RocFall® require similar
inputs and provide
comparable outputs, allowing for a quantitative comparison of their modelling results.
Table 1 shows the input data required and the outputs produced by the software.

First, independent rock fall models for the twelve selected source areas (Fig. 2) were
obtained using STONE. Next, rock fall models were performed with RocFall® along the most
likely rock fall paths identified by STONE for each source area. To compare the models, we
evaluated the location of the rock fall stopping points (i.e., the location of the rock fall
trajectory end-points) and the rock fall vertical distance to the ground, at selected points.
These variables were chosen because they are relevant for rock fall hazard assessment and
risk evaluation, and because they can be checked against field observations and historical
data. Other model outputs, including rock fall velocity, are relevant for rock fall hazard
assessment and risk mitigation but are difficult to validate with field evidences. For this
reason they were not selected for the test.

6.1 Rock fall stopping points

The first test consisted in the comparison of the predicted location of the rock fall stopping
points (“rock end-points”). This test aimed at testing the ability of the software to define the
possible rock fall “invasion” zone, i.e., the area of a slope that can be affected by rock falls.
This is useful information to determine rock fall hazard [12, 13].

Table 2 lists the length of the rock fall trajectories computed by the software for the
twelve individual rock fall source areas, and the differences in length between the computed
trajectories. Inspection of the Table 2 indicates a reasonably good agreement in the location
of the stopping points for the falling boulders. STONE computed longer rock fall
trajectories than RocFall®, for 8 source areas. The difference between the computed rock
fall trajectories averages 4 m, and ranges between 95 m and −90 m, corresponding to
+11.7% and −10.5% of the total length of the individual trajectories.

6.2 Rock fall vertical distance to the ground

The second test consisted of comparing the maximum predicted vertical distance to the
ground for the modelled rock falls. This is important information to design rock fall
retaining structures, including elastic rock fences, used to mitigate rock fall risk [12]. To
compare the vertical distance to the ground, five points were selected along the computed
rock fall trajectories. Table 3 lists the result for five individual points randomly selected
along the rock fall trajectories computed for four of the source areas (#1, #5, #8, and #10 in
Fig. 2). In general, the rock fall trajectories computed by STONE are higher than the
corresponding rock fall trajectories computed by RocFall® (source areas #5, #8, and #10 in
Table 3). However, in places the rock fall trajectories computed by RocFall® are higher

than the corresponding rock fall
trajectories computed by STONE. The differences
highlight the natural variability of rock fall phenomena, they may be the result of the local
topography captured by the 1×1 m DEM used by STONE, and a consequences of the
different approaches adopted by the computer codes to model the loss of energy at impact
points and where boulders are rolling.

To further analyze the pattern of the rock fall trajectories computed by STONE, the frequency
distributions of the computed vertical distance to the ground were obtained at selected points
(Fig. 6). Histograms in Fig. 6 show the frequency distribution of the computed rock fall
vertical distance to the ground, in five classes. Limits for the first two classes were selected
considering engineering constraints in the design of rock fall retaining elastic barriers.
Inspection of the histograms reveals that, at the selected measuring points, an average of about
the 87% of the computed rock fall trajectories have a vertical distance to the ground lower
than 6 m, and the 76% have a vertical distance to the ground lower than 3 m (with a pick of
98.72 % on Source area #10). This is important information because it shows that rock fall
risk can be significantly reduced in the study area by adopting adequate mitigation measures.
The histograms also show that a (small) proportion of the modelled rock falls have a vertical
distance to the ground that exceeds 10 m. These rock falls are difficult—or impossible—to
stop using elastic rock fences or rock walls. The latter conclusion implies that—based on the

available simulations—a level of residual risk will remain in the study area even if passive
defensive measures (e.g., elastic rock fences) are installed.

7 Concluding remarks

In this work, we compared rock fall models produced by two computer codes: RocFall® a
widely used, hybrid 2-dimensional software, and STONE a lumped mass, 3-dimensional
research code. For the comparison, the Monte Salta rock fall, in northern Italy, was selected
because of the abundance of geological, topographic and historical data. The comparison
outlined the differences and similarities between the two modelling software. In general,
STONE computed higher and longer rock fall trajectories, outlining a larger area potentially
subject to rock fall hazard. With this respect, a rock fall hazard and risk zonation based on
the results of STONE is more conservative (i.e., it includes a larger area) than the zonation
based on the results of RocFall®. Detailed analysis of the frequency distribution of the rock
fall bouncing heights (i.e., the vertical distance between the rock fall trajectory and the
topographic surface) obtained by STONE revealed that most of the rock fall trajectories
were within the 3 m from the ground. These rock falls can be contained with appropriate
passive defensive measures, i.e. elastic retaining fences. However, the analysis revealed that
a limited number of rock falls fly higher and cannot be stopped by passive retaining
structures. We conclude that a level of residual rock fall risk will remain in the study area,
even if passive defensive measure are installed.

STONE, due to its 3-dimensional nature, is capable of tracking a rock fall along a slope
based on a digital description of topography. This is a major advantage, as it eliminates the
subjectivity inherent in the selection of the location of the topographic profiles required by
RocFall®. On the other hand, the use of RocFall® is simple and straightforward when
compared to STONE, and does not require the time consuming geographical operation
needed to prepare the input data used by STONE. We conclude that RocFall® is preferable
where the rock fall problem is simple and well defined, where the study area is of limited
extent, and where a digital representation of the topography (i.e., DEM) is not available.
Conversely, STONE is preferable where large areas have to be investigated, where rock
falls originate from multiple source areas, where morphology is complex, and where a
DEM is available.

Results of our study allow for considerations on the role of the DEM resolution on rock
fall modelling. For the Monte Salta rock fall, two DEM were available: a 5×5 m DEM
obtained from 5 m contour lines shown in 1:5,000 scale topographic maps, and a 1×1 m
DEM obtained resampling the 5×5 m DEM adding random noise to the elevation data
based on topographic surface roughness. Rock fall modelling prepared using the higher
resolution DEM provided results in better agreement with field observations and
information on historical rock falls, than the corresponding models prepared using the
coarser resolution DEM. We conclude that when short-range roughness of the topographic
surface is significant and it controls the behaviour of rock fall trajectories locally, a detailed
representation of the topographic surface is required to successfully model rock falls. The
detailed representation of the topographic surface can be obtained “stochastically”, by
adding noise to the available elevation data, or can be obtained directly, e.g. from a high
resolution Lidar survey.

Abstract. This paper describes an application of fuzzy set theory to perform
temporal interpolation in a raster GIS database. Speci(cid:142) c fuzzy membership func-
tions have been derived to simulate spatial changes between consecutive snapshots
registered in the database. The proposed approach is tested on a very dynamic
rural-urban environment of Montreal Metropolitan area in Quebec, Canada,
covering the period from 1956 to 1986 with a temporal resolution of ten years.
A user friendly software package named FUZZY_TEMP was developed and
integrated in the GRASS4.1 environment in order to perform the implementation
of the developed concepts.

Introduction
In order to accurately analyse dynamic geographic phenomena, it is necessary
to take into account their two basic components: spatial and temporal. Space and
time are a continuo and do not exist without each other. They possess some correlated
properties but also exhibit important di(cid:128) erences. Both are considered unbounded
and can be measured using well de(cid:142) ned units (Snodgrass 1992). However, while
space is three-dimensional and physically perceptible, time is characterized by its
unidirectional continuous (cid:143) ow, in(cid:142) nitely stretching into the past and the future,
which can only be observed through apparent changes of objects and its attributes
occurring in space.

Current GIS have a strong potential for the analysis of dynamic geographical
phenomena. However, because they are inspired by the conventional cartographic
models, time is still often simply represented as an attribute of space (Langran and
Chrisman 1988). In data models currently used, temporal information is stored
through a series of snapshots associated to particular instants in time. Therefore,
information about change that occurred in the interval between two consecutive
snapshots is not directly available. If the interval between the snapshots is too long,
the exact beginning and duration of change that happened during this time interval
is not known. Furthermore, collection of geographical data is often not exerted at
the time when the geographic change had occurred (Langran 1993). As described
by Snodgrass (1992), in the context of a GIS database, there are several de(cid:142) nitions
of time: (1) the real world time when change really occurs, (2) the updating time when

geographical data are recorded, (3) the cartographic time when data products are
released, and (4 ) the database (transaction) time when data are registered into the
database. When the di(cid:128) erence between the real world time and the updated, carto-
graphic or database time is signi(cid:142) cant, essential information about the phenomenon
under investigation may be omitted or misrepresented.

Introducing the temporal dimension into a GIS framework has not yet been fully
accomplished since the paradigm for temporal data representation still remains
unresolved. However, many e(cid:128) orts have been made at the conceptual level to improve
temporal dynamic representation into GISs (Al-Taha and Barrara. 1990, Hazelton
et al. 1992, Langran 1992, Edwards et al. 1993, Peuquet 1994, Claramunt and
Theriault 1995 ). In the raster model considered in this paper, one of the approaches
intended to enhance the temporal representation in GIS databases is the event-based
approach presented in Peuquet and Duan. (1995). An event is associated with each
change and the corresponding time is then stored in increasing order from the state
at the initial time to the latest recorded change. This approach enables the basic
retrieval tasks related to location in order to facilitate database queries. It can be
e(cid:128) ectively used when a continuous monitoring and recording of events is available.
However, this approach cannot be successfully implemented to study changes which
occurred at speci(cid:142) c time instances that did not correspond to times at data collection
using the conventional sources (topographic and thematic maps, satellite and
airborne data, census data, etc.).

When studying a dynamic phenomenon that happened in the past, one possible
solution to obtaining information associated with change is to apply temporal
interpolation between consecutive snapshots, using an appropriate temporal reso-
lution, to simulate the change that occurred in the interval. In this paper, an approach
based on fuzzy set theory is proposed to generate new data layers at times inter-
mediate to already existing data layers. Fuzzy membership functions are developed
to build di(cid:128) erent possible scenarios when some event/change had appeared between
two snapshots registered in the database. It is also possible to introduce information
related to the exact timing of change of a particular object in the database when it
is available from other sources. The proposed approach, tested on the rural-urban
fringe of the Montreal Metropolitan area, brings the following bene(cid:142) ts:

1. Estimates the information in intermediate time periods at a chosen temporal

2. Allows the user to create di(cid:128) erent scenarios based on a choice of membership

3. Considers the time for cartographic updates;
4. Considers the cartographic errors between two snapshots in a database;
5. Adds an object appearing at a particular moment in time to the intermediate

fuzzy layer.

2. The fuzzy set theory

According to crisp set theory, when trying to manage land-use classi(cid:142) cation
problems, an abrupt boundary exists between geographical classes. A geographical
entity fully belongs to one class, and is totally out of another class. The inclusion or
exclusion of an entity within the class is usually decided based on some chosen
criterion. However, an appropriate criterion is not always easy to de(cid:142) ne and often
the theory of probability may be employed (Burrough and Frank 1995 ). There is no

227

overlap between class memberships and often the results of such strict Boolean logic
impose unrealistic preciseness in classi(cid:142) cation and change analysis (Hall et al. 1992,
Heuvelnik and Burrough, 1993).

The fuzzy set theory as described by Zadeh (1965, 1978 ) was proposed to extend
crisp set theory in order to deal with continuous classi(cid:142) cations. This approach has
been mainly applied in geography on problems related to soil classi(cid:142) cation and
de(cid:142) nition of boundaries between soil classes (Burrough 1989, Kollias and Voliotis
1991, Banai 1993, Davidson et al. 1994). The fuzzy aspect of boundaries in geographic
space (Mark and Csillag 1989, Wang and Hall 1996) and its relation to change in
time is now fully recognized and fuzzy logic has been recommended as a means of
tackling this problem in current GIS (NCGIA 1994). In this paper, a new approach
to manage time based on a fuzzy logic methodology is outlined. The following
section describes the basic concepts and de(cid:142) nitions related to fuzzy logic and its
linkage with GIS databases.

The raster GIS data model is based on the notion of a cell, a smallest space
entity, to associate the geographical information with spatial co-ordinates. A cell
can be mathematically described as an element of a large matrix, usually called a
layer, used to model a complex geographical region. Therefore, a cell is characterized
in a GIS by four attributes, namely, row and column co-ordinates, a thematic value
and the description of its category content. The thematic value identi(cid:142) es the geo-
graphical entity that is modelled, e.g. forest, agricultural or urban area. A time
component is brought into the spatial raster database through de(cid:142) ning a set of
layers for the same geographical region but for di(cid:128) erent time periods. Therefore, a
particular cell belonging to one layer which characterizes a speci(cid:142) c time period may
contain a di(cid:128) erent value in a layer describing another time period ((cid:142) gure 1). This
implies that the geographical item changes with time (e.g. in 1965 it was forest and
in 1977 urban land use is found at the same location).

Thus, given two layers captured at two time instants, t1 and t2, the completion
of temporal information would consist of creating a set of new layers in order to
describe the change of geographical entities between times t1 and t2. The simplest
way of doing this is through direct comparison of values contained in the correspond-
ing cells at given periods to check if the change occurred. The following outcomes
are possible:

1. If the value in the cell examined is the same for both layers (t1 and t2), the
conclusion is that for any time period ti between t1 and t2 the value in that
cell would stay unchanged with the highest possibility of 100% or 1.0 degree
of belonging ((cid:142) gure 1—Case I).

2. If the value in the cell examined is di(cid:128) erent at t1 and t2, it could be concluded
that the geographical entity had changed between these two snapshots. The
main problem here consists of determining the possible time when the change
really occurred thereby permitting the creation of new fuzzy layers ((cid:142) gure 1—
Case II).

The fuzzy logic approach was developed to tackle the problem described in (2 ).
The values in a given cell at given time periods t1 and t2 indicate 100% or 1.0 full
membership to a speci(cid:142) c geographical class. A class represents a particular geograph-
ical entity such as forest, urban or agricultural land. Therefore, if it were possible to
construct a function that can be used to perform the calculation of the degree of
belonging for a given element, the problem of classifying elements into the appropriate

sets would be signi(cid:142) cantly simpli(cid:142) ed. Fuzzy logic theory suggests such an approach
where the so-called fuzzy functions could be used to evaluate the membership grade.
A membership function is developed to estimate the possible change of a geo-
graphical entity between two time snapshots for any pair of classes ((cid:142) gure 2).
Membership functions are conceived based on the realistic speed and timing of a
particular change appearing from class A to class B. This model thereby allows the
estimation of a possible type and possible moment in time when the geographical
change between two well established states had occurred.

Consider a set T that contains the set of n elements ti which represent di(cid:128) erent
moments in time. In order to determine a level of membership of an element of T
in a speci(cid:142) c subset A of T representing a geographical class, the following relations
are used:

mA (ti)= G

1 if ti ×A
0 if ti 1 A

(1)

where mA(ti) is the characteristic function used to calculate the degree of membership
between two extremes states (0 and 1) (Dubois and Prade 1980 ).

In the case where the set {0, 1} is possible to de(cid:142) ne as the real interval [0, 1],
the subset A of T represents the fuzzy set and the function establishes mA (ti), the

grade of membership of an element in a geographical class A for the moment ti. The
closer the value of mA(ti) is to 1, the higher the degree of membership of the element
in the subset A. Therefore, A is a subset of T that has no sharp boundary. For
example if T denotes a (cid:142) nite set {t1, ..., tn}, a fuzzy set could be expressed with the
usual notation (Zadeh 1972) and is as follows:

A = mA(t

)/t
1

+ ´´´ +mA(tn)/tn = (cid:158)

mA (ti)/ti

n

i= 1

However, if T is not (cid:142) nite it is possible to write:

(2)

(3)

A = PA

mA(t)/t

A fuzzy subset of a geographical class A describes vagueness in the subset’s
boundary region that is not re(cid:143) ected by the crisp subset. This is accomplished by
transferring the original values to some real value on a continuous scale from 0 to
1 which indicates the relative membership grade of the set in question.

Instead of having only two extreme truth values: absolutely true =1 and absolutely
false = 0, all other values between 0 and 1 are also considered and used to model a
relative membership grade (Hootsmans 1996). For example, the value of 0.3 would
mean that the considered element would have 30% possibility or 0.3 degree belonging
to the set. Such a representation allows expression of gradual transition between
two extremes like truth and falsehood used in a Boolean logic approach.

One example of a generic fuzzy membership function is presented in (cid:142) gure 2.

Thus, at the time t1 the value in the cell considered indicates the 100% or 1.0
membership to the geographical class A while the value in the same cell at the time
t2 indicates the 100% or 1.0 degree of belonging to the class B. As shown in (cid:142) gure 2,
the function is piece-wise linear i.e. the points corresponding to temporal interpola-
tion intervals [0, 10] are connected by linear segments with annual temporal reso-
lution. The new intermediate layer is created at time t1i on the basis of membership
grade according to fuzzy functions A and B which are not necessarily complementary:

(5)

A = (cid:158)

n

I= 1

mA (ti)/tI

and

B = (cid:158)

n

i= 1

mB(ti)/ti

One example of how these functions can be used to estimate the change of a

geographical entity is as follows:

A = {1.0/t

1.0

, 1.0/t1.1, 0.8/t1.2, 0.7/t1.3, 0.3/t1.4, 0.3/t1.5, 0.2/t1.6, 0.1/t1.7,

B ={0.0/t1.0, 0.0/t1.1, 0.2/t1.2, 0.3/t1.3, 0.6/t1.4, 0.7/t1.5, 0.7/t1.6, 0.8/t1.7,

0.1/t1.8, 0.0/t1.9, 0.0/t2.0}

0.9/t1.8, 1.0/t1.9, 1.0/t2.0}

Let the objective be to determine the cell value at the moment t1.7 corresponding
to the seventh year after time t1. Using the function illustrated in (cid:142) gure 2, the degrees
of possibility of belonging to geographical classes A and B are 0.1 and 0.8, respectively.
This information is then used to derive the thematic value that is then put in the
considered cell for the instant t1.7. Each de(cid:142) ned thematic value matches one particular
category content that carries the values assigned to two degrees of membership. The
thematic value obtained must be di(cid:128) erent for each possible combination of degrees
of belonging for any pair of classes considered. For example, the thematic value
calculated for (0.1, 0.8) degrees related to classes A and B must be di(cid:128) erent from the
thematic value obtained for (0.2, 0.6) degrees of membership to some other classes
C and D or A and D. There are basically two approaches to meet this condition.
The (cid:142) rst method consists of developing a mathematical formula to calculate the
thematic value in such a way as to ensure the uniqueness of the calculated result for
each pair of classes and each combination of membership grades. The other approach
is to let the user adopt a new thematic value for any new membership combination.
The latter approach has been adopted in this study. The most important task is to
(cid:142) ll the database, layer by layer, with the fuzzy category contents associated with
each cell value in question. Thus, for the time t1.7, according to membership functions
used in the example shown in (cid:142) gure 2, the cell is in transition from class A to class
B with possible degrees of belonging of 0.1 to class A and 0.8 to class B. The category
contents associated with a particular cell in the intermediate layer is therefore
%A(cid:129) B, possibly 0.1/A +0.8/B&.

3. Methodology

The fuzzy logic approach proposed in this paper was applied to study the
evolution of the North Shore of the Montreal Metropolitan area in Que´bec, Canada,
covering a surface of 1320 km2 ((cid:142) gure 3). This area was radically transformed during
the last forty years due to considerable and fast expansion of urban population. One
consequence is the loss of natural vegetation and agricultural lands to the bene(cid:142) t of
residential and commercial developments. The related issues of concentration of

human population and constant urban expansion are beginning to be fully recognized
as a signi(cid:142) cant global problem (Acevedo et al. 1996) and tools like GIS can play an
important role in order to better understand these dynamic geographical phenomena
(Marceau et al. 1995 ).

The main source of data used to create a raster database is topographic maps
produced by the Survey and Mapping Branch of the Department of Energy, Mines
and Resources, Canada at the scale 1:50 000, UTM projection zone 18 and NAD27.
Thirty-two maps corresponding to the years 1956, 1966, 1976 and 1986 were digitized
using the MapInfo3.0 desktop mapping software. These digitized data were incorpor-
ated in the GRASS4.1 geo-referenced raster database with a (cid:142) nal spatial resolution
of 10 m. Major land-use classes were de(cid:142) ned on each snapshot layer as follows:
urban area, forested area, agricultural land, principal road network, hydrography,
airport, national park and Indian reserve.

A set of new routines was developed using C programming language in order to
implement the fuzzy logic approach to model temporal information in GIS. These
C functions perform the following tasks:

(1) Calculation of degrees of membership. These routines contain encoded de(cid:142) ni-
tions of the fuzzy membership functions derived. All principal land-use classes
are considered for the development of these functions.

(2) Calculation of the category content. These functions encompass a set of rules
that are processed when assigning the corresponding category content. Given

S. Dragicevic and D. J. Marceau

the thematic value as an input, the appropriate rule is used to yield the
resulting category content that includes fuzzy membership degrees and the
corresponding transition.

The above mentioned new routines are grouped into a module named
FUZZY_TEMP and integrated into the GRASS4.1 environment which is user
friendly and possesses various powerful facilities for manipulating and analysing
geographical information. The basic functions and the advantage s of this module
are now discussed in more detail.

3.1. Generation of intermediate fuzzy layers

The de(cid:142) nition of membership functions is a very important issue while working
with fuzzy sets (Zadeh 1965). They should (cid:142) t the problem at hand and be easy to
calculate (Dombi 1990). They can also be the result of a subjective process, but
should not be arbitrary (Burrough 1989 ). By changing the function parameters, the
results obtained can lead to di(cid:128) erent outcomes (Hootsmans 1996 ). There are two
basic methods for building membership functions: the similarity relation model and
the semantic import model (Robinson, 1988). The (cid:142) rst one is a data-driven approach
where clustering of data determines the de(cid:142) nition of subsets and membership func-
tions. If an object belongs to a subset it cannot be a member of any other subset
(McBratney and de Gruijter 1992).

The second model is characterized by the fact that only expert knowledge can
provide a reasonable assignment of membership grades which describe discriminating
criteria according to the theoretical or empirical evidence (Hootsmans 1996 ). In this
study, fuzzy membership functions are conceived on the basis of this model and
without direct reference to the data values. Only lower and upper boundary values
for each class have to be de(cid:142) ned. The functions are usually asymmetric in order to
describe the smooth temporal transition from one class to another. The values of
membership grades are derived by the user as a result of consultation with experts,
and the realistic estimates of time needed for various transitions to be accomplished
were considered. These functions were developed for all possible combinations of
transitions among variables. For example, the change from forest to urban area takes
four years; the change from forest to road takes two years; while the transition from
forest to agricultural land requires three years. Transitions which do not seem likely
to be real, such as the transition from urban area to forest or agricultural land are
not considered in this study.

For simplicity, a temporal resolution equal to one year has been chosen as the
most appropriate to enable the modelling of all possible transitions of database
classes. According to the evaluation of possible duration of transitions between the
database cells, a minimum of two years was estimated for more rapid change and is
considered for illustrating the fuzzy-temporal model of land use change. The temporal
resolution of ten years between initial database snapshots is a limiting factor that
did not permit modelling of cyclic and sequential changes.

Using an annual temporal resolution, FUZZY_TEMP generates intermediate
layers through comparison of variables in each cell of two consecutive input snapshot
layers. The comparison is accomplished using the developed fuzzy membership
functions that in turn serve to determine the most accurate degrees of membership
as related to the above two input states.

3.2. T ime for cartographic updates

Through the observation of the topographic maps used in the study, it was found
that there are always a few years of di(cid:128) erence between the time when aerial photo-
graphs are taken and the time when the corresponding maps are printed. The analysis
of the 32 maps used to generate the temporal database showed that the average time
which elapses between the update time and cartographic time is four years. This
re(cid:143) ects the usual cartographic problem of producing maps when the data collection
is spread out in time and change is still in progress when the map is printed. In this
study there is an attempt to handle this problem in a simpli(cid:142) ed manner. The
di(cid:128) erence between update and cartographic time is considered in the development
of the fuzzy functions: there are only six years available for a change to be modelled.
In this way an attempt is made to bring the model of temporal change as close as
possible to the real world and to model a change in the period of time when it
realistically occurred. The updating and cartographic times are thereby introduced
in the temporal database.

3.3. Choice of di(cid:128) erent scenarios

Since the most accurate information related to the exact time when change begins
and how long it progresses are usually unknown, and since the changes of the same
type do not occur at the same time throughout the study region, two extreme possible
scenarios are proposed. They are conceived in order to model di(cid:128) erent change
progressions and assume the earliest and the latest possible beginnings of the change.
Figure 4 depicts the membership functions corresponding to these two scenarios.
They have been developed for all pairs of classes, except when the transition from
the agricultural land to forest is considered ((cid:142) gure 5). Only one scenario is possible
here since this change requires a signi(cid:142) cantly longer period of time. When developing
the fuzzy membership functions, care is taken of the fact that the change starts at
the time corresponding to the previous snapshot layer, and that the last change must
be completed by the time corresponding to the cartographic update.

3.4. Cartographic temporal errors

The usual quality problem of map accuracy could be characterized with errors
in boundary locations, in map geometry and in classi(cid:142) cation (Drummond 1987,
Kiiveri 1997 ). This situation can be explained by the way how urban boundaries
are de(cid:142) ned during the map production. The functional de(cid:142) nition refers to human
activities such as residential, commercial, industrial or recreational, and also depends
on the housing density. The physical de(cid:142) nition states that urban boundaries depend
on the population size and density (Bell et al. 1995 ). Depending on which de(cid:142) nition
is adopted, di(cid:128) erent classi(cid:142) cations of urban land-use can occur on di(cid:128) erent maps.

In addition, some other factors related to the raster data model are also involved.
The (cid:142) rst factor results from positional inconsistency in a series of adjacent maps or
between maps corresponding to di(cid:128) erent time periods. The second factor is the
in(cid:143) uence of map digitizing errors (Youcai and Wenbao 1997), the production of
misclassi(cid:142) cation errors due to vector to raster conversion (Veregin 1989, Knaap
1992, Carver and Brunsdon 1994), and errors arising from raster data manipulations
(Newcomer and Szajgin 1984, Arbia et al. 1998). All these factors have an impact
on the positional accuracy of generated raster database snapshot layers (Dunn et al.
1990, Caspary and Scheuring 1993), and usually they have a tendency to accumulate
(Heuvelnik et al. 1989, Hunter and Goodchild 1993 ). This leads to misregistration

between snapshots that could cause the appearance of vacillating change and (cid:142) nally
to provoke errors in fuzzy temporal modelling.

In the course of creation of the intermediate fuzzy layers, it was found that some
cells corresponding to the urban land registered in an older snapshot layer did not
appear in a more recent layer at the same location. This implies that the urban land
was physically replaced by another land use, such as forestry or agriculture, which
is not likely to happen in reality. This could be explained by the accumulation
and propagation of di(cid:128) erent errors. In this study, when such illogical transitions
of cells are encountered while creating the new intermediate layers in the
database, FUZZY_TEMP warns the user by displaying a category content named
%cartographic error&.

3.5. Updating a database for a known change

In the real world, many entities, such as highways, airports or new residential
areas, get created during the interval between two snapshots registered in the data-
base. Sometimes, information related to the time when these entities appeared can
be available. In that case, it becomes possible to perform an update of the database
by inserting these spatial objects in the layer that corresponds to the year of object
creation. This approach is an attempt to introduce the real world time in the temporal
database.The FUZZY_TEMP program is capable of handling the insertion of such
objects when creating the corresponding intermediate fuzzy layers. In that context,
a special kind of membership function has been developed for handling the following
objects: Mirabel airport opened in 1975, the establishment of the provincial park
Oka in 1962, the Indian reserve in 1976, and the principal highways constructed
during the last 30 years.

Figure. 5. Example of membership function with only one scenario.

The incorporation of the above-mentione d objects into the corresponding fuzzy
layer has an impact on the creation of membership functions. The e(cid:128) ect is mostly
seen as a reduction in the interval for the development of these functions. This is
because the placement of the particular object which appears at a given year in the
corresponding layer sets the known constant cell thematic value and the category
content for this object from that year to the end of the interval. This also implies
that the membership function is developed only for one scenario. Consequently,
FUZZY_TEMP includes a set of special membership functions developed for objects
for which the year of their creation is known.

4. Results

The following section discusses in more detail the results obtained through the
implementation of FUZZY_TEMP in the analysis of urban spread in the North
Shore region of Montreal. To illustrate the results, two sub-sites have been chosen
((cid:142) gure 3) because they exhibit quantitatively signi(cid:142) cant changes during the period
of observation.

The sub-site 1 is centred at 73ß 29¾ W and 45ß 44¾ N and covers an area of 65.72 km2.
It encompasses the municipalities of Charlemagne, Lachinaie, Mascouche, Le
Gardeur and Repentigny, and is used to show the change modelled in the period
between 1976 and 1986 ((cid:142) gure 6(a) and (b)). The resulting map obtained from the
generated intermediate fuzzy layer in year 1977 for the earliest possible scenario is
presented on (cid:142) gure 6(c).

Table 1 contains the detailed description of the transition for each land-use class.
It also provides the description of the category contents for each generated fuzzy
layer for the years 1977, 1978, 1981, 1982, and 1985, considering both scenarios. For
example, FUZZY_TEMP generates the possible change from agricultural to urban
land-use in 1977 with the degrees of belonging of 0.3 to agricultural and 0.7 to urban.
The category content associated for particular cells in this class A(cid:129) U is therefore
%A(cid:129) U, possible 0.3/A +0.7/U&. This answer is obtained for the scenario 1 of the
earliest possible change. On the other hand, if scenario 2 of the latest possible change
is considered, for the same year 1977, transition from agricultural to urban land-use
does not appear yet. The degrees of belonging to agricultural and urban land-use
are still 1.0 and 0.0, respectively. The category content associated for the same classes
A(cid:129) U is therefore %A(cid:129) U, possible 1.0/A +0.0/U&. It can be seen that this change

will take place later, in 1981, and the category content is then %A(cid:129) U, possible
0.3/A +0.7/U&.

The second example, sub-site 2 ((cid:142) gure 3) illustrates the inclusion of Mirabel
airport in the database. This sub-site covers an area of 70.41 km2 and is centred at
74ß 03¾ W and 45ß 41¾ N in the municipality of Mirabel. Figure 7 shows the speci(cid:142) c
fuzzy functions that present transitions from forest and agricultural land to the
airport land-use in the characteristic period between 1966 and 1976. Note that the
transition period for the development of a fuzzy function is less than 10 years since
the Mirabel airport appears in the layer corresponding to the year 1975 when it was
o(cid:129) cially opened.

Figure 8 (a) and (d) represent the snapshot layers in 1966 and 1976. Resulting
maps for the particular intermediate layers corresponding to years 1969 and 1975
are outlined on (cid:142) gure 8(b) and (c), respectively. Table 2 presents the category contents
corresponding to the speci(cid:142) c class transitions which appears in the intermediate
fuzzy layers for the years 1969, 1972, 1973, and 1975. For example, for the transition
from forest to airport land-use, FUZZY_TEMP generates category contents that
show the gradual change appearing during the time needed for the construction of
the airport. For the year 1969 when the construction began, it is %F(cid:129) AP, possible
0.8/F +0.0/AP&. For the year 1973, when the construction is about to (cid:142) nish, the
category content becomes %F(cid:129) AP, possible 0.0/F +0.8/AP&. Finally, at the year
1975, when the airport is o(cid:129) cially opened, the generated category content is
%Mirabel airport&.

5. Conclusion

This paper addresses the problem of modelling time in current raster GIS. The
proposed method based on the fuzzy logic theory enables the generation of inter-
mediate layers in a snapshot database by choosing the most appropriate temporal
resolution for the dynamic phenomenon under investigation. If a very small temporal
resolution is adopted, this methodology could reconcile two di(cid:128) erent de(cid:142) nitions of
time, namely the real world time and its representation in a GIS database. This
di(cid:128) erence is re(cid:143) ected in the fact that the former is continuous while the later still
remains discrete. Such a model could closely simulate the evolution occurring in the
real world given that an optimal temporal resolution is chosen. Consequently, the
database representation of time can approach the real world continuum.

The approach tested in this study o(cid:128) ers a lot of (cid:143) exibility in the development of
fuzzy membership functions which could be conceived based on the user’s experience
as well as through consulting experts in the domain. This may represent a slight
disadvantag e due to the personal judgement that is involved. However, it allows
freedom for developing various scenarios to model di(cid:128) erent evolutions of geograph-
ical phenomena under study. This implies the construction of new fuzzy membership
functions to deal with di(cid:128) erent temporal resolutions than those adopted in this
study. In the case of larger temporal intervals the modelling of cyclical changes that
have a period shorter than the elapsed time between snapshots may be considered.
Sequential changes that could generate an intermediate class between two consecutive

snapshot layers could also be modelled. This approach can be easily generalized and
applied on more complex dynamic phenomena. An extension of this approach
is a fuzzy spatio-tempora l interpolation that takes into account di(cid:128) erent stages of
evolution of the land-use transformation (Dragicevic and Marceau 1999a, 1999b) .

The most signi(cid:142) cant land-use transformation s that took place during the study
period can be instantaneously calculated from intermediate layers without using the
tedious procedures of change-detection analysis and cross tabulation. Another

advantage of this type of temporal database is the great (cid:143) exibility for the application
of spatio-tempora l queries which in turn facilitates the understanding of various
causality relations.

A user-friendly software package named FUZZY_TEMP was developed and
integrated into the GRASS4.1 environment. This software can be successfully applied
to various geographical phenomena and also be easily extended for temporal
extrapolation that can signi(cid:142) cantly facilitate land-use planning tasks.

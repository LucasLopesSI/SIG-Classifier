Abstract. Problems of precision and accuracy in geographical
information
systems have often been undervalued. However, these are important issues when
trying to avoid inaccurate computations that could distort the ﬁnal result. A
method is described for the Transverse Mercator Projection of the ellipsoid to
calculate the necessary number of terms of their series development so that
desired accuracy can be achieved. The ﬁrst part describes one algorithm used to
obtain the full development of the formulas by means of a symbolic calculus
program. The second part studies the inﬂuence of each term in the ﬁnal result in
order to know which terms can be neglected while achieving the desired
precision. Finally, the results are applied to a rectangle of 30‡ width and latitude
varying from 30‡ to 50‡.

Introduction
The emergence of the Transverse Mercator Projection of the ellipsoid as a
projection for topographic mapping began in the nineteenth century. It was very
important in the second half of the twentieth century in military maps, and is now
probably the most important conformal mapping in geodesy. Its mathematical basis
and the formulas for the projection can be found in classical works such as those by
Hotine (1946, 1947a–d), Levallois (1969) and Tardi and Laclave`re (1954). For more
recent and theoretical work, see Grafarend (1995).

Since conformal projections are analytic, they admit a series development.
However, when applied to a geodetic or topographic problem, it is unnecessary to
take all the terms, so that only a few are chosen. How many terms should be
taken? The answer

lies

A second question is related to the structure of the series coefﬁcients, the an
terms. The series expansion shows a deﬁnite tendency for the number of terms in
each an to increase, although the omission of certain smaller terms in the fourth and
higher powers of e, the ﬁrst eccentricity of the ellipsoid,
is of no practical
importance. On the other hand, Redfearn (1948) noted out that if such small terms
are neglected, it might become problematic to cover a zone greater than 6‡ in width

or to try to extend to higher latitudes. The answer here is rather more complicated
and requires a numerical approach.

One of the goals of the present paper is to show for which values of k, ek might
be neglected and to show how many terms one should take into account according
to the width of the zone to be represented. Because of these considerations, it
seemed that a fuller development of the formulas would be worthwhile, although,
as was pointed out above, the number of terms of the coefﬁcients is greatly
increased. This is where symbolic calculus should help. Since the development of
the formulas involves a very complex algebraic expression, computer algebra is a
powerful tool for obtaining the equations for this projection.

Finally, Foote (1999) states:

Until quite recently, people involved in developing and using GIS paid little
attention to the problems caused by error, inaccuracy, and imprecision in spatial
datasets. Certainly there was an awareness that all data suffers from inaccuracy
and imprecision, but the effects on GIS problems and solutions was not
considered in great detail.

Thus lies the second aim of the present paper: how computer algebra systems
would help in solving the problems of precision and accuracy. We have to
distinguish between graphical precision, which is given by the nominal scale of the
map, usually 0.2 mm, and internal precision, which is necessary to make the
calculus. However, in GIS, a map can be shrunk or enlarged at will. One can zoom
in to a square metre or less or zoom out until the screen displays the entire map. In
other words, geographic data in a database do not really have a ‘map scale’.
Since graphical precision is related to the nominal scale of the map and is usually
small, some GIS users and developers do not pay attention to the importance
internal precision will allow
of
development of maps at greater scales even though that may not have been
one’s ﬁrst intention.

2. Basis of the Transverse Mercator Projection

Consider a point with geodetic coordinates (Q, l), where the longitude l is
computed from the central meridian. The isometric latitude, q, is deﬁned as follows

The Transverse Mercator is deﬁned as a conformal, cylindrical transverse

projection. In this case, the two conditions to be met are as follows:

. y-axis should represent a meridian, which is called the central meridian.
. Scale should be true along this meridian.

By using these assumptions, the Northing, y, is the plane coordinate measured
along the central meridian from the origin of the projection, and the Easting, x, is
the distance from the central meridian to this point, reckoned along the geodetic
that passes through the point and is perpendicular to this meridian. To obtain the
basic formulas for Northings and Eastings, equation (5) must be expanded by using
Taylor’s theorem in a series of powers of iDl:

To calculate the rest of the values for an, a recursive form will be used instead of
the usual deﬁnition for an given by equation (7). By using a little calculus the

and with the deﬁnition of dq, equation (10) becomes:

By eliminating M and N with the previous deﬁnition of g, the desired recursive

deﬁnition for the coefﬁcients an, for n§2 is:

The initial value, a1, is given by the original deﬁnition of the an. It is obvious

that for n~1:

the series will not satisfy one of the equations. Moreover, if some values of gk are
neglected, neither of the equations (14) will be satisﬁed.

3. Methods

In summary, these are the problems to be solved:

. Does ek really inﬂuence the value of (x, y), and how?
. If so, how does the inﬂuence vary according to the zone width, Dl, and the

The next steps will be followed:

. Developing the series neglecting ek for different values of k and for different

widths of the zone.

. Studying the inﬂuence of ek for a ﬁxed width Dl and different latitudes.
. Producing the full development of the series for a 30‡-wide zone with an error

4. Development of map projection formulas

To answer the ﬁrst problem formulated above, note that studying the inﬂuence
of the term ek is the same as studying the term gk(Q), since they are related by
equation (2).

The degree is deﬁned as the value of the exponent k, for which gkz2(Q) is
considered to be negligible. The order will be the order of the development. Both
order and degree of the development will be functions of the required precision,
which is normally shown as millimetres in topography and geodesy.

The structure of the equations will now be considered. According to Redfearn
(1948), the expression for an involves not only powers of g(Q), but powers of tan Q
as well, which are also greatly increased with latitude. Under these conditions, he
suggested that the terms in tank Q could not be neglected for higher latitudes. On
the other hand, a more careful inspection of the equations shows that all terms are
multiplied by powers of cos Q, so there are powers of g(Q) sin Q and the latitude
should be no problem. This will be the ﬁrst goal: to determine the inﬂuence of
latitude on the terms an and the inﬂuence of the degree on the precision.

According to the previous deﬁnitions, both the degree and the order of the

classic equations published by Redfearn are eight.

All calculations and plots were made with Mathematica1. The ability of this
program to deal with symbolic expressions allowed us to use it to deﬁne and
simplify the an expressions, which can be used to generate Fortran and C code.

The deﬁnitions for derivatives for N and g(Q) are:

In ½(cid:2) : Nradius0½Q (cid:2) :~

g Q½

1zg Q½
(cid:2):

In ½(cid:2) : g0½Q (cid:2) : ~{g Q½

Also from deﬁnition (12), the terms gk(Q) only appear in the coefﬁcients an, with

n§k/2z2. The deﬁnition of the simpliﬁcation is:

According to (12) and (13) the deﬁnitions for the coefﬁcients are:

With this function, all the coefﬁcients an can be easily generated. For instance,
the instructions for generating a particular coefﬁcient, such as a23, neglecting the
terms g8(Q) are:

In ½(cid:2) : degree~6
In ½(cid:2) : CoefA½23, Q(cid:2):

5. Numerical results

We will calculate the values of all the coefﬁcients up to a40 Dl40, for a different
width zone, (Dl~3‡, 5‡, 10‡, 15‡, 20‡, 25‡, 30‡, 40‡, 50‡, 60‡, 70‡), with different
degrees, up to 20, and for latitude varying from 0‡ to 80‡ in a 10‡ interval. The
calculations were made on the WGS84 ellipsoid (a~6 378 137 m, e2~0.006 694 38).
The ﬁrst step was to calculate the order of magnitude, 10p, of the quantities
involved in the whole process. Table 1 shows the highest of these values for each
coefﬁcient according to the different width zone and for all the latitudes.

In all tables, those values not inﬂuenced by the degree and those v1 mm

(pv23) have been omitted.

Table 1 shows that more than 20 terms are necessary to achieve a 10-m precision
for a 50‡-width zone, so that it will be necessary to take more terms to achieve a
development for wider zones. On the other hand, the inﬂuence of the degree has not
been studied yet, and this is an important issue, because the number of terms of
each coefﬁcient, and hence the computational time to calculate them, increases
rapidly. For example, for a degree equal to 2, the numbers of terms in the
coefﬁcient a20 is 19, while for a degree equal to 20, the number of terms is 100.
Therefore, to avoid calculating unnecessary terms, the ﬁrst approach was to ﬁx a
width zone (Dl~10‡) and to make all the calculus for different degrees and
different latitudes (Q~0‡, 10‡, 20‡, …, 80‡). By way of example, table 2 shows the
values of the coefﬁcients, up to the term n~20, for a ﬁxed latitude (Q~10‡). In
none of the cases can a strong dependence upon the degree be found, even though it
does exist.

Taking into account the previous facts, up to the 90th term of the development

will be calculated, but limiting the degree to 30.

The ﬁrst result is shown in tables 3–7: the number of terms (order) necessary to
achieve a determinate precision according to the width of the zone and the latitude.
Figures 1–3 show, in graphical form, the same relationship for low, medium and

are negligible (v0.001 m).

The same procedure is repeated for the different width zone, but only the results

for 70‡ are shown in ﬁgures 5–9.

Therefore, the ﬁrst conclusion is: the ﬁnal result will be a function of the degree

and is dependent upon the width of the zone to be considered.

According to the plots, for a 10-m precision at 70‡ latitude, it is necessary to
take a degree equal to 6, but the degree must be 14 if a 0.001-m precision is
required.

for a 70‡-width zone.

In all cases, the greatest differences, contrary to Redfearn’s intuition, are found

at low latitudes and not at higher ones.

Table 8 shows the relationship among precision, width zone and degree.

6. Application

These data are now going to be applied to answer the third question. In
practice, few applications, except those for precision surveying and geodesy, need a
precision of v1 m, although it is often used to prevent computer-rounding error
(Clarke 1995). The results will be applied to a rectangle of 30‡ width and the
latitude varying from 30 to 50‡. This rectangle, centred in the 100‡ WG meridian,

would cover continental USA with the exception of Alaska. The map scale will be
1:200 000, so the required graphical precision is: 0.2 mm6200 000~40.0 m.

According to tables 1 and 8, it would be sufﬁcient to develop the series up to
term 8 and the degree equal to 2. However, if in the future it is necessary to map the
same zone at a bigger scale, for example 1:50 000, or to zoom in with more detail,
the data cannot take ‘as they are’ or else serious errors will be made in all the
calculus. On the other hand, if attention had been paid to the internal precision and
not to the graphical precision, we would have been more conservative and would
have had to work with a 1 m (order~13, degree~4), or even greater, precision, and
this would have allowed us to work up to a 1:5000 scale.

7. Conclusions

The aim of this paper was twofold. On the one hand, to ﬁnd a way to determine
the number of terms of the development that must be taken into account to obtain
a desired accuracy, checking which simpliﬁcations were really acceptable. In
the latitude and longitude is studied. By
addition, the possible inﬂuence of
expressing the coefﬁcients in a recursive form the terms of the development can be
obtained up to a desired order thanks to a symbolic computer program. This is the
key to our objective. The inﬂuence on the ﬁnal value of the (x, y) has been proven.
On the other hand, computer algebra can solve easily an underestimated
problem of GIS, namely the accuracy and precision of the cartographic data.
Because computers can gather geographic data that are both precise and accurate,
it makes no sense to continue working with data lacking these attributes.

Abstract
Local studies aimed at assessing the impact of climate variability on crop yield at the
individual  farm  level  require  the  use  of  weather  and  climate  data.  These  are  often
collected at points known as meteorological stations. In West Africa, meteorological
stations are sparsely distributed and as a result, are often unable to satisfy the data
requirements for such studies. One major problem arising from this is how to estimate
values for locations where primary data is not available. General Circulation Models
(GCMs)  have  recently  been  deployed  for  weather  forecasting  and  climate  change
projections  but  the  resolution  of  their  outputs  is  low  requiring  downscaling.  This
article describes a GIS-based procedure for downscaling GCMs’ outputs for use in
studies  assessing  the  impacts  of  climate  variability  on  crop  yield  at  the  farm  level.
The  procedure  is  implemented  with  the  Hadley  Centre’s  GCM  (HadCM2)  data,
although any other GCM can be used. Results in this study show that the model works
best when representing drier months as compared to wet months in all three domains
tested.  For  example,  it  estimated  the  rainfall  for  January  (the  driest  month)  better
than that of July which is the peak of the rainy season in West Africa. There is also
a north-south pattern influencing the accuracy of estimated rainfall distribution, with
stations in the south better represented than those in the north. For the greater part
of West Africa where similar climatic conditions persist as in Nigeria, this procedure
can be considered suitable for interpolation and downscaling.

1 Introduction

Primary  information  in  respect  of  weather  and  climate  are  often  collected  at  widely
spaced  points  known  as  meteorological  stations.  Where  observed  weather  data  are
available, they are used in local studies for assessing the impacts of climate variability
on  crop  yield  at  individual  farm  sites.  In  West  Africa,  meteorological  stations  are
sparsely distributed and as a result, are often unable to satisfy the data requirements
for such studies. One major problem arising from this is how to estimate values for
locations where primary data is not available. Consequently, crop model simulations at
locations  far  from  measured  data  or  where  essential  variables  or  periods  are  missing
must rely on estimated data (see Hansen and Jones 2000).

The most common estimate is to simply use the nearest weather station as a proxy
for unmeasured weather at the location of interest. Spatial averaging and interpolation
methods are often used to derive climate data values for all locations of interest in order
to  drive  crop  models  (Priya  and  Shibasaki  2001).  The  reduction  in  the  variability  of
daily time-series data when spatial averaging is used is a limitation. This is because crop
models  are  sensitive  not  only  to  mean  climate,  but  also  to  its  variability  within  and
between seasons. Spatial interpolation methods convert data from point observations to
contiguous fields based on the rationale that, on average, climate values are more likely
to be similar at points close together than at those further apart (see Hansen and Jones
2000).  Low  density  of  the  weather  observation  network  is  the  primary  deficiency  for
interpolation methods (Tait et al. 2006). For example, interpolation of rainfall data into
other  areas,  based  on  data  from  sampled  stations  sometimes  several  kilometres  away,
can  cause  significant  discrepancies  and  it  is  also  possible  that  some  localised  rainfall
events may be missed entirely if no rain fell at the nearest observation stations.

Another source of estimated data is that provided by equilibrium General Circulation
Models  (GCMs)  or  coupled  atmosphere-ocean  general  circulation  model  (AOGCM)
simulations.  Most  impact  studies  now  use  climate  change  information  from  GCMs
because  of  the  ready  availability  of  this  information  (Mearns  et  al.  2003).  At  present,
GCMs  are  the  best  tools  for  providing  a  complete  and  coherent  view  of  atmospheric
dynamics. Although they provide reasonable climatic simulations in terms of annual and
seasonal means, their resolution of several hundred kilometers is unsuitable for producing
values  either  at  a  regional  scale  (i.e.  a  few  tens  of  kilometres)  or  at  a  local  scale  (i.e.  a
few kilometres). Consequently, there is the need to downscale coarse GCM outputs to
the  scale  of  the  studied  system  for  simulated  data  to  be  of  use  in  impact  assessment
studies (Hoff 2001).

In West Africa, weather data are sourced from both international and local organ-
izations  such  as  the  Meteorological  Office  –  United  Kingdom  (MO-UK),  Centre  de
Recherche  de  Climatologie  –  France,  the  U.S.  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric
Administration, the Central Forecasting Organisation (CFO) – Nigeria and the African
Centre  for  Meteorological  Applications  for  Development.  These  available  data  do  not
often  satisfy  the  need  of  local  impact  assessment  studies  because  the  forecasting  tools
currently deployed are regional in approach and general in perspective. For example, the
CFO  divides  Nigeria  into  five  broad  zones  and  makes  its  forecasts  for  each  zone.  The
models  developed  are  at  such  coarse  spatial  scales  that  they  often  fail  at  individual
farm-level sites (Odekunle et al. 2005). According to Adejuwon et al. (2007), the zones
are extensive and within the same zone, a wet season at one station may be a dry season
at another. They noted that the disparities existing in forecasting skills between stations

lying in the same ecological zones are probably a result of such intrazonal variability. Thus
intrazonal variability is a limiting factor to the use of weather forecasts at farm-level sites.
The situation in West Africa requires scientifically accessible, sound and easy to use
methods for studying climate change impact at local levels. This article seeks to address
the  growing  requirement  for  climate  and  weather  data  by  local  applications  in  West
Africa for assessing climate variability impacts on crop yield. It examines the suitability
of a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based geostatistical interpolation procedure
for  downscaling  low  resolution  climate  and  weather  data  from  GCM  outputs  to  high
resolution  data  for  use  at  the  farm  level.  Interpolation  is  probably  one  of  the  most
efficient  methods  for  obtaining  data  at  the  required  scale  (Hoff  2001)  and  it  is  easily
applied to output from different GCMs.

The  primary  objective  of  the  larger  project  from  which  this  study  emanated  is  to
examine  the  vulnerability  of  food  crop  production  to  inter-annual  climate  variability
and  extreme  weather  events  in  West  Africa  and  to  assess  how  extended  weather  and
climate  forecasts  could  be  employed  as  a  basic  adaptation  strategy  to  ameliorate
the impact. The project is aimed at improving the management and decision-making
associated with the production of food crops in West Africa.

2 Background

Climate models are used to simulate and quantify the climate response to present and
future human activities. The present climate is initially simulated for extended periods,
typically many decades, under present conditions without any change in external climate
forcing.  Then  the  quality  of  these  simulations  is  assessed  by  systematically  comparing
the simulated climate with observations of the present climate. Once the model is
evaluated and its quality established, projections of future climate change can be made
(see Baede et al. 2001, Solomon et al. 2007).

The coarse spatial scale of the climate scenarios produced from GCMs is recognised
as  one  of  the  major  problems  in  applying  GCM  projections  at  local  or  regional  levels
(Kunstmann  and  Jung  2005).  There  are  techniques  for  evolving  regional  and  local
details from the coarse resolution GCM data. One such method is to adopt changes in
climate  projected  for  each  GCM  grid  box  to  project  future  climate  for  all  locations
within the larger box from observed climate (Rosenzweig and Parry 1994). Other more
sophisticated  approaches  are  high  resolution  and  variable  resolution  ‘time-slice’
AOGCMs;  regional  (or  nested  limited  area)  climate  models  (RCMs);  and  empirical/
statistical and statistical/dynamic methods (Wilby and Wigley 1997). With high resolution
and  variable  resolution  global  models,  identified  periods  of  interest  (or  ‘time-slices’)
within AOGCM transient simulations are modelled to provide additional spatial detail
(Fox-Rabinovitz et al. 1997, Govindasamy et al. 2003).

The  regional  climate  modelling  technique  involves  the  use  of  output  from  global
model simulations to provide initial conditions and time-dependent lateral meteorological
boundary conditions to drive high-resolution RCM simulations for selected time periods
of the global model run (Giorgi 1990, Mearns et al. 2003). RCMs capture geographical
details  more  precisely  than  the  coarse-resolution  GCM,  although  the  computational
requirements are demanding (Hay et al. 2002). Kunstmann and Jung (2005) investigated
the impact of climate change on the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation,

West  Africa.  High  resolution  regional  climate  simulation  using  explicit  dynamic
downscaling  of  the  IS92a  ECHAM4  global  climate  scenario  indicates  a  slight  increase
in  total  annual  precipitation  of  5%,  but  also  a  significant  decrease  (up  to  70%)  of
precipitation  in  April,  which  marks  the  transition  from  the  dry  season  to  the  rainy
season.  Statistical  downscaling  develops  empirical  relations  between  climate  variables
simulated  by  a  GCM  at  grid-box  scales  and  variables  at  subgrid  (regional  and  local)
scales.  A  summary  of  various  climate  scenario  techniques  and  an  evaluation  of  their
advantages and disadvantages can be found in Mearns et al. (2003).

Some  studies  have  examined  the  differences  in  the  performance  of  different
downscaling  methods.  Wilby  et  al.  (1998)  calibrated  different  statistical  downscaling
models  using  both  observed  and  GCM-generated  daily  precipitation  time  series.
Significant  differences  in  the  level  of  skill  were  found  amongst  the  downscaling
methods.  Changes  in  precipitation  between  the  present  and  future  scenarios  produced
by  the  statistical  downscaling  methods  were  generally  smaller  than  those  produced
directly by the GCM. Wilby and Dettinger (2000) found that hydrographs (hydrological
response)  simulated  using  dynamically  downscaled  precipitation  and  temperature  for
the  Animas  River  basin  of  Colorado  were  not  generally  as  realistic  as  those  simulated
using statistically downscaled precipitation and temperature.

Impact assessment applications using climate scenarios are recent (e.g. in agriculture
–  Mearns  et  al.  2001  and  in  water  resources  –  Stone  et  al.  2003).  The  approaches  are
still  not  available  to  a  large  majority  of  researchers  whose  main  interests  lie  in  the
assessments  of  impacts,  vulnerabilities  and  adaptations.  The  methods  are  not  always
straightforward  and  remain  much  more  computationally  demanding  than  most  people
other  than  their  developers  could  cope  with.  Statistical  downscaling  models  are  most
suitable for use in regions where there is sufficiently good datasets available for model
calibration  (Mearns  et  al.  2003).  Although  not  computationally  as  expensive  as  other
downscaling models, the use of statistical downscaling in West Africa is limited by the
dearth  of  observed  data.  Moreover,  impact  research  requires  climate  modelling  skills.
This  requirement  is  often  not  available  to  impact  researchers  in  developing  countries
and  working  with  regional  modellers  who  have  the  expertise  for  generating  RCM
simulations may as well not be feasible. 

3 Study Area

The Atlantic Ocean is the major, if not the only, source of moisture for the West Africa
subcontinent.  The  moisture  is  brought  to  the  land  areas  by  the  southwesterly  winds
moving in after the northward migrating Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This
zone is a discontinuity between the dry continental air and the humid southwesterly air,
whose  characteristics  are  determined  by  the  nature  of  the  sea  surface  temperature  of
the  Gulf  of  Guinea.  The  ITCZ  controls  the  number  and  duration  of  weather  types
experienced  in  different  parts  of  West  Africa  with  rainfall  over  the  land  reducing  with
increasing distance inland (Adedokun 1978, Oguntoyinbo 1978).

Since  the  climate  of  Nigeria  represents  a  microcosm  of  the  climate  of  West  Africa
(Oguntoyinbo 1978), Nigeria is used as the case study for sub-Saharan West Africa. The
country truly represents the climatic profile from the very wet to the semi-arid ends of
the subcontinent (see Figure 1). All the indicator vegetation types of the various climate
types are present in the Nigeria except the Southern Sahara and Saharan vegetation.

3.1 Data

In this study, rainfall is the meteorological parameter used as changes in the amount and
distribution  of  rainfall  have  significant  impacts  on  water  availability  and  thereby
directly  influence  socio-economic  activities  in  the  region.  Over  70%  of  the  inhabitants
depend  primarily  on  rain-fed  agriculture  for  their  livelihood.  Since  West  Africa  is  a
typical tropical region, rainfall is the principal controlling element of crop productivity
because the crop plants are sensitive to the moisture situation both during their growth,
development, and especially as they reach maturity. Hydropower is the main source of
electric  power  generation,  crucial  for  socio-economic  development,  and  is  strongly
dependent  on  the  availability  of  rainfall  (Kunstmann  and  Jung  2005,  Nieuwolt  1982
cited in Adejuwon et al. 2007).

available.  This  is  different  where  the  data  are  the  outputs  of  the  GCMs,  since  the
procedures  for  deriving  values  for  locations  between  nodes  are  usually  referred  to  as
‘downscaling’ in these instances. The relevant results of downscaling and interpolation
in this context are the same in that they lead to the enhancement of the spatial resolution
of the climate data surface. This forms the basic premise of this work in that GIS tools
for  interpolating  from  data  collected  at  meteorological  stations  could  logically  be
employed for downscaling coarse resolution data outputs of GCMs.

4.1 Spatial Interpolation Techniques

Spatial  interpolation  involves  the  estimation  of  the  values  of  properties  of  unsampled
sites  within  an  area  covered  by  sampled  points,  using  the  data  from  those  points.
Perhaps the most widely adopted version of this technique is the one which adopts the
data collected at the nearest weather station for the location of interest (Burrough and
McDonnell  1998).  Other  more  sophisticated  techniques  used  in  interpolating  climate
values  from  point  based  data  include:  (1)  Thiessen  polygons  (Thiessen  1911);  (2)
Splining  (Fleming  et  al.  2000,  Jeffrey  et  al.  2001);  (3)  Kriging  (Hudson  and  Wachker-
nagel 1994); (4) Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) (Hartkamp et al. 1999); (5) Gradient
plus  inverse-distance-squared  (Price  et  al.  2000);  and  (6)  Neural  networks (Antonic
et al. 2001, Rigol et al. 2001).

Although each of these spatial interpolation techniques has its own advantages and
disadvantages,  we  consider  the  IDW  interpolator  the  most  appropriate  in  our  case  to
illustrate the applicability of the GIS-based procedure for downscaling GCM outputs. This
is because IDW attenuates the influence of distant points by its use of inverse distance weight
given an assumption of positive spatial autocorrelation. In other words, it assumes that
the influence of the nearby observed data on an interpolated point solely depends on the

The stations Ti (where i = 1, 2, . . . , Mj) are chosen according to the distance table for
the grid gj. Station r1 is the station with data that is nearest to the grid gj, and station r2
is the second nearest station (Shen et al. 2001).

The implication of this assumption is that values closer to the unsampled locations
are  more  representative  of  the  value  to  be  estimated  than  values  from  samples  farther
away. Weights therefore change according to the linear distance of the samples from the
unsampled point in inverse proportions. In other words, the larger the distance between
the data point and interpolated point, the smaller the weight given to the data point. In
the  ArcView  IDW  interpolator,  the  significance  of  the  surrounding  points  upon  the
interpolated value is controlled using the power parameter. According to Adejuwon (2004),
it  is  important  for  us  to  reduce  to  a  minimum  the  influence  of  distant  points  because

crop yield was found to differ between locations when all other parameters are the same.
The distribution of observation points when interpolating is also very important as clustered
points  will  carry  an  artificially  large  weight.  For  this  study,  the  observation  points  are
well spaced out which reduces the spatial bias to the estimates (see Shen et al. 2001 and
Chapman and Thorne 2003 for detailed discussion on some of these other methods).

4.2 GIS-based Procedure for Downscaling

With particular focus on the West African situation, the aim of this GIS-based procedure
is to procure weather data for crop modelling (Figure 4). This procedure could offer an

integration of GIS and crop model functionalities (Tan and Shibasaki 2003). Generally,
crop  simulation  models  require  weather  data  as  well  as  soil  properties  and  cultivar
characteristics.

Figure  4  shows  the  steps  involved  in  the  procedure  developed  and  utilised  in  this
study. Coarse resolution GCM output data are input into a GIS database with links to
a  point  layer  representing  GCM  network  nodes.  Using  this  point  layer  and  a  polygon
mask layer of the Nigerian boundary (the case study), we run the IDW interpolator to
produce  a  raster  surface  of  continuous  climate  values  (see  Appendix  1  for  details).
Climate parameter values for settlements lying between the network nodes are generated
from the raster surface. From this, a database of interpolated climate values is developed
for settlements of interest. This database could serve as climate variable data input in a
crop  model  for  crop  yield  forecast.  It  is  possible  to  incorporate  terrain  characteristics
into the analysis for areas where topography affects the spatial patterns of climate with
the GIS approach used. Since much of Nigeria consist essentially of low lying plateaus
and  coastal  plains,  the  effect  of  topography  was  not  assessed  in  this  article.  However,
some studies in West Africa and East Africa have shown influence of altitude and relief
on  the  occurrence  of  severe  weather  (Asnani  and  Kinuthia  1979,  Fortune  1980  both
cited in Nyakwada 2004).

As this work is carried out within a GIS environment there is considerable potential
to couple the procedure developed with any agricultural impact model. The widespread
applicability and obvious benefits of GIS has led to the development of several generic
tools that link crop models and commercial GIS packages, thereby addressing the spatial
deficiency  of  simulation  models.  Some  examples  are  Spatial-EPIC  (Satya  2002),  GIS-
CropSyst  (Cropping  Systems  Simulation  Model:  Stockle  et  al.  2003)  and  AEGIS/WIN
(Agricultural  and  Environmental  Geographic  Information  System  for  Windows)  which
links  the  simulation  system  Decision  Support  System  for  Agrotechnology  Transfer
(DSSAT)  v3  with  the  geographic  mapping  tool  ArcView  2.  AEGIS/WIN  is  a  series  of
tools that link GIS to DSSAT family of crop models (Engel et al. 1997).

In  order  to  test  the  reliability  of  this  GIS-based  procedure  to  reproduce  observed
rainfall,  30  Nigerian  meteorological  stations  distributed  from  south  to  north  were
selected (refer to Figure 2). Observed rainfall data available from 1961 to 2000 for these
stations were compared with estimated rainfall values in order to evaluate the ability of
the proposed method to reproduce observed rainfall. R-squared (r 2) and root mean square
error (RMSE) were calculated for each station as in Equations 3 and 4, respectively:

R2 is the square of the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient through data
points  in  observed  rainfall  (independent  values  −  x)  and  modeled  rainfall  (dependent
values  −  y).  The  R2  value  can  be  interpreted  as  the  proportion  of  the  variance  in  y

attributable to the variance in x. As an indicator whose values range from 0 to 1, it is
most reliable when its value is at or near 1. The RMSE is a measure of how close a fitted
line is to data points. For every data point, the distance is taken vertically from the point
to the corresponding y value on the curve fit (the error), and the value is squared. Then
we add up all those values for all data points, divide by the number of points and find
the square root.

5 Implementation of the Procedure

This procedure is implemented using ESRI’s ArcView 3.2 GIS software (Spatial Analyst
extension).  A  significant  advantage  in  using  ArcView  3.x  is  the  very  large  user  base
which continues to exist, despite the launch and implementation of the ArcGIS platform
(Lowry  2006).  Although  the  procedure  was  implemented  using  the  Hadley  Centre’s
GCM (HadCM2) data, it is also suitable for other GCMs. To demonstrate the suitability
of the procedure for GCM generated climate data, we used the observed average rainfall
for  the  period  from  1961  to  2000  and  1985  rainfall  values.  Specifically  we  applied
the  procedure  described  earlier  to  the  monthly  means  for  January,  April,  July  and
September.  The  choice  of  months  is  important  in  that  January  was  chosen  as  it  is  the
middle  of  the  “harmattan”  (dry)  season,  April  is  at  the  beginning  of  the  rainy  season,
and July and September are at the middle and end of the rainy season, respectively for
West Africa.

Rainfall  values  were  obtained  from  the  GCM  output  for  the  months  of  January,
April, July, and September for selected stations for which observed data were available.
Three categories comprising 10, 20 and 30 meteorological stations were used and these
are referred to as domain 1, domain 2 and domain 3, respectively for ease of reference.
The  domains  incorporated  10,  20  and  30  stations  with  observed  rainfall  data  because
these domains approximate 10 2.5° lat × 3.75° long, 20 2° lat × 2.5° long and 30 1.5°
lat × 2° long GCM grid cells, respectively covering Nigeria (see Table 2 for additional
details).

6 Results and Discussion

Three point layers for the 10, 20 and 30 meteorological stations were created to which
either observed 1985 precipitation values or 1961–2000 mean values were input. These
layers  are  then  displayed  over  the  raster  surface  created  from  the  GCM  precipitation
data  output.  Rainfall  values  for  stations  in  the  three  different  domains  (10,  20  and  30
stations) can be read from the created raster surface (see Figure 5).

Figure  5  shows  the  interpolated  precipitation  surface  derived  from  the  GCM
data  output  for  Nigeria.  This  surface  is  for  the  month  of  January  (1961–1990)  under
domain  3  (30  stations).  The  estimated  and  observed  rainfall  totals  for  Sokoto  in  the
extreme  north  and  Lagos  in  the  extreme  south-west  are  displayed  on  the  map.  In
order  to  evaluate  the  ability  to  reproduce  observed  climate  using  the  proposed
procedure,  a  comparison  between  simulated  mean  monthly  rainfall  and  observed
rainfall  was  conducted  for  each  domain.  This  is  demonstrated  in  Figure  6,  which
presents a comparison between simulated and observed rainfall for each of the four
months under domain 1.

data output

Further  results  obtained  from  comparing  estimated  and  observed  rainfall  for  the
time  period  1961–2000  are  shown  in  Table  3.  A  high  positive  correlation  was  found
between the observed and simulated rainfall datasets used for all the months examined
except for July in all domains. From Table 3, r values for every month with the excep-
tion  of  July  range  from  0.81  to  0.92.  The  R2  values  in  Table  3  reveal  that  the  model
represents the drier months’ rainfall (January − R2 = 0.85 and April − R2 = 0.84) better
than  that  of  the  wettest  month  (July  −  R2  =  0.24).  That  is  85,  84  and  24%  of  the
variance  in  the  estimated  rainfall  values  can  be  explained  by  variation  in  the  observed
rainfall values for January, April and July, respectively. The RMSE values regarding the
rainfall representation for January are better and were almost constant given values of
8.02, 8.25 and 7.84 for domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

Using  results  from  domain  1  as  the  distribution  of  stations  approximates  the
HadCM2  cell  coverage  for  Nigeria,  the  model  underestimated  rainfall  by  6.28%

(1,119.96  vs.  1,194.96 mm)  for  the  four  months,  especially  for  the  very  rainy  months
(July  and  September).  Thornton  et  al.  (2006)  noted  that  the  Hadley  centre  model  is  a
“drier” model based on their study which compared rainfall differences between different
models. The fact that the model captures the drier months better than the rainy months
cannot be entirely attributed to its seemingly dry nature. We take cognisance of the fact
that  both  the  GCM  and  observed  datasets  used  cover  slightly  different  time  periods
which  may  have  had  some  influence.  The  GCM  data  is  from  1960–1990  while  the
observed rainfall data is from 1960–2000.

As an indication of its overall performance, the model underestimated total rainfall
by 4.7% (2,799.1 vs. 2,935.98 mm) and 8.0% (1,303.12 vs. 1,415.8 mm) for southern
and  northern  stations,  respectively.  Estimated  rainfall  values  for  stations  in  the  south
were  better  than  those  in  the  north.  A  contributing  factor  is  probably  that  these
southern  stations  enjoy  a  greater  maritime  influence  due  to  their  proximity  to  the
Atlantic  Ocean.  Moreover,  the  density  of  stations  which  is  much  higher  in  the  south
than in the north may be an additional contributing influence.

6 Conclusions

This work describes a GIS-based procedure developed for downscaling coarse resolution
data outputs of General Circulation Models to be used as input in crop models for crop
yield forecast. The main GIS technique used is the IDW interpolation method which is
adopted for deriving values for locations between the GCM network nodes. Our main
objective  is  the  use  of  simpler  methods  to  generate  high-resolution  data  from  GCMs
outputs for a technology and data sparse region as West Africa. Although the HadCM2
data  was  used  for  implementation,  the  procedure  is  meant  to  be  generic.  For  climate
change scenario construction, the GIS approach is subject, like the statistical approach,

to the weakness of assuming that the current inter-element relations will continue to be
valid  under  future  radiative  forcing.  In  other  words,  the  GIS  approach  is  basically
time invariant.

To assess the ability of the GIS-based downscaling procedure to reproduce observed
climate, the estimated rainfall values for meteorological stations were compared to the
means  of  the  observed  data  from  1961  to  2000.  We  reported  coefficients  of  Pearson’s
correlation,  R2  and  RMSE  for  the  test  using  three  domains  comprising  of  10,  20,  and
30  stations  for  which  observed  data  were  available.  The  results  in  this  study  show
that the model works best in representing drier months compared to wet months in all
three domains tested. For example, it captured the rainfall for January (the driest month)
better  than  that  of  July  which  is  the  peak  of  the  rainy  season  in  West  Africa.  With
regards to accuracy, the model underestimated rainfall by 6.3% (1,119.96 vs. 1,194.96 mm),
especially for the very rainy months (July and September). In relation to the north-south
pattern  of  estimated  rainfall  distribution,  stations  in  the  south  were  better  represented
than those in the north with total rainfall underestimated by 4.7 and 8.0%, respectively.
At  this  stage,  we  cannot  make  the  claim  that  the  approach  will  be  suitable  for
downscaling  throughout  tropical  Africa  where  weather  and  climate  similar  to  those  of
Nigeria  are  experienced.  This  is  because  Nigeria,  consisting  of  essentially  low  lying
plateaus and coastal plains, does not offer a good example for the remainder of tropical
Africa which consists mainly of high altitude plateaus and mountainous regions. It may
thus be necessary to conduct assessments similar to that performed in this article to test the
applicability of the approaches in East, Central and Southern Africa. For the greater part of
West  Africa  with  similar  climatic  and  terrain  conditions  as  Nigeria,  this  procedure  is
considered suitable for interpolation and downscaling. Further refinements to the procedure
would  be  to  incorporate  terrain  characteristics  in  the  analysis  and  use  of  future  climate
scenarios to study the spatial variability of climate and the temporal progression of changes.
With  this  GIS-based  procedure,  there  is  the  possibility  of  downscaling  to  point
resolution  which  is  not  always  the  case  for  the  other  approaches.  There  is  also  the
chance to incorporate topographic effect where topography affects the spatial patterns
of climate to give more accurate results. The GIS approach is definitely more user-friendly
as it involves little or no computations since all that it requires are some knowledge of
GIS-based spatial analysis functions and applications.

Appendix 1: Steps for Using the IDW Interpolation Method

Check and select the mask theme to make it active
From the ANALYSIS menu set the PROPERTIES
To run the IDW interpolator, make the point theme active
From the SURFACE menu click INTERPOLATE GRID

The INTERPOLATE SURFACE dialog box is displayed.

Choose for method – IDW (inverse distance weights)
Z-value Field – for example, Jan (January precipitation field in the database)
No. of Neighbours – 9 (10 HadCM2 nodes minus 1)
Power – 2
Barriers – No Barriers; OK. 

Note that a choice of “No Barriers” will use all points specified in the “No. of Neigh-
bours” or within a “fixed radius”. On the other hand, each line in a barrier input line
theme  is  used  as  a  break  that  limits  the  search  for  input  sample  points.  A  line  can
represent a cliff, ridge, or some other interruption in a landscape.

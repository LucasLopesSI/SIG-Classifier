Comparison of the structure and accuracy of two land change models

This article, originally published in volume 19 no. 2 (February 2005), pp. 243–265,
contained a number of errors. These are listed below – bold text indicates new or
amended information, except in the case of section headings or volume reference
numbers.

1. The name of the corresponding author is ROBERT GILMORE PONTIUS JR.

2. The first sentence of the Introduction should read

‘‘Models of land-use & -cover change (LUCC) vary enormously in terms of their
assumptions concerning….’’

3. The second and third sentences in the last paragraph of this page should

‘‘Pontius et al. (2001) offer the single most complete description of Geomod, which
used to be known as Geomod2. Geomod predicts a one-way conversion from one
category to one other category, similar to other popular land change models such as
early versions of SLEUTH (Clarke et al. 1996, Clarke 1998).’’

4. Paragraph four, sentence six should read

‘‘Validation is the process of comparing the model’s prediction for time t2 to a
reference map of time t2, where the reference map is considered an accurate
portrayal of the landscape at time t2.’’

Page 246:

5. Paragraph four, sentence two should read

‘‘The null resolution is the resolution at which the accuracy of the predictive model
is the same as the accuracy of a null model, where accuracy is measured in terms of
percent correct of the entire landscape (Pontius et al, 2004).’’

Page 249:

6. The large ‘m’ should be removed from the middle of figure 4.

7. The second paragraph from the bottom should begin thus:

‘‘Similar to CA_Markov, Geomod examines a suitability map to find the pixels with
the largest suitability values, and then predicts conversion of new built at the non-
built pixels that have the largest suitability for built.’’

8. Paragraph two, sentence five should read

‘‘The non-built categories of Cropland, Water Based Recreation, Pasture, and
Woody Perennial became between 5% and 20% built in 1985.’’

9. Paragraph four, sentence three should read

‘‘In most cases that we have seen, a null model of pure persistence gives a
larger percent correct than a predictive model at the resolution of the raw
data.’’

10. Paragraph two, sentence two should read

‘‘In each figure, the real map for 1999 is compared to the simulated map of
1999.’’

11. The last sentence of the second paragraph should read ‘‘Readers who are
especially interested in the details of the calculations should read Pontius (2000),
Pontius (2002) and Pontius and Suedmeyer (2004).’’

12. Paragraph three, sentence three should read

‘‘Each additional progression in the aggregation process averages the membership of
four neighbouring pixels, therefore the size of the resolutions progress as a geometric
sequence, where the side of a pixel in each additional resolution is twice the length of
the side of a pixel at the previous resolution’’.

13. The last paragraph should begin thus:

‘‘Null resolution. The second criterion to assess a model run is the null resolution
(Pontius et al. 2004).’’

Page 258:

14. The third and fourth sentences on this page should read

‘‘In figure 11, the solid line with the closed circles (or triangles) is the percent correct
for the predictive model (or null model) respectively. The dashed line with the open
circles (or triangles) shows the error due to quantity for the predictive model (or null
model) respectively.’’

15. In figure 11, the last item on the legend should read ‘‘model % correct’’.

16. Paragraph three, sentence two should read
‘‘Figure 8 overlays the 1985 real map, the 1999 real map, and the 1999 simulated
map of a Geomod run that uses net Markov quantities, considers laws, and is
unconstrained.’’

17. Paragraph five, sentences five and six should read

‘‘Among the runs that use the contiguity rule, there are two clusters. Between
these two clusters,
(ranging from
91.52
constrained Geomod
runs.’’

18. Paragraph two, sentence four should read

‘‘Furthermore, none of the predictions were more accurate in terms of null resolution
than would be expected by random chance.’’

19. The first sentence of the Discussion should read

‘‘For any particular modeling application,
is a challenge to separate the
results that are true in general from those that are true for only a specific
landscape.’’

it

20. Paragraph three, sentence three should read

‘‘However, a quick glance at figures 2 and 3 shows clearly that new built areas do not
grow from existing built areas.’’

21. Paragraph one, sentence four should read

‘‘We know of very few spatially explicit models that have been shown to predict for
any landscape better than both a null model and a random model at any spatial
resolution.’’

22. Paragraph two, sentence three should read

‘‘Much of the noise is the small patches of transition from built to non-built.’’

23. The second sentence of the Acknowledgements section should read

‘‘We also acknowledge programmer Hao Chen, who was funded by the Center for
Integrated Study of the Human Dimensions of Global Change.’’

24. The last sentence of the Acknowledgements section should read

‘‘The authors also thank Clarklabs, which has made the methods of this paper
available in the GIS software Idrisi.’’

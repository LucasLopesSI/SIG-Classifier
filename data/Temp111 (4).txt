Abstract. A tremendous amount of attention has been given to the aging of
population that is occurring in many parts of the world. However, very little
work has focused upon the aging of minority populations. Because minority
populations often have greater needs for health care and fewer resources to pay
for it, it is important to assess the demand for services. This paper takes an initial
step in that direction by focusing upon the geographic distribution of elderly
minority populations in the United States. The study is carried out at several
spatial scales, and it is concluded that elderly minority populations tend to be
even more segregated than their non-elderly counterparts.

1.

Introduction
Despite all of the attention given to the increased pace of population aging, there
has been little study of the aging of minority populations. Furthermore, those studies
that do address the aging of minorities often give little if any attention to this
subgroup’s geographical distribution (e.g. Manuel 1988, Gerontological Society of
America 1991, Angel and Hogan 1992).

In this paper, I explore the geographical distribution of the minority elderly in
the United States. Several di(cid:128) erent spatial scales are examined, using population
data from the 1990 decennial census. Such examination is facilitated by developments
that have eased the tasks associated with data analysis and mapping. In particular,
the entire summary tape ®
les of the US 1990 decennial census now reside on a single
CD (Geolytics, 1996 ), along with a user-friendly interface. It is straightforward to
combine the output with a GIS ( here ArcView 3.0 was used ) to produce choropleth
maps for the depiction and visualization of geographical patterns.

The focus in this paper on the spatial distribution of the minority elderly is of
importance when considering service availability and use. The relatively more rapid
rate of growth of minority elders also implies that future elderly populations will be
more racially and ethnically diverse than they are at present, which will tend to
naturally focus more attention on the topic.

Section two of the paper provides some background and motivation in this
regard. The third section of the paper focuses upon the location and segregation of
the minority elderly. The ® nal section provides a summary.

2. Long-term care and service availability and use

The Older Americans Act of 1965 contains a stipulation that service provision
to the elderly in the United States have a focus on those of `greatest need with
particular attention to low-income minority individuals’. (Administration on Aging
1987). It is therefore imperative that we assess the geography of service demand. An

initial element of such a demand analysis is a detailed study of population
distribution.

The use of services by the minority elderly faces two di(cid:129) cult problemsÐ

one
involving demand, and the other related to supply. The potential demand for services
from older minority individuals is large, and is growing. In particular, the low-
income minority aged constitute a large fraction of the total number of people
requiring assistance (Chesney and Engel 1982, Taylor and Chatters 1988, Yeatts et
al. 1992 ). Also, Manuel ( 1988 ) reports that older African Americans are more likely
to be in poor health, and are more likely to have functional limitations than are
older whites.

In addition to facing the problems associated with meeting a potentially sizable
demand for services, service providers also must face the reality that services are
underutilized by minorities. For example, likelihoods of residence in nursing homes
are signi® cantly lower among older African Americans, in comparison with white
elderly persons ( Burr 1990). Yeatts et al. categorize barriers to use according to
those involving knowledge ( knowledge of illness, knowledge of services available,
etc.), access (transportation, a(cid:128) ordability), and intent (willingness and interest).

Older African Americans are also more likely than whites to live with other
family members (Angel et al. 1990, Burr 1990, Mutchler 1990, Worobey and Angel
1990). It is important to consider the point raised by Gratton and Wilson ( 1988),
however, that, although African American family support is relatively available, the
ability of the family to actually provide assistance is often limited by considerations
of a(cid:128) ordability and access. In some of these situations, help may be given out of
necessity; although there are well-documented di(cid:128) erences by race in the provision
of family help, these di(cid:128) erences are harder to detect when socioeconomic status is
controlled for. There is a danger that policy makers will mistakenly look to family
members to provide support and consequently reduce formal levels of support.

As indicated above, there has been little previous documentation of the geograph-
ical location and distribution of elderly minority populations. Manuel ( 1988 ) notes
that in 1980, African Americans were more concentrated than whites in urban areas
( 80.6% to 73.8%), and the discrepancy was even more pronounced within central
cities ( 69.1% of elderly African Americans were in central cities in 1980, compared
with only 39% of all elderly whites). Manuel also indicates that the ten states with
the highest number of elderly African Americans contained 56.0% of the country’s
elderly African American population (see table 1). This statistic alone might lead to
the impression of a relatively high level of concentration, but these same ten states
contained 46.5% of all elderly. Furthermore, the top ten states with elderly individ-
uals (which is a set di(cid:128) erent from that in the table) contained 55.2% of all elderly.
Thus the elderly African American population was only slightly more spatially
concentrated than the overall elderly population, at the scale of states, in 1980.

3. Location and segregation of the minority elderly
3.1. 1990 Elderly Minority populations, by county

Figure 1 displays the 1990 geographical distribution of the elderly concentrations
in the United States, by county. In addition to the expected concentration of elderly
in Florida, most apparent is the strong concentration in the Midwest. The concentra-
tion of older persons in the heartland of the country is attributable to the steady
out-migration of younger adults from this region to other areas of the country. Also
notable are concentrations inland from the eastern seaboard in the Appalachian

3.2. 1990 Population distribution of Af rican American elderly

Data were collected on the 1990 white and African American populations for the
fteen largest metropolitan areas. Table 2 displays some background information on
the population of whites and African Americans Ð
for both total and elderly pop-
ulationsÐ
for the ®
fteen largest metropolitan areas in the United States in 1990.
fteen areas contain 36.4% of the total population, and 44.5%
Note that these ®
of the African American population. The areas contain 31.1% of the white elderly
population, and 41.1% of the African American elderly population.

A useful way to characterize the geographical distribution of a minority popula-
tion is to use segregation indices. Four types of geographical segregation were
investigated and compared:

1. African American elderly versus African American non-elderly
2. White elderly vs. white non-elderly
3. African American elderly versus white elderly
4. African American population versus white population

For each of the four comparisons above, Duncan’s Index of Dissimilarity was used:

subgroup who reside in census tract i. ( pi refers to one of the two populations being
compared, and si refers to the other).

Table 3 reveals that the African American elderly population is more isolated
from the African American non-elderly population than the white elderly are isolated
from the white non-elderly (comparing columns 1 and 2 in the table). This is true at
all spatial scales Ð
states, counties, and census tracts within metropolitan areas.
(Census tracts are areas containing approximately 4000 persons). Only in Miami are
the African American elderly less isolated from the African American non elderly to
a lesser degree than the white elderly are isolated from the non elderly. The table
also shows that the degree of racial segregation (white versus African American) is
greater for the elderly than the degree of segregation in the overall population
(comparing columns 3 and 4 in the table). This is also true at all spatial scales.

Table 4 demonstrates that these same general ® ndings also hold at the smaller
scale of the block group ( there are approximately four block groups per census tract,
and approximately 1000 persons per block group). In general, the index is a bit
higher than in table 3, indicating a slightly higher level of isolation at this ® ner
geographical scale.

Although the Index of Dissimilarity provides a measure of the degree of segre-
gation and isolation, it is of interest to focus in more detail on the geographical
patterns of population distribution. As Morrill ( 1991 ) and Wong ( 1993) point out,
the Index of Dissimilarity treats all spatial units identically and independently. It
therefore does not account for the spatial pattern of segregation, and it is necessary
to either map the variable of interest, or consider spatial measures of the Index of
Dissimilarity. Here the former approach is adopted; for the latter, see the papers by
Morrill and Wong. In ® gure 7, the numbers of African Americans in each census
tract in Cuyahoga County (containing the city of Cleveland, Ohio) are mapped. The
® gure shows a clear clustering of the sub-population, with two sub-clusters. Figure 8

shows that when one examines the spatial pattern of the fraction of African Americans
who are elderly quite a di(cid:128) erent picture emerges. In addition to the original cluster,
isolated pockets appear elsewhere in the city. These are locations where there are
not necessarily a large number of older African Americans, but where they constitute
a relatively large percentage of the African American population. Consequently,
these are areas where indices of need may be relatively higher than elsewhere.

The more darkly shaded tracts of ® gure 9 show where contributions to the index
of dissimilarity ( Index III) comparing African American elderly with white elderly
are highest. The location quotient used in this ® gure is de® ned as

African American elderly/African American population
white elderly/white population

The location quotient is higher than one where the fraction of African Americans
who are elderly exceeds the fraction of whites who are elderly. Again these areas
contribute to any greater isolation that might be experienced by African Americans,
in comparison with the white population. This map is very similar to that in the
previous ® gure. The primary cluster is slightly lighter than the previous ® gure,
indicating that although the percentage elderly is quite high for African Americans,
it is also quite high for the white population. Areas contributing to the high Index
of Dissimilarity (of Type 3) are quite scattered throughout the city, and consist of
areas with both large and small numbers of older African Americans.

Services targeted simply toward areas with the greatest number of elderly minorit-
ies may miss important areas of need. In particular, those areas with (i ) high
concentrations of older minorities, relative to the total number of minorities and
(ii ) high fractions of minorities who are elderly, relative to the fraction of whites who

are elderly, may also be worthy of targeting. This is so because the elderly minorities
in these areas, despite potentially low absolute numbers, may ® nd little support from
other members of the minority subgroup, either in an absolute sense, or relative to
the support received by older whites from the overall white population.

Summary and discussion
Because the population growth rate of minority populations is higher than the
national average, the elderly population is rapidly becoming more racially and
ethnically diverse. Minority populations often have greater needs for health care
services and fewer resources to pay for them. This paper has included evidence
demonstrating that elderly minority populations are quite segregated and isolated
within major metropolitan areas in the United States. This result holds on several
spatial scales, and points to the need to be particularly concerned about the accessibil-
ity to, and provision of, services for elderly minorities. One limitation of the result
is that it focuses upon population structure and not household structure; it would
be of much interest to examine many of the issues addressed here from a household
perspective. For example, it would likely be instructive to examine the geographical
distribution of elderly minority individuals who live alone.

In focusing upon the geographical distribution of elderly minorities, this paper
has focused upon the demand issues associated with future needs for health care and
support. Attention also needs to be devoted to geographical issues associated with
supply, much as Corden ( 1992 ) has done in studying factors in¯ uencing the location
decisions of long-term care providers.

A worthwhile goal would be to integrate the work here with that done in the
area of intergenerational care giving and support (e.g. Crimmins and Ingegneri 1990),
including analyses of the geographical distribution of distances between the elderly
and their adult children (e.g. Rogerson et al. 1993, Rogerson et al. 1997).

Finally, in addition to the substantive issues addressed in this paper, it is worth
noting that population analysis has indeed been made easier by advances in the ease
of use of both data and GIS. Calls have been made for better integration of spatial
analysis and GIS for some time now. Progress is clearly being made, and it likely
will not be long before user-friendly ways of doing population analysis are added to
the current linkages that are readily achievable between GIS and population data.

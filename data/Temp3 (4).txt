Abstract
MassMov2D is a numerical model for simulating runout and deposition of landslide
phenomena over a complex topography that is implemented in the free GIS
PCRaster. This research aims at improving the mechanism of MassMov2D calibra-
tion and verifying its capability of representing complex landslides. In this article the
authors present the enhancement of the MassMov2D code due to the introduction
of the Nash-Sutcliffe coefﬁcient for model efﬁciency calculation; this enables the
replacement of the inefﬁcient ‘trial and error’ approach used for sensitivity analysis
and calibration with a semi-automatic procedure. During this research the improved
code was tested in a case study located on the Canaria Valley (Switzerland) where a
complex landslide occurred. An optimal set of parameters were calculated for
evaluating the effects of a possible further slope failure.

The availability of a unique dataset of high resolution digital elevation models
just before and after the collapse allowed precise evaluation of the sensitivity and
calibration of the model with the new procedure. The results demonstrate that this
model is capable of reproducing the observed deposits even though some model
limitations were identiﬁed in steep slope areas. Finally the study presents the
expected scenario due to a future landslide.

1 Introduction

The purpose of this study is the simulation of a rapid moving landslide, which is a natural
phenomenon that for frequency and severity is certainly one of the most dangerous that
may occur in mountainous regions. This event is generally unpredictable due to the high
level of complexity of its dynamics; it may involve different types of materials (rock,
terrain, debris) and evolve in multiple types of movement mechanisms (sliding, falling,
earth ﬂow, complex falls, rock avalanche).

Currently the modeling of this phenomenon is an important research ﬁeld because a
detailed analysis of the runout can provide estimates on the expected impact area and the
probable distribution of deposits. This information is a useful insight for the develop-
ment of risk mitigation strategies.

In the literature both empirical and physically-based models exist. Empirical models
estimate, on the basis of historical data analyses, the correlations among different
characteristics of the landslide; for example the detached volume and the reach angle in
Corominas (1996) or the area of deposits and volume in Iverson et al. (1998). This type
of approach allows us to predict runout distances or deposits extension but, according to
Hungr (2006), it “suffers from great scatter of data, making even the limited predictions
very unreliable”.

In the last few years, scientists have concentrated their efforts on developing physi-
cally based models that are capable of providing a more realistic and, thanks to the usage
of physically based parameters, a more meaningful description. Within these models, the
dynamic approach seems to have the potential to be the most accurate, objective, and
accessible method for the analysis of landslides with rapid dynamics (McDougall 2006).
It applies mass, momentum and energy conservation equations for the description of the
terrain movements together with rheological formulas (Bingham, Voellmy, frictional,
etc.) able to characterize the type of material.

Hungr (1995) made a great contribution in this research ﬁeld with the development
of DAN-W, which is a bidimensional model based on the Lagrangian solution of the
motion equations. Afterwards, in order to account for complex topographies, the for-
mulation was extended to three dimensions and included in the DAN3D model (McDou-
gall and Hungr 2004). Numerous applications of these two models are described in
literature (McKinnon et al. 2008, Sosio et al. 2008, Willenberg et al. 2009). In recent
years, many other dynamic models have been developed: see, for example, TITAN2D
(Pitman et al. 2003), RASH3D (Pirulli 2005) and MassMov2D (Begueria et al. 2009a).
Among these recently developed models, MassMov2D is one of the latest and has the
great advantage to be freely available on the Internet (CSIC 2009) with open access to the
source code; this allows for easy understanding of the algorithms, and for testing and
improving on the original code. This model, based on an Eulerian approach, is able to
provide a three-dimensional description of the mass movements over digital terrain
models; its application accounts for both debris-ﬂows and rock avalanches (Begueria
et al. 2009b).

The goals of this research are to: (1) test the MassMov2D capability to correctly
simulate a complex landslide collapse; (2) improve the model calibration process by
integrating in the code a semi-automatic procedure; (3) derive an optimal set of param-
eters values to be applied in other similar conditions; and (4) evaluate the intensity map
of a collapsing scenario for future risk assessment. With this propose the Val Canaria
(Ticino, Switzerland) case was studied.

2 MassMov2D Model

2.1 Governing Equations

MassMov2D is a numerical model that allows users to simulate the expansion (runout)
and deposition of mass movements over a complex topography by approximating the
heterogeneous sliding mass to a homogeneous one-phase ﬂuid (following the approach
proposed by Savage and Hutter (1989) and Iverson and Denlinger (2001).

The model describes the mass movements as a two-dimensional ﬂux taking advan-
tage of the shallow water equations. This formula is derived from the general Navier-
Stokes equations under the hypothesis that the vertical components of velocity and
pressure are negligible with respect to the horizontal components, and that the vertical
pressure proﬁle can be considered as almost hydrostatic (Kinnmark 1985).

These assumptions allow for the integration of the equations along the vertical
component z deriving a 2D description of the ﬂux that avoids the complex 3D repre-
sentation. The shallow water equations that drive the model, represented in a 2D
Euclidean space with Cartesian coordinates x, y (see Figure 1), are:

surface and the horizontal plane in the direction x and y [deg]; g is the gravity accelera-
tion [m/s2]; Sf is a parameter accounting for the energy dissipation [-] as a function of the
rheological properties of the ﬂux, here considered homogeneous and constants; and k is
the earth pressure coefﬁcient [-]: the ratio between the tangential and normal stresses. k
ranges between two extreme values, Kp and Ka, which correspond, respectively, to the
passive and active state of the Rankine theory (Rankine 1857) and are calculated as a
function of the angle of internal friction d as follows:

Equations (1) and (2) express, in terms of accelerations, the momentum balance
along the horizontal directions. In the numerical solution they are applied to estimate the
evolution in time of ﬂux velocities u and v as a function of the convective acceleration due
to the movement, and of the local acceleration due to the combination of three forces:
gravity, pore pressure and ﬂux resistance.

Equation (3) expresses the mass balance and, once the ﬂux velocities are known,

allows evaluation of the variation in time of the deposit depth h.

2.2 Rheological Equations

In Equations (1) and (2), the term Sf accounts for the ﬂux resistance as a function of the
rheology and drives the mass expansion. MassMov2D permits selection of one of the
following rheological laws:

frictional – based on the frictional basal angle j only;

•
• Voellmy (1955) – here the frictional component is added to a turbulent component
dependent on a turbulence factor x, the square of velocity U and the ﬂux depth h;
• Bingham (Coussot 1997) – visco-plastic model that describes the ﬂux behavior as a
function of density r, dynamic viscosity m and constant yield stress tc due to cohesion;
• Coulomb (Begueria et al. 2009a) – viscous model that replaces the cohesive term of
the Bingham law with a cohesion-friction combination term, making it dependent not
only on the constant yield stress tc but also on the basal frictional angle j.

Depending on the selected rheology law, the Sf term of Equations (1) and (2) has the
following formulation:

2.3 Input and Output Parameters

The MassMov2D code is distributed under an ‘Attribution Non-Commercial Share
Alike’ license and is implemented within PCRaster (Wesseling et al. 1996, Karssenberg
et al. 2001), a free software developed by the geosciences faculty of Utrecht University.
The model requires a series of raster maps describing the morphology like the sliding
surface topography (digital terrain model without the sliding body), the initial sliding
mass thickness, and the ‘distance map’ representing the cell’s distance from the landslide
toe. Other input parameters that characterize the mass material are the density [kg/m3],
apparent yield stress [Pa], Chèzy roughness coefﬁcient [m/s2], dynamic viscosity [Pa•s],
basal friction angle [deg], internal friction angle of the sliding mass during the expansion
[deg], and the ﬂuid rate [m/s]. This last parameter provides information on the transac-
tion velocity of the sliding mass when it passes from a solid state to a ﬂuid state and,
together with the ‘distance map’, allows deﬁnition of the amount of mass mobilized as a
function of time. It is worth noting that, depending on the selected rheological law,
different sets of parameters are mandatory. In addition the model requires the maximum
time step number and the spatial computational domain to set the simulation.

The main outputs of the model are two time series rasters representing ﬂux velocity
and deposit depth; optionally, additional reports about other variables like volumes or
ﬂux forces can be produced.

3 Case Study

3.1 The Cè Complex Landslide

The Canaria valley is the case study area. It is located in Northern Ticino (Switzerland)
close to the San Gottardo Alps corridor where critical infrastructures for road and train
connections between Central and South Europe are located.

The Canaria valley, with the exception of the Airolo and Madrano villages, has
historically few permanent residents but accounts for numerous visitors and touristic
cottages. At its bottom the Canaria River ﬂows into the Ticino River a few meters away
from the highway and the railway.

From a geological point of view the valley is characterized by two major tectonic
units: the Penninic nappes to the south, and the Gotthard crystalline massif and Mesozoic
sediments, being part of the Helvetic domain, to the north. In particular, the area for this
study is characterized by the presence of dolomites, anhydrites, and gypsum being part
of the Gotthard Mesozoic sedimentary cover, interested by folds and faults with a
sub-vertical axis that create a very complex tectonic structure. Due to this particular
geological setting, the entire region is affected by numerous types of gravitational
phenomena that have produced heavy damage to vacation cottages in the last years. The

Figure 2 Cè rockfall: before and after the 2009 event

most dangerous instability is the complex landslide in the Cè area, located on the left side
of the valley and characterized by the presence of anhydrites; due to hydration caused by
water inﬁltration they turned into gypsum with an increment of the volume up to 60 %
that generated rock fractures followed by karstiﬁcations and weathering. All these
processes are responsible for the general reduction of the rock mass properties and
consequent instability phenomena.

Of particular interest are the events which occurred in 2007, 2009 and 2010. In
2007 a mass of about 40,000 m3 fell from the central part of the landslide crown, and the
deposits arrived close to the river without any consequences. In October 2009, a collapse
of the central and left side of the landslide crown (see Figure 2) involved about
350,000 m3, and in this case the deposits reached the valley bottom and destroyed the
nearby road. Fortunately, the granulometry of the deposit was coarse (mass blocks up to
1,000 m3) and the river ﬂow was not signiﬁcantly interrupted at that time.

In the summer of 2010, due to intense rainfall, the deposits of the 2009 event
together with the debris transported by the river generated a temporary natural dam that
collapsed. The consequent ﬂood wave eroded the river bank, causing the destruction of
a large part of the road (meanwhile rebuilt), and washed away two rural houses. The
generated debris ﬂow did not reach the end of the valley.

3.2 Data

Due to the existing risk situation, the Canaria valley has been monitored for a long time
with regular measurements of hydrometry, groundwater level, snow depth, rainfall, and
superﬁcial displacements (by periodic GPS and total station campaigns). Moreover,
besides the traditional monitoring, the Cè slope is yearly surveyed with terrestrial LiDAR
(Light Detection And Ranging), a technique that allows for dense measuring of surfaces
by means of three-dimensional point clouds. From this type of measure it is possible to
derive accurate digital surface terrain models capturing the topography of the landslide
and of its deposits at a given time.

Regarding the 2009 event, a periodic geodetic survey conducted 10 days before the
failure measured an increase of displacements of monitoring points all over the valley; in
particular in the Cè area, displacements were calculated to range between 3 and 9 cm.
Twelve days after the event, a speciﬁc survey in the Cè area observed additional displace-
ment of the upward part of the slide of 2–3 cm (about 0.2–0.3 cm/day).

Transactions in GIS, 2012, 16(2)

GIS-based Calibration of MassMov2D 221

Additional important observations were derived from LiDAR campaigns. In fact, by
chance, two LiDAR surveys of the landslide area were conducted, one on 26 October
2009, the day before the collapse, and the second a few days after it, on 30 October
2009. These two measurements were particularly crucial in the analysis of the event. In
fact, we could derive pre- and post-event digital terrain models (DTM) at 1 m resolution
by integrating terrestrial laser scanning data with the surrounding available airborne
LiDAR point clouds by means of bilinear spline interpolation (Brovelli et al. 2004).

Afterwards, the depths and shape of the deposit and the initial landslide body were
identiﬁed with high precision by comparing the two terrain models, which is invaluable
information for the correct calibration of MassMov2D. The volumetric analysis recog-
nized a collapsing volume of 353,000 m3 and a deposit volume of 512,000 m3, and this
corresponds to a volume expansion of 45%.

The generation of the model input maps was performed by taking advantage of
several GRASS GIS modules (GRASS Development Team 2011), in particular: (1) the
sliding surface was calculated by subtracting the collapsing body from the pre-event
DTM (r.mapcalc); (2) the collapsing body thickness was evaluated by considering the
negative differences between the post and pre-event DTM multiplied for the cosine of the
slope (r.mapcalc and r.slope.aspect); (3) the distance map from the landslide toe was
obtained by applying the r.grow.distance module to the rasterized limits of the landslide;
and (4) the computational domain map was derived by setting the value of 1 on the
bounding box limits and 0 elsewhere so that the open boundary condition was applied
(r.mapcalc).

MassMov2D does not account for volume expansion caused by the increment of
void volumes. This means that a model result and the ground truthing cannot be
directly compared; for this reason, the deposit thickness (calculated with the same
procedure adopted for the collapsing body thickness) was reduced by a factor of 0.689
(353,000 m3/512,000 m3). In Figure 3 the deposit and the collapsing body thickness are
mapped.

4 Improved Sensitivity Analysis and Calibration of MassMov2D

In order to determine the values of the MassMov2D parameters that allow for the
simulation of future events, of the same type and characterized by the same materials
properties, the authors conducted a sensitivity analysis (Morgan and Henrion 1990) to
identify the parameters that have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the model results and a model
calibration (Hill 1998) to ﬁnd values of model input parameters able to guarantee the
optimal correspondence between observed and simulated data.

To accomplish this task it is very important to focus attention on the landslide
deposits by trying to simulate its values (extension and thickness) as accurately as
possible; for this reason the efﬁciency coefﬁcient N described in Nash and Sutcliffe (1970)
has been integrated into the model code.

In relation to the deposit thickness, the Nash-Sutcliffe coefﬁcient N is formulated as

follows:

is the simulated deposit

The Nash-Sutcliffe coefﬁcient N provides a measure of the simulation goodness-of-ﬁt
(from a quantitative and spatial point of view) with respect to the observations. It is
deﬁned between 1 and -•: when N = 1 simulation and observed values are exactly the
same either in terms of magnitude and space, when N = 0 the model simulations are as
accurate as the average of the observations, ﬁnally when N < 0 the average of the
observations is more accurate than the simulations.

Moreover, the Nash-Sutcliffe coefﬁcient is also used to estimate the time at which a
simulation can be considered concluded: N is evaluated at each time step and if its value
does not vary signiﬁcantly (difference less than 0.0001) in three consecutive steps, the
simulation is closed.

Taking advantage of this model enhancement the user can provide an observed
deposit thickness (eventually reduced to remove the volume expansion) as a new model
input and obtain the ﬁnal simulation Nash-Sutcliffe coefﬁcient value.

4.1 Sensitivity Analysis

The sensitivity analysis is based on a predeﬁned range of parameters values; in Table 1
the selected ranges are reported. For the case study the authors selected the Voellmy
rheological law that has been already successfully applied for the simulation of debris
ﬂows and rock avalanches (Hungr and Evans 1996). The chosen limits of the basal
friction and Chèzy (parameters that deﬁne the Voellmy rheological law) were derived
from the literature (Hungr and Evans 1996, Hungr et al. 2007, Sosio et al. 2008). The

ranges of the internal friction angle and ﬂuidization rate were driven by physically
meaningful limits due to missing literature reference values. Other rheological param-
eters have not been evaluated because they are not used by the applied Voellmy rheology.
The sensitivity analysis was performed in four different simulations sets, and in each
one a single parameter was varied while others took the medium value of the deﬁned
variation range. The results of the simulation sets are graphed in Figure 4 where the
variation of Nash-Sutcliffe coefﬁcient as a function of the variation of the parameter
values is represented.

Figure 4 highlights the high sensitivity of the model to changes of basal friction
values; Chèzy and internal friction coefﬁcients also inﬂuence the model output, although
in a less signiﬁcant way. The ﬂuid rate parameter does not affect the model output
variation (negligible effect). While the curve related to the basal friction is parabolic with
a single maximum value, others curves are characterized by irregular behavior. Irregu-
larities in the relationship between N and these parameters can probably be associated
with numerical instability of the model which affects more the internal friction and Chèzy
coefﬁcients because their effect on the ﬂow depends, respectively, on the velocity and the
velocity squared. Based on these considerations, basal friction, Chèzy and internal
friction coefﬁcients were accounted for in the calibration process, while the ﬂuid rate
parameter was excluded and set to a constant value of 10 m/s.

4.2 Model Calibration

The calibration process consists of searching for the optimal parameter combination that
produces model simulations capable of representing as close as possible the observed
reality. With respect to the sensitivity analysis, in this process all the possible combina-
tions of parameter values within predeﬁned ranges are evaluated by means of the
Nash-Sutcliffe coefﬁcient N.

The work was conducted in two consecutive phases (see Table 2). The ﬁrst was a
coarse calibration that was characterized by high variation and large ranges of parameter
values. This phase allowed us to obtain ﬁner sets of intervals of optimal values identiﬁed
by simulations with N greater than 0.6. The second phase was a ﬁne calibration
performed within the ranges derived by the coarse calibration and with smaller param-
eter value variations. This phase led to the identiﬁcation of optimal parameter sets.

The overall results displayed two optimal sets of parameter values, both character-
ized by Nash-Sutcliffe values of about 0.67. This may be due to the difﬁculty in modeling
values of the Chèzy and internal friction coefﬁcients which, as previously stated, are
inﬂuenced by the velocity; in this case, having no information about the velocity of the
ﬂow during the event, it was not possible to restrict further the range of these two
parameters. The values of the two optimal sets are reported in Table 3.

Compared to set 1, set 2 presents higher values of the Chèzy coefﬁcient and basal
friction angle. These two parameters have an opposite effect on the ﬁnal deposit simulation
(see Equation 7); in fact a higher basal friction angle produces slower ﬂow and thus more
deposition close to the landslide crown, whereas a higher Chèzy value produces a faster
ﬂow (and hence momentum) and thus major deposition at the landslide toe.

Figure 5 Difference map between simulations 1 and 2

These considerations are conﬁrmed by the analysis of the deposition obtained with
the two sets of parameters (simulation 1 applying parameter set 1 and simulation 2
applying set 2). The difference map (Figure 5) shows negligible values, with an absolute
average of about 0.3 m and a standard deviation of about 0.6 m. The image illustrates
deposit depths slightly higher for simulation 1 at the bottom of the accumulation area
(positive values) and lower values in the middle part (negative values). The high values
at the border of the map are due to differences in the extension of the deposit area.
Among the two optimal sets, we selected set 2 because a higher value of the internal
friction angle seems to better represent the physical characteristics of the mass.

Figure 6 shows the differences between the deposit thickness map derived from pre
and post-event DTM (herein after is referred to as OD) and the one generated by the
model. The histogram shows discrepancies varying between -11 m and +11 m, with an
absolute average of 3 m and a standard deviation of 4.1 m.

At the top of the landslide (area 1 of Figure 6) we found negative differences, which
can be due to limitations in the methodology used to derive OD. In fact, the difference
between the pre and post-event maps does not provide information about deposit
thickness in the initial landslide area. Still, we know that actually there was deposition in
this area (see Figure 2), but we cannot perform additional ﬁeld measurements in the
upper part of the landslide because of the existing risk situation.

The central part of the landslide (area 2 of Figure 6) is the most critical area; here the
model underestimates the deposition. We can suppose that this problem in the simulation
arises because of the steepness of the terrain.

The northern part of the deposition (area 3 in Figure 6) cannot actually be evaluated
because in that area the laser scanning data were not available due to the presence of
obstructions during the surveys. Here the post-event DTM has been interpolated and
thus cannot be considered representative of the real terrain morphology.

The remaining parts of the simulated deposit near the river are almost in perfect
agreement with reality; here the differences are very limited and the maximum deposit
depth observed (21.8 m) is well reproduced by the model (20.4 m).

Figure 7 shows a comparison of the two deposit depth proﬁles illustrated in Figure 6.
The A-A′ transect underlines the difﬁculties of the model in reproducing observed data in
the central part of the landslide; here the presence of high slopes indicates that the model
seems unable to arrest the material. Nevertheless, close to the river, the accuracy of the

model increases drastically. The transect B-B′ conﬁrms the good accuracy of the simula-
tion in this area.

It is worth noting that the capability of the model to accurately reproduce the
bottom valley deposit is really important. In fact, in case of risk due to temporary dam
breaks, it is essential to correctly identify the shape and height of the natural dam; this
allows correct estimation of water volumes and ﬂash ﬂood or debris ﬂow runout.

5 Risk Scenario

The 2010 event is a clear example of the expected threatening scenario; the recent
reactivation of the movements, identiﬁed by numerous ﬁeld inspections, could lead to new
landslides. Those, adding further deposits, are likely to increase the intensity of an eventual
debris ﬂow that in this case might reach the houses of Airolo and the transportation
infrastructures of the north-south route. According to geological surveys and ﬁeld evidence
there is the risk of a future new collapse of the right side of the landslide crown. Geological
and structural analysis carried out on the 2009 rockfall event together with recent
geo-morphological surveys were used to map the probable area of instability (Figure 8),
characterized by a mass of about 275,000 m3 and an average thickness of 33 m.

Under the hypothesis that the expected terrain failure generates a landslide of the
same material and mechanism as the 2009 event, we can assume that the optimal
parameters set identiﬁed with the calibration can be used to predict the expected deposit.
Simulation results are proposed in Figure 9. It should be noted that the deposit thickness

values obtained from the model have been corrected for volume expansion with the
coefﬁcient of volume variation mentioned in the previous paragraph; the same value used
in the calibration process was applied.

The simulation forecasts a deposit that affects both the street and the stream in a very
narrow valley point. Taking advantage of the r.watershed GRASS module it was possible
to identify the river path in the vicinity of the accumulation. The CC′ transect (Figure 9)
shows that the deposit intersects the river bed for about 250 m reaching values of
maximum thickness of 32 m.

6 Motivation for Porting MassMov2D to GRASS GIS

Currently the porting of the MassMov2D code to the GIS GRASS is being executed. With
the exception of a few routines written in the C language, the original code is based on the
scripting language of PCRaster; if this approach has the advantage of easier understanding
and access to the code by scientists, it has the disadvantage of slowing down the
computational time, due to numerous system calls and disk writing and reading. More-
over, with the porting of the code to GRASS, MassMov2D will move from the current
‘Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike’ to the General Public License (GPL) that will
guarantee the right to access, modify, redistribute and use the code. This will permit access
to all the primitive functions for their modiﬁcation, a fact that is not currently guaranteed
by PCRaster, which is free but partially proprietary software with a closed source core.
Furthermore, the GPL will authorize the development of ad-hoc graphical user interfaces

to support user friendly usage of the code, currently forbidden by PCRaster. Finally, the
users will also have the right to run the software in commercial projects.

7 Conclusions

This research has improved the MassMov2D model by implementing a new feature that
simpliﬁes and optimizes the sensitivity analysis and calibration within a GIS. In fact, the
Nash-Sutcliffe coefﬁcient allows for evaluating the goodness-of-ﬁt of the simulation with
respect to the observation surface from both a spatial and a quantitative point of view.
The application of the modiﬁed version of the model in a case study allowed us to
understand the model parameters and to obtain an optimal set of values capable of
reproducing the observed event. The availability of high resolution surfaces of the area
before and after the collapse enabled the effective evaluation of the model capability in
simulating complex landslides in a unique way. Such precise data is very seldom
available.

The results of our analysis demonstrate that the model is capable of reproducing the
deposits near the valley bottom, which in the case study is the most important area in
terms of expected risk scenario evaluation. Nevertheless, some differences with the
observations were identiﬁed in the presence of high slopes. In the opinion of the authors,
this deﬁciency is partly because there was no information on the dynamics of the event
(evolution in time of the runout) to better calibrate the model, and partly because of the
assumptions of the model, which describe the mass movement as a ﬂux. Another
important factor that may contribute to this deﬁciency is the volume expansion that
occurs during mass movement; this fact was accounted during the calibration by apply-
ing a constant reduction factor on the observations and during the simulation by
applying a constant expansion factor to the calculated deposit. A better modeling of this
phenomenon could lead to better calibration and therefore to better simulations. For this
reason the authors plan to conduct future research on this topic.

The simulation run with the expected risk scenario showed that a deposit thickness
slightly higher than 30 m could affect the river bed. This suggests that an important ﬂash
ﬂood may occur and therefore a detailed simulation of debris-ﬂow downstream is
required for assessing the risk of transport infrastructure damage. This investigation is
now being performed and will be estimated by means of the r.damﬂood module devel-
oped in GRASS by Cannata and Marzocchi (2012).

As a ﬁnal comment, we can conclude that the open access to the source code was a
prerequisite to modify and enhance the model. The Free and Open Source Software gives
the opportunity of generating open research where many researchers may collaboratively
participate at different levels. As a result, after the code porting and license migration, the
model will have more chance to be tested and improved by scientists.

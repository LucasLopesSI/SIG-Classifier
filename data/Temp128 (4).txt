This article introduces a novel geographical information system toolkit for measur-
ing and mapping the accessibility of individuals to services. The toolkit contributes
to earlier implementations by combining aspects of both place-based and person-based
accessibility measures. To this end, place-based accessibility measures are derived from
a person-based framework by considering space–time prisms that are centred at service
facilities rather than individual anchor points. The implementation is also innovative by
explicitly accounting for the opening hours of service delivery in its accessibility mea-
surement. In addition, the toolkit is aimed to be user-friendly and to generate insightful
and comprehensible results for non-technically oriented users, which is illustrated in a
brief case study about library accessibility in Ghent (Belgium).

Keywords: accessibility; GIS toolkit; place-based approach; space–time prism

Introduction

1.
Accessibility is a fundamental concept in transport geography and urban planning. It refers
to the individuals’ ability to travel and participate in activities given the available trans-
port and land use system (Pirie 1979, Pooler 1987). To assess accessibility, researchers
have relied on various accessibility measures. Roughly, these can be divided into place-
based and person-based measures (Miller 2007). Place-based measures associate a level
of accessibility with a location or spatial unit of analysis (e.g. census tract, ward and trafﬁc
analysis zone). They express accessibility in terms of physical separation between desired
activity locations and a key location in an individual’s daily life, such as the residence or
workplace. The family of place-based measures includes such well-known and commonly
applied accessibility measures as the travel time or distance to the nearest opportunity and
the number of opportunities within a particular area or within a speciﬁc cut-off distance
from a given location. Rigid, easily implementable and insightful, place-based measures
have often been criticised as they tend to reduce individual travel behaviour to a (set of) key
location(s), while ignoring important temporal constraints on activity behaviour such as the
opening hours of urban opportunities and the limited availability of discretionary time on
the part of an individual (Neutens et al. 2010b). This criticism has called a foundation for
the development of person-based accessibility measures.

Person-based measures are speciﬁed at the lowest level amenable to the social sci-
ences, that is, the individual. Drawing on the concepts of time geography (Hägerstrand
1970), these measures express accessibility on the basis of detailed observations of the
spatiotemporal constraints individuals are faced with. Hence, person-based measures allow
accessibility to ﬂuctuate during the course of the day as well as across persons, as has
been shown by, among others, Kwan (1998, 1999), Kim and Kwan (2003), Casas (2007),
Miller (2007), Schwanen and De Jong (2008), Yu and Shaw (2008), Neutens et al. (2010b,
2010c) and Páez et al. (2010). While more subtle and detailed, they are also more complex
to calculate than the place-based measures – although this difﬁculty has been increas-
ingly overcome by the growing capabilities of geographical information systems (GISs)
in recent years. In addition, the assessment of person-based accessibility requires dedi-
cated and representative information about the activities (e.g. travel diaries) of sampled
individuals, which is in many cases unavailable or at least difﬁcult to collect.

From a cartographical point of view, person-based measures have an important dis-
advantage over place-based measures, as they cannot be mapped in a straightforward
manner. This is because person-based measures associate accessibility values with indi-
viduals instead of locations. Three alternative approaches have been used to represent
person-based accessibility on a map (Figure 1). A ﬁrst approach consists of delineating all
locations that are accessible to an individual by mapping one’s potential path area (PPA)
or feasible opportunity set in between two or more pairs of ﬁxed activities (see, e.g. Kwan
1999, p. 215, Kim and Kwan 2003, p. 85, Weber 2003, p. 57, Miller and Bridwell 2009,
p. 68) (Figure 1a). Second, individual accessibility values may be mapped at locations
where an individual spends much time during the day, such as the residence or work place.
Examples of such maps are available in Weber and Kwan (2002, p. 232), Weber (2003,
p. 61) and Neutens et al. (2010c, p. 1051) (Figure 1b). As argued by Weber and Kwan
(2002), this representation may be misleading because the values assigned to static loca-
tions do not depend on these locations but rather on individuals who may travel widely
throughout the study area. Third, person-based accessibility can be aggregated across indi-
viduals and mapped at the activity locations, for instance, by using the concept of locational
beneﬁts (see, e.g. Miller 1999, p. 827, Neutens et al. 2010a, p. 1206) (Figure 1c).

A problem with the three person-based accessibility maps in Figure 1 is that they fail
to represent the ﬂuctuation of individual accessibility values across every single location

in the study area. This is in contrast with place-based accessibility, which can be easily
summarised in a conventional area-covering map in which each location is allotted a unique
accessibility value (e.g. see some recently published maps by El-Geneidy and Levinson
(2007), Nettleton et al. (2007), Achuthan et al. (2010), Colclough and Owens (2010), Drew
and Rowe (2010) and Lei and Church (2010)).

This article attempts to make a link between place-based and person-based tools
by introducing PrismMapper, a GIS toolkit for measuring and mapping accessibility
to service facilities. To this end, we will consider place-based measures that imple-
ment person-based concepts building on time geography. In addition, the toolkit is
intended to be simple, robust and comprehensible such that it is directly appealing to all
kinds of end-users. The toolkit is available from http://geoweb.ugent.be/cartogis/research/
prismmapper. The remainder of the article is structured as follows. The next section dis-
cusses related tools to measure accessibility and provides a motivation for the current
contribution. Section 3 presents the toolkit and the accessibility measures it implements.
To illustrate its relevance for policy makers, a case study on the accessibility of pub-
lic libraries in Ghent (Belgium) is elaborated in Section 4, followed by conclusions in
Section 5.

2. Related tools

Many existing information systems and services implement accessibility measures in vari-
ous ways. GPS devices and routing systems, for instance, are able to calculate travel times
and distances, that is, simple place-based accessibility measures. These implementations,
however, are usually a black box to the user. Web services, such as the OpenRouteService
(http://openrouteservice.org) (Neis et al. 2007), the National Accessibility Map of the
Netherlands (http://www.bereikbaarheidskaart.nl) and the recently released Mapniﬁcent
(http://www.mapniﬁcent.net), offer explicit tools to map accessibility measures. Although
useful, such services are often limited on two aspects: (i) meta-information on the data
sources and exact methods they use to assess the implemented accessibility measures and
by consequence (ii) the freedom they offer the user to manipulate or conﬁgure these data
and methods.

On the other hand, dedicated GIS packages or extensions, most of which implement
place-based measures, can cope with the above shortcomings. Travel times and distances
are supported in many GIS packages by the calculation of either beeline distances in uncon-
strained space or shortest paths within a geographic network. A noteworthy toolkit going
beyond these simple measures is Flowmap (http://ﬂowmap.geog.uu.nl), developed at the
University of Utrecht and released in 1990. Flowmap has been speciﬁcally designed to
handle spatial ﬂow patterns, and also support computing travel costs along a network,
and model the market areas of existing or planned facilities. In 1998, the Environment
Systems Research Institute (ESRI®) introduced the Network Analyst extension of its
ArcViewTM software (nowadays ArcGISTM). The Network Analyst allows calculating
and mapping shortest paths, nearest facilities and service areas over a given network
(N. N. 1998). O’Sullivan et al. (2000) have described a desktop GIS application to map
isochrones for accessing facilities through public transport. In 2004, Liu and Zhu (2004)
have presented their own ArcGISTM accessibility extension. Although their implementa-
tion includes tools that are currently also covered by the Network Analyst extensions, such
as origin–destination travel cost matrices, it additionally supports more complicated place-
based measures such as gravity- and utility-based measures and catchment proﬁles. Despite
the authors’ argumentation that the extension is available to a wide range of users, any

further reference on how to obtain and use their toolkit is regretfully missing. The same is
true for the recent Urban.Access tool (Benenson et al. 2010) that allows for the mapping
of place-based measures based on detailed car and bus travel times.

Regarding person-based accessibility, especially in the ﬁeld of exploratory spatiotem-
poral data analysis and visualisation, several implementations exist which may assist
the assessment of person-based accessibility measures without explicitly operationalising
these (e.g. Andrienko and Andrienko 1998, Kraak 2003, Yu 2006, Andrienko et al. 2009,
Andrienko et al. 2010). In addition, there have been early operationalisations of funda-
mental time geographical concepts such as (Lenntorp 1976, Kitamura et al. 1981, Landau
et al. 1982, Kondo and Kitamura 1987, Villoria 1989, Nishii and Kondo 1992). These have
been characterised by an unrealistic modelling of the travel environment as they ignore the
transportation network (Kwan and Hong 1998). This shortcoming has been addressed later
in both theoretical (Neutens et al. 2007, Miller and Bridwell 2009, Kuijpers et al. 2010)
and empirical works (Kwan 1998, Kwan and Hong 1998, Kim and Kwan 2003, Kwan and
Weber 2003, Neutens et al. 2010b, 2010c).

In 2000, Miller and Wu (2000) introduced the ﬁrst true person-based toolbox that
allows mapping three different beneﬁt measures for an individual to participate at discre-
tionary activities in space and time. This prototype is a user-friendly front-end/back-end
application for measuring an individual’s accessibility. Recently, Neutens et al. (2010d)
presented a stand-alone person-based accessibility toolkit for assessing the opportunities
for joint activity participation. Their toolkit provides a dynamic and animated view of the
activity locations that are accessible to a person or group during the course of the day.
Both toolkits are characterised by a sincere demand for detailed input data about the indi-
vidual activity schedules. Not only is such information merely occasionally available for
a sample of individuals, it is also questionable whether this sample data are representative
in all its dimensions for the associated population. This delicate issue has never been pro-
foundly addressed in studies on person-based accessibility, which questions the usefulness
of the related tools. More than that, given that the necessary information would be avail-
able, these toolkits are unable to generate maps of the accessibility of an entire population
– let alone area-covering maps (cf. Figure 1) – thereby passing over the synoptic power
of maps. This could be considered a signiﬁcant inadequacy in the eyes of decision mak-
ers or urban planners dissuading them from using these tools. In addition, both toolkits
implement comparable beneﬁt measures that are obtained from complex utility functions.
The complexity of these functions obscures the interpretation for end-users who do not
have prior knowledge about time geography and accessibility modelling. Finally, a last
and perhaps most poignant point of critique is that the toolkits nullify the added value of
person-based measures as they only account for the spatiotemporal constraints on the part
of the individual while neglecting the time constraints on the part of the urban facilities
(e.g. opening hours and waiting times).

The PrismMapper toolkit introduced in this article aims to contribute to the set
of existing implementations in at least three ways. First, it tends to support a com-
prehensible set of simple and rigid place-based accessibility measures. That is to say,
the measures should be meaningful, interpretable and self-evident, even for end-users
who are not acquainted with the accessibility literature. Second, while taking advan-
tage of the mapping opportunities of place-based measures, it seeks to implement some
temporal properties that are implied in person-based measures by considering reverse
space–time prisms (RSTPs) (see Section 3.1). Third, PrismMapper accounts for the space–
time constraints of service delivery by explicitly considering the opening hours of service
facilities.

3. PrismMapper

This section will ﬁrst describe the place-based accessibility measures implemented in
PrismMapper and then give an overview of the system.

3.1. Accessibility measures

Most person-based measures rely on the well-known time geographical framework origi-
nated in the 1970s by Hägerstrand (1970). The basic unit of analysis in time geography is
the space–time path, that is, an individual’s daily trajectory in space and time. Space–time
paths comply with three types of constraints: (i) an individual’s physiological capabilities
(capacity constraints), (ii) an individual’s commitments that bind him/her to speciﬁc loca-
tions and time budgets (coupling constraints) and (iii) rules stemming from norms and laws
(authority constraints). These constraints delineate a set of space–time points accessible,
that is, physically reachable, by the individual. The subset of this set which corresponds
to an individual’s space–time budget that is available between an origin and a destination
is referred to as a space–time prism (STP). The origin and destination are denoted as the
anchor points of the STP. STPs are typically represented in a 3D space–time cube where a
vertical time axis is integrated with a ﬂattened topography (Figures 2 and 3a). The STP of
an individual with a time budget from ti to tj between an origin o and a destination d can
be formally described as follows:

(cid:2)
o, d, ti, tj

(cid:3)

STP

(cid:4)

(x, t) |ti ≤ t ≤ tj(cid:2)T (o, x) ≤ (t − ti) (cid:2)T (x, d) ≤

(cid:3)(cid:5)

(cid:2)
tj − t

with T (o, x) the travel time from o to x and T (x, d) the travel time from x to d. In the
case of an isotropic travel environment with a constant ﬁnite maximum velocity – as has
been understood in Figures 2 and 3 – a STP is obtained from the intersection of a cone
oriented forward in time and a cone oriented backward in time (Miller 2005). These cones,
respectively, represent the condition that all parts of the STP should be reachable from the
origin within the time budget and that the destination should be reachable within the time
budget from each point of the STP.

Although the STP is a powerful concept to model a global level of an individual’s phys-
ical accessibility, many studies have used it to assess, speciﬁcally, individual accessibility to

services by simply considering a service accessible on the basis of the presence of its loca-
tion within the STP (e.g. Neutens et al. 2010d). Hence, they overlook the time constraints of
services, which are however only delivered and thus accessible within well-deﬁned open-
ing hours. Therefore, in addition to STPs, PrismMapper accounts for the opening hour
regimes of facilities in order to decide on their accessibility (see Equation (2) further on in
this section).

The cartographical equivalent of a STP, that is, its spatial footprint, is called a PPA
(Figure 2). As one individual may have more than two anchor points in the course of a day
and thus multiple STPs, the mapping of PPAs across multiple individuals soon becomes
cluttered (cf. Figure 1a). To overcome this cartographical problem, PrismMapper considers
RSTPs that are centred at service facilities instead of individual anchor points, and which
we will refer to as RSTPs. The RSTP for a facility f and its opening hour time slot from tp
to tq with respect to a time budget from tq to tj, a maximum travel time c and a minimum
activity duration m are given by

The RSTP comprises all space–time points from which an individual may travel to a facil-
ity in order to visit it for at least a given amount of time during its opening hour such that
the individual may return back to his/her origin within the given time budget and maxi-
mum travel time. The difference between a STP and a RSTP is illustrated in several cross
sections through space–time shown in Figure 3. Instead of looking at the accessible loca-
tions in between two anchor points, the PPAs of RSTPs capture all anchor points that may
be interpreted as valid pairs of a coinciding origin and destination, such that an individual
can travel from the origin to visit the facility and return to the destination within the time
budget and travel time threshold at hand. The interpretation of such back-and-forth trips
is straightforward, as they are common in daily life, especially with respect to residential
locations, that is, home–facility–home trips.

In contrast to conventional STPs, RSTPs are not obtained from the intersection of two
cones, as they are determined by different conditions. Figure 3a–c shows how different
RSTPs evolve from different conﬁgurations of the individual time budget and the facility
opening hour. The RSTPs have a cylindroconical shape that is determined by the ultimate
anchor points from where the facility can be reached for a certain minimum duration during
its opening time window and that can thereafter be returned to within the time budget and
within the considered maximum travel time.

The boundary of a RSTP may have several bends at the space–time points where
different constraints meet. A bend between the conical and the cylindrical part of an
RSTP may occur at the cut-off distance corresponding to the maximum travel time c,
as applies to Figure 3b and d. In these cases, the distance corresponds to the half of
c because travel times are symmetrical in isotropic space. In Figure 3a and c smaller
cut-off threshold applies, given that there is less time to return within the time bud-
get after a meaningful visit to the facility. Furthermore, it is noted that the RSTP in
Figure 3b has a second, inner bend in its conical shape, which occurs at the intersec-
tion of ultimate anchor points from where the facility can be reached at its closing
time and those that can still be returned to from the facility at the end of the time
budget.

RSTPs have an essential property:

∀ (x, t) ∈ RSTP

(cid:2)
f , tp, tq, ti, tj, c, m

(cid:3)

, ∀tx < t(cid:2)tx ≥ ti : (x, tx) ∈ RSTP

(cid:2)
f , tp, tq, ti, tj, c, m

(cid:3)

(3)

Thus, for each space–time point of a RSTP, all coinciding space–time points at an earlier
instant within the time budget belong to the RSTP as well. In other words, from each
anchor location within a RSTP, an individual may always leave earlier within the time

.

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

RSTPs differ signiﬁcantly from traditional STPs in being independent from individual
anchor points. This is advantageous in several respects. First, it takes away the requirement
of high-level individual activity/travel data. Second, this is also desirable from a computa-
tional point of view, as RSTPs have only to be calculated once in total, instead of once for
each individual. Finally, yet most importantly, given a set of facilities with their opening
hours and a presumed time budget, maximum travel time and minimum activity duration,
RSTPs are representative for all anchor locations. Thus, area-covering maps may be pro-
duced to represent the PPAs of RSTPs, which will be PrismMapper’s core functionality.

In addition, a parameter n expressing the minimum number of accessible facilities is intro-
duced. This parameter has been absent in the accessibility measures’ formulas, but can
be easily implemented by considering in Equations (5)–(10) only these x, ti, tj for which
ACCESS(x, ti, tj, F, c, m) is true for at least n facilities.

Unlike the implicit assumption of an isotropic travel environment and a constant max-
imum travelling velocity underlying Figures 2 and 3, PrismMapper implements all the
above accessibility measures within a much more realistic network-based travel environ-
ment with maximum travelling velocity varying all across the network (see Section 3.2).

3.2. System
The PrismMapper system has three main components: (i) a GIS component, (ii) a com-
putational module (CM) and (iii) a graphical user interface. PrismMapper is embedded in
ESRI®’s ArcGISTM Desktop GIS software as an ArcMapTM project template. ArcGISTM
Desktop is ESRI®’s most important desktop GIS product, offering a comprehensive
set of tools to manipulate, analyse, visualise and store geospatial data in general and
network-based data, including some place-based accessibility measures (see Section 2),
in particular. Embedding PrismMapper as a project template enables the integration of its
functionality with the yet extended set of ArcGISTM tools. The form of a project template
ensures an easy distribution of the toolkit, as well as no installation requirements.

The core of the PrismMapper toolkit is the CM. It consists of several code modules
written in Visual Basic using the ArcObjects object model (Burke 2003). CM is responsible
for the calculation and mapping of the accessibility measures presented in Section 3.1.
To this end, CM relies on the following input data:

(cid:129) Network dataset ND;
(cid:129) Travel time attribute T;
(cid:129) Set of facilities F;
(cid:15)
(cid:14)
(cid:129) Time budget
ti, tj
(cid:129) Maximum travel time c;
(cid:129) Minimum activity duration m;
(cid:129) Minimum number of accessible facilities n;
(cid:129) Accessibility measure AM.

;

The network dataset ND represents a transportation network that delineates the considered
travel environment and thus the area of potential anchor locations. Networks are speci-
ﬁed as ArcGISTM Network Datasets that may be created from all kinds of data sources
that participate in a transportation network such as road segments, junctions and turns.
PrismMapper requires this network to have at least one travel time attribute T (i.e. an
impedance attribute expressed in temporal units) to enable the calculation of travel times.
Optionally, some additional network analysis settings can be conﬁgured, including a dis-
tance threshold for matching facility locations to the network, and restrictions to account
for when calculating shortest paths (e.g. one-way traversable network segments).

A facility dataset F consists at least of the location and the opening hours for a set
of service facilities. Facility locations are obtained either from a point data source or by
manually picking them on screen. They should be covered by the study area delimited by
the ND. The facility locations are matched to the nearest network location on the ND on the
basis of a spatial search threshold which is conﬁgurable by the user. The opening hours are
represented by their weekly schedules, that is, a set of non-overlapping time intervals, given
that this is the most common manner to express the opening hours of service facilities.
Opening hours can be speciﬁed manually or they can be loaded from a text ﬁle.

The computation of AM proceeds as follows. First, the set F is ﬁltered to F(cid:7) which
includes only those facilities of which the opening hours have a temporal overlap with
(step 1). Second, for each facility f in F(cid:7), the module calculates all
the time budget
shortest paths within the threshold time tj – ti according to the attribute T. This is done once
for all paths towards f (step 2) and once for all paths from f (step 3) in order to obtain all
necessary travel costs T (x, f ) and T (f , x) required in Equation (2). Next, the intersection
of all shortest paths towards and away from the same facility is made for each facility (step
4). For each network location which is on at least n of such shortest path pairs, the module
proceeds with assessing AM using the respective formula of Equations (5)–(10) (step 5).
The ﬁnal accessibility results are spatially summarised to the level of network segments
and stored as a polyline shapeﬁle.

After the computation of the accessibility results, these are mapped within the
ArcGISTM map environment. Map type and symbolisation are chosen according to the
data type of AM (see Section 3.1):

(cid:129) The network locations for which ACCESS is true are represented through a single-

value map by means of a simple solid bright green line symbol;

(cid:129) CUMF, MINT and MAXD are mapped onto a chloropleth map with in between ﬁve
and seven equal interval classes. These classes are symbolised through solid line
symbols with colours ranging from bright green for the network locations in the
most accessible class to bright red for the locations in the least accessible class;
(cid:129) MINTF and MAXDF are expressed by a chorochromatic map using a random colour

ramp to associate each facility with a unique colour.

A useful toolkit should be reasonably efﬁcient in terms of computation time and resources.
The bottleneck operation in PrismMapper is the calculation of the accessibility measures
described above (steps 1–5). Theoretical time complexity limits have not been listed here,
as each computation step calls on a number of ArcGISTM subroutines for which the precise
algorithms are not available. The overall computational efﬁciency will highly depend on the
size of the preset time budget, the maximum travel time and minimum activity duration, the
number and spatial conﬁguration of facilities with opening hours during the time budget,
as well as on the scale, density and velocity characteristics of the transportation network
at hand. Absolute computation times may ﬂuctuate depending on the system platform and
the exact version of ArcGISTM.

As a reference, we have reported the absolute run times of a scalability experiment
which considered varying conﬁgurations in terms of maximum travel time, minimum activ-
ity duration and number of opened facilities during the time budget. To this end, a Tele
Atlas MultiNet® road network database for the province of East Flanders (Belgium) includ-
ing 16,473 points of interest was employed. Seven different series of computation scenarios
were set up by taking a random selection of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 points
of interest – such that the larger selection contains the smaller selections – as facilities
opened from 9:00 A.M. to 17:00 P.M. For each of the series, all accessibility measures
have been calculated (steps 1–5) according to the seven scenarios through an invariable
of 120 min from 12:00 P.M. to 14:00 P.M. and an increasing maximum
time budget
travel time c of 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min (and a proportionally decreasing min-
imum activity duration m such that c + m = 120 min). All 49 (7 × 7) scenarios were
processed on a 2.4-GHz Intel® CoreTM i5 450M CPU running Windows 7 and ArcGISTM

9.3.1. The resulting run times are plotted in Figure 4. As could be expected, computation
time increases with an increasing number of opened facilities and an increasing maximum
travel time (decreasing minimum activity duration). The increase due to maximum travel
time seems to level off somewhat from c = 60 onwards. This effect may be explained by
the growing number of shortest paths that meet the limits of the study area for higher travel
times (e.g. a maximum travel time of 120 min covers the large majority of possible trips
within the network of East Flanders). Considering the high density and complexity of the
road network in East Flanders (66,771 junctions and 85,025 segments for 13,673 km of
roads over an area of 2,982 km2), we conclude on the basis of observed computation times
that the toolkit is sufﬁciently adequate for the purpose of large-scale accessibility analyses.
According to the underlying objective, the PrismMapper’s graphical user interface
is kept particularly simple. The toolkit’s main application window and the associated
workﬂow are depicted in Figures 5 and 6.

4. Case study
In this section, we will elaborate a case study to illustrate the application of the
PrismMapper toolkit. The study will examine the variation in accessibility to the public
libraries in Ghent (Belgium) according to the alternative scenarios of space–time con-
straints on the part of the individual as well as the libraries. A transportation network for
Ghent has been compiled from Tele Atlas MultiNet® road network data. Car travel times
can be estimated from this network using the shortest travel time attribute. The locations,
presented in Figure 7, and weekly opening hours of Ghent’s municipal libraries have been
obtained from the ofﬁcial city website (http://www.gent.be). Ghent has one central main
library and ﬁfteen smaller branch libraries dispersed across the city.

4.1. Reference scenario
In order to conﬁgure the individual settings, we will consider persons who would like
to make an evening library visit of at least half an hour1 during a one-hour time budget
on Monday from 6:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M., and who do not want to travel by car for more
than 20 min in total. This conﬁguration is also depicted in Figure 6. The accessibility

maps for CUMF, MINT and MAXD for this reference scenario are shown in Figures 8–10.
In general, they reﬂect a high library accessibility. At least one library can be visited from
practically everywhere in Ghent, with up to 14 libraries downtown (Figure 8).

The MINT map in Figure 9 indicates that the minimum total travel time required to
visit the nearest accessible facility is fairly limited (below 10 min on most locations), given
the number of opened facilities and their spatial dispersion across the city. Note that the
MINT maps reﬂect physical proximity in a nuanced manner as they neatly articulate the
discordance between network-based proximity, captured by back-and-forth shortest paths,
and beeline proximity read from the map. Especially the directional nature of network
segments may cause higher travel times than the expected. Many locations in the vicinity
of the main library, for instance, have rather high travel times due to the predominance of
one-way streets in that part of city.

The MAXD map in Figure 10 shows that the maximum feasible visiting duration ranges
from 40 to 60 min. This is a corollary of the preset maximum total travel time of 20 min
on the one hand and a maximal visiting time from 6:00 P.M. (start of the time budget) to
7:00 P.M. (the closing time of the libraries on Monday). Within the larger part of Ghent, a
library can be visited for over 50 min, that is, more than 83% of the time budget.

Figure 6. PrismMapper main application window.

In the remainder of this section, we will compare the accessibility results for the
reference scenario to those obtained for other scenarios by varying the time budget, trans-
port mode, travel costs and facility opening hours, respectively. Summary statistics for
the numerical measures CUMF, MINT and MAXD have been listed for each scenario in
Table 1.

4.2. Time budget
Individuals differ much in terms of the time budgets they dispose of for conducting dis-
cretionary activities (Schwanen et al. 2008). PrismMapper allows for investigating how
different time budgets affect accessibility. This is demonstrated in two alternative cases.

The ﬁrst case involves a time squeeze scenario where the start of the time budget is
postponed with a quarter of an hour from 6:00 P.M. to 6:15 P.M. (the end of the time
budget being preserved at 7:00 P.M.). The resulting CUMF map is shown in Figure 11.
The effect of the time squeeze on the number of accessible libraries is general and strong.

Figure 7. Public libraries in Ghent (Belgium).

A signiﬁcant decrease is observed, when compared to the reference CUMF map (Figure 8),
with some parts in the north of Ghent now being deprived from accessing a library. Yet, the
reduced time budget allows individuals to visit at least one library from within the major
part of Ghent.

In addition to the size of the time budget, timing effects may inﬂuence one’s accessi-
bility of services as well. To illustrate the implications of having the same amount of time
available at another moment, Figure 12 provides the CUMF map in case the reference time
budget is shifted from Monday to Tuesday. On Tuesday evening at most three libraries can
be visited, even in the city centre, and a considerable part of the more peripheral areas have
no library access at all. This is a sheer consequence of the fact that only the main library
and branches 2 and 4 are opened on Tuesday evening. Nevertheless, these three libraries
still manage to serve Ghent reasonably well in this scenario, due to their relative dispersion
across the city.

4.3. Transport mode
So far, we have considered library accessibility by car. To examine the inﬂuence of different
transport modes, we have recalculated the reference scenario for the case of bicycle

1145

accessibility. Bicycles are a popular means of transport in Ghent and cycling is considered
the most efﬁcient way to travel across the city centre, especially within certain groups of
the population such as students2 and young adults. It is noted that public transportation
cannot be dealt with by the current version of the toolkit. This would require implementing
additional network algorithms for coping with the schedules and frequencies of various
transport modes.

Since the MultiNet® network data does not contain a dedicated bicycle travel time
attribute, we have estimated cycling travel times using a compromise solution. The
approach consists of excluding highways and other exclusive motorways from the road
network and allowing travel directions for non-motorised travellers3. The travel times have
been estimated as the division of the shortest path distance and an average cycling speed
of 15 km/h (El-Geneidy et al. 2007).

The resulting map for MINT is presented in Figure 13. Libraries can be accessed on
Monday evening by bicycle from within the larger part of Ghent. As could be expected,
the car offers a better accessibility of the libraries and generally smaller travel times
(Figure 10), although this difference is less obvious in the inner city.

M. Delafontaine et al.

Figure 9. Map of MINT for the reference scenario.

4.4. Opening hours
The above scenarios vary in terms of the constraints they impose on the part of the indi-
vidual (time budget and transport mode), that is, the demand side. Other opportunities
lie in applying different conﬁgurations on the supply side, that is, the service facilities.
PrismMapper supports the analysis of variations of both the location and the operating
hours of service facilities. Such comparative analyses may assist policy makers in facil-
ity planning and management, such as ﬁnding a suitable location for a new facility or
rescheduling the regime of opening hours across facilities.

As an example, we have taken a potential facility closing scenario, for example, due
to budget cuts. Given that branch library 13 has the smallest collection size and the sec-
ond smallest number of borrowers in 2010 (http://www.gent.be), we have considered the
case of closing this library on Monday evening. The resulting accessibility map for MAXD
is shown in Figure 14. It observed that the effect on feasible visiting duration of closing
branch 13 on Monday evening is minimal: the duration is merely reduced within the small
neighbourhood that directly surrounds the library, whereas the rest of Ghent remains unaf-
fected. In addition, a fairly acceptable visiting duration remains feasible within the affected
area, because the closed library is located in the well-served central area and close to the
yet opened main library and library 3.

5. Conclusion
This article has introduced a novel GIS toolkit, named PrismMapper, for measuring and
mapping the accessibility of individuals to services. The toolkit aims to combine beneﬁts
of both place-based and person-based accessibility measures basing on the time geograph-
ical concept of a STP. Through the consideration of RSTPs, PPAs can be derived that are

representative for individual anchor locations in general rather than for one individual in
particular. Thus, a foundation for deriving place-based measures has been obtained on the
basis of person-based constraints including individual time budget, maximum travel time
and minimum activity duration. PrismMapper is also innovative in explicitly accounting
for the opening hours of services in its assessment of accessibility. Accounting for the
temporal component of service delivery is critical in order to assist the temporal plan-
ning of service facilities and the evaluation of temporal policies. Explicit attention to
time constraints in accessibility measurement is also important in the light of recognition
of time and coordination problems in contemporary Western societies (see, e.g. Moccia
2000, Deffner 2005, Southerton and Tomlinson 2005, Anxo and Boulin 2006, Boulin 2006,
Szollos 2009). It also aligns with the emerging interest in time poverty issues in the social
exclusion literature (Kenyon et al. 2003, Lyons 2003, Cass et al. 2005, Neutens et al.
2010c, Farber et al. 2011).

The analysis capabilities of PrismMapper have been illustrated in a case study of
accessibility to public libraries in Ghent (Belgium). The study has demonstrated how
PrismMapper can be applied to generate accessibility maps according to alternative sce-
narios of constraints considered both on the part of the individual (time budget, activity

duration and mobility resources) and on the part of the facilities (facility locations and
opening hours). Investigation of the effects of such constraints on the accessibility of ser-
vices can be useful for, among others, planners and decision makers who are faced with the
planning and optimisation of services. The toolkit may, for example, be used to assess the
suitability of a new facility location or to evaluate opening hour policies (e.g. Neutens et al.
2010c, Delafontaine et al. 2011, Neutens et al. 2011, Neutens et al. 2012). Other oppor-
tunities lie within transport studies. In Section 4, the difference between car and bicycle
accessibility has been studied. Alternative possibilities include analysing the impact of
congestion (e.g. by associating different travel cost attributes to different time budgets)
(Bilbao-Ubillos 2008, Noland 2008) or modiﬁcations to the transport infrastructure (Meyer
and Miller 2001, Vandenbulcke et al. 2009).

Admittedly, PrismMapper does not arrive at integrating all of the beneﬁts of true
person-based approaches. Nevertheless, a further step to support an even more ﬁne-grained
integration of person-based constraints may be to consider individual time proﬁles. Speciﬁc
groups of a population (e.g. fulltime employees, students and pensioners) may dispose
of similar budgets of available time for accessing opportunities. Therefore, accounting

for speciﬁc (weekly) time proﬁles, instead of a single time budget, may be a promising
extension of the toolkit. We aim to address this opportunity in future work.

Apart from the yet mentioned contributions, PrismMapper has been developed with the
eye on two additional objectives that have hitherto often been ignored in existing related
tools (see Section 2). The ﬁrst of these has been that the results generated by the toolkit
should be useful and in as much as possible comprehensible for end-users who are not
acquainted with the accessibility literature. We believe to have demonstrated this through
the case study presented in Section 4, although a genuine user study may support a further
evaluation of this objective.

The other objective has been that the toolkit should be simple and user-friendly. This
has been achieved through an undemanding user interface and an easy workﬂow which con-
sists, in essence, of three steps: launching the application, conﬁguring the input data and
parameters and processing the results. Apart from user-controllable parameters, the toolkit
relies on readily available data about the service facilities and the transportation network
at hand. Data about the locations and opening hours of service facilities are generally pub-
licly available. Yet, given that these may not be available in a standardised digital format,
PrismMapper offers the ﬂexibility to manually conﬁgure them. Transportation network

data, on the other hand, is abundantly available for many parts of the world. Some network
data sets can be freely downloaded in appropriate formats, such as from the websites of the
U.S. Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger) and OpenStreetMap (http://
www.openstreetmap.org). Furthermore, the embedding of the toolkit within an ArcGISTM
project template allows an easy distribution and takes away any installation requirements.
The incorporation in a larger GIS has another advantage. PrismMapper reports all
accessibility results at the level of network segments. This is a ﬁne-grained and transparent
representation in the sense that accessibility is only calculated on the basis of travelling
along the network. Many applications will, however, desire accessibility measures to be
reported on an aggregated level according to a certain administrative or statistical zoning.
Given that ArcGISTM implements many different overlay operations to obtain such aggre-
gations, the most ﬁne-grained resolution has been chosen intentionally for PrismMapper,
leaving a posteriori aggregation possibilities to the user.

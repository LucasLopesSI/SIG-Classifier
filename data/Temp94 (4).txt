Solar radiation not only sustains the lives on the Earth, but also creates spatial and tem-
poral variations of hydrological ingredients, such as vegetation, soil moisture, and snow.
Precise quantiﬁcation of spatial solar radiation incident on the Earth’s surface which
accounts for the topographic modulation, especially in complex terrain, underpins
the study of many catchment hydro-meteorological and hydro-ecological processes.
Topography is a key parameter that affects the spatial solar radiation pattern across dif-
ferent scales. This article addresses the issue of modelling spatial variability of actual
solar radiation caused by topography from the hydrological perspective. Models with
different algorithms and different complexities, from the simple empirical equations
to process-based physical approach, have been developed to parameterize and calcu-
late the potential radiation (under clear-sky condition) and the actual radiation (under
overcast cloudy condition). Based on a review of the general steps of solar radiation
modelling and the corresponding models for each step, two models with easily or glob-
ally available data for spatial solar radiation modelling in complex terrain, namely, the
physically parameterized, remote-sensing-oriented Heliosat-2 model and the sunshine
duration-based Angström–Prescott regression model are selected and implemented in
a GIS framework. The capability of both models for simulation of cloudy-sky radi-
ation on horizontal surfaces has been veriﬁed against observed station data showing
an R2 greater than 0.9. The validity of the models for modelling inclined surface is
tested by comparing against each other, which has shown a satisfactory agreement and
demonstrated that the simple Angström–Prescott method performed reasonably well
compared with the more elaborate Heliosat-2 method. Scale sensitivity of the models
and the shading effect are examined with different digital elevation model (DEM) res-
olutions from 30 to 500 m and reveal the existence of a threshold grid size to resolve
the topography-induced spatial solar radiation variability. Spatial mapping of potential
solar radiation and actual solar radiation has been demonstrated in a small catchment
in Southern Germany, with a spatial difference up to 30% in winter and 5% in summer.
This may lead to a signiﬁcant difference for the energy-limited hydrological processes,
such as snowmelt, and evapotranspiration.

Introduction

Solar radiation is the ultimate energy source of the terrestrial system. It affects all the
physical, chemical and biological processes on the Earth and sustains the living agents
on the globe. In hydrology, the importance of solar radiation can be manifested by the
fact that the spatially and temporally varying solar radiations regulate the spatial dynam-
ics of many hydrological and landscape factors and processes, for example, temperature,
photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, soil moisture and snow melting. These processes
consequently affect the regional water balance (Fox et al. 2000), drought and ﬂood occur-
rence (Marks et al. 2001), as well as landscape-scale distribution of vegetation (Urban
et al. 2000, Dymond and Johnson 2002). Mapping of spatial solar radiation is an important
prerequisite for many solar radiation-related applications. For locating solar energy sys-
tem, monthly maps may be enough (Janjai et al. 2005), but for hydro-meteorological and
hydro-ecological studies concerning rapidly changing processes, such as snowmelt, wind
and vegetation growth, radiation variation at ﬁner space and timescale is often required
(Wang et al. 2002).

Solar radiation incident to the Earth’s surface consists of three components: direct radi-
ation which is the radiation reaching the Earth’s surface without changing its direction;
diffuse radiation which is the part of radiation scattered back to the Earth’s surface by atmo-
sphere; and reﬂected radiation which is reﬂected by the surrounding terrain, amounting
only a very small portion and is usually neglected in practice. The individual components
as well as the sum of them, called global radiation, are determined by the interaction
among Sun–Earth geometry (solar positioning, surface inclination, the terrain shading and
so on), surface properties (albedo, absorptivity and so on) and atmospheric characteris-
tics (atmospheric attenuation, cloud type and so on), all of which demonstrate a strong
spatiotemporal variability. Solar radiation mapping may concern the individual radiation
components (direct radiation, diffuse radiation or reﬂected radiation) or the total radiation
amount (global radiation), under clear- or overcast-sky condition, on horizontal or inclined
surface. Different approaches, that is, observations/interpolation, statistical methods, phys-
ical techniques or a combination of them have been developed to quantify the spatial
radiation. Recent developments in remote sensing, such as the geostationary satellite
data of METEOSAT (Cano et al. 1986, Rigollier et al. 2004), Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GEOS) (Dubayah and Loechel 1997) and near-polar orbiting
satellites, such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Liang et al.
2006), offer new possibilities in solar radiation mapping. Mapping techniques also differ
in terms of spatial and temporal scales.

This article ﬁrst presents a review of the general steps of actual solar radiation mod-
elling and the most popular modelling approaches for each step correspondingly. Unlike
some other review articles focusing on detailed atmospheric processes or some single steps
of the complete modelling chain, this article tries to present a roadmap of solar radia-
tion modelling to address the demand of distributed hydrological modelling. Based on the
review, two models with generally available data are selected and demonstrated compara-
tively for a small catchment in Southern Germany at different scales. One model is based
on remote-sensing data from the geostationary meteorological satellite METEOSAT, called
the Heliosat-2 model, and the other is based on easily observable daily sunshine dura-
tion observations, called Angström–Prescott (AP) method. Unlike some other researches
focusing on the potential radiation (Kumar et al. 1997), this work addresses mainly the
actual radiation under the inﬂuence of cloud and its spatiotemporal variability caused by
topography. The objectives are (1) to quantify how strong the topography-induced spatial
variability of solar radiation is; (2) to investigate how this variability changes with scale and

identify a critical scale to capture the spatial variability between a balance of computational
efforts and accuracy; and (3) to ﬁnd operational radiation models driven by generally avail-
able data, which can be used to facilitate the development and application of distributed
hydrological modelling.

2. Review of solar radiation modelling steps and alternatives

When it comes to the quantiﬁcation of radiation, the difference between quantity and ﬂux
has to be noticed – following the terminology of WMO (2008), the term irradiation and
radiation refer to the amount of energy falling on a unit area over a given time interval,
while irradiance and radiance denote radiant ﬂux of intensity, that is, the instantaneous
solar power received by unit area per unit time. Radiation is also used as a generic term for
solar radiant energy. Radiation can be measured by radiometers which are designed to be
sensitive to a speciﬁed range of wavelengths (WMO 2008). The longwave radiation, direct
radiation and global radiation can be measured by pyrgeometer, pyrheliometer and pyra-
nometer, respectively. For an accurate solar radiation measurement, the devices have to be
mounted according to the view-limiting geometry to capture exactly the desired radiation
components with regular calibration and adjustment. The calibration of pyrgeometer also
requires a lot of effort (Reda et al. 2003). The high requirements for calibration and main-
tenance render the radiation measurement network very sparse, for example, in Germany,
altogether only 113 solar radiation stations are available, of which only 13 measure in addi-
tion the longwave radiation. Moreover, radiation measurement is very site speciﬁc, because
of high spatial variability of ground surface and atmospheric conditions. It is therefore
more usual to measure sunshine duration, nd, which is deﬁned as the time period with
direct solar irradiance exceeding 120 W m−2. The radiation pattern interpolated from the
sparse radiation network can capture only spatial variability at the national or regional
scale, but hydrological or hydro-ecological studies often require very detailed spatiotem-
poral radiation information; therefore, radiation modelling has been developed to meet this
demand.

A good solar radiation model should be capable of handling arbitrarily oriented sur-
faces (horizontal and inclined) under all-sky conditions (clear sky and overcast sky) by
properly representing and parameterizing the factors that affect the interactions among
solar, atmosphere and ground surface. These factors include (Hoﬁerka and Suri 2002) the
following:

(1) The Sun–Earth position: revolution and rotation.
(2) Topography: elevation, surface aspect and inclination and shading.
(3) Atmospheric characteristics: gases, water (liquid, solid, and vapour) and particles.
(4) Overcast condition: spatial and temporal cloud cover.

The ﬁrst two groups of the above factors can be modelled by trigonometry with high level
of accuracy. The atmospheric attenuation, which is the attenuation effect under clear-sky
conditions, can only be modelled by parameterization with less but relatively good accu-
racy, because the composition of atmosphere is relatively stable. The most difﬁcult issue is
the cloud accounting; even the observed clouds data can be problematic due to rapid spa-
tially and temporally changing weather conditions and the three-dimensional structure of
cloud. Nevertheless, many models and software packages have been developed to model
the global solar radiation, and some of them are included as a standard package in GIS
software, for example, r.sun in GRASS (Hoﬁerka and Suri 2002); the Solar Analyst (SA)

in ArcView and ArcGIS of ESRI (Fu and Rich 2002); and the SRAD in TAPEG (Wilson
and Gallant 2000). Models differentiate themselves in terms of the approaches for geomet-
ric modelling, attenuation parameterization and overcast concepts, which will be discussed
in the following sections.

2.1. Sun–Earth geometric modelling

The geometric modelling concerns the Sun’s position, solar incidence angle and shading.
The basics of solar positioning algorithm and solar incidence angle calculation are very
well known (see Iqbal 1983). In complex terrain, shading may result in signiﬁcant differ-
ence of radiation, which can be caused either by the inclination of the surface itself or
the adjacent terrain. Shading modiﬁes the direct radiation by blocking the sunbeam. It also
reduces the scope of the sky that scatters diffuse radiation to the ground. On the other hand,
it may also add reﬂected radiation from the blocking terrain to the ground.

Two main shading algorithms are available: the solar-based method and the ground-
based method. For the solar-based method, shading test is conducted for a given solar
altitude at each time step for all points. The elevation of each ground point lying on the sun
point line projection is checked to ensure that it does not obstruct the sunlight. The GRASS
solar radiation package r.sun applies this method (Hoﬁerka and Suri 2002). The ground-
based method calculates the hemispherical viewing area (viewshed), which is the area that
the point of interest is exposed to, based only on the adjacent terrain. Direct and diffuse
radiation from this area is not shaded (Dozier and Frew 1990, Rich et al. 1994). Once the
viewshed is constructed, at each time step no more computation but only a simple check
whether the sun is lying within the viewshed is needed; therefore, the ground-based method
is computationally more efﬁcient. This method is represented by the SA package in ArcGIS
and ArcView.

The geometric modelling gives the solar radiation in the absence of atmosphere on
the ground surface. With the geometrical Sun–Earth relationship, the theoretical solar
irradiance in the absence of Earth’s atmosphere can be calculated and integrated either
numerically or analytically to get hourly or daily irradiation. The analytical solution of
daily solar radiation and hourly solar radiation is shown in Iqbal (1983). But usually in the
real world, the presence of air, trace gases, dust and water vapour in the atmosphere will
attenuate and deplete the radiation, therefore, should be considered in application.

2.2. Atmospheric parameterization for clear sky

2.2.1. Fundamentals of atmospheric parameterization
The depletion processes include scattering by air molecules (Rayleigh scattering), scat-
tering and absorption by aerosols, absorption by ozone layer, absorption by uniformly
mixed gases and absorption by water vapour (Iqbal 1983). The total atmospheric atten-
uation effect is the result of interaction between atmosphere conditions and Sun–Earth
revolution, because the optical air mass mi of a given substance i, which attenuates the
incoming energy, changes with the solar ray direction and the richness of the substance
in atmosphere. mi can be expressed in relative terms with regard to Rayleigh optical air
mass mr as mr (i) = mi/mr. Attenuation processes can be described by Lambert’s law
with two mutually convertible parameters, the transmittance τ i and the optical depth δi.
Different substances scatter and/or absorb solar radiation at certain spectrum range and
the attenuation processes for each substance and spectrum are independent, therefore, can
be treated individually as monochromatic attenuation and then superimposed together (see
Equations (1)–(3)).

τe = τrτaτozτgasτwa =

i=n(cid:2)

i=1

τi

˙Ii = ˙I0iτi

τi = e−δi

Here, i denotes a given atmospheric substance, which may or may not exist throughout
the whole atmospheric layer. ˙Ii and ˙I0i are the intensities of spectral radiation before and
after passing through the atmosphere. τe, τr, τa, τoz, τgas, τwa are the effective transmittance,
transmittance of Rayleigh (molecule) scattering, transmittance of aerosol scattering and
absorption, transmittance of ozone absorption, transmittance of uniformly mixed gas and
transmittance of water vapour, respectively. The optical depth δi is substance speciﬁc,
which is different from the optical path length determined only by incoming light angle.
Part of the attenuated radiation becomes diffuse radiation, which can be conceptualized by
the diffuse transmission coefﬁcient T d.

Numerous atmospheric parameterization schemes exist (Ineichen 2006), which can be
generalized into two groups based on whether the attenuation effects of different extinction
substances are parameterized substance speciﬁcally or integrated. The substance-speciﬁc
parameterization adopts different attenuation parameters for each individual extinction
layer (substances), which is represented by the Page (1997) model, SOLIS model (Mueller
et al. 2004), Bird and Huldstrom (1980) model and CPCR2 model (Gueymard 1993).
The second group summarizes the different processes into Rayleigh optical depthδr and
the Linke turbidity T Ln, by which the transmittance of each extinction substance is con-
verted and summed up with reference to the spectrally integrated Rayleigh optical depth
of the clean and dry atmosphere (Kasten 1996). It is used by the European Solar Radiation
Atlas model (Rigollier et al. 2000) and the Ineichen model (Ineichen and Perez 2002).
Linke turbidity can be derived by measurements of the beam irradiance using appropri-
ate but expensive equipment. The typical Linke turbidity values are widely reported in the
literature for different parts of the world.

2.2.2. Clear-sky model on horizontal surface

Based on the parameterization schemes, the clear-sky irradiance, both direct and diffuse
components on horizontal surface, can be expressed as the following in integrated and
substance-speciﬁc form, respectively.

Substance-speciﬁc parameterization:

dhc = ˙ISC∈ Td(TLn)Fd(θz, TLn)

dhc = ˙ISC∈ Td(τe, fas, faf)

Here, the subscript h denotes horizontal surface and c denotes clear sky. ˙ISC is the extrater-
restrial solar radiation. θ z is the solar zenith angle of horizontal surface and θ is used to
denote the zenith angle of inclined surface. ∈is the eccentricity correction factor of Sun–
Earth distance. The diffuse transmission coefﬁcient T d for the integrated parameterization
is a function of T Ln, and for individual parameterization it is given by Equation (7). The
integrated form also includes a diffuse angular function Fd related to θ z and T Ln. Here f af
denotes the portion of forward scattered radiation and f as is the scattered fraction out of
the total energy attenuated by aerosol.

2.2.3. Clear-sky model on inclined surface

For inclined surface under clear sky, the direct radiation will be modiﬁed by the solar
incidence angle (see Equation (8)), and the diffuse radiation will be reduced in addition by
the reduced skyview fraction ψ β, also called the diffuse coefﬁcient (see Equation (8)):

bβc = bhc cos θ/ cos θz
dβc = dhcψβ

Here the subscript β denotes inclined surface. The relationship between inclined and hor-
izontal surface under clear sky also holds for cloudy condition. The formulation of the
coefﬁcient ψ β depends on how the diffuse radiation is treated. The basic component of dif-
fuse radiation is the isotropic part from all directions of the sky, sometimes called dome or
sky irradiation. In addition, two anisotropic components may be considered – circumsolar
brightening caused by the strong forward aerosol scattering from approximately 5◦ around
the direct solar beam, and the horizon brightening due primarily to multiple Rayleigh scat-
tering and retroscattering in clear atmospheres. The diffuse radiation model may consider
only the isotropic component as by Liu and Jordan (1961), or in addition the circumsolar
component, for example, by Hay (1979), or eventually all the three components, that is, by
Perez et al. (1990) and Muneer (1990). There is an array of diffuse radiation models which
will not be repeated here. These models are applicable for both clear sky and overcast con-
ditions. For a complete overview of them, readers are referred to the article of Evseev and
Kudish (2009). Here the Liu–Jordan model and the Muneer model, which are components
in the selected models of this article are given brieﬂy as follows:

Here, β is the slope of the inclined surface; Khay is the Hay’s sky clarity index (Hay 1979)
denoting the proportion of beam irradiance and extraterrestrial solar irradiance on horizon-
tal surface; T M is the Muneer’s tilt factor; FM is a composite clearness function; and rs and
U are some auxiliary variables.

2.3. Cloud accounting for cloudy sky
Cloud is the most critical factor for calculating the actual solar radiation. It is also the most
uncertain factor due to its temporal and three-dimensional spatial variability. Actual radia-
tion under overcast sky is usually processed step by step: ﬁrst the overcast global radiation
on horizontal surface Ghw is obtained by modelling or observation, then the estimation of
direct and diffuse radiation proportion by cloud parameterization, ﬁnally the corresponding
direct and diffuse solar radiation on the inclined surface, Bβ w and Dβ w, will be estimated
based on their corresponding horizontal values, Bhw and Dhw, and summed up to get the
global radiation on the inclined surface Gβ w.

2.3.1. Overcast global radiation on horizontal surface

Because it is impossible to consider the instantaneous change of cloud, cloud is usually
parameterized in a time averaging way at hourly or daily interval. Detailed physical mod-
elling of cloud ﬁeld for radiation analysis is beyond the objective of this work or even
beyond the demand of hydrological study. Cloud effects are usually quantiﬁed by a param-
eter called clear-sky index, Kw (Kasten and Czeplak 1980), which is the ratio of actual
global radiation to the potential global radiation on horizontal surface under clear-sky con-
ditions (Equation (18)). Kb
w are the respective beam and diffuse components of
the clear-sky index (Equations (19) and (20)). It has to be distinguished from other similar
parameters: (1) clearness index Kt in Equation (21) which is the ratio of global radiation on
the horizontal surface Ghb to extraterrestrial radiation on horizontal surface H 0 and (2) the
Hay’s sky clarity index H hay mentioned previously.

Kt = Ghw/H0

The clear-sky index can be interpreted as the cloud transmittance and it can be obtained, as
its deﬁnition suggests, as the ratio between the observed Ghw and the theoretically derived
Ghc. When no radiation observation is available, Kw is expressed as an empirical func-
tion of one of the following parameters: (1) the sunshine duration, (2) the cloudiness
index, (3) the cloud index or (4) some combination of meteorological parameters, such
as, precipitation, temperature and humidity, etc.

(cid:129) The sunshine duration method

AP equation (Angström 1924) has suggested that the monthly average daily global
radiation on a horizontal surface can be estimated through the sunshine duration as follows:

Ghw
Ghc

= Kw = pap + qapnd/Ndh

Here, pap and qap are the empirical coefﬁcients, and nd and N dh are the actual and potential
sunshine durations, respectively. Although the original form is proposed for the evaluation
of the long-term average daily global radiation, it is proved to be held for daily radiation
as well. There are also many non-linear versions of AP equation which will not be listed
here.

(cid:129) The cloudiness index method

The cloudiness index Ck is the spatial cloud cover in okta unit. It does not consider the
cloud type or thickness. Kasten (1983) proposed the following relationship between cloud
cover and clear sky index, where pk and qk are empirical coefﬁcients:

Kw = 1 −

(cid:129) The meteorological method

The cloud index nc is deﬁned speciﬁcally for each pixel based on albedo data derived from
the visible (VIS spectrum range 0.5–0.9 μm) band images of the satellite remote-sensing
data, for example, METEOSAT. Here, Kw is a function of nc (Cano et al. 1986, Rigollier
et al. 2004).

nc = (ρo − ρg)/(ρa − ρg)

Kw = f (nc)

where ρo is the apparent albedo observed by the satellite sensor [−]; ρg is the apparent
albedo of the ground under clear skies [−]; and ρa is the transmittance of aerosol scattering
and absorption [−].

Albedo increases with the cloud cover, which is bright and has higher reﬂection. ρg and
ρa are the minimum and maximum that are selected from the time series of satellite images
at each pixel. This is the method that is adopted in the Heliosat-2 method (Rigollier et al.
2004). Actually with the development of meteorological satellites, an alternative of cloud
parameterization that does not belong to the clearness index family called cloud optical
depth has emerged (Mueller et al. 2004) but is still subject to improvement.

Once the clear-sky index, Kw, is known, the overcast global radiation on horizontal
surface Ghw can be obtained by Equation (18), given that Ghc is available from observation
or model estimation. Then using Equation (21), the clearness index Kt can be obtained for
further calculation. It should be mentioned that for some methods the calculation order of
Kt and Ghw is inversed – ﬁrst Kt is directly regressed with sunshine duration nd (Prescott
1940, Bahel et al. 1987) or meteorological parameters, such as temperature (Bristow and
Campbell 1984, Allen 1997), then based on Kt, Ghw is calculated. The latter method is
supposed to be rougher than the former one, because no physical processes are explicitly
considered.

2.3.2. Radiation partitioning on the horizontal surface

For further estimation of diffuse and direct radiation on inclined surface under cloudy con-
ditions, the beam and diffuse component under cloudy conditions on the horizontal surface
have to be partitioned. They are usually estimated by statistical regression of observed data,
which relate either the direct radiation fraction, usually called direct radiation transmittance
Kb (see Equation (26)), or the diffuse radiation fraction Kd (see Equation (27)) to the
clearness index, the surface albedo, the sun elevation (or say relative air mass) or some
other parameters, such as dew point temperature and humidity. If the reﬂected radiation is
neglected, Kb and Kd sum to unity, that is, Equation (28) holds.

Kb = Bhw/Ghw

Kd = Dhw/Ghw

Kb + Kd = 1

(26)

(27)

(28)

(cid:129) Direct radiation transmittance Kb

The DISC model of Maxwell (1987) ﬁrst proposed the expression of direct radiation
transmittance (normal to the incident surface) as the function of clearness index and rela-
tive air mass using regression analysis, but with some physical considerations. Perez et al.
(1992) further developed the model into the Drint model, which considers more parame-
ters, such as precipitable water. DirIndex model (Perez et al. 2002) is a further update of
Drint and can be generalized as follows:

Kb = f (Kt, nd, . . .)

(29)

(cid:129) Diffuse radiation fraction Kd

M. Liu et al.

Diffuse radiation fraction Kd is a more popular approach in application which has a longer
history. It is expressed as a polynomial function of clearness index (Liu and Jordan 1961,
Ruth and Chant 1976) or the sunshine duration (Iqbal 1983). Logistic functions (Boland
et al. 2001) and functions with multiple predictors (Ridley et al. 2010) have also been
developed to include more parameters, such as temperature, humidity and turbidity, as a
correction of the clearness index or the sunshine duration. Despite the functional form, all
these equations are mainly regression analysis based on observed data (see Equation (30)),
even though in some cases physical processes may be incorporated. Comparative studies
on diffuse radiation modelling can be found in Torres et al. (2010).

2.3.3. Global radiation on inclined surface

Based on the partition factors, the direct and diffuse radiation on horizontal surface can be
obtained. Through a procedure similar to the clear-sky conditions, direct and diffuse irra-
diance on inclined surface can be calculated following Equations (8) and (9) by replacing
the subscript c with w. The instantaneous values should also be integrated analytically
or numerically to obtain the corresponding radiation of a given time interval. To give
a better overview of the global solar radiation modelling, we summarize the modelling
steps and options in a pseudo ﬂowchart (see Figure 1), which gives the main steps and
alternatives of solar radiation modelling. Models generally comprise the following steps:
horizontal extraterrestrial radiation H 0→ clear sky global radiation on horizontal surface
Ghc→ overcast global radiation on horizontal surface Ghw→ radiation partition → overcast
global radiation on tilted surface Gβw. For each step, different alternatives discussed in the
previous sections can be chosen depending on the data availability.

3. The Heliosat-2 and AP models
As discussed above, atmospheric characterization and cloud parameterization are the most
critical factors for calculating potential radiation and actual radiation, respectively. For a
given region, clear-sky atmospheric conditions are relatively stable and can be easily char-
acterized as transmittance or Linke turbidity with 1-year historical measurement data or
even data obtained from other similar geographic regions. Since cloud is more dynamic
and site speciﬁc, different atmospheric observations are required to parameterize the cloud
effects, which require considerable observatory efforts. Therefore, easily attainable data
such as sunshine duration which does not require a complicated instrument, or generally
available data such as remote sensing, should be the ﬁrst option for the modelling purpose.
Cloud parameterization using remote-sensing data is an ideal substitution of ground-based
data. Solar radiation model based on MODIS, GEOS and METEOSAT data has shown
very promising performance in some prior studies (Dubayah and Loechel 1997, Hammer
2003, Liang et al. 2006). In this article, two cloud parameterization schemes, namely, phys-
ically parameterized, remote-sensing-oriented model Heliosat-2 (Rigollier et al. 2004) and
the regressional AP model based on sunshine duration are selected and compared. Both
models are representative models of their type and have a balanced complexity in the
model components. The Heliosat-2 method applies the r.sun (Hoﬁerka and Suri 2002)
approach together with a speciﬁc cloud parameterization scheme developed by European
Solar Radiation Atlas (Rigollier et al. 2000). The AP method applies sunshine duration as

a surrogate for the total attenuation effects of both cloud and atmosphere. Both models are
implemented in a GIS framework in this work.

There are many comparative studies for point or potential solar radiation with the afore-
mentioned methods (Muneer and Gul 2000, Iziomon and Mayer 2002, Trnka et al. 2005,
Ineichen 2006, Wu et al. 2007, Evseev and Kudish 2009, Torres et al. 2010), and some
of them address specially GIS solar radiation modelling software packages (Ruiz-Arias
et al. 2009). GIS-based models calibrated with station data have been widely applied to

model the spatial solar radiation (Mckenney 1999, Wang et al. 2006, Batlles et al. 2008,
Martnez-Durbn et al. 2009, Ruiz-Arias et al. 2009), but these methods always require sta-
tion observed radiation data, which limit the transferability of these models in ungauged
basins, or they calculate only potential values. Approaches for modelling spatial actual
solar radiation in complex terrain with generally available data for hydrological applica-
tions are investigated in this article, with the focus on the issue of topography-induced
spatial radiation variability.

3.1. The Heliosat-2 model
For the Heliosat-2 method, ﬁrst, the clear-sky index is obtained from the cloud index nc,
then the overcast global radiation on horizontal surface Ghw is calculated by Equation (18),
which can be subsequently used to derive the clearness index Kt. The diffuse radiation frac-
tion Kd is estimated as a function of Kt to calculate diffuse radiation on horizontal surface,
based on which the beam and diffuse components of the clear-sky index, Kb
w, can be
calculated for spatial radiation mapping. Kb
w are assumed to be constant throughout
the day. The Muneer’s model is applied to obtain the diffuse radiation on inclined surface,
that is, to calculate ψ β. The global radiation on an inclined surface at a grid point p(i, j)
can be calculated as follows:

w and Kd

3.2. The AP model
The AP model applies the relative sunshine duration nc as a surrogate for the attenuation
effects of both cloud and atmosphere. The diffuse radiation fraction Kd is approximated
as a function of nd. For the diffuse radiation on inclined surface, the Liu–Jordan model
in Equation (10) is applied, because it is conceptually much simpler, which matches the
degree of complexity of the AP method. The Liu–Jordan method estimates only isotropic
diffuse component, which is constant over time, by geometric calculation of the sky expo-
sure of the tilted surface. It also neglects the shading effect for direct radiation. The hourly
value is integrated analytically to get the daily value by assuming constant diffuse frac-
tion throughout the day. Following similar procedure for extraterrestrial radiation in Iqbal
(1983), Equation (34) can be obtained as

Gβw(i, j) =

(bhw(i, j) cos θ/ cos θz + dhw(i, j)ψβ)dω

= bhw

(cos θ/ cos θz)dω + Dhw(i, j)ψβ

ωss(cid:7)

The overcast global radiation on horizontal surface can be calculated with an adapted AP
model relating Ghw directly to extraterrestrial radiation H 0:

Gβw(i, j) = Ghw(1 − Kd)ξ + GhwKdψβ

= H0(aap + bapnd/Ndh)(1 − Kd)ξ + H0(aap + bapnd/Ndh)Kdψβ

Here, ξ is the ratio of daily radiation on inclined surface to horizontal surface in the absence
of the atmosphere. The readers are referred to Iqbal (1983) for a detailed derivation.

4. Comparison of the selected models

At the ﬁrst step the geometrical modelling of r.sun will be checked against observations and
another widely used model SA on horizontal surface under clear-sky conditions. Then the
scale sensitivity of r.sun will be tested with 30 to 500 m DEM resolutions. After the clear-
sky test, the performance control of the Heliosat-2 and AP models under cloudy conditions
will be conducted based on global and diffuse radiation measured on horizontal surface
at stations. Because solar radiation observation data for this study are only for horizontal
surfaces, the two models are tested against each other for inclined surfaces. Finally the
regional radiation mapping, that is, topographic downscaling of solar radiation using two
methods will be performed.

4.1. Test area
The solar radiation stations in German federal state Baden-Wuerttemberg (see Figure 2)
are used to test the Heliosat-2 and AP models. There are three solar radiation stations
within the state – Mannheim, Stuttgart and Freiburg, which provide daily sunshine dura-
tion, global and diffuse solar radiation data from 2002 to 2007. For Stuttgart station global
radiation data from year 1990 to 1999 are also available. A small catchment within the state

called Talhausen close to Stuttgart city is used to test the models on horizontal surface. The
Talhausen catchment is around 192 km2, with elevation varying from 216 to 530 m for a
30 m DEM. The southern part of the catchment is a mountainous area with steep val-
leys, while the north part is relatively ﬂat, which forms a complex terrain with diversiﬁed
topographic features. Four locations, P1–P4, with representative topographic features, are
marked for detailed investigation. The selected points are around 10–15 km away from the
Stuttgart solar station, which is close enough to allow a parameter transfer. Table 1 shows
the topographic parameters (elevation, aspect, slope) of the four points at DEM resolu-
tion from 30 to 500 m. In general, elevation and slope decrease with increasing grid size,
whereas the variation of aspect is strongly dependent on the surrounding terrain. However,
due to the resampling procedure of DEM data processing, some erratic variations of these
parameters may occur, for example, instead of monotonically decreasing, the elevation of
the selected points ﬂuctuates.

4.2. Test of geometric modelling

As discussed before, r.sun applies the solar-based shading algorithm, and it is conceptually
simpler than the hemispheric viewshed algorithm used in SA, which is assumed to be more
advanced and computationally efﬁcient. In this article, the r.sun program incorporated in
GRASS is adapted to be a stand-alone program for more ﬂexible calculations.

4.2.1. Comparison of point radiation
The performances of the two algorithms are compared using simulation of time series at
P1 under clear-sky conditions. The observed solar radiation at Stuttgart station is included
as a reference case. Figure 3 shows the results of the eight different cases at P1 as follows:

line).

In general, both the simulated global radiation (Figure 3) and sunshine duration (Figure 4)
in different cases from the two models are consistent. Case 1 of both ﬁgures show that the
proﬁles of the maximum daily curves, both global radiation and sunshine duration, resem-
ble the theoretical cosine curves under clear-sky conditions very well. Clear-sky radiation
simulated by SA (case 2 in Figure 3) on horizontal surface shows an exaggerated differ-
ence from case 1 for summer time and has difﬁculties in matching the observed curve for
both summer and winter seasons. The corresponding sunshine duration (case 2 in Figure 4)
shows a stepwise feature and exceptional ﬂuctuations in January and December. A better
match may be realized by a time-variant parameter setting which is not possible in the SA
module.

If shading from surrounding terrain is considered for horizontal surface, as shown in
Figure 3, both SA and r.sun (cases 3 and 6) give much lower radiation for winter time com-
pared with the no shading case and little difference in summer (cases 2 and 5). Comparison
of all the shade/no shade cases in Figure 4 shows that in summer time illumination time
is identical, because P1 lies on a north-oriented slope and shading happens only in winter
time when the sun altitude is low. The inclined surface receives much less radiation than the
horizontal surface, which is represented by both models. For P1, the sunshine durations for
horizontal surface and inclined surface calculated by r.sun, under the presence of shading
are identical (cases 6 and 8 in Figure 4), which means shading is caused by the neighbour-
ing terrain, not by the inclination of the surface itself. But this is not true for SA, which
shows slight difference (cases 3 and 4 in Figure 4) possibly arising from the accounting of
detailed microtopography by SA. However, when the surface is tilted, the inclination will
be responsible for the shading effect in summer time. Even though shading reduces more
illumination time for inclined surface in winter comparing to summer (cases 7 and 8 in
Figure 4), it makes little difference in global radiation (cases 7 and 8 in Figure 3). The rea-
son may lie in that shading happens at sunrise or sunset time, for which the solar incidence
angle is very small due to the surface inclination, and the reduced beam radiation is almost

compensated by the increased diffuse radiation due to horizontal brightening. SA and r.sun
show better agreement for inclined surface than for horizontal surface.

The basic validation against observation has shown that both models, especially r.sun,
perform reasonably well on horizontal surface under clear-sky conditions, and for inclined
surface the two models also give consistent results with minor differences. The perfor-
mance of SA is not so good as r.sun with time-varying parameters, but still reasonable.
SA is specially error prone for the equinox and solstice days, which can be witnessed by
the unusual values on 22 December of the green curves. The agreement of the two models
on inclined surface can serve as an indirect veriﬁcation of the models on inclined surface,
given that observed data for inclined surface are not available.

4.2.2. Comparison of spatial radiation

The spatial comparison of r.sun with SA is conducted for an arbitrarily selected day (as an
example day 30 is selected, see Figure 5a and b) and the yearly average daily radiation (see
Figure 5c and d). The scatter plot shows that there is a high correlation between the two
models for the simulated radiation and the sunshine duration, except for very few outliers.
The r.sun model gives in general slightly higher evaluation than SA for global radiation,
mainly in the valleys. The reason may lie in the fact that SA considers the microtopography
in more detail. For extremely low sunshine duration values, which are points in shadow,
r.sun gives lower values than SA. Nevertheless, the strong linear relationship between the
two model results implies that by adjusting the parameters properly, a good match of the
two models is possible. For the yearly average daily radiation, the difference diminishes,
and results of the two models become more close as shown in Figure 5c and d.

4.2.3. Correlation of radiation with topography

Statistical analysis shows that there is a positive correlation of radiation with aspect and
elevation, and negative correlation with slope. Table 2 shows the mean of daily correlation
coefﬁcients and standard deviation over 1 year. The aspect starts at north zero clockwise.
It has to be mentioned that in GRASS open GIS system, the aspect increases counterclock-
wise, with east as 0◦. To consider the topography more properly, the negative cosine of
aspect is taken to calculate the correlation coefﬁcient. Similarly, the sine of slope is used,
and only elevation uses the original value. The correlation between elevation and global
radiation is very weak, but an interesting time-dependent correlation can be observed,
namely, the correlation coefﬁcient is negative in winter and positive in summer.

4.3. Test of scale sensitivity

In GIS-based models, the calculation of radiation is based on DEM data; therefore, it is
natural that the resolution of the DEM affects the simulated radiation by modifying the
topographic parameters and shading conditions. In the following, how the shading effect
and spatial variability of simulated radiation changes with scale is investigated with DEM
resolutions ranging from 30 m to 500 m.

4.3.1. Shading effect with scale
Shading reduces the global radiation of one point in shadow (from Gns to Gs). When the
DEM grid size increases, the microtopographic features which can be reﬂected at ﬁner
resolution disappear, which causes some information to be lost and thus affects the shading

effect, for example, two points with one being shaded by the other may be merged as one
point in a coarser resolution DEM, or the shading time may change at different scales. Here,
the annual mean daily radiation simulated with and without shading effect are compared
for six different DEM resolutions. The cumulative distribution of the relative difference
( Gns−Gs
) of all grid points of each DEM resolution is demonstrated in Figure 6. It shows
Gns
that the shading effect prevails at ﬁne resolution. But even at a resolution of 30 m, only
in about less than 5% area shading causes a relative difference larger than 5%. When the
grid size increases, the shading effect drops quickly below 5% in most of the area. It can
be concluded that the shading effect is only detectable locally for very limited area, which
may be signiﬁcant for some ecological applications, but not hydrological applications at
catchment level.

4.3.2. Scale effect over time
To check the scale effect over time, two pairs of points, P1 and P2 in mountain area and
P3 and P4 in lowland area, are examined without considering the shading effect. The results
show that the radiation difference varies with scale (see Figure 7). In general, both abso-
lute and relative differences diminish with increasing grid size – for P1 and P2, the relative
difference decreases from around 600% at 30 m DEM to less than 60% at 500 m DEM,
and for P3 and P4 from 80% to around 1%. For P3 and P4, due to the shift of aspect at
P3 from north/north-east to south-east and at P4 from south-west to north-west when tran-
siting from 60 m DEM to coarser DEM, the relationship at the two points gets inverted.
This shows that DEM-based radiation modelling may be erratic at some points, but at the
basin scale, such a phenomenon should be of minor importance. For both pairs, the scale
effects in terms of absolute radiation are the largest at the equinox days, and decrease on
both solstice days, with a minimum difference in the day of the summer solstice. However,
if relative radiation is considered, the scale effect is much stronger in winter than in
summer.

μs

4.3.3. Spatial radiation variance with scale
The spatial variation of solar radiation is quantiﬁed in terms of normalized interquantile
range (NIQR) P90−P10
, where P90 and P10 are the 90 and 10 percentiles of the spatial values
in a speciﬁc radiation map, and μs is the mean radiation of that map. We do not use the
standard deviation, because the distribution of spatial radiation depends on the topography,
which is not necessarily normally distributed. Figure 8 shows that in winter the spatial
variability of global radiation is very sensitive to the scale and decreases from 37% for
30 m DEM to 19% for 500 m DEM, especially when the grid size increases further to
100 m, the spatial variability drops rapidly, whereas in summer time the spatial variability
is below 5% and does not vary much with scale. This may have strong implication for the
energy-driven hydrological processes in the winter time, such as snowmelt and evaporation,
and solar radiation modelling at resolution ﬁner than certain critical value is preferred for
distributed hydrological modelling to account for such spatial variability explicitly.

4.4. Performance test on overcast horizontal surface
For testing the model performance on all-sky conditions, the Heliosat-2 model is validated
against the station data at Stuttgart, Mannheim and Freiburg from year 2002 to 2007. The
adapted AP method using extraterrestrial radiation is also tested against the observations.

4.4.1. The Heliosat-2 method
The Heliosat-2 method calculates the cloud index using Equation (24). The functional form
to derive clear-sky index Kw from the cloud index nc (Equation (25)) follows Rigollier et al.

The overcast radiation Ghw is equal to the clear-sky radiation Ghc scaled by the clear-sky
index Kw. Table 3 shows the simulated result in comparison with observations at the three
stations. The goodness of ﬁt is tested by the root mean squared error (RMSE) and R2.
The R2 for all the three stations are above 0.93, which shows a very good match between
simulation and observation.

4.4.2. The AP method
The original AP (Equation equation (22)) can be adapted to the following form using
extraterrestrial radiation instead of clear-sky radiation to obtain the clearness index Kt:

Ghw
H0

= Kt = pap + qapnd/Ndh

The actual daily sunshine duration nd is obtained from the observations, while the potential
daily sunshine duration and extraterrestrial radiation on horizontal surface, N dh and H 0 can
be easily calculated following Iqbal (1983). To apply the AP equation, pap and qap have to
be estimated ﬁrst. The observation data are split into two time series of equal length, with
2002–2004 for calibration and 2005–2007 for validation. It shows that aap increases and bap
decreases with the latitude (see Table 3), which are consistent with the ﬁndings of Glover
and McCulloch (1958) and can be regarded as a kind of climatic gradient. Because in our
case, the three solar radiation stations are relatively close, a single set of AP coefﬁcients can
be used, which is called the ‘general’ case. It is not surprising that the calibrated empirical
AP approach is slightly better than the physically based Heliosat-2 method. But one should
keep in mind that the Heliosat-2 method is free of any ground observations, which offers a
satisfactory calibration-free solution for ungauged basins.

Because the radiometers for routine measurements of solar radiation are usually
mounted horizontally, ground sources for validation of radiation on tilted surface are very
scarce. A model test for the inclined surface is not possible due to the data limitation in
the study region. Therefore, the capability of the two methods for modelling tilted surface
under overcast sky condition is veriﬁed by comparing against each other.

4.5. Spatial solar radiation mapping
4.5.1. Derivation of diffuse fraction

For the Heliosat-2 method, a ground observation-free method following the Ruth–Chant
approach (Ruth and Chant 1976) has been applied to relate diffuse fraction to clearness
index in the following form:

(cid:12)

Kd =

(cid:8)

(cid:8)

d, Kt ≤ K
K
p1(Kt)2 + p2kt + p3, kt ≥ k
t

t

(cid:8)

(38)

(39)

Here, K(cid:8)
t is the threshold value of clearness index for applying the quadratic function, and
p1, p2 and p3 are empirical coefﬁcients. The clearness index is obtained from the global
radiation on horizontal surface. Once the direct and diffuse components on horizontal sur-
face are partitioned with Kd, the direct and diffuse components of the clear-sky index, Kb
w
and Kd
For the AP method, the diffuse fraction is evaluated as a quadratic function of relative
sunshine duration:

w, are calculated for further calculations.

Kd = p

Tables 4 and 5 show the calibration and validation results of each station with the clear-
ness index method and sunshine duration method, respectively. Both functional forms are
calibrated and validated with two approaches:

(1) Split-sample approach: calibration and validation with split sample (2002–2004 for

calibration, 2005–2007 for validation) for each station.

(2) General method: calibration with data from all three stations and validation for

each station for the validation period.

For all three stations the performances are considerably good. Although the parameters
vary for different stations, they are not very sensitive. For the sake of simpliﬁcation, the
general parameter sets obtained by fusing the data from all three stations is used, which
gives comparable results as the parameter set from the split-sample approach.

4.5.2. Mapping spatial global radiation
Once the global radiation and the diffuse fraction on horizontal surface are available,
Equations (33) and (35) can be used to map spatial radiation, which can be regarded as
a downscaling procedure, by which the radiation on the horizontal surface acts as the
regional value. Figure 9 shows the comparison of the mapping results of actual global
radiation in the year 2002 simulated by the two models. Figure 9a shows the R2 and RMSE
of the two methods throughout the year. The R2 is considerably high, and most of time
is over 0.80, except for a short period around summer time. Even in summer seasons, the
R2 never goes below 0.60 and the RMSE is also relatively small, which demonstrates the
results of the two methods agree well with each other. A detailed inspection reveals that
the error mainly originate from the deviation of the regional radiation (radiation on hor-
izontal surface) calculated by the two methods, and the error from diffusion model is of
minor importance. Figure 9b illustrates the relative variability of the spatial radiation in
terms of NIQR. Again the two models agree well with each other. The spatial variability
is much stronger in winter than in summer. The mapping results of actual radiation show
that the simple AP approach performs reasonably well compared with the more elaborate
Heliosat-2 model.

5. Conclusion
The article ﬁrst reviews the solar radiation modelling steps and approaches which are sum-
marized into a ﬂowchart. The review is not meant to be thorough, but just a guideline for
model selection for hydrological applications. Based on the review, the remote-sensing-
based Heliosat-2 model and the adapted AP model are selected for mapping the actual
spatial solar radiation. The models are tested in three steps: in the ﬁrst step, the geometric
modelling component and clear-sky parameterization of the Heliosat-2 model are tested
against SA and observed data. It is shown that even though r.sun is conceptually simpler
than SA, its results are more stable for arbitrarily oriented surfaces, whereas SA is error
prone in days of equinox and solstice. In the second step, scale sensitivity of the r.sun
model in terms of shading and spatial variability is tested, which reveals that shading is
insigniﬁcant except at very ﬁne scale and a critical threshold scale should be maintained
in order to resolve the spatial variation of radiation. It is 100 m in the example case. It also
demonstrates that the resampling procedure from ﬁner DEM to obtain coarser DEM may
cause erratic results at some points. In the last step, both the Heliosat-2 model and the AP
model are validated for horizontal surface under cloudy conditions at three weather sta-
tions in Southern Germany, and both of them perform very well. The two models are also
applied to inclined surface under overcast conditions. Although accounting for atmospheric
effects, particularly clouds, involves a lot of simplifying approximations and requires mea-
sured data either in the form of satellite imagery or ground observations, the two selected
models have reasonably characterized the spatial variability caused by topography. The AP
model applying sunshine duration is conceptually very simple, but it has been shown that
the sunshine duration is a good surrogate for the cloud parameterization. For ungauged
basins without any ground observations, the Heliosat-2 method is a capable method for
actual solar radiation mapping. The strong spatial variability of solar radiation in win-
ter time, as demonstrated by the two models, may have essential effects on energy-limited
hydrological processes, such as snowmelt and evapotranspiration, and should be considered
explicitly in hydrological modelling at a proper scale.

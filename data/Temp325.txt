Abstract. This paper develops a spatio-temporal data model to support activity-
based transport demand modelling in a GIS environment. This so-called mobility-
oriented spatio-temporal data model conceptualizes the spatial and temporal
interaction of travel and activity behaviour using the concept of mobility. In other
words, activity patterns are conceptualized as a sequence of staying at or travelling
between activity locations. The model can support the analysis and queries of
activities from diŒerent perspectives, i.e. queries can be location-based, time-based,
and person-based. It can also support activity-based modelling by identifying
spatial and temporal opportunities for activity participation. The conceptual and
logical designs of the data model are presented. A prototype system based on the
data model is implemented in ArcView. The prototype is illustrated and tested
by a case study based in Hong Kong.

Introduction
Recently, the integration of activity-based transport demand modelling with
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has received substantial attention in both
the GIS and transport communities (Miller 1991, Kwan 1997, Greaves and Stopher
1998, Bhat and Koppleman 1999, Miller and Wu 2000 ). This is inspired by the fact
that GIS facilitates the representation and manipulation of spatial information, it is
thus useful in modelling the spatial contexts of activity patterns and the interaction
of temporal characteristics with spatial attributes. It is also encouraged by the
successful integration between GIS and Transportation (GIS-T) in the past ten years
or so. GIS-T, like GIS as a whole, bene(cid:142) ted from developments in computer hard-
ware, in management information systems and database techniques (Waters 1998).
Besides highway mapping, GIS has been applied to managing bridges, networks,
pavements, tra(cid:141) c volume and accident locations. As for transport demand modelling,
among others, GIS software was developed to facilitate the development of the four-
step urban transportatio n model system (Shaw and Wang 2000 ).

Although most authors believe that GIS, through the capabilities oŒered for the
collection, storage, manipulation, analysis, and display of spatially referenced data,
could prove critical to the ultimate success of the activity-based approach, all agree
that existing GIS techniques need to be further developed to meet the requirements
of activity-based modelling. This is partly because compared with traditional trip-
based models, activity-based models are dependent on detailed individual-level data,
spatially more accurate representations of the physical environment, and the develop-
ment of more e(cid:141) cient information processing technologies. More importantly, most
models in GIS are static descriptions. They are not dynamic and do not describe
spatial changes and/or change with time (Burrough and Frank 1995), but in activity-
based modelling, the activity patterns of individuals are dynamic, and change in
space and time. As Goodchild (2000) argued, current GIS are still inadequate in
handling data analysis of (cid:143) ows, complex paths, and temporal changes. He believes
that GIS-T has evolved in three stages: the map view, the navigational view, and
the behavioural view. The map view is static in nature and favours application to
inventory and description. It raises questions of accuracy and interoperability. The
navigational view raises concerns for network representation and network topology
and issues of representation related to scale, including the need for lane-level con-
nectivity. The behavioural view treats transportatio n events as dynamic and occur-
ring within the largely static transportatio n space. It deals explicitly with the
behaviour of discrete objects to represent moving geometry. The behavioural view
requires a new series of representation methods, beyond those required by either the
map or navigation views. Appropriate representations for the behavioural view have
still to be worked out.

To cope with the increasing demand for handling dynamic information, the GIS
community has diverted substantial eŒorts to develop so-called ‘spatio-temporal ’
data models with the aim of representing, analysing and predicting changes of spatial
information over time (Langran 1992, Al-Taha and Frank 1993, Egenhofer and
Golledge 1998). For example, Peuquet and Duan (1995) proposed an event-based
spatio-tempora l data model (ESTDM) to represent temporal information of landuse
change. Several other authors including Raper and Livingstone (1995), Mason et al.
(1994) and Cheng and Molenaar (1998) put forth object-oriented spatio-tempora l
data models to represent the dynamics of geomorphologi c systems. Yuan (1995)
developed a so-called three-domain model for forest and wild(cid:142) re management, and
Spery et al. (1999) suggested spatio-tempora l models for cadastre management. All
these models are intended for addressing and modelling the dynamic behaviour of
natural phenomena, which is normally related to changes in spatial extent.

These models are, however, not tailored to the needs of activity-based research.
This is because the dynamics of activity and travel behaviour are related to changes
in locations of human subjects.

The objective of this paper is therefore to develop a spatio-tempora l data model
that can represent the dynamic behaviour of activity and to support activity-based
modelling in a GIS environment. A mobility-oriented spatio-tempora l data model
is proposed. In the model, the behaviour of activities is represented as a sequence of
two states—staying at and travelling between activity locations. The proposed model
can support analysis and queries of activities from multiple perspectives, i.e. queries
can be location-based, activity-based , time-based, and person-based. The conceptual
and logical designs of the data model are presented. The multi-perspective queries and
modelling function are implemented in ArcView. It is illustrated by a case study
based in Hong Kong.

temporal data model. Section 5 reports the physical implementation of the data

2. Activity-based transport demand modelling

Since the late 1950s, transportatio n models have played an important role in
forecasting transport demand and evaluating the impacts of plans and policies.
Planners use transportatio n models to learn about the behaviour of transport sys-
tems. Over the past decades, the development of particular modelling approaches
has closely followed planning needs, which in turn are closely related to dominant
policy issues.

The (cid:142) rst generation of transportatio n models was developed during the late 1950s
and early 1960s. Their purpose was to facilitate the prediction of future transport
demand, such that road capacity programs could be based on predicted demand.
The (cid:142) rst generation models are commonly referred to as four-step models. These
models are typically formulated and calibrated at the level of the tra(cid:141) c zones.
Individuals are aggregated by tra(cid:141) c zone. Tra(cid:141) c is considered to be the result of
four sequential decisions: trip generation, trip distribution, mode split and tra(cid:141) c
assignment. These decisions are modelled separately at successive stages. Although
the four-step models have been widely used, even institutionalized in literally thou-
sands of applications (Stopher et al. 1996 ), the major shortcoming of these large-
scale, aggregate and supply-oriented models is their lack of behavioural content.
Consequently, researchers could not evaluate alternative policies such as tra(cid:141) c
demand management measures that are unrelated to investment proposals for major
facilities, because the evaluation of these policies requires the prediction of individual
behavioural responses.

Consequently, in the 1970s and 1980s, this aggregate approach was gradually
replaced by a disaggregate modelling approach. The disaggregate approach focuses
on decision-making and choice processes at the level of individuals or households.
This shift was stimulated by a policy change from long-term supply strategies to
short-term market-oriented tra(cid:141) c management initiatives. The major premise under-
lying this more decentralized and demand-oriented approach is that individual
decision-making mediates the impact of transport policies on travel patterns. If the
impact on an individual’s behaviour can be predicted, the eŒects of transport policies
can be easily derived by aggregating across individuals. The disaggregate approach
was developed from random utility theory. Individual travel decision-making is
represented by discrete choice models. Mode and destination choices are the two
types of travel decisions that have witnessed most applications.

Although the theoretical underpinnings of the disaggregate approach were cer-
tainly stronger than those underlying the aggregate approach, the disaggregate
approach also did not escape from major criticisms. Like the aggregate approach,
the disaggregate approach is a trip-based approach which decomposes travel behavi-
our into a set of simple problems related to single trips, ignoring the interdependencies
between individual trips. More importantly, the approach treats travel as a demand
in its own right, avoiding the question why people travel. It has become increasingly
evident, however, that travel choices fundamentally depend on choices to participate

in activities (Jones et al. 1990), and on choices of related travel. A failure to account
for these interdependencies will undermine the ability of the models to predict
important decisions such as the trade-oŒbetween activities with and without travel,
and between tours of single-stop and multi-stop. As a result, the approach was
accused of not being able to predict the shift from single-stop tours to multi-stop
tours and from non-travel activity patterns to patterns including travel. This limita-
tion has become signi(cid:142) cant in the light of the need to assess a set of new policy
initiatives proposed in recent years, including road pricing, information technologies,
teleworking/teleshopping, etc. It has been argued that these policies may induce
individuals to change their activity and travel behaviour by substituting out-of-home
activities with in-home activities, chaining individual trips into home-based tours
and changing the timing of activities and trips. Because of their inherent drawbacks,
the trip-based aggregate and disaggregate approaches may be less appropriate to
predict the eŒects of these potential behaviour changes.

It thus became necessary to explicitly address the fact that travel is derived from
the decision to participate in particular activities at diŒerent locations. This so-called
activity-based approach received some early attention in the late 1980s and became
a dominant modelling approach in recent years. The approach considers travel
decisions as derived from activity choices. Travel demand is thus accounted for by
explaining and analysing individuals’ and households’ activity decisions. These
decisions include whether, where, when, how, for how long and with whom activities
are conducted. The interdependencies among these decisions are explicitly taken into
consideration. The approach thus provides a more fundamental and comprehensive
framework to examine travel behaviour than the trip-based aggregate and disaggreg-
ate modelling approaches.

The activity-based approach has also resulted in a wider range of issues that
need to be addressed. According to Pas (1985), the major areas of investigation in
activity-based studies include:

demand for activity participation;
activity scheduling in time and space;
spatial-temporal , interpersonal, and other constraints;
interactions in travel decisions over time;
interactions among individuals; and
household structure and roles.

Existing activity-based studies can be roughly classi(cid:142) ed into two categories. One
stream of studies concerns empirically examining observed activity and travel pat-
terns. These studies aim at formulating hypothesis about activity and travel behavi-
our. Another important stream has focused on developing activity-based models.
These models intend to integrate the various decisions regarding activities and travel
in a model framework with theoretical underpinnings and the possibility of being
calibrated. In such a way, the models are able to predict how individuals may change
their activity and travel patterns in response to changes in their travel environments.
To help readers, who are not familiar with the activity-based modelling approach
to understand the terminology used in this paper, we shall (cid:142) rst de(cid:142) ne some terms.
Following Axhausen (1994), an activity is de(cid:142) ned as the main business carried
out at a location including waiting time before or after the activity. For example,
shopping is an activity carried out at a shop. Activities can be classi(cid:142) ed into types

565

according to their purposes. For example, working is an activity for subsistence,
while shopping is an activity for household maintenance.

The time of the day when activities are conducted is de(cid:142) ned as the timing of
activities. During a certain period, such as a month or a week, an activity may be
conducted several times. The frequency of activities thus represents the number of
times that a particular activity is conducted during a particular time period. An
activity may only be conducted at a particular location where the necessary facilities
and environment are provided. For example, one cannot conduct sporting activities
in a shop, because the shop usually does not provide an environment for sport. The
location where particular activities may be conducted is called the destination.
Destinations are characterized by their locational and non-locational attributes, such
as travel time to reach the location, the quality and quantity of facilities, etc. The
fact that not all activities can be performed at the same destination implies that one
has to move from one activity destination to another activity destination. Such a
movement between two activity destinations is called a trip. The means used to make
a trip is called a transport mode.

An activity program is de(cid:142) ned as a list of activities to be performed on a particular
day. For example, an individual’s daily activity program on Monday may include
the following out-of-home activities: working, sporting and visiting a friend. Before
implementing an activity program, individuals need to organize the activities in time
and space. They make decisions about where, when, in what sequence, in what home-
based tours to organize their activities along with what transport modes to use. This
detailed information regarding how activities are organized in space and time is
de(cid:142) ned as an activity schedule. Individuals do not necessarily perform activities
according to the planned activity schedule. They may be involved in unplanned
activities. We refer to the actual set of activities and the actual way in which activities
were performed as an activity pattern. Thus, an activity pattern contains the informa-
tion regarding activities, destinations, timings, sequence of activities, home-based
tours, transport modes, etc.

Individuals’ activity behaviour takes place within the context of their physical
and institutional environments. The spatial con(cid:142) guration and transport connections
between alternative destinations where individuals perform their commited activities
constitute the physical environment in which individuals live. In other words, the
physical environment refers to the home location, the work place, the locations of
shopping centres, etc., and the roads and public transportatio n facilities connecting
these places. The physical environment de(cid:142) nes an individual’s spatial opportunities
but also the constraints to pursue particular activities. The institutional environment
is de(cid:142) ned as the set of formal rules that regulate on individual’s time use. For
example, the working time arrangement between an individual and employer, opening
hours of shops and public facilities, time schedule of transport facilities, etc., are
elements of the institutional environment. The individiual’s institutional environment
determines their time opportunities and constraints for activity participation. For
example, a person who works until 6:00 p.m. will not be able to buy bread after
work, if shops are open from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays.

3. Requirements of activity-based modelling for GIS

Section 2 demonstrate d the complexity of activity-based modelling in terms of
the number of entities involved and the complicated relationships among the entities.
This complexity poses extreme demands on information handling. Since most activity

data are location speci(cid:142) c (geo-referenced), a GIS is particularly useful for activity-
based modelling. As suggested by Greaves and Stopher (1998), it is likely that GIS
will be used increasingly as a spatial decision support tool for activity modelling. In
general, GIS has great potential to support activity-based modelling in data collec-
tion, data management (retrieving, updating, etc.), data manipulation, data output
and visualization. Speci(cid:142) cally, activity-based travel demand modelling will bene(cid:142) t
from GIS in the following respects:

Support for data collection;
Provide cross-classi(cid:142) cation of activities by type, time, location, and socio-
demographi c characteristics of individuals;
De(cid:142) ne an individual’s spatial and temporal opportunity set for conducting
activities;
Represent the space-time prism.

Traditionally, transport demand modelling is based on travel surveys that collect
travel behaviour information such as trip purpose, transport mode and trip origin
and destination. The spatial dimension of this information is normally referenced to
tra(cid:141) c zones. For example, the origin and destination of a trip are recorded according
to the tra(cid:141) c zones they belong to. It is not a big problem if you do not use a GIS
to collect these information. On the other hand, a major part of an activity pattern
is where individuals are doing what, and from where to where individuals travel.
Because of these, information is required at a very detailed level, the traditional way
of recording spatial information by tra(cid:141) c zones is not su(cid:141) cient anymore. Instead,
one needs to record the detailed address where activities are conducted. This will
pose signi(cid:142) cant burdens to respondents because they need to recall detailed addresses
where they have been. It can also be erroneous because individuals normally can
not record exactly where they have been and where they are heading to by detailed
address. A GIS that contains detailed information about the location and addresses
of various facilities in a city is therefore desirable.

Descriptive analysis of activity and travel behaviour usually requires cross-
classi(cid:142) cation of activities by time, location, and socio-demographi c characteristics of
individuals, etc. For example, it is a typical exercise to examine representative activity
patterns and the frequencies and duration of individual activities by diŒerent kinds
of people. In order to construct an activity pattern, it is important to record the
topological relationships (in terms of time sequences) between activities and trips.
To meet these requirements it is necessary for GIS to support multi-perspective
queries. For example, in order to examine diŒerences in activity patterns of diŒerent
individuals, it is necessary to provide queries of activity related information based
on individuals. Similarly, in order to caluclate the average duration of activities, it
is necessary to retrieve information on the timing of activities by activity types.

As argued in the previous section, activity-based modelling intends to simulate
individual decision making regarding activity participation and travel. The key
information that is required in such modelling is the alternatives from which a choice
may be made. These alternatives can be spatial or temporal opportunities. In terms
of spatial opportunities, we refer to cases such as what are the potential destinations
for shopping? While the case of temporal opportunities refer to what time slots are
available to activity engagement? These spatial and temporal opportunities may be
entailed in the concept of space-time prisms (Hagerstrand 1970 ). Miller (1991)
proposed methods to use GIS for identifying space-time prisms.

567

Finally, visualization of activity patterns and space-time prisms is required to
present activity information in a more appealing way and may help researchers to
(cid:142) nd out important regularities underlying activity patterns.

To support all the functions identi(cid:142) ed above, the GIS database must be structured
and organized in an appropriate way that recognizes the dynamic nature of activity
and travel related information. In this case, it is the spatial and temporal inter-
action and the complicated interactions between individuals and their environments.
As will be argued in the next section, the recently proposed spatio-tempora l data
models cannot deal with the dynamics involved in activity patterns because that the
dynamics handled by these models are normally related to changes of spatial extent
in natural phenomena, while the dynamics in activty patterns are related to the
change of locations. A new data model is therefore required.

4. A mobility-oriente d spatio-temporal data model for activity-based transport
demand modelling

In order to develop a spatio-tempora l data model to support activity-based
modelling, the dynamic behaviour of activity patterns should (cid:142) rst be understood. As
argued in §1, the dynamics underlying activity patterns are quite diŒerent from the
dynamics of natural phenomena. In this section, we will (cid:142) rstly investigate this
diŒerence in detail in order to derive a proper model to accommodate the dynamics
of activity patterns. Based on the investigation, a mobility-oriented spatio-tempora l
data model will be proposed.

4.1. T ypes of spatio-tempora l behaviour

Based on the changing characteristics of the spatial attributes of objects, such as
location, boundary or shape, three types of spatio-tempora l behaviours can be
diŒerentiated (Tryfona and Jensen 1999, Hornsby and Egenhofer 2000, Renolen
2000 ):

A continuous change: objects of this type are always considered to be in a changing
state. For example, the (cid:143) ow of water, the moving plume of an oil spill and a storm
are usually modelled as ‘moving’ objects (changing location) with changing properties
(e.g. intensity) and shape continuously.

A discrete change: objects of this type are always in static states but change
instantaneously by events. This behaviour involves objects located in space, whose
characteristics, such as shape, as well as their position may change suddenly in time.
The land that a person owns is a typical example of this.

A stepwise change: objects of this type are sometimes static and sometimes change,
for example, movement of people and vehicles (car, plane, ship, etc.). In this type of
application, objects change in spatial position, but not in shape. For example, a ‘car’
moves on a road network, the location of the ‘car’ is changing, but its shape remains
unchanged.

The three types of spatial-tempora l behaviour are illustrated by (cid:142) gure 1. Panel
(a) illustrates the continuous type of spatio-tempora l behaviour by a slant line. Panel
(b) describes the discrete change by several horizontal and vertical lines. The hori-
zontal line means the static states, and vertical lines represent the sudden changes
between two static states. Panel (c) shows the stepwise change by horizontal and
slant lines with the horizontal lines representing the static states and the slant lines
representing objects in motion.

4.2. T he underlying dynamics of activity patterns

In order to understand the underlying dynamics of activity patterns,

let us

examine a hypothetical activity pattern of a particular person in 24 hours:

8:30–9:00 travelling from home to o(cid:141) ce
9:00–12:00 working
12:00–12:15 going to restaurant
12:15–13:00 having lunch
13:00–13:15 going back to o(cid:141) ce
13:15–18:00 working
18:00–18:10 going to a shop
18:10–19:00 shopping
19:00–19:30 going back home
19:30–8:30 at home

569

We may display this activity pattern in a two-dimensional coordinate system
with the horizontal axis representing the clock time and the vertical axis representing
the spatial relations of the activity destinations. Figure 2 shows the graphic repres-
entation of the activity pattern. The horizontal lines indicate that the person stays
in activity destinations (the length of the lines represents the duration of stays), while
the slant lines suggest that the person is travelling between activity destinations. If
we compare (cid:142) gure 2 with panel (c) of (cid:142) gure 1, it is easy to come to the following
conclusion: the underlying dynamics of activity patterns can be classi(cid:142) ed as the
stepwise type of spatio-tempora l behaviour. The object, in this case the person, is
sometimes static and some times in motion. The shape of the object (i.e. the size of
the person) does not change during motion.

From the viewpoint of mobility status, activity patterns can be described by two
types of state: Stay_at or T ravel_between. We may apply these two states to represent
the above activity pattern (table 1).

Therefore the activities of a person can be considered as the interaction of a
person with locations, either Stay_at or T ravel_between locations (as illustrated in
(cid:142) gure 3). If we use mobility to represent the characteristics of T ravel_between, and
no-mobility to describe the characteristics of Stay_at, this view can be considered as
a mobility-oriented view. This view treats activities as dynamic and occurring within
the largely static transportatio n space. It deals explicitly with the moving behaviour
of discrete objects (individuals) . This view can also be used to describe the dynamics
of vehicles (car, bus and airplane).

4.3. T he conceptual model

The types of dynamic behaviour discussed in §4.1 require diŒerent data models
to represent, because of their diŒerences in the natures of change, which demand
diŒerent types of information to be represented. Many of the existing spatio-tempora l
data models address the continuous type of dynamics. For example, the model
proposed by Raper and Livingstone (1995) focuses on the change of spatial extent
i.e. the expanding or shrinking of objects in spatial extent. The
(or boundary)
dynamics of natural phenomena are usually manifested in this type of change. In
terms of the information that should be captured for the continuous type of dynamics,
since the change of spatial extent is continuous, it can only be recorded in the form
of snapshots at particular times. Generally the time scale can be (cid:142) xed (monthly,
annually, etc) in order to analyse and model the change (Cheng and Molenaar 1999 ).
Furthermore, for modelling natural phenomena, only physical environmental con-
straints should be considered.

The event-based model proposed by Peuquet and Duan (1995 ) is for modelling
the discrete type of dynamics. Their model speci(cid:142) cally addresses the change of land-
use type in parcels. Models of this type are also suitable for modelling other discrete
types of changes such as the change of ownership of land parcel. Since this type of
change is random and discrete, the time when the event happened is usually recorded.
The factors (either physical or institutional) that might result in the events causing
the changes are usually included.

The stepwise type of spatio-tempora l behaviour or dynamics, for example the
dynamics underlying activity patterns, are revealed as the change in spatial positions,
e.g. the moving of human objects in a city. Thus, the change of locations should be
emphasized. Since this kind of dynamic is not always continuous, the time period
over which the changes of location happened should be recorded explicitly. Further,
the time scale is not (cid:142) xed in the sense that activity patterns can be de(cid:142) ned for a day
or a week. Moreover, the activity patterns are in(cid:143) uenced by the physical and
institutional environmental constraints. The physical constraints are spatial con-
straints, which include the information of the home and work address, the locations
of shopping centres and the network of roads. The institutional constraints require
that the information about the opening hours, facilities of locations and household
information of the persons should also be represented in the model. All these
specialities make the spatio-tempora l data model for activity-based modelling more

complicated. We will follow the mobility-oriented view discussed above to design
our model.

As discussed above, an individual’s activity pattern can be considered as a series
of Stay_at or T ravel_between in space during a particular time period. Thus, we may
present an activity pattern as a function of Stay_at or T ravel_between of the following
formula:

Activity Pattern 5 {Stay_at (1), T ravel_between(1), ..., Stay_at (i), T ravel_between(i),

..., T ravel_between(nÕ

f (T L s

T ravel_Between(i) 5
where, SL i represents the location of Stay_at (i), ST s
i represent the starting
time and ending time of Stay_at (i), respectively; Aim represents the activity of this
stay, such as work or sport; T L s
i represent the starting location and the
end location of T ravel_between(i) respectively (i.e. the destination of the previous
activity and the destination of the next activity); Similarly, T T s
i represent
the starting time and end time of T ravel_between(i). Finally Pathi is the transport
route of T ravel_between(i).

The spatial and temporal constraints can be represented by equations (4), (5),

(6) and (7).

Equation (4) means that the location of a stay is the start location of the next
T ravel_between and equation (5) means that the end location of T ravel_between(i)
1). Equation (6) states that the end of Stay_at (i) is the
is the location of Stay_at (i1
start time of T ravel_between(i1

1), whose end time is the start of the Stay_at (i1
(equation (7)). There are cases that two stays are in the same location and there is
no T ravel_between between them. These equations still work for such cases because
we may de(cid:142) ne SL i 5 SL i+1 and T L s
i . Still there might be other spatio-tempora l
constraints such as the time for sport should be within the opening hours of a sport
studio, which is not discussed here since these constraints are more related to the
methods of modelling.

i 5 T L e

The relationship between elements expressed in the equations can be represented
in a hierarchical structure as illustrated in (cid:142) gure 4. Since activity-based modelling
normally uses the household as the analytical unit because interactions between
household members are an important factor determining activity engagement. In
addition to the major elements of activity patterns, we include household and persons
as two additional elements in the diagram. It shows that a Household consists of
several persons. Furthermore, each Person has a planned activity program, which is
then realized as an activity pattern. The fourth layer of the diagram illustrates the
two major elements (Stay_at and T ravel_between) of activity pattern and their
topological relationships. Under the element of Stay_at, the location and duration
(which is de(cid:142) ned by the starting time and the end time) of the stay is indicated. The

element of T ravel_between is entailed by from where to where the travel takes place,
how long the travel lasts (which is de(cid:142) ned by the start and end time of the travel),
what
traverses. All Stay_at and
T ravel_between are connected by topological relations between time and locations.
For example, Location (i) of Stay_at (i) is the start location of T ravel_between(i)
(equation (6)) and the end location of T ravel_between-(i)Õ Location(i1 1), is the
location of Stay_at (i1

1) (equation (7)).

4.4. T he EER representation of the conceptual model

The conceptual model proposed in the last section can be expressed by an
extended-entity-relationshi p (EER) model, which describes the elements and the
hierarchical relationships between the elements as entities, relationships and attrib-
utes. We adopt the notation of EER diagram used in Elmasri and Navathe (2000,
p. 63). The EER representation of the conceptual model can then be illustrated as
‘PERSON’,
in (cid:142) gure 5. Ten entity types are de(cid:142) ned. They are ‘HOUSEHOL D’,
‘ACT IV IT Y_PROGRAM ’,
‘L OCAT ION ’,
‘STAY_AT ’, ‘T RAV EL_BET W EEN ’, ‘NODE ’, and ‘PAT H ’. Each of them is shown in
a rectangular box. Among them, ‘STAY_AT ’ and ‘T RAV EL_BET W EEN ’ are de(cid:142) ned
as weak entity types, because their existence depends on another two entity types
PERSON and L OCAT ION, which are the owner entity types. The interaction
between PERSON and L OCAT ION at a particular time derives a STAY_AT or
T RAV EL_BET W EEN. These two weak entity types are distinguished by being
placed in rectangles with boundaries of double lines and by having their identifying
relationship placed in diamonds with boundaries of double lines.

‘ACT IV IT Y_PAT T ERN ’,

‘ACT IV IT Y ’,

The relationship among these entity types are described by relationship types
shown in the diamond-shape d boxes attached to the participating entity types with
straight lines, such as HAS and POSE, etc. The cardinality ratio of each binary
relationship type is speci(cid:142) ed by attaching a 1, M, or N on each participating edge.

573

Figure 5. The EER diagram for the mobility-oriented spatio-temporal data model.

For example, the cardinality ratio of HOUSEHOL D:PERSON is 1:N, whilst it is 1:1
for T RAV EL_BET W EEN and STAY_AT for the relationship BEFORE. The parti-
cipation constraint is speci(cid:142) ed by a single line for partial participation and by double
lines for total participation.

The attributes are shown in ovals. Each attribute is connected by a straight line
to its entity type of relationship type. Key attributes have their names underlined.
For example, {Name} (the name of person), {Salary}, {Role} (the role of the person),
{ Wplace} (working place) and {Occupation} are the attributes of entity type
PERSON and {Pid} (the identi(cid:142) er of a person) is the key attribute. For entity type
L OCAT ION, there is a primary key {Laddress} (representing its address) and a
partial key { Ltype} (representing its function types), because diŒerent function types
of a location might have diŒerent opening time {To}, closing time {Tc}, and facility
size {Facility}.

Derived attributes are shown in dotted ovals, as illustrated by the attributes
{Pnum} (the number of persons in a household) and {Income} of HOUSEHOL D.
In addition, HOUSEHOL D is described by its primary key attribute {Hid } (identi(cid:142) er
of a household) and attribute ({Haddress} (its address).

4.5. T he logical model

We transform the EER model to a relational schema as a logical data model.
We will use the relational schema shown in (cid:142) gure 6 to illustrate the mapping steps
as follows.

(1) Each entity type HOUSEHOL D, PERSON, L OCAT ION, ACT IV IT Y ,
ACT IV IT Y_PAT T ERN, and ACT IV IT Y_PROGRAM in the EER model is

translated into a relation, which is given the same name. The relation inherits
all the attributes of each entity, with the primary (and partial) keys underlined.
Since NODE and PAT H are more related to spatial information and are
usually available in a GIS database, we will not discuss the structure of these
two entities.

(2) The weak entity type T RAV EL_BET W EEN together with the identifying
relationship T RAV EL_BET W EEN_AT is
translated into the relation
T RAV EL_BET W EEN. All the attributes {Ts} (starting time of travel), { Te}
(ending time of travel) and {Tmode} (transport mode) of the weak entity
type T RAV EL_BET W EEN are mapped into the attributes of the relation
T RAV EL_BET W EEN. In addition, the primary key attributes {Pid} and
{Laddress } of the relation(s) corresponding to the owner entity types
PERSON and L OCAT ION are included as foreign key attributes of the
relation T RAV EL_BET W EEN. Now the primary key attributes of relation
T RAV EL_BET W EEN are the combination of the primary keys of its owner

575

types and itself {Pid, Laddress1, Laddress2, Ts}. Since there are two
Locations involved in the T RAV EL_BET W EEN, two location addresses
(Laddress1 and Laddress2 ) are needed. In addition, the relation has its own
attributes {Te} and { Tmode}.

The translation of weak entity type STAY_AT is similar to the translation
of T RAV EL_BET W EEN. Similarly, the relation STAY_AT has primary key
attributes {Pid, Laddress, Ts} and attributes {Te} and {Stype} (the activity
type for the stay). In this case, only one location address is needed.

(3) For the binary 1:1 relationship REALIZED, which is an optional participa-
tion relation, we create a relation REAL IZAT ION to represent it. We include
the primary keys of the relations ACT IV IT Y_PROGRAM {APid} and
ACT IV IT Y_PAT T ERN {APTid} as primary keys in REAL IZAT ION and
rename them as {RAPid} and {RAPTid}.

For the binary 1:1 relationships BEFORE and AFT ER, we should
include the primary key of
the relation STAY_AT in the relation
T RAV EL_BET W EEN. Since the primary key of the relation STAY_AT is the
combination of the primary keys {Pid, Laddress, Ts}, we use {Sanum} as a
surrogate key to represent their unique combination for simplicity and add
it in the relation STAY_AT . {SAnum} is included in the T RAV EL_BET W EEN
relation as {BSAnum} (which means the previous stay of this travel, repres-
enting the relation BEFORE) and {ASAnum} (which means the next stay
after this travel, representing the relation AFT ER). Similarly, we use
{TBnum} as a surrogate key to represent the unique combination of {Pid ,
Laddress1, Laddress2 , Ts} in the relation T RAV EL_BET W EEN.

(4) For the binary 1:N relationship HAS, we include the primary key {Hid } of
relation HOUSEHOL D as a foreign key in the relation PERSON and call it
{PHid}.

For the binary 1:N relationship PL AN, we include the primary key of
the relation PERSON in the relation ACT IV IT Y_PROGRAM and call it
{APPid}. Similarly, for POSE we include the primary key of the relation
PERSON in the ACTIVITY_PATTERN relation and call it {APTPid} (This
1:N relation means that a person may have several patterns for diŒerent days
of a week).

For the binary 1:N relationships CONSIST_OF(T) and CONSIST_OF(S),
we include the primary key (APTid} of ACT IV IT Y_PAT T ERN as the foreign
key in the relation T RAV EL_BET W EEN and relation STAY_AT and call
them {TAPTid} and {SAPTid}, respectively.

For the binary 1:N relationship CONSIST_OF(A), we include the primary
key {APid} of the relation ACT IV IT Y_PROGRAM as a foreign key in the
ACT IV IT Y relation and call it {AAPid}.

After all the transformation s we also check the functional dependencies in the
relations. All the relations are in third normal form (3NF). Up to this point the
procedure of the model design, including conceptual and logical designs, is (cid:142) nished.

5.

Implementation
The aim of this section is to illustrate how to implement the data model proposed
in the previous section. We will (cid:142) rst describe the case study and creation of the

database. Design of the user-interface of multi-perspective queries will then be
reported.

5.1. T he Case

We used the data collected from six families to test the data model. Table 2
reports the information about these six families, including household ID, number of
persons, monthly income and address. The working members of these six families
are portrayed in table 3. Each person has a daily activity pattern. Here are two
examples:

The activity pattern of W inter is:

8:00–8:30 going to Baptist University by Train
8:30–12:00 working at Baptist University
12:00–13:00 having lunch at Baptist University
13:00–19:00 working at Baptist University
19:00–19:10 going to Festival Walk by walking
19:10–19:50 shopping at Festival Walk
19:50–20:00 going home (ParkView Garden) by Train
20:00–8:00 at home (ParkView Garden)

The activity pattern of Nancy is:

8:30–9:00 going to University by Train
9:00–12:00 working at University

In addition to the types of activities listed above, the activity patterns of other
persons may involve other activities, such as sporting or having dinner in a restaurant.
Similarly, in addition to the activity destinations listed above, the patterns of other
persons may involve other destinations.

5.2. T he database

We now apply the spatio-tempora l data model presented in §4.5 to organize the

data. First a database including only the major information is built.

Data describing the household are the same as those stated in table 2, although
a person identi(cid:142) er column (Pid) is added to that describing persons (table 3 ). Table 4
is used to encode the activity type (used as Atype in ACT IV IT Y , Stype in STAY_AT
and L type in L OCAT ION ), with six records representing six activity types. Table 5
is used to encode the travel mode (used as T mode in T RAV EL_BET W EEN ).

to describe the dynamics underlying activity patterns, because they represent the

5.3. User interface for multi-perspective queries

To simplify the operations for users to query and to visualize the query result, a
window-based query prototype was implemented based upon the function of
Network Analyst and Avenue provided by ArcView. In the following paragraphs,
we will demonstrate how the prototype may support the cross-classi(cid:142) cation of
activities by type, time, location, and socio-demographi c characteristics of individuals.
The prototype may be easily extended to support other tasks of activity-based
modelling.

We may organize the queries into four groups, i.e. time-based, person-based,
activity-based and location-based. Major functions of these four groups are listed
below:

T ime-based queries search for time related information, for example:

(a) ‘Where is person A and what is he/she doing at 10:00 a.m.?’
(b) ‘Which shops are open at 10:00 p.m.?’

Figure 7 shows the result of a time-based query, ‘Where is person 2 and
what is he doing at 12:30 p.m.? The result shows that this person was working
at University (indicated on the map) at this time.
Person-based queries look up information about a person, including personal
information, the types of activities he/she is engaged in and activity programs,
for example:

(a) What is the income of person B?
(b) What is the activity program of person B?
(c) Where person B is doing between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.?

Figure 8 illustrates the result of a person-based query. The two tables in
this (cid:142) gure show all activities that person W inter was engaged in for a whole day.
Activity-based queries search for information on when and where an activity
is conducted and by whom, for example:

(a) Where can shopping activities be conducted?
(b) How long did person C work?
(c) What is the probability that person C does shopping activity on Saturday?
(d ) Which activity person C did before he/she came home?

The result of an activity-based query is presented in (cid:142) gure 9. Panel (a)
shows the user-interface of querying activity Shopping. Two persons Shopped
and the result is reported in the table ‘stay.txt ’. Panel (b) shows the locations
where shopping activities were conducted: ‘Festival Walk’ and ‘Sha T in Station’.
L ocation-base d queries (cid:142) nd information on activity locations, for example:

(a) What are the opening hours of Festival Walk shopping centre?
(b) Where is the Baptist University located?
(c) What kind of activities may one conduct at Baptist University? Sporting?
Dinning?

Figure 10 illustrates location-base d queries. The (cid:142) gure displays the location of

shopping centres where a shopping activity could be conducted.

There are still other types of queries that the prototype supports. These queries
provide the information for calculating the frequency of activities, the average dura-
tion of activities, travel times to diŒerent activity types, time use patterns of diŒerent

types of persons, the relationships between activity participation patterns and the
socio-demographi c characteristics of individuals, etc. All of these are important topics
in activity-based transport demand modelling. The time- and location-base d queries
directly provide information on spatial and temporal opportunities (or constraints)
for activity participation, this information is essential for de(cid:142) ning choice alternatives
in activity scheduling models.

6. Discussion and conclusions

This paper presents a so-called mobility-oriented spatio-tempora l data model for
activity-based transport demand modelling. The conceptual and logical designs and
prototype system are reported. The prototype supports queries from time-based,
person-based, activity-based and location-base d perspectives. These query functions
are illustrated and tested by a case based in Hong Kong. The case study proves that
the data model is powerful in organizing, managing and manipulating data for
activity-based modelling. In the future, the prototype will be extended to support
activity scheduling and policy change evaluation, by providing functions to (cid:142) nd
out activity schedules for giving activity programs and to identify impacts on activity
patterns of changes in opening hours, level of service of the transport system, etc.
In other words, the proposed data model is capable of supporting all aspects of
activity-based modelling.

Although the case used to illustrate the application of the data mode is simple,
it has all the essential data that one may encounter in activity-based transport
modelling. The model should be able to manage large amounts of activity data,
although the search time might increase if the data size is very large. The proposed
data model should also be able to handle GPS (Global Position System)-derived
data and easily establish links with the data types included in the model. First, for
the entity having locational information such as Stay_at, we assigned a location
attribute, which records the name of the location but the name is linked to a pair
of coordinates in the map. If GPS-derived coordinates are available, they may simply
be linked to the location attributes. Secondly, if the GPS-derived coordinates are
used to construct a moving Path of a person, these coordinates can be used as nodes
constituting the Path for the T ravel_between relation. This ‘Path’ is not necessarily
the shortest path in our model.

While the data model is developed to support activity-based transport modelling,
we believe that this model can be applied to represent and model the dynamical
behaviour of objects with step-wise changes in general.

INTRODUCTION

Usually a street map contains various types of detailed
information  and appears to be very crowded. As a result, to
many users, a street map looks complicated and is not easy
to read and follow. To a certain degree, too much detail
would make the map uninformative and noisy. Therefore,
simpliﬁcation of such a map is necessary for display and for
map interpretation efﬁciency.

applied: 

Two types of   simpliﬁcation can be 

to   the
content and to the graphics. The former means the
omission of less important information and the latter means
the improvement of the clarity of the map for easy reading
and interpretation. Map generalization is a process for both
types of simpliﬁcation. A map such as the London tube map
(Figure 1), called a schematic or topological map in some
literature, has been often cited as an excellent example of
possible graphic simpliﬁcation for clarity.

Automated generation of such a map has long been a
dream of cartographers. Many researchers in recent years
have developed algorithms and/or procedures for the
automated production of schematic maps for underground
routes
(e.g. Scott and Rodgers, 2005; Wolff, 2007;
Noellenburg and Wolff, 2011; Scott et al., 2011) and road
networks (e.g. Neyer, 1999; Avelar and Mueller, 2000;
Cabello et al., 2001; Ware et al. 2006, Avelar et al., 2007;

Merrick and Gudmundsson, 2007; Dong et al., 2008; Li
and Dong, 2010; Wang and Chi, 2011). A few researchers
(e.g. Avelar and Hurni, 2006) discuss the design of such
maps. However, it seems that no research work has been
devoted to the general principles of schematic maps: this
short article addresses this forgotten topic.

A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF EXISTING WORK: THE LACK
OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Most algorithms follow the three-step procedure proposed
by Elroi (1988), as follows:
N to simplify lines to basic shapes;
N to re-orient lines along grid lines; and
N to enlarge those areas where roads are congested.
The differences rest in the use of different solutions to these
three steps. Figure 2 shows typical examples of the results
from such algorithms, which are used for illustration by
Ware et al. (2006).

It can be seen that the resulting maps are still very close
to the original map and indeed can be regarded as
caricatures of it. It is very clear that such a map is still too
‘realistic’ and is far away from the abstract level of the
London tube map. Indeed, by comparing the London tube

map and these schematic maps automatically generated by
the existing algorithms, one could ﬁnd that:
N the former has large distortions in some (i.e. central)
areas (Jenny, 2007), while the latter is somehow still
semi-metric; and
N lines on the former are straightened, while those on the

latter are zigzag.

It  has  been  pointed  out  by  Li  and  Dong  (2010)  that
the zigzag nature of the re-oriented lines in such schematic
maps  is  due  to  the  fact  that  each  line  segment  of  a  long
road  is  re-oriented  individually  (Figure  3).  Therefore,  Li
and  Dong  (2010)  proposed  the  use  of  the  whole  road,
instead of road segments, resulting in the  so-called  ‘stroke-
based’ strategy, as follows:
N to increase the space for congested areas by increasing
N to form roads (or strokes) from line segments;
N to orient the strokes along grid lines and/or diagonals; and
N to straighten the lines as a post-process.

the scale in such areas, if desirable;

With this stroke-based strategy, street/road segments with
identical names are sequentially connected together to form a
stroke. On the other hand, if streets/roads are not named in a
set of data, then one needs to concatenate segments naturally,

based  on  the  good  continuation  grouping  principle 
of perception.  With  this  principle,  for  example,  line  seg-
ments 3,4,  4,5,  5,6,  6,7  and  7,8  in  Figure  3  can  be  con-
catenated into a single stroke and then re-oriented as a line.
In this way, alternatives as shown in Figures  3c and 3d can
be produced.

Seven constraints were considered for the schematization
by  Ware  et  al  (2006),  i.e.  topological,  orientation,  length, 
angle,  rotation,  clearance  and  displacement.  Thresholds
have  been  set  for  these  constraints.

.

In summary, so far no general principles have been set for
schematization. This study intends to formulate some general
principles.

FOUR GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR SCHEMATI 

Z 

  ATION

It can be noticed that in the schematization process, all
researchers and practitioners make efforts to preserve the
topological relationship between lines in a network. This
should therefore be the ﬁrst principle, as follows:

The First Principle of Schematization (Principle of the
Preservation of the Topological Relationship): The
topological relationship between the lines in a network
should be preserved after schematiz

The  topological  relationship 
(connected  or  disconnected),  parallelism,  inclusion,  inter-
section  and  so  on.

Schematization is a simpliﬁcation process. Therefore,
some general principles used in map generalization (Li,
2007)   could 
valid in schematization. In map
generalization, one of the general principles is that the main
structure of the original map should be preserved after
generalization. Therefore, the second principle of schema-
tization could be written as:

The Second Principle of Schematization (Principle of
the Preservation of the Main Structure of a Line
Network): The main structure of the line network
should be preserved after schemati  ation.

z

For example, the main structure of the line network shown
in Figure 3 is that (1) a major road formed by points 3, 4, 5,
6, 7 and 8 goes from west to east and (2) another major road
formed by points 1, 2, 7, 10 and 11 goes from north to south
and then southeast. This principle is followed in the design of
the two alternative maps shown in Figure 3.

These two principles are about the preservation of some
key properties of a map and they cannot be violated in the
schematization process.

One may compare schematization with map projection.
In a map projection, four types of distortion are possible,
i.e. distance (or length), area, angle and direction (or
orientation). In schematization, the area distortion and
shape distortion are generated by intention to improve the

clarity. Therefore, only the general principles for length and
orientation are required. On the other hand, location (or
position) is about line nodes, and is related to orientation.
As a result, another principle can be formulated as follows:

The Third Principle of Schematization (Principle of
Relativity in Position): A point which is on one side of a
reference line on the original map may not be relocated
z
 ation.
on the other side of the reference line after schematiz

A reference line is normally a vertical or a horizontal line.
However, it could also be a major line in the network. For
example, the concatenated stroke line formed by points 3,
4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 on the map shown in Figure 3 could be a
good choice as a major reference line. If one makes use of
the vertical line passing through point 7 as a reference line
with this principle, it is not permitted to relocate point 1 on
the map (Figure 3) to the left side of this reference line, but
it could be moved at most onto the reference line. One sees
that this principle has been violated in Figure 3b, but is well
preserved in Figures 3c and 3d.

The last principle is about the relationship between the
length of a line before and after the schematization and it
may be written as:

The Fourth Principle of Schematization (Principle of
Relativity in Length): A line segment which is longer

One could see that line segment 3,4 in Figure 3a is
longer than line segment 4,5, but

this principle has been

violated. With this principle, line segment 3,4 in Figure 3
line
should be kept longer than, or at most equal to,
segment 4,5 in the ﬁnal result after schematisation.

Of course,

these two are the General Principles of
Relativity. It is desirable to keep them intact. However, it is
possible to have these principles violated in very special cases.

CONCLUSIONS

In this short article, analysis of existing work in the
automated generation of schematic maps has been con-
ducted, and it is found that almost all existing research is on
the development of algorithms and procedures, and that
there is a lack of general principles.

In this article, four general principles have been formulated

for schematization, i.e.
N First Principle of Schematization – Principle of the
N Second Principle of Schematization – Principle of the
Preservation of the Main Structure of the Line Network;

Preservation of the Topological Relationship;

N Third Principle of Schematization – Principle of Relativity
N Fourth Principle of Schematization – Principle of Relativity

in Position; and

in Length.

The ﬁrst two are the principles of preservation. These two
should never be violated. The last two are principles of
relativity, and it is very desirable to keep these two intact
unless there is an absolute need to violate them.

Abstract. Gazeteers and geographical thesauri can be regarded as parsimonious
spatial models that associate geographical location with place names and encode
some semantic relations between the names. They are of particular value in pro-
cessing information retrieval requests in which the user employs place names to
specify geographical context. Typically the geometric locational data in a gazetteer
are con(cid:142) ned to a simple footprint in the form of a centroid or a minimum bounding
rectangle, both of which can be used to link to a map but are of limited value in
determining spatial relationships. Here we describe a Voronoi diagram method for
generating approximate regional extents from sets of centroids that are respectively
inside and external to a region. The resulting approximations provide measures of
areal extent and can be used to assist in answering geographical queries by evaluat-
ing spatial relationships such as distance, direction and common boundary length.
Preliminary experimental evaluations of the method have been performed in the
context of a semantic modelling system that combines the centroid data with
hierarchical and adjacency relations between the associated place names.

Introduction
There are many contexts in which geographical location may be an important
dimension for purposes of information retrieval. It is not always the case however
that the conventional facilities of geographical information systems are required or
necessary in order to meet the users’ needs (Larson 1996, Jones et al. 1996, Moss
et al. 1998 ). In particular it may not be necessary to produce a digital map or to
employ detailed spatial data. Examples of types of enquiry where this may be the
case (though is not necessarily so) include those that require lists of retail outlets,
hotel accommodation, archaeological sites, tourist attractions or industrial sites that

lie inside or in the vicinity of some named place. In such enquiries the user may
want to see data or documents that relate to the speci(cid:142) ed places, while from a spatial
viewpoint the needs may be con(cid:142) ned to that of having found a reasonable, perhaps
approximate match with the speci(cid:142) ed place.

To service these enquiries it may be su(cid:141) cient to employ a sparse, or parsimonious,
representation of geographic space that combines a rich set of place name data with
only limited locational data that provides an approximation of the spatial extent, or
footprint. Data of this sort are typically referred to as gazetteers or geographical
thesauri (Hill et al. 1999, Harpring 1997b), while the combination of the data and
some associated functionality may be referred to as a geographical name server
(GNS). GNS of this kind may lend themselves to limited bandwidth situations, such
as in many WWW applications. When used in the context of query processing, such
data enable a user-speci(cid:142) ed name to be matched with place names attached to the
stored data. As with conventional information retrieval applications, the underlying
information may have been indexed using terms diŒerent from those employed in a
user’s query. For example, a user may refer to a more speci(cid:142) c place name, employ
an archaic alternative, or simply a nearby place name. The matching process could
be precise, or it could be imprecise, whereby the geographical name server was
employed to (cid:142) nd place names that were similar in the sense of being alternative
versions for the same place, or of being spatially related. Determination of spatial
closeness could be performed, for example, by traversing a geographical names
hierarchy, to (cid:142) nd containing places, or by using the limited locational data to (cid:142) nd
places that were within some threshold distance of the speci(cid:142) ed place. Following
standard procedures for information retrieval it may be appropriate to rank the
results of approximate matches in terms of their estimated closeness to the target
place.

The use of gazetteers and GNS to process geographical enquiries in this way is
at present in its infancy, but it can be expected to grow considerably as users of
search engines raise their expectations of the level of geographical intelligence with
regard to place name terminology. Research challenges in this area include those of
determining the most appropriate data that should be stored in a gazetteer, the
provision of support for user speci(cid:142) cation of spatial relationships in their query, and
the development of semantic and spatial closeness measures that accurately re(cid:143) ect
a user’s perception of the similarity of a found place to one that they specify. A
recent initiative in gazetteer design is the proposal of a content standard in association
with the Alexandria Digital Library (Hill 1996, Hill et al. 1999 ). It may be regarded
as pointing the way forward for future gazetteer design as well as helping to raise
the pro(cid:142) le of the potential of gazetteers in geographical information retrieval. The
proposed gazetteer, which adopts a metadata approach, is very (cid:143) exible with regard
to the types of data that may be stored. Notably, it leaves open the possibility of
various types of relationship between place names, which could be spatial as well as
administrative. An important issue highlighted by Hill, and one which aŒects the
potential of the gazetteer to assist in geographical query processing, is that of the
form of the spatial footprint that should be stored with a place name.

A spatial

footprint may be used to determine, or at least estimate, spatial
relationships between places. These could include distance, direction, and some
topological relationships such as containment and overlap. Some existing gazetteers
and geographical thesauri, such as Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)
(US Geological Survey 1998 ) and the Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN)

(Harpring 1997a, 1997b) , only store single points for footprints and hence are
restricted in their potential for estimating spatial relationships. The Alexandria
Digital Library (ADL) proposals allow for other forms of footprint, ranging from a
minimum bounding rectangle, at the least accurate, to what might be a relatively
precise polygonal boundary. The determination of a footprint is in any event not
always simple, as some place names refer to inherently imprecise regions, for which
there may be no ‘o(cid:141) cial’ discrete boundary. In such cases, examples of which would
be the ‘Rockies’ in America, and the ‘Midlands’ in the UK, it may be desirable to
provide a footprint based on a common understanding of the extent of the region
and the places within it.

Here we present a method for estimating spatial footprints from the locations of
point sites that are known to lie inside a region and of point sites that are known
to be outside. It is called the Dynamic Spatial Approximation Method (DSAM) and
is based on the Voronoi diagram of the point sites. DSAM is intended to be used in
combination with gazetteers and geographical thesauri that contain the co-ordinate s
of a centroid associated with each settlement or other named site. It is assumed that
the place name data are structured hierarchically and that the spatial relationship
of meets is encoded between the referenced regions. Thus settlements and other
point-referenced sites should refer to their parent regions, of which there could be
several, while regional place names refer both to their parents and to their connected
neighbours. Regions for which DSAM estimates a spatial footprint may be precise
administrative areas or imprecise topographic or cultural areas, and they may be
current or historical. Support of historical regions necessitates the presence of tem-
poral data associated with the place names, but this is now widely regarded as an
important element of gazetteers (Copp 1997, Moss et al. 1998, Chappell 1999, Hill
et al. 1999, Beard et al. 1997a), as indeed it is of any metadata.

In the remainder of the paper, we describe in §2 the OASIS system that we have
developed for modelling place names and associated semantic data. This system is
used to provide the data needed to implement DSAM. The DSAM method is
described in detail in §3. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 present results of evaluating the quality
of region approximation with regard to area and to visual appearance respectively.
In §4.3 we present the results of some preliminary experiments to evaluate the
reliability of the method for determining selected topological, directional and proxim-
ity relations. DSAM evaluation and future work are covered in §5. Conclusions are
presented in §6.

2. The OASIS system
2.1. OASIS overview

The DSAM method was developed as an approximate spatial region represen-
tation and inference method for the OASIS (Ontologically Augmented Spatial
Information System) research project. OASIS is a prototype hypermedia information
system, developed to explore the potential of knowledge organisation systems in
searching cultural heritage data collections. An important consideration is the provi-
sion of functionality to support queries in space and time and to do so in a way
that would be global in spatial coverage. To this end, OASIS combines thematic
data with a geographical thesaurus which, while containing only sparse geometric
data, is relatively rich in encoding qualitative relationships between named places.
Several spatial and thematic similarity measures are employed in the OASIS system
to (cid:142) nd similar items and places by imprecisely matching query terms.

2.2. OASIS data

The two main types of data used in this project are thematic and spatial. Thematic
data includes data on museum objects and artefacts, where and when they were
found or made, the material they are made of, etc. This data was taken mainly from
the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland
(RCAHMS), which contains a large amount of information on archaeological sites
and historical buildings and monuments in Scotland (Murray 1997). This was
combined with the Art and Architecture T hesaurus (AAT) which is a vocabulary
resource developed by the J. Paul Getty Trust. It contains over 120 000 structured
terms for the description of art, architecture, and material culture (Petersen and
Barnett 1994). The classi(cid:142) cation schema of the OASIS system was linked to the
FORTH (Foundation for Research and Technology—Hellas) implementation of
the AAT which provides the necessary thematic descriptors for the RCAHMS data,
such as ‘bronze’, ‘disk’, ‘building’, ‘castle’, etc.

The spatial data in the OASIS system includes information on hierarchical and
adjacency relations between named places, place types, and co-ordinates. Much of
this information was derived from the Bartholomew’s (Harper Collins 2000) digital
map data for Scotland, which includes place names and co-ordinate s of several types
of objects, such as towns, villages, airports, hills, golf courses, etc. Some data, such
as place types and alternative names, was also taken from the Getty T hesaurus
for Geographic Names database, which is a structured vocabulary of place names
(Harpring 1997a). The TGN places are represented hierarchically according to the
current political and physical world. A place name can be vernacular, English, or a
historical name.

2.3. OASIS classi(cid:142) cation schema

OASIS has a rich classi(cid:142) cation schema that enables the storage of diŒerent
versions of place names (e.g. current and historical names, names in diŒerent lan-
guages) , place types (e.g. City, Building, Port, Hill),
latitude and longitude co-
ordinates, and topological relationships (e.g. overlaps, meets, part of ) ((cid:142) gure 1). The
schema is implemented using the Semantic Index System (SIS), an objected-oriented

Figure 1. The classi(cid:142) cation schema of ‘Place’ in the OASIS system.

291

database system (Constantopolous and Doerr 1993, Doerr 1997) which is also used
to store the data. The SIS has a meta modelling capability and an application
interface for querying the schema.

The meta level classi(cid:142) cation of Place is shown in (cid:142) gure 1. Classes are represented
by rectangular boxes linked to other classes via relationships represented by arrow
lines. Relationships can also be instantiated or subclassed from other relationships.
For example, the relationships meets, overlaps, and partOf are subclasses of the
relationship T opological Relationships. Standard Name and Alternative Name are
instances of the relationships Preferred T erm and Non Preferred T erm respectively
(shown between brackets in (cid:142) gure 1). Place inherits all other relationships such as
longitude, latitude, area, etc., from its superclass Geographical Concept.

Figure 2 shows the classi(cid:142) cation diagram of the City of Edinburgh. The City of
Edinburgh is an instance of Geopolitical Place. The places that are part of the City
of Edinburgh are represented in (cid:142) gure 2 by a dummy class called MANYpartOf,
which can be opened in a separate window listing all the places that are administrat-
ively part of the region of the City of Edinburgh. The City of Edinburgh is also linked
by meets relationships to the regions that it shares a boundary with. Although the
meets relationships are symmetric, they were entered in both directions to increase
the speed of search and retrieval. The information stored in the OASIS database
can be accessed using a set of functions through which it is possible to (cid:142) nd all the
information related to a given place, or (cid:142) nd all the places with speci(cid:142) c relationships.
For example to (cid:142) nd all the places that are part of Edinburgh, the system would
return a set of all the places that are linked with a partOf relationship pointing to
Edinburgh. All relationships can be associated with dates. For example a partOf
relationship can be linked to a certain date to indicate when the place became part
of the other. This makes it possible for example to (cid:142) nd all places that used to be
part of Edinburgh during a certain period of time. This type of information is
necessary in generating fuzzy and historical boundaries, as will be explained in §3.

3. The DSAM method

The Dynamic Spatial Approximation Method (DSAM) generates approximation s
of spatial regions based on Voronoi diagrams ((cid:142) gure 3). These diagrams are built
from the co-ordinate s of places within these regions, and of places in regions that
are known to surround them. DSAM cannot be applied in its current form to mainly
empty regions, or to a region that is connected to an empty region. An empty region
is one that has no places to be part of it, either due to lack of data, or due to its
topographica l type (e.g. lake, sea, etc.). Several approaches are proposed later in this
paper to widen the scope of the method’s implementation.

As explained in §2.3, the places that are part of a speci(cid:142) c spatial region can easily
be found from the OASIS system via partOf relationships and their co-ordinate s can
be retrieved. Each region is linked with meets relationships to its surrounding regions.
Hence, the co-ordinate s of the places within the surrounding regions can also be
retrieved. These co-ordinate s are then used to construct the Voronoi diagrams that
represent the boundary approximation .

Boundary approximation s generated by DSAM are used to infer spatial relations
between regions in the absence of digitised boundaries. Tests presented in this paper
show that the inconsistency between DSAM approximation s and the original bound-
aries can be quite low ((cid:142) gure 4). From the approximations , it is possible to calculate
area measures, directional relationships (e.g. 10% north, 90% north-east), topological
relationships of overlap, lengths of shared boundaries, and point-to-region , and
region-to-region Euclidean distances.

DSAM has the capability of handling change and generating fuzzy and historical
boundaries from the co-ordinate s of the places that are known to be, or have been,
within these boundaries. For example to get the administrative boundaries of a
region at a certain date, all that is required are the places known to be part of that
region at that time. The OASIS system can store and retrieve this type of information
e(cid:141) cienctly as demonstrate d in §2.3. To take a hypothetical example, assume that a
user is interested in the area of South Lanarkshire, that was aŒected by a (cid:143) ooding
at a speci(cid:142) c date. The DSAM approximation for South Lanarkshire can be generated
as usual, then the set of Voronoi polygons of the places that were aŒected by the
(cid:143) ooding can be retrieved. The area and boundary length of the selected zone can be
measured from the area and boundaries of the Voronoi polygons in the retrieved set
((cid:142) gure 5).

Having a large number of accurate place co-ordinate s is important as the quality
of DSAM approximation s increases with the number of place co-ordinate s available.

3.1. Voronoi diagrams

Voronoi diagrams are fundamental types of data structures in computational
geometry (Aurenhammer 1991). They have important value in many (cid:142) elds, such as
computer science, mathematics, physics, natural science, etc. The Voronoi diagram
of a set of points is the partition of space around them into cells, where each cell
represents the area of space that is closer to the associated point than to any other
point ((cid:142) gure 6). The Voronoi polygon of a point is created from the perpendicular
bisectors of the segments linking that point to those points closest to it.

Several versions of Voronoi algorithms have been developed for various types
of spatial query (Okabe et al. 1992). Voronoi diagrams are valuable in de(cid:142) ning
solutions to spatial adjacency and nearest-neighbou r problems (Sedgewick 1988,
Aurenhammer 1991, Gold 1989, Gold 1991). Points are considered to be adjacent
to each other if they share a Voronoi polygonal boundary. Having constructed a
Voronoi diagram, the nearest data point to an arbitrary location may be found by
determining the Voronoi polygon that contains the location.

Insertion and deletion of points to Voronoi diagrams can be implemented at run
time, without the need to reconstruct the whole diagram. This assures that updated
data can be available at all times, and opens new possibilities for users to experiment
with the data and formulate ‘what-if ’ type of queries (Gold 1992 ).

Figure 5. DSAM approximation of fuzzy boundaries.

Figure 6. Voronoi diagrams for a set of points.

The Voronoi diagrams used in this paper were generated using Arc/Info’s Thiessen
algorithm. The research also made use of a program called Qhull (1997) which
computes Voronoi diagrams, convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, and other geo-
metric algorithms. Areas of Voronoi polygons and their edge lengths can be calculated
from the co-ordinate s of the Voronoi nodes produced by Qhull. It is also possible
to (cid:142) nd the two place-points that a speci(cid:142) c polygonal edge falls between, and vice
versa. This information is used by DSAM to identify the boundary between two
regions from the polygonal edges that lie between pairs of points, one from each
region. Areas of regions can be approximated from the total area of Voronoi polygons

295

of the points that are part of that region. Other spatial information can be derived
from Voronoi diagrams as will be seen later in this paper.

3.2. Queries

DSAM can be used to answer a variety of spatial queries, and to rank results.

1. Shape representation. ‘Show me the region of Falkirk’.
2. Shared boundary lengths between regions known to meet. ‘How long is the
boundary between Midlothian and West L othian?’. DSAM can calculate the
lengths of shared boundaries and rank the regions accordingly.

3. Area of overlap between overlapping regions. ‘W hich hills overlap the L othian
area?’. DSAM can rank the answer set according to the degree of overlap.
4. Directional relationships. ‘W hat administrative regions surround Aberdeenshire
from the south?’. ‘Are there any Roman sites to the west of Midlothian?’. DSAM
can calculate and rank directional relationships with regard to areal extent.
5. Generating current, historical, and imprecise boundaries. ‘Show me the bound-
ary of the L othian region as it used to be in 1992’,
‘Give me information on
bronze lamps found within the 17th century borders of Edinburgh’, ‘Show me the
boundary of the Middle East’.

6. Euclidean distance calculation between point and area referenced objects.

‘How far is Edinburgh Castle from the Scottish Borders?’.

7. Nearest neighbour queries. ‘W hich is the nearest museum?’. DSAM is based on
Voronoi diagrams, which in turn can be used to answer nearest neighbour
queries.

4. Error of approximatio n

As mentioned earlier, to assure good quality DSAM approximations , it is neces-
sary to have a uniformly distributed large amount of point-location co-ordinates.
In the experiments that follow, the point-locational data were taken from the
Bartholomew’s digital map data sets for the UK and include various point-referenced
sites in addition to settlements. Quality of approximation can be measured in diŒerent
ways that can be categorized as follows:

1. T otal areal error. This is the common way to measure approximation quality,
which is based on comparing the area of approximation with the area of the
original region.

2. V isual error. This is related to how diŒerent the approximated shape is from
the original region’s shape. This is important when representing objects
graphically.

3. Quality of spatial relationships. This concerns the extent to which the spatial
relationships between the approximated regions are consistent with the spatial
relationships between the original regions.

4.1. T otal areal error

The areal approximation error can be calculated from the diŒerence in area
measure between the approximation and its original region. As explained in the
following section, the DSAM method, as does any boundary generalization method,
produces negative and positive false areas. However, for areal change calculations
only total areas will be compared disregarding whether the area is a positive or
negative false area ((cid:142) gure 7). Accuracy of total area is important for queries of the
sort
is the size of

‘which is the largest region in Scotland’, or simply ‘what

Downloaded by [University of Nebraska, Lincoln] at 10:16 23 October 2014 296

H. Alani et al.

Aberdeenshire? ’. To process such queries it is important that the total area of
approximation is as close as possible to the area of the original region. The areal
error can be calculated as follows:

Areal Error5

|

| Ap Õ A0
A0

100%

(1)

where Ap is the total area of approximation , and A0
is the area of the original object.
Areal error of 0% means that the area of approximation equals the original area. If
areal error is more than 100%, this means that the approximated area is more than
double the original one.

4.1.1. Experiment with areal error calculations

Table 1 shows the areal error calculations for (cid:142) ve regions in Scotland using
equation (1). It can be seen that the average areal error was around 2%, with almost
an exact match in some cases.

4.2. V isual error

The visual error of approximation s becomes an important issue when providing
graphical displays of spatial regions. The user might like to see the location of a
certain place with respect to its region. For some applications it might be su(cid:141) cient
and acceptable to use these approximation s to represent some of the query results
graphically.

normally results in negative and positive false areas. Negative false areas are the
original areas that were left out in the approximation , while positive false areas are
the ones that were added to the approximation , and did not belong to the original
region ((cid:142) gure 8). Here we use the sum of these false areas (symmetric diVerence) as a
simple measure of the extent to which the method retains the visual form of the
original region.

The following function is used to calculate visual error:

V isual Error5

App1 Anp
A0

100%

(2)

where App is the positive approximated false area, Anp is the negative approximated
false area, and A0
is the original area. Visual error of 0% is an exact match in shape
between the approximation and the original object. If visual error exceeds 100%,
this means that the area of symmetric diŒerence exceeds the original area.

4.2.1. Experiment with visual error calculations

The visual error was calculated for (cid:142) ve regions in Scotland using equation (2),
and the results are presented in table 2 below. The average visual error was found
to be around 13%.

4.3. Quality of spatial relationships

For purposes of information retrieval it may be desirable to combine qualitative
relations with a quantitative value that re(cid:143) ects the extent or degree of the relationship.
This type of information is important when measuring similarities between spatial
objects and ranking query results (Bruns and Egenhofer 1996, Beard and Sharma
1997b) . For example, the answer to a query of the form;
‘Give me information on
woodland overlapping region A’ could be ranked according to the amount of over-
lapping area, so that woodland with most overlapping area would be placed at the
top of the list. Traditional gazetteers cannot usually be used to obtain the necessary
data. They are also weak in calculating Euclidean distances, adjacency, and nearest

neighbour relationships for regions, as point co-ordinate information maintained by
gazetteers is not su(cid:141) cient to compute such relationships. For example measuring
Euclidean distances between regions from their centroid co-ordinates would produce
inaccurate results if the user were interested in Euclidean distances between their
boundaries.

The three main categories of spatial relationships are topological, directional,
and proximity relationships (Pullar and Egenhofer 1988, Egenhofer 1991, Clementini
et al. 1993 ). The following sections describe how the DSAM method can be used to
derive spatial relationships using simple mathematical procedures, and present some
preliminary experiments to test the quality of result.

4.3.1. T opological relationships

Topological relationships are related to how objects interconnect and form an

important component of spatial information systems.

The six main topological relationship s are inside, cover, equal, meet, overlap, and
disjoint (Egenhofer 1991). DSAM approximation s can be used to evaluate all of these
types of relationship but the results can be expected to be more error-prone than when
using full boundary representations . Examples of speci(cid:142) c types of error are provided
in §5. Figure 9 illustrates an example of the result of using DSAM approximatio n
extents to determine overlap and adjacency respectively between pairs of regions. In

(cid:142) gure 9(a) the overlap is represented by the shared Voronoi polygons, which are
bounded by white lines. In the case of adjacency in (cid:142) gure 9(b) the boundary is estimated
from the Voronoi polygon edges that are common to the two regions.

4.3.1.1. Experiments to estimate boundaries between regions. Table 3 shows the
results of measuring lengths of shared boundaries between selected regions. The
table compares actual boundary lengths with those calculated from DSAM
approximations . The shared boundary error can be calculated as follows:

where Bp is the boundary calculated from DSAM approximations , and B0
is the
original boundary length. Boundary error of 0% is an exact match between the
approximated boundary and the original boundary. A boundary error of more
than 100% indicates an approximated boundary of more than double the original
boundary length.

4.3.2. Directional relationships

The results presented above show that the average error of shared boundary

Directional relationships (Frank 1992, 1996) are widely used in spatial queries,
and complement topological relationships in measuring spatial objects’ similarity
(Goyal and Egenhofer, in press). Most systems use centroid co-ordinates, Minimum
Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) or some representative points as models to derive
directional relationships (Goyal and Egenhofer, in press). Due to the roughness of
these approximations , several alternative approaches have previously been investi-
gated. These approaches focus on partitioning space around the MBR of the main
object into 9 tiles (N, NW, NE, S, SW, SE, E, W, and 0) as shown in (cid:142) gure 10
(Papadias and Egenhofer 1997, Goyal and Egenhofer,
in press, Papadias and
Theodoridis 1997, Theodoridis et al. 1998), and measuring how much area of the
target object falls into each tile.

A typical example of query results on directional relationships would be of the
form; region A is 30% north-east of B, and 70% east of B. Figure 11 shows the
DSAM approximation s of two such regions; Midlothian and South Lanarkshire.

4.2.2.1. Experiment with directional relationship calculations. Directional relation-
ships were calculated between three pairs of regions using their DSAM approximatio ns.
The amounts of Voronoi-polygonal areas from these approximatio ns were calculated in
each tile, and compared to the actual area measures. The error of results is calculated
using equation 1 and presented in table 4. Results showed that the average error of
directional relationships driven from DSAM approximatio ns was around 2%.

4.3.3. Proximity relationships

Proximity relationships represent qualitative and quantitative distances between
objects. An example of a quantitative query is, ‘(cid:142) nd all forests within 10 miles from
the river’. A qualitative query could include near or far relationships, ‘which castles
are near to the river?’.

As mentioned earlier, Voronoi diagrams can be used to answer nearest neighbours
and spatial adjacency queries. The Voronoi polygon for each point represents the
area closest to that point. Therefore, nearest neighbour queries can easily be answered
by identifying the polygon that the query place falls in. For example to (cid:142) nd the
nearest castle to a speci(cid:142) c location, all that is needed is to identify which castle-
Voronoi-polygo n the location falls in.

Distance calculations form an important part of spatial information systems
(Laurini and Thompson 1994 ). Euclidean distances between point-referenced objects
can easily be calculated from their co-ordinates. However, Euclidean distances
between area-referenced objects, or between point and area-referenced objects, are
more di(cid:141) cult to calculate. An area-referenced object, such as a region, has a boundary
as well as a centroid-point. Measuring Euclidean distances to the centre of the region
is not always desired. Consider the query, ‘How far is this place f rom the boundary
of region A?’, or ‘Show me all castles within 20 miles of region B’. To process such
queries accurately, it is important to measure the distance to the boundaries, rather
than to the regions’ centres. Euclidean distances between boundaries can be calcu-
lated from DSAM approximations . Shortest Euclidean distances between point and
area objects can be measured between the point’s co-ordinate s and the closest
polygonal boundary point of the DSAM approximation for the area object. In the
same way it is possible to measure the shortest Euclidean distance between two area
objects from the distance between their closest pair of polygonal boundary points.
The following section presents an experiment with Euclidean distance calculations

between point and area referenced places.

4.3.3.1. Experiment with Euclidean distance calculation. The shortest Euclidean
distances were measured from six randomly selected towns to the boundary of North
Lanarkshire. The distances were (cid:142) rst measured to the actual boundary of North
Lanarkshire, then compared to the distance values measured to the DSAM approxi-
mated boundary ((cid:142) gure 12). The measurement using the DSAM approximated

boundary was subject to the simpli(cid:142) cation of measuring distances from the given
points to the nearest node of the DSAM boundary.

Euclidean distance error is calculated using an equation of the same form as
equation (3). From the table below, it can be seen that Euclidean distances measured
to the DSAM approximated boundary are of good quality, with an average error of
around 4%. DSAM quality in measuring Euclidean distances is expected to increase
with the increase in distance. This is because the further the point location is from
the target region, the less is the eŒect of the boundary approximation error on the
Euclidean distance measure.

5. Evaluation

DSAM approximation quality depends on the amount and quality of data
available, in the form of places and co-ordinates. In general, DSAM approximation s
could produce three types of error:

1. Qualitative errors, when inferring topological relationships.
2. Measurement errors, when calculating area and boundary lengths.
3. Statistical errors, when ranking query results.

Qualitative errors might occur when inferring topological relationships from
DSAM approximations . Some topological relationships such as partOf and meets
were retrieved from the Bartholomew ’s data and stored explicitly in the OASIS
database. DSAM relies on partOf relationships in constructing Voronoi diagrams
for region approximation , and on meets relationships to decide whether two regions
are connected or disjoint.

If little data is available, or it is of low quality, then inconsistencies may arise
between the spatial relationships inferred from DSAM, and those existing between
the original regions. Figure 13 gives an example of such incompatibility, where the
DSAM approximation s for Midlothian and West Lothian share a boundary, while
the actual regions are disjoint. This is due to the lack of points in our dataset in the
parts of the City of Edinburgh and the Scottish Borders that separate Midlothian
from West Lothian. The result of this error falls in two parts. First, the approxi-
mations of two very close, but separate regions (West Lothian and Midlothian)
became connected and shared a boundary. Secondly, the approximation s of two
slightly connected regions (Scottish Borders and the City of Edinburgh) became
separate. The (cid:142) rst part of the problem may be solved by making use of the meets
relationship to decide whether two regions are connected or not, rather than trying
to infer this information from their approximations , which will be a more error-
prone and computationall y intensive process. The second part of the problem is
rather more di(cid:141) cult to solve, due to the loss of information involved. A zero length
of shared boundary between two regions linked with a meets relationship is a sign
of inconsistency, which an integrity checking procedure could detect and request a
manual intervention to insert notional points for purposes of DSAM processing.

Calculating area and boundary lengths from DSAM region approximation s is
subject to measurement errors. Such calculations are aŒected by the amount of false
area involved in the approximations .

Ranking can introduce statistical error, where the ranks of query results may
diŒer slightly from the ranks of the original values. For example in the experiment
results presented in table 3, although the approximation quality was good, the
ranking was not totally accurate. Consider the (cid:142) rst two records. The actual shared
boundary length in the (cid:142) rst record is longer than in the second record. However,
the approximated shared boundary in the second record turned out to be longer
than the (cid:142) rst one. This occurs where the actual boundary lengths to be approximated
are similar. For example, in the (cid:142) rst two records, the diŒerence between the actual

H. Alani et al.

shared boundary lengths was less than 15%. In such cases, a slight negative or
positive change in their approximated lengths could change the ranking. However,
an overall comparison between the ranks of the approximated and original values
in table 3 yields a Spearman coe(cid:141) cient of 0.822 (where 1.0 means an exact match
between the two ranks). This indicates that ranking is of good quality overall.
Ranking quality should improve even more when dealing with larger sets of results.
At present, DSAM is suitable for approximating inland regions, surrounded by
other regions. This is because the approximation is built from the Voronoi diagrams
of the co-ordinate s of the places within these regions. Therefore, if the region to be
approximated is connected to a sea on the one side, for example, then the obvious
lack of place co-ordinate s in the sea region results in a high degree of inaccuracy in
the boundary approximation of that particular side. Incomplete Voronoi polygons
and dangling segments normally occur when co-ordinate s are available from one
or more sides of a region to be approximate. Such cases can be (cid:143) agged by most
Voronoi programs.

6. Conclusions and future work

Gazetteers use sparse spatial databases in which geographical place names are
associated with a spatial footprint. Usually the footprint is con(cid:142) ned to a centroid or
minimum bounding rectangle and does not include boundary data. As a consequence
gazetteers have conventionally been of limited use in answering queries on spatial
relationships and boundaries. DSAM provides an eŒective way to approximate the
extent of spatial regions and derive their spatial relationships using sets of co-
ordinates in association with place name hierarchies and region adjacency data.
Traditional spatial information systems often face di(cid:141) culties in storing and repres-
enting historical and imprecise boundaries. DSAM is capable of approximating
boundaries of precise and imprecise regions with respect to time.

The DSAM method uses a set of functions based on Voronoi diagrams to estimate
spatial relationships between named places represented by their centroid co-ordinates.
Tests presented in this paper showed that the DSAM method gives good results for
measures of area, shared boundary lengths between regions that are known to meet,
area of overlap between overlapping regions, Euclidean distances and directional
relationships. In doing so they provide good approximation s of current, historical,
and imprecise boundaries, and help in answering nearest neighbour queries.

As regards limitations, the DSAM method presented cannot be used reliably for
determining topological relationships, due to its sensitivity to the con(cid:142) guration of
the source points. While the method is intended to be used in combination with
supplied topological relationships, problems can occur when attempting to make
measurements of associated boundaries. However there is clearly scope for extending
the method to ensure consistency between DSAM-determined relationships and the
supplied topological relationships. This could be done by inserting appropriatel y
located dummy points. There is also the problem of unbounded DSAM regions due
to the presence of real-world regions that are not represented by centroid data, a
prime example being the sea. Possible solutions include the insertion of dummy
points in the unrepresented region, or boundary approximation based on the convex
hull of the centroids of the represented region. It is important to note that the
accuracy of a DSAM region approximation depends upon the density and distribu-
tion of the centroid data. Future work will investigate the multiresolution nature of
DSAM and its relationship to depth of descent within place name hierarchies.

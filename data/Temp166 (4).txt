ABSTRACT
Urban growth boundaries (UGBs) have been applied in many rapid
urbanizing areas to alleviate the problems of urban sprawl.
Although empirical research has stressed the importance of eco-
logical protection in UGB delineation, existing UGB models lack a
component for the assessment of ecologically sensitive areas. To
address this problem, we develop an innovative method that is
capable of simulating UGB alternatives with economic and ecolo-
gical constraints. Our method employs a patch-based cellular
automaton (i.e. SA-Patch-CA) for simulating future urban growth,
constrained by the ecological protection areas produced by an
agent-based land allocation optimization model (AgentLA). The
delineation of UGBs is also based on the estimated future urban
land demand derived from support vector regression (SVR). The
proposed method is applied in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China.
Three scenarios are designed to represent diﬀerent objectives of
future industrial transitions. The results indicate that increasing the
shares of low energy consumption industries and tertiary indus-
tries can eﬀectively reduce urban land demand. By overlapping
the simulations, we found that the areal agreement of the simu-
lated UGBs among the three scenarios accounts for approximately
88% of the total area. These areas can then be considered as the
primary locations for establishing the UGBs.

1. Introduction

Urban growth boundaries (UGBs) are zoning controls used to constrain future urban
developments within a ﬁxed area (Carter 2009). The implementation of UGBs is used to
establish a physical boundary beyond which urban developments are not permitted. In a
broad sense, the technical implementation of UGBs includes zoning and land develop-
ment permits (Long et al. 2013). UGBs are advocated in many rapid urbanizing areas
because they can promote development density, protect agricultural land, and reduce
infrastructure costs (Tayyebi et al. 2011).

UGBs were ﬁrst applied in the rapidly growing cities of the United States, such as
Lexington and Portland, in the 1960s (Nelson and Duncan 1995). There are also successful
applications of UGBs in other countries worldwide. For instance, UGBs have been applied
in Canada to constrain urban growth (Ali 2008). Cities in Australia, Korea, and Saudi Arabia
have also promoted the establishments of UGBs (Mubarak 2004; Bengston and Youn 2006;
Coiacetto 2007). In China, UGBs are gaining increasing attention, and their potential to
alleviate the problems of urban sprawl in the Chinese cities has been widely discussed in
literature (Henderson et al. 2003; Long et al. 2007, 2013; Han et al. 2009). Moreover, the
establishment of UGBs is further adapted in the Chinese context by enhancing the role of
ecological protection. Yu et al. (2011) argued that the conventional planning approach
fails to avoid the problems of ecological degradation accompanied with rapid urbaniza-
tion, and therefore they stressed the importance of prioritizing ecological protection
zoning while planning the future growth (Kong et al. 2017).

The spatial delineation of UGBs requires a comprehensive understanding of urban
systems. However, conventional methods for UGB delineation are mainly based on the
personal experiences of urban planners. This deﬁciency often results in the inconsistency
or contradiction between the planned UGBs and actual urban growth (Long et al. 2013).
Therefore, recent eﬀorts have been devoted to the development of generative models
for the spatial delineation of UGBs. Generally, at least three types of models can be used
to produce UGB alternatives. (1) Models that directly generate the geometry of UGBs.
For instance, Tayyebi et al. (2011) developed a model based on artiﬁcial neural networks
to predict the radial extent of UGBs at speciﬁed azimuths, while Ma et al. (2017)
employed the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm for UGB optimization with a
connectivity constraint. (2) Models that assess the development suitability/potential. For
example, Zheng and Lv (2016) delineated the UGBs by aggregating the land units with
the highest development suitability, which was evaluated using a weight of evidence
(WOE) method. A similar application can be found in He et al. (2018). (3) Models that
anticipate the future urban developments. Long et al. (2013) simulated the UGBs of
Beijing based on the predictions of urban expansion by using a constrained cellular
automaton (CA) model. Zhou et al. (2016) applied the CLUE model to predict the future
land change in Changshu City and delineated the UGBs accordingly.

In this article, in response to the call for prioritizing ecological protection zoning in the
establishment of UGBs, we present an innovative method that is capable of simulating UGB
alternatives with economic and ecological constraints. This method consists of three major
components, i.e. an urban land demand estimation model, an urban CA model, and an
optimization model for zoning ecological protection areas. The urban CA model is the core
component of the proposed method, which can assist UGB delineation by predicting the
future urban land expansion. Although important progress has been made in this area
(García et al. 2012; Rienow and Goetzke 2015; Guan et al. 2016; Feng 2017; Feng et al. 2017;
Mustafa et al. 2018a), there are still problems impairing the performance of existing urban
CA models. For instance, the conventional cell-based representation and simulation stra-
tegies are considered inadequate for applications with ﬁne resolution spatial data (Wang
and Marceau 2013; Abolhasani et al. 2016; Pinto et al. 2017; Alaei Moghadam et al. 2018). To
avoid the bias caused by the cell-based representation, therefore, we adopted a patch-
based strategy (Chen et al. 2014) for the simulation of urban growth. Moreover, conven-
tional methods of model calibration usually involve only two datasets at the respective

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

time points of Tstart and Tend (Liu et al. 2015; Mustafa et al. 2017, 2018b) and hence fail to
capture the changing eﬀects of driving factors over time. We addressed this issue by using
the approach of survival analysis (SA) (An and Brown 2008; Chen et al. 2016) to calibrate the
patch-based CA model with multitemporal urban land data. In the following sections, we
refer this model as the SA-Patch-CA model.

To fulﬁl the idea of prioritizing ecological protection zoning, we employ a spatial
optimization model of land allocation to assist the spatial delineation of UGBs. Although
one of the objectives of UGBs is to preserve green spaces, many existing UGB models
lack a component that provides spatially explicit assessment of ecologically sensitive
areas. The zoning of ecological protection areas is a land allocation optimization pro-
blem. Solving this kind of problem is complicated mainly because they usually involve
contradicting objectives and a massive number of possible combinations. In previous
studies, land allocation optimization models were primarily developed based on heur-
istic algorithms (Santé-Riveira et al. 2008; Shao et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2016; Schwaab et al.
2018) or agent-based modeling techniques (Ligmann-Zielinska et al. 2008; Zhang et al.
2016; Ghavami et al. 2017). In this study, we applied an agent-based land allocation
optimization model (AgentLA), which is developed in our previous research (Chen et al.
2010), to address the problem of ecological zoning due to eﬀectiveness and computa-
tion eﬃciency of AgentLA compared with conventional methods. The AgentLA model is
used to generate the layout of ecological protection areas and they are further incorpo-
rated as a spatial constraint in SA-Patch-CA for simulating future urban growth.

Furthermore, as estimation of urban land demand is an essential task in UGB delinea-
tion, we develop a model based on support vector regression (SVR) (Smola and Schölkopf
2004) to estimate the future urban land demand. Statistical methods, such as linear
regression analysis, have been frequently used for estimating urban land demand.
However, these methods usually require rigorous assumptions about the data distributions,
and have diﬃculty handling the nonlinear interactions in the data. In this study, we adopt
the SVR algorithm because it is more ﬂexible for data distributions. Moreover, the predic-
tions made by SVR are also more accurate due to the implementation of the so-called
structural risk minimization (SRM) strategy (Smola and Schölkopf 2004). As urban develop-
ments are largely related to the economic conditions, it is worth exploring the inﬂuences of
changing industrial structures on urban growth and associated delineation of UGBs. This
can be conveniently implemented by adjusting the parameters of SVR.

The proposed method is tested in the core region of Pearl River Delta, China. The SA-
Patch-CA is calibrated using multiple sets of urban land data. The AgentLA model is used
to generate the layout of ecological protection areas, which are used to constrain future
urban growth. Future urban land demand is estimated under several scenarios that
represent diﬀerent industrial structures. Then the spatial distributions of future urban
developments are predicted with the ecological constraint for each scenario. Finally, the
UGBs are delineated according the predicted urban growth.

2. Study area and data

Pearl River Delta (PRD) is the low-lying area surrounding the Pearl River estuary in South
China. This region has an annual average temperature of 22ºC and annual precipitation
In 2016, this region accounted for 4.3% of total population of
of over 1700 mm.

mainland China, while contributing 9.1% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).
The PRD has now become one of the highly urbanized areas in China (Shi et al. 2014; Yu
et al. 2014) and a globally important manufacturing base. Recently, the PRD has
surpassed Tokyo and become the world’s largest urban area by both area and popula-
tion (Deuskar et al. 2015). The core region of the PRD is selected as our case study area,
namely the cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, Dongguan, and Zhongshan
(Figure 1). Rapid urbanization and economic developments in this area has already
aﬀected the living environments and caused unprecedented disturbances to the regio-
nal ecosystems. To alleviate these problems, part of the PRD has set up the so-called
Eco-designated Line of Control (ELC) to encompass the ecological protection areas.
These protection areas are regarded as a strict spatial constraint for urban constructions
and no developments are allowed within these areas.

The urban land data were derived through the classiﬁcations of Landsat images in the
years of 1990, 1995, 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2012. To cover the whole study area, it
requires four scenes of images in a single year. The speciﬁc path/row numbers and
image acquisition dates are summarized in Table 1. Object-based segmentation and
classiﬁcation methods were used to extract the urban land from the acquired Landsat
images. Afterward manual corrections were conducted with the aid of concurrent

Google Earth images. The evaluation of classiﬁcation accuracies was carried out by an
independent working group of quality reviewers, who did not participate in the classi-
ﬁcation procedures, to conduct ﬁeld survey in each city of the study area and validate
the classiﬁcations. These reviewers reported the overall accuracies of 91.03% (1990),
92.68% (1995), 91.36% (2000), 92.10% (2003), 94.81% (2006), 95.77% (2009), and 97.29%
(2012) for the urban land classiﬁcations.

In addition, the spatial variables of distance to city center, distance to town center,
distance to railway station, distance to shipping port, distance to airport, distance to
highway, distance to major road, and slope were prepared according to previous
research of urban simulations (Liu et al. 2017; Li et al. 2017a; Du et al. 2018; Mustafa
et al. 2018a) and also the data availability in our case study. More speciﬁcally, the
distance variables of highway and major road are obtained based on the transportation
network data for the corresponding years of 1995, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012.
These data are produced by manual interpretation of Landsat images with reference
transportation data for the year 2012, collected from the local planning agencies in each
city of the study area. In this manner, the transportation network data for the years
before 2012 can be adjusted by subtracting the ‘nonexistent’ highways/roads through
visual comparison between the Landsat images (before 2012) and the reference 2012
transportation network data. Figure 2 shows these variables for the year 2006 as a
representative example. The distance variables of important centers/locations, however,
are held constant over time because these centers/locations show no changes in the
study period. The original important centers/locations data in the vector format were
also provided by loc al planning agencies. All of these spatial variables had a spatial
resolution of 30 m and their values were rescaled to the interval [0, 1].

Another set of spatial data was used for the generation of ecological protection areas
as the constraint of future urban growth. These data, which were collected from local
planning agencies, include habitat diversity, vegetation coverage, slope, and proximity
to water source (Figure 3). They were rescaled into the interval [0, 1] and combined with
equal weights to represent the variable of ecological suitability.

To estimate future land demand, the socioeconomic data of the ﬁve selected cities
were also collected from the prefectural statistical yearbooks for
the period of
2000–2012. These data include population, the gross domestic products (GDP) for the
39 industrial sectors and the tertiary sector, respectively. Moreover, the 39 industrial
sectors were organized into three groups, namely the intensive energy consumption
sector, medium energy consumption sector, and low energy consumption sector,
according to their energy consumption intensities. Table 2 lists the industrial structure
for each city in 2009.

and AgentLA models. First, empirical urban land data and a set of socioeconomic
variables were used to establish an SVR-based urban land demand model, which was
further applied to urban land demand estimation in the scenario simulations. Second,
empirical urban land data and the selected spatial driving factors were used to calibrate

run to generate the spatial distributions of ecological protection areas. Fourth, urban
growth scenarios were simulated using the calibrated SA-Patch-CA with the constraints
of urban land demand and ecological protection areas obtained in the ﬁrst and third
steps. Finally, the UGB alternatives were determined mainly through the vectorizations
of the scenario simulations of urban growth.

3.1. Land demand projection using SVR algorithm

In SVR, the optimization objective is to best ﬁt the training data using the function f(x) =
< w, x > + b, where w is a vector of weights and b is the threshold. Suppose that the f(x)
function can be estimated with errors less than ε, then the optimization objective can be
expressed as:

the tradeoﬀ between the ﬂatness of f(x) and the errors. The minimization of Equation (1)

There several forms of kernel functions, in which polynomial function (PF) and radial

Mustafa et al. 2018b). Therefore, these two function forms are used in our case study to
train the SVR-based land demand projection model.

3.2. SA-Patch-CA for simulating urban growth

The SA-Patch-CA model
integrates two methods to simulate urban growth: the SA
method to derive the temporal adapted parameters and a patch-based strategy to
allocate the simulated new developed land. Originally, SA is a method for studying
the mortality of individuals. In the context of urban growth, the irreversible rural-urban
conversion for a certain land unit (i.e. a cell) is indeed analogous to an individual’s death
event. Given that a cell is nonurban at time t, the so-called hazard function h(t) in SA can
be used to describe the risks of its death (i.e. being converted into urban) in a small
subsequent period after time t:

(cid:6)

h tð Þ ¼ lim
Δt!0

ð

Pr t (cid:4) T< t þ ΔtjT (cid:5) t
Δt

Þ

(cid:7)
;

where T is the event time. In conventional applications of SA, the time variable t is
treated as continuous because the event time can be precisely recorded. For urban
growth analysis, however, it is almost impossible to identify the precise time of land
changes for each cell. Therefore, the entire time frame is discretized into several periods,
while h(t) is then considered as the average risks that a cell would be subject to over
time (An and Brown 2008). The calculation of h(t) is usually based on the Cox regression
model:

(cid:1)
h tð Þ ¼ λ0exp β

1x1 þ β0

1x1 tð Þ þ . . . þ β

kxk þ β0

kxk tð Þ

(cid:3)

Or:

logh tð Þ ¼ α tð Þ þ β

1x1 þ β0

1x1 tð Þ þ . . . þ β

kxk þ β0

kxk tð Þ;

where λ0 is the baseline hazard and α(t) = logλ0; λ0 can take any nonnegative form or be
left unspeciﬁed (An and Brown 2008). The variable xk is the kth driving factor of urban
growth, and xk(t) is the time-dependent eﬀect of xk (where xk(t) = xk × t) on the condition
that the Schoenfeld residuals of xk signiﬁcantly correlate with t (Allison 2012). The

(4)

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

estimation of the coeﬃcients for xk and xk(t) can be carried out using the partial
likelihood method and a set of interval and right censored observations. Given a period
of [t0, tn], the interval censored observations are cells being nonurban at t0 while
converted into urban during before tn, and the right censored observations are cells
remaining as nonurban during the whole period. In addition to the estimated h(t), the
probability of urban development for a certain cell p(t) is also aﬀected by its neighbour-
hood condition Ω(t), which can be represented using the following equation:

p tð Þ ¼ h tð Þ Ω tð Þ Con s ¼ suitable

ð

Þ;

P

Ω tð Þ ¼

ð
n2Con s ¼ developed
n2 (cid:3) 1

Þ

:

(9)

(10)

Where Con() is a conditional function that returns 1 if the condition is met, otherwise
returns 0; n is the bandwidth of a Moore neighbourhood, and n = 3 in our case study.
We deﬁned the neighbourhood as 3 × 3 because this conﬁguration is prevalent and also
eﬀective according to previous experimental results in our case study area using the
data of the same resolution (Chen et al. 2014; Du et al. 2015; Li et al. 2017b).

Based on the calculated h(t) and p(t), urban growth is simulated using a patch-based
simulation strategy. This strategy simulates one new urban patch at a time, and hence
by iteratively running this strategy the entire simulation procedure can be accomplished.
The simulation of a new urban patch starts by estimating its size (i.e. cell count) Ai, which
can be obtained using the following equation:

Ai ¼ a0 rað Þa1 :

(11)

Where ra is a random value between 0 and 1; a0 and a1 are parameters that can be
obtained by ﬁtting the observed cumulative area distributions of new urban patches
during a certain simulation period (Chen et al. 2014). After the patch size is set, the
growth type of this new patch is determined through the comparison between a
random pointer rtype and a predeﬁned threshold Tspon. If rtype ≤ Tspon, this new patch
is categorized as spontaneous growth; otherwise it is set as organic growth.

The spatial allocation of this new urban patch is carried out in two steps. First, the
seed of this new urban patch is allocated in the space. This procedure is diﬀerent
between spontaneous growth and organic growth. For a new urban patch that is
categorized as spontaneous growth, a nonurban cell is randomly picked and set as
the seed if its h(t) value is larger than a random value within [0, 1]; otherwise another
nonurban cell is selected and compared again. For organic growth, however, the seed
allocation procedure is almost similar except that the p(t) value of the selected nonurban
cell is used for comparison instead of the h(t) value. Second, after the seed allocation
procedure, the patch growth is simulated using a 3 × 3 moving window that centers on
the seed at the beginning. The roulette wheel selection approach is used to determine
the next developed cell using the p(t) values of the nonurban cells within the window.
Once the new developed cell is set, the window moves and centers on this cell. Then the
same growth simulation procedure continues until the estimated patch size Ai is reached
or the nonurban cells within the moving window are depleted.

3.3. Agentla for generating ecological constraints

The AgentLA model is used to generate the ecological protection areas as a spatial
constraint for urban growth simulations, i.e. no developments allowed in the ecological
protection areas. This model optimizes the spatial pattern of ecological protection areas
with the objectives of maximizing the total ecological suitability and compactness. To
implement the AgentLA model, the quantity of land (i.e. cell count) for ecological
protection should be speciﬁed ﬁrst. Then the model initiates with randomly distributed
individual agents (i.e. movable cells) in the space. The population size of agents is equal
to the given land quantity for ecological protection. Afterward each agent iteratively
makes decisions on relocation according to the ﬁtness function:

fij ¼ wvvij þ wccij;

(cid:9)

Ωxmnexp (cid:3) dmn
γ
(cid:9) ;
(cid:8)
P
Ωexp (cid:3) dmn

cij ¼

Where fij is the ﬁtness at cell (i, j); vij is the ecological suitability value at cell (i, j); cij is the
neighbourhood condition; wv and wc are weights of vij and cij, respectively; Ω is the
Moore neighbourhood of cell (i, j); xmn equals 1 if cell (i, j) is already occupied by an
j) and (m, n); γ is a
agent, otherwise it is 0; dmn is the distance between cells (i,
compensation parameter that ranges from 1 to 10.

Each agent ﬁrst evaluates the ﬁtness of the current position, i.e. fij. Then the agent
searches the vacant position with the highest ﬁtness in the neighbouring positions
adjacent to (i, j), which can be denoted as fL. Also, the agent randomly selects from
the entire cell space a vacant position that should have at least one agent in its 3 × 3
neighbourhood. The ﬁtness of this position is denoted as fG. By comparing the values of
fij, fL, and fG, the agent stays or moves to one of these positions that has the highest
ﬁtness.
In each iteration, the spatial pattern formed by all of the agents’ decision
makings is assessed using the F function:

3.4. UGB delineation

The UGBs of the study area are delineated based on the projected future urban
growth of SA-Patch-CA constrained by the ecological protection areas. The simula-
tions of future growth are ﬁrst transformed into vector polygons, including the urban
patches and the gaps within them, and polygons with low compactness and too
small size (e.g. less than four cells) are eliminated because they are not feasible to
establish the UGBs. Finally, these vector polygons are merged, and their outlines are
extracted to represent the UGBs. As indicated by previous studies, the UGBs in many
Chinese cities may comprise multiple parts, which are diﬀerent from those in the
United States (Zhou et al. 2016).

4. Implementations and results

4.1. Training results of SVR

The training of the SVR algorithm was implemented in the machine learning platform of
Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) (Srivastava 2014). The training
results (Table 3) indicate that SVR with the kernel function type of PF performs better
than SVR with RBF in terms of the training (22.11% vs. 47.02%) and prediction errors
(31.52% vs. 48.15%). Moreover, the SVR algorithm (with PF) has much lower training and
prediction errors than the linear regression method. It also outperforms backpropaga-
tion neural network models, which are frequently used for numeric prediction problems.
Therefore, the trained SVR-based urban land demand model can be used in the sub-
sequent simulations of future urban growth.

4.2. Urban growth simulation and validation

The SA-Patch-CA model was ﬁrst tested through the simulations of historical urban
growth in the study area from 1990 to 2012. More speciﬁcally, the data for the time
intervals of 1990–1995, 1995–2000, and 2000–2006 were used for model calibration,
while three sets of data (not applied in the calibration procedure) for the years 2003,
2009, and 2012 were used for assessing the prediction accuracy. The estimated coeﬃ-
cients of Equation (8) and the calibrated Tspon values for each city are shown in Table 4.
As mentioned in the previous section, whether to include an xk(t) term depends on
the correlations between the Schoenfeld residuals of xk and the variable t.
If no
correlations are observed, then the term xk(t) cannot be included in the model. For
instance, the terms xcitycenter(t), xtowncenter(t), and xrailstat(t) were not included in the

model for Dongguan because there are no correlations between the Schoenfeld
residuals of xcitycenter, xtowncenter, and xrailstat and the variable t.
It is also possible
that the included xk(t) terms are not signiﬁcant (e.g. xrailstat(t) and xexpressway(t) for
Guangzhou), suggesting that the corresponding xk does not have time-dependent
eﬀects to urban developments. To diagnose the regression results, we carried out an
analysis based on the relative operating characteristic (ROC). This analysis yields the
results for the indicator of area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.633 to 0.876
(Table 5), indicating that the regression models are better than a random classiﬁer
and the regression results are meaningful. By using these xk(t) terms, parameters for
future scenario simulations can then be autoadjusted according to the corresponding
time intervals. In addition, the parameters a0 and a1 were estimated for each city by
ﬁtting the empirical area distributions of new urban patches in diﬀerent periods, as
shown in Table 6. Note that the estimated a0 and a1 for the time interval of
2006–2012 were only used in the future scenario simulations and were not applied
in the historical urban growth simulations.

The simulations of historical urban growth based on the calibrated SA-Patch-CA are
shown in Figures 5 and 6. The quantities of simulated new urban land were set equal to the
observed amounts of actual urban land expansion according to the empirical land use
data. As we introduced a random term in SA-Patch-CA (Equation (11)), several runs are
required to investigate the behaviour of the model in the dynamic environment of various
values of the randomness (Mustafa et al. 2018c). We, therefore, ran the model 100 times.
The historical simulations were validated at the cell and landscape levels using the
indicator of ‘Figure of Merit’ (FoM) (Pontius et al. 2008) and a set of landscape metrics as
well. The FoM indicator measures the modeling accuracy of simulated changes, and hence
is more feasible for validation than other conventional metrics, such as overall accuracy and
Kappa, which include nonchange areas into validation and overestimate the simulation
accuracy. The calculation of FoM is based on the following equation:

Where A is the error due to observed but not simulated change; B is the agreement due
to observed and simulated change; C is the error due to observed but incorrectly
simulated change; D is the error due to observed nonchange but simulated change. C
should be zero in our simulations because the SA-Patch-CA model only simulates the
conversion from nonurban to urban.

The landscape metrics selected for validation include the number of patches (NP),
largest patch index (LPI), mean Euclidean distance of nearest neighbours (ENN), and
perimeter-area ratio (PARA). The selection of these metrics is according to the sugges-
tions from previous studies (Pickard et al. 2017; Xu and Brown 2017; Li et al. 2017b).
Based on these metrics, a pattern similarity indicator al can be calculated using the

Where Δli is the relative diﬀerence between the ith simulated (li;s) and observed (li;o)
landscape metric. It should be noted that the unit of LPI is already %, therefore Δli is
calculated as the absolute diﬀerence between the simulated and observed LPI.

The distributions of errors and successes for the historical urban growth simula-
tions were obtained by comparing the simulations to the actual urban growth.
Figure 7 shows the averaging results of errors and successes for the 100 runs for
each period. Based the distributions of errors and successes, the FoM indicator can
be calculated. Table 7 shows the average FoM values and their standard deviations

simulations in Dongguan, Foshan, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen attain high pattern
similarity values, which are approximately 80–90%. However,
for
Zhongshan are relatively lower (60–80%), mainly caused by the errors in the simu-
lated NP and ENN values (Figure 8). This suggests that the simulated urban growth
patterns are more fragmented and dispersed than those observed in the actual
urban land data. Nevertheless, the SA-Patch-CA model achieves an overall pattern
similarity value of approximately 80% for the entire study area, indicating a satisfac-
tory performance for subsequent scenario simulations.

In this study, future urban growth is constrained by the ecological protection areas
obtained from the AgentLA model. The quantity of land for zoning ecological protection
areas is set as 40% of the total terrestrial area of the entire region (water surfaces are
excluded). The performance of the AgentLA is sensitive to the settings of wv. To explore
the eﬀects of wv, multiple experiments were run before the formal zoning procedure to
identify the proper value for wv. As shown in Figure 9, the model attains the highest F
values with the wv value of 0.7–0.8. Therefore, the wv value is set as 0.75 for the AgentLA

model. Scenario 2 (S2) assumes that the study area changing the industrial structure by
increase the share of the low energy consumption industries. S2 animates the recent
policies of ‘energy conservation and emission reduction’ in China’s industrial produc-
tions. This is achieved by setting a goal of 30% GDP increase, relative to that obtained in
S1, for the low energy consumption industries while maintaining the same amount of
total GDP projected in S1. These calculations are not applied for Shenzhen because its
current GDP in low energy consumption sector has already exceeded 70%. Scenario 3
(S3) assumes that the study area changing the industrial structure by increase the GDP
share in the tertiary sector. S3 animates the transition toward a new industrial structure
dominated by the service industries. A goal of 30% GDP growth for the tertiary sector
relative to that obtained in S1 is set for each city (except for Guangzhou, whose current
GDP share in the tertiary sector is over 60%), maintaining the same amount of total GDP
projected in S1. The urban land demand in diﬀerent scenarios was estimated based on
the trained SVR model and the assumptions described above. The results (Table 9) show
that, compared to the urban land demand in S1, approximately 6% of land can be saved
from urban encroachments if the goal in S2 is achieved. This suggests that the promo-
tion of low energy consumption industries can favour the reduction of both energy and
land consumption. The results in S3 also yield less land demand (2.8%) than those in S1.
Based on the estimated urban land demand, new urban developments were
allocated using the calibrated SA-Patch-CA constrained by the ecological protection
areas (Figure 10). The results of the simulated urban growth were then transformed
and dissolved to generate the UGBs for each city (Figure 11). The simulated UGBs

extents, the landscape metrics were normalized by dividing the landscape metric
values by the corresponding UGB areas in each scenario so that their results are
comparable. The normalized landscape metrics indicate that S2 yields the largest
patch density (normalized NP = 237.26) and shape complexity (normalized PARA =
4.78). The simulated UGB in S3 has the largest normalized LPI (6.68) and the smallest
normalized ENN values (14.22), suggesting relatively tighter connections between the
urban patches in the simulated UGB. Although the urban land demand is the largest
in S1, the simulated UGB in S1 has low patch density, weak dominance of the largest
urban patch, low shape complexity and large spatial separations between the urban
patches, as indicated by the normalized NP (223.64), LPI (5.76), PARA (4.13), and ENN
(15.84).

By overlapping the scenario simulations, we found that the areal agreement in the UGB
delineation among the three scenarios (i.e. overlap count = three) is 5579.15 km2, or
approximately 88% of the total area involved in the scenario simulations (Figure 11 and
Table 11). Therefore, these areas should be included into the UGBs because they are the
primary locations for future urban expansion according to the predictions of our simulation
method. For the areas with overlap counts of one and two, we referred them as Type I and
Type II disagreements. These disagreements are mainly caused by the diﬀerent constraints
applied and the model uncertainty as well. Type I disagreements represent areas simulated
as UGBs in only one scenario while predicted as nonurban in the other two scenarios.
Similarly, Type II disagreements are areas simulated as UGBs in any two of the three scenarios
while predicted as nonurban in the other scenario. Type I and Type II disagreements account
for 6.10% and 6.40%, respectively, of the total areas involved in the simulations. Most of
these disagreements are in Foshan, Guangzhou, and Zhongshan, while less disagreements
are found in Shenzhen, mainly due to its shortage of vacant land for future developments.
In realistic planning, however, a proper solution of these disagreements is important
to eﬀectively establish the UGBs. As land is often associated with immediate economic

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE

beneﬁts and the basis for future developments, the reconciliation of these disagree-
ments requires more advanced scientiﬁc methods and techniques to support the
negotiation between diﬀerent stake-holders. Recently gaming theory, which can be
used to animate and model the conﬂicts between diﬀerent actors, has been applied in
land use research (Lin and Li 2016). Although we do not address the disagreements of
UGB alternatives in this study,
it is feasible to solve this problem in the future by
incorporating a framework based on gaming theory.

Overall, the proposed method oﬀers a ﬂexible framework that allows for exploring
planning scenarios of UGBs. Compared with existing methods for UGB delineation, the
proposed method uses a state-of-the-art patch-based CA model with enhanced tem-
poral adaptation for urban growth simulation. Our method also employs a spatial
optimization model that explicitly concerns the protection of ecologically sensitive
areas. Considering that the PRD has not yet designated the oﬃcial UGBs either at the
city level or the regional
level, our method can, therefore, assist urban planners to
evaluate the potential outcomes of diﬀerent development policies and enhance the
design of the layouts for UGBs. The limitation of the proposed method, however, is that
the attributes of activities and mobility are still
lacking (Chen et al. 2017a, 2017b).
Empirical research has demonstrated that inconsistency exists between the travel
ﬂows and the planned UGBs (Long et al. 2015). The incorporation of human activity
and mobility requires more data at ﬁner spatial-temporal resolution, such as ﬂoating car
data and social media data. This has pointed the direction for our future research on
UGB delineation.

5. Conclusion

In this study, we responded to the idea of prioritizing ecological protection in UGB
delineation and proposed a new method for the generation of UGB alternatives. This
method was developed by integrating an SVR-based urban land demand estimation
model, a land allocation optimization model (AgentLA) and an urban land expansion
simulation model (SA-Patch-CA). This method was tested through the case study in
the PRD, China, to simulate the UGB alternatives with economic and ecological
constraints.

First, the SVR algorithm was trained to estimate urban land demand using a set of
socioeconomic variables. It was found that the trained SVR with polynomial function has
lower prediction errors than the conventional methods of BP-NN and linear regression.
By adjusting the parameters according to the scenario assumptions, the trained SVR-
based urban land demand estimation model can yield the corresponding results of
future urban land for diﬀerent scenarios.

Second, to fulﬁl the idea of prioritizing ecological protection, the AgentLA model was
implemented to optimize the zoning of ecological protection areas. By running multiple
experiments, the adequate parameter combination was determined and subsequently
applied for optimizing the zoning of ecological protection areas. These results were used
as a spatial constraint to restrict the simulated future urban growth, which was carried
out based on the SA-Patch-CA model.

Third, the SA-Patch-CA model was calibrated using survival analysis, an approach
allowing the use of multitemporal urban land data to capture the spatiotemporal

signatures of urban land change. The calibrated SA-Patch-CA model was tested through
the historical simulations of urban growth in PRD. The results suggest that the SA-Patch-
CA has a reliable performance, and hence can be used to predict the future distributions
of urban developments.

Finally, three scenarios were designed to represent diﬀerent economic development
tendencies in the future. The corresponding UGBs for each scenario was simulated using
the SA-Patch-CA model, constrained by the estimated urban land demand and the
optimized zoning of ecological protection areas. The results indicate that increasing
the GDP shares of low energy consumption industries and tertiary industries can
eﬀectively reduce the amounts of urban land demand. The simulated UGB alternatives
were quantiﬁed and compared using landscape metrics. By overlapping the simulations,
we found that the areal agreement in the UGBs delineation among three scenarios
accounts for approximately 88% of the total area involved in the scenario simulations.
Therefore, these areas are the primary locations for establishing the UGB. The disagree-
ments of the scenario simulations, however, require additional modeling techniques to
make proper reconciliation and this points to a direction for our future research.

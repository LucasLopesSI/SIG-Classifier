Abstract
Forests  play  a  critical  role  in  sustaining  the  human  environment.  Most  forest  fires
not only destroy the natural environment and ecological balance, but also seriously
threaten the security of life and property. The early discovery and forecasting of forest
fires are both urgent and necessary for forest fire control. This article explores the
possible  applications  of  Spatio-temporal  Data  Mining  for  forest  fire  prevention.
The research pays special attention to the spatio-temporal forecasting of forest fire
areas  based  upon  historic  observations.  An  integrated  spatio-temporal  forecasting
framework  –  ISTFF  –  is  proposed:  it  uses  a  dynamic  recurrent  neural  network  for
spatial forecasting. The principle and algorithm of ISTFF are presented, and are then
illustrated  by  a  case  study  of  forest  fire  area  prediction  in  Canada.  Comparative
analysis  of  ISTFF  with  other  methods  shows  its  high  accuracy  in  short-term
prediction.  The  effect  of  spatial  correlations  on  the  prediction  accuracy  of  spatial
forecasting is also explored.

1 Introduction

Forests play an important role in sustaining the human environment. Most forest fires
not only destroy the natural environment and the ecological balance, but also seriously
threaten the security of life and property. It is not surprising to see increased expenditure
on  forest  fire  control.  Even  so,  millions  of  hectares  of  woodland  are  still  destroyed  by
fires  annually.  Controlling  fires  is  a  complex  task.  Indeed,  forest  fires  can  cover  an
 within nine days, and cost millions of dollars to extinguish
area as large as 600 km

(Martinus and Junk 1982). Most forest fires are extinguished quickly, but a few become
uncontrollable  by  human  intervention,  and  such  fires  cause  huge  damage  to  the
environment and endanger human lives. For example, in 1983, in the Province of Victoria
(Australia),  forest  fire  burned  392,000  ha  of  (grass)  land  and  killed  75  people  (Moore
and  Trevitt  1991).  In  India,  17,852  fires  were  reported  in  the  period  1985–1990,  and
they affected an area of 5.7 million hectares, which represents an annual average of 1.14
million hectares (Saigal 1989). In Portugal, in 2003, 420,000 ha were destroyed in forest
fires  that  caused  20  deaths  (Bianchinia  et  al.  2006).  In  2006,  Spain  suffered  one  of  its
most  destructive  forest  fires  in  a  decade,  with  almost  150,000  ha  burnt  (Amil  2007).
The  data  also  reveal  that  average  fire  occurrence  in  Canada  is  8,000  fires/year,  the
average area burned is 2.5 million hectares/year, and the average suppression costs have
been between $300 and $500 million annually since 1951 (CFS 2006).

To  effectively/efficiently  manage  and  control  forest  fire,  many  countries  are
developing forest fire databases or information systems. For example, in 2002, the State
Bureau of Forestry Administration of the People’s Republic of China invested RMB 2M
in building a forest fire prevention system (Zhang 2004). Canada has its fire database –
LFDB (Canada Large Fire Database) – which records large forest fires of an area exceed-
ing  200  ha  in  every  province,  region,  and  forest  park  in  Canada  (CFS  2006).  The
European Commission has built a European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), for
which 14 member states of the Union provide forest fire data each year (EFFIS 2006).
The  principal  aim  of  constructing  such  databases  is  to  record  forest  fires  and
relevant  weather  information  systematically,  to  enable  the  behaviour  of  forest  fires  to
be  understood  and  to  be  more  predictable.  At  present,  some  fire  models  have  been
developed, using weather, vegetation and topographic data to predict the forest fire risk
level.  For  example,  Brillinger  et  al.  (1986)  proposed  a  risk  model  to  estimate  the
probability  of  a  forest  fire  taking  place  at  a  particular  location  and  time  as  a  function
of these factors. This approach considers mainly the forest fire history of the area, and
experiments show that the output of the methodology is very useful, because it offers a
reliable measure of forest fire risk for a specific area. Jaiswal et al. (2002) implemented
a  GIS-based  forest  fire  risk  model,  which  applies  geographical  information  systems  to
analyze  and  combine  different  forest-fire-causing  factors,  such  as  vegetation,  climate,
topography, and other coverage (roads and settlements), in order to demarcate a forest
fire  risk  zone  map.  Four  categories  of  forest  fire  risk,  ranging  from  very  high  to  low,
were  derived  automatically.  The  evolved  GIS-based  forest  fire  risk  model  of  the  study
area  was  found  to  be  in  strong  agreement  with  actual  fire-affected  sites. Iliadis  (2005)
developed  a  decision  support  system  (FFIR-EDESSYS)  that  introduces  the  use  of  fuzzy
sets and fuzzy algebra concepts, for the estimation of the structural forest fire risk on a
global  scale.  The  system  has  been  applied  in  Greece,  and  results  show  that  the  system
successfully  estimates  the  forest  fire  risk  areas.  However,  a  common  characteristic  of
these  models  is  that  they  cannot  give  a  quantitative  prediction  of  the  forest  fire  area,
which is very important in assessing forest fire loss. On the other hand, the huge amount
of accumulated spatio-temporal data far exceeds the human ability to completely interpret
and use it effectively. As a result, the data repositories cannot be fully utilized for forest
fire prediction.

To  understand  and  make  full  use  of  these  data  repositories,  we  need  to  find  the
interesting  and  unexpected  patterns  (or  knowledge)  deeply  hidden  or  implicitly  stored
in  forest  fire  databases.  Spatio-temporal  data  mining  (STDM)  is  the  extraction  of
unknown and implicit knowledge (structures, spatio-temporal relationships, or patterns)

not  explicitly  stored  in  spatio-temporal  databases  (Miller  and  Han  2001,  Yao  2003,
Yuan  et  al.  2004).  State-of-the-art  spatio-temporal  data  mining  should  be  applied  to
enhance the intelligence of forest fire prevention systems, and to extend forest fire data
platforms  with  the  ability  to  predict  and  evaluate  forest  fire  risk.  This  article  explores
the possible applications of spatio-temporal data mining for forest fire prevention. The
research  pays  special  attention  to  the  spatio-temporal  forecasting  of  forest  fires  areas,
because  of  the  importance  of  prediction  for  fire  prevention.  This  is  also  necessary
because most existing spatio-temporal forecasting methods cannot handle the dynamic
change  of  forest  fires  over  space.  In  this  study,  we  forecast  the  annual  average  area  of
forest fire based upon historic observations. We propose an integrated spatio-temporal
forecasting  framework  –  ISTFF  –  which  uses  a  dynamic  recurrent  neural  network  for
spatial forecasting.

The article is organized as follows. The next section discusses the possible applica-
tions of spatio-temporal data mining for forest fire prevention, and reviews the progress
made  so  far.  Section  2  introduces  the  principle  and  structure  of  a  dynamic  recurrent
neural  network.  The  Elman  dynamic  recurrent  neural  network  captures  spatial
correlation  in  multiple  time  series  and  can  be  used  to  forecast  how  forest  fires  will
develop  over  space.  Section  3  presents  an  integrated  spatio-temporal  forecasting
framework  (ISTFF)  with  time  series  analysis  by  an  autoregressive  regression  analysis,
spatial forecasting by an Elman neural network, and their combination via a linear
regression.  In  Section  4,  the  framework  is  implemented  and  tested  by  predicting  forest
fire  areas  in  the  Provinces  of  Alberta  and  Newfoundland,  Canada.  The  final  section
summarizes the major findings and proposes directions for future research.

2 Spatio-temporal Data Mining Techniques for Forest Fire Prevention

Spatio-temporal data mining techniques and tasks include spatio-temporal forecast and
trend analysis, spatio-temporal association rule mining, spatio-temporal sequential pat-
terns  mining,  spatio-temporal  clustering  and  classification,  and  so  on  (Miller  and  Han
2001, Yao 2003, Yuan et al. 2004).

2.1 Spatio-Temporal Forecasting and Trend Analysis

The  spatio-temporal  forecasting  and  trend  analysis  technique  is  an  effective  means  of
forecasting with spatial attributes. Spatio-temporal forecasting has been developed from
individual spatial or temporal forecasting, and it has gained attention for its promising
performance in handling complex data in which both spatial and temporal characteristics
must be taken into account. The key issue is to integrate space and time simultaneously
and  seamlessly.  Some  mature  analysis  tools,  e.g.  time  series  or  spatial  statistics,  have
been extended to the spatio-temporal problem (Cressie and Majure 1997, Deutsch and
Ramos 1986, Pfeifer and Deutsch 1990, Pokrajac and Obradovic 2001).

2.2 Spatio-temporal Association Rule Mining

Association  Rule  Mining  is  one  of  the  most  extensively  studied  data  mining  tech-
niques.  A  spatio-temporal  association  rule  is  an  implication  of  a  strong  association

non-spatio-temporal attributes. The implication carries the meaning that if the attributes
 take some specific value at a point in time, then, with a certain probability, at the
at 
same point in time, the attributes at B will take some specific value (Gidofalvi 2004).

Despite the abundance of spatio-temporal data, few algorithms mine such data. The
main reason for the lack of efficient algorithms is a result of the exponential explosion
in the search space for knowledge caused by the added spatial and temporal attributes.
Existing  approaches  only  extend  the  classical  rule  mining  method  to  spatio-temporal
association rules. Thus, such rules lose the spatio-temporal characteristics (Verhein and
Chawla 2005).

2.3 Spatio-temporal Sequential Patterns Mining

The  aim  of  mining  spatio-temporal  patterns  is  to  find  sequences  of  events  (an  ordered
list  of  item  sets)  that  occur  frequently  in  spatio-temporal  datasets.  A  spatio-temporal
 are sets of spatio-temporal and
sequential pattern has the form A 
non-spatio-temporal  attributes,  which  means  that,  if,  at  some  point  in  time  and  space,
 take some specific value, then, with a certain probability at some later
the attributes in 
point in time, the attributes in 

 will take some specific value (Gidofalvi 2004).

Sequential pattern mining algorithms were first introduced by Agrawal and Srikant
(1995).  Tsoukatos  and  Gunopulos  (2001)  later  extended  these  methods  by  adding  the
spatial dimension. An efficient DFS (Depth First Searching) algorithm was proposed to
discover spatio-temporal sequential patterns for weather prediction.

2.4 Spatio-temporal Cluster Characteristics and Discriminate Rules Mining

Cluster  characteristics  or  discriminate  rules  associate  objects  belonging  to  a  cluster  of
some attributes with some probability. Widely used spatial clustering techniques – e.g.
K
-medoids  and  CLARANS  (Han  and  Kamber  2001)  –  may  be  extended

for spatio-temporal clustering.

These  techniques  can  be  applied  for  forest  fire  prevention,  as  follows  (Cheng  and

Wang, 2006):

2. Prediction of ongoing forest fire development: 

1. Forecasting and trend analysis of forest fire: 

Based on the data of forest fires in the
past (such as the burnt area extracted from remotely sensed images), spatio-temporal
forecasting and trend analysis techniques can be applied to predict the fire area and
the length of fire field in the future, in the same area or country. The prediction will
be based on the historic data of forest fires in the area and its spatial neighbourhoods.
Based on the spatio-temporal association
rule mining, how the relationship of locations A and B over time changes between
weather conditions (wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and humidity), forest
fuel type, and geographical conditions (degree of slope, aspect of slope, position of
slope) will be identified. This will enable the spreading of fire to be predicted, and
thus provide a real time optimised fighting plan to minimize the total cost resulting
from the fire.

3. Detection  of  the  sequences  of  fire  events: 

Using  the  spatio-temporal  sequential
patterns  mining  technique,  we  may  discover  a  spatio-temporal  sequential  pattern
that  occurs  frequently  in  a  forest  fire  database,  such  as  “Forest  fire  always  occurs
at region R1 prior to the occurrence of haze in nearby region R2”.

Identification  of  fire  spot  and  risk  assessment:
  Spatio-temporal  clustering  may
discover that “the grid cells with similar values in the meteorological satellite image
at  noon  can  be  clustered  as  a  spot  at  high  temperature,  tending  to  be  a  fire  spot”.
In addition to discriminating the fire spot, the spatio-temporal cluster characteristics
and discriminate mining techniques may be able to classify the fire risk ranking, and
to predict the probability of forest fire.

From  the  aforementioned  discussion,  we  can  see  that  Spatio-temporal  Data  Mining
(STDM) has great potential in forest fire prediction. That is why some researchers have
used  data  mining  technology  to  identify  fire  spots  and/or  assess  risk  areas,  such  as  the
automatic  detection  of  fire  smoke  using  artificial  neural  networks  and  threshold
approaches  applied  to  AVHRR  imagery  (Li  et  al.  2001),  and  using  evolving  neural
networks  for  forest  fire  control,  by  answering  such  questions  as  “where  should  the
agents  cut  fire-lines  to  minimize  the  damage  done  by  the  forest  fire?”  (Wiering  and
Dorigo 1998); or by using statistics-based predictive geospatial data mining methods to
predict the forest fire hazardous areas, based on the FHR (Forest Fire Hazard Rate) and
a PRC (Prediction Rate Curve), respectively (Han et al. 2003).

In addition, cellular automata or agent-based modelling is used extensively to predict
forest fire development using fire spread simulation. In these cellular automata models,
a forest is considered as a cellular space that consists of cells that can change their state
and influence neighbouring cells. Fire spread is simulated as a propagation process from
cell  to  cell,  in  which  burning  cells  ignite  their  unburned  neighbours  (Ntaimo  and
Khargharia  2006).  For  example,  Clarke  et  al.  (1994)  applied  cellular  automata  to
implement  a  model  of  wildfire  propagation  and  extinction  based  on  fractal  geometry.
Muzy et al. (2001) simulated fire spread via the cellular automation model (namely
Cell-DEVS), by combining it with Rothermel’s (1972) physical model of fire spread (see
also Muzy and Wainer 2002). Dunn and Milne (2004) introduced a methodology that
can be used to capture spatial heterogeneity by encoding the spread of wildland fire in
a set of interacting automata. The results demonstrated the ability of the methodology
to  capture  the  spatial  heterogeneity  of  a  landscape,  and  to  simulate  the  spread  of
wildfire  on  an  irregular  and  non-uniform  landscape.  Moreover,  Hu  and  Sun  (2007)
stimulated  fire  suppression  by  developing  fire-fighting  agents  in  three  fire  suppression
strategies: direct attack, parallel attack, and indirect attack. In general, cellular automata
modelling or agent-based modelling, is more suitable for fire behaviour simulation, but
not for behaviour forecasting. The challenge facing spatio-temporal forecasting is how
to integrate space and time seamlessly and simultaneously. Given the increasing demand
for  spatio-temporal  data  mining  in  many  application  fields,  many  spatio-temporal
forecasting models have been proposed. These forecasting models are based on mature
analysis  tools,  e.g.  time  series  or  spatial  statistics,  which  are  extended  to  the  temporal
or spatial aspects, respectively. For example, spatial statistics concepts were extended to
take the time dimension into account by Cressie and Majure (1997) and Pokrajac and
Obradovic (2001). In contrast, Deutsch and colleagues incorporated spatial correlation
into the multivariate time series analysis with the help of a neighbouring distance matrix
(Deutsch and Ramos 1986, Pfeifer and Deutsch 1990).

Artificial  neural  network  (ANN)  models  are  known  to  be  universal  and  flexible
function  approximators.  They  have  been  used  to  simulate  non-linear  systems  and  to
describe all kinds of data (Hagan et al. 1996, Mitchell 2003, Acharya et al. 2006). Over
the  years,  ANN  models  have  been  widely  used  for  temporal  forecasting  problems

(Drossu and Obradovic 1996, Tenti 1996, Walczak 2005). Recently, a static feedforward
neural  network  based  on  a  back-propagation  (BP)  algorithm  has  been  employed  for
spatial  forecasting  (Li  and  Dunham  2002).  A  spatio-temporal  integrated  framework  –
STIFF  –  has  been  proposed  to  forecast  the  water  flow  rate  at  a  gauging  station  in  the
catchment area (Li and Dunham 2002). In STIFF, time series analysis is performed using
an  autoregressive  integrated  moving  average  (ARIMA, Box  et  al.  1994)  to  capture  the
temporal  correlations,  and  the  BP  neural  network  is  employed  to  discover  the  hidden
and deeply entangled spatial relationships. The two mechanisms are then combined via
regression to generate the overall forecasting. This overcomes the deficiency of previous
works, by loosening their stringent assumptions and excessive simplification.

However,  the  STIFF  approach  cannot  forecast  forest  fire,  because  forest  fire  is  a
dynamic  process  that  develops  over  space,  and  thus  cannot  be  handled  by  a  static
forward neural network based on the BP algorithm that STIFF employed. A more com-
plex  network  should  be  designed  to  deal  with  the  non-stationary  and  non-linearity  of
the  dynamics  of  forest  fire  over  space.  A  dynamic  recurrent  neural  network  (DRNN),
which  is  a  neural  network  with  feedback  connections,  seems  more  appropriate.  This
feature makes the DRNN particularly suitable for a dynamic behaviour, when the input
vector includes a group of components specified at several consecutive periods, as often
occurs in time-series forecasting (Mandic and Chambers 2001). In principle, DRNN can
implement almost arbitrary sequential behaviours in a way that makes them biologically
more  plausible  and  computationally  more  powerful.  These  properties  of  DRNN  have
very  important  advantages  over  a  static  feedforward  neural  network,  such  as  the  BP
neural network, especially in real time applications that model the dynamic change over
space  (e.g.  forest  fire  and  transport).  Therefore,  in  this  research  we  will  use  DRNN  to
replace the static neural network, and combine the DRNN with the ARIMA to achieve
integrated spatio-temporal forecasting of forest fires.

3 DRNN for Spatial Forecasting

A  DRNN  is  a  neural  network  with  feedback  connections.  In  a  DRNN,  the  output
depends  not  only  on  the  current  input  to  the  network,  but  also  on  the  current  or
previous  input  and  output,  and  on  the  state  of  the  network.  This  feature  makes  the
recurrent neural network particularly suitable for a dynamic behaviour, which takes the

DRNNs learn to map input sequences to output sequences. In principle, DRNN can
implement almost arbitrary sequential behaviours. DRNNs are biologically more plausible
and computationally more powerful than other adaptive models, such as Hidden Markov
Models (which have no continuous internal states), and feedforward networks and Support
Vector Machines (which have no internal states at all) (Mandic and Chambers 2001).

3.1 Dynamic Recurrent Neural Networks

DRNNs are fundamentally different from static feedforward neural networks (SFNNs),
because DRNNs operate not only on an input space, but also on an internal state space:

3.2 Elman Recurrent Neural Network

The critical issue in the application of a DRNN is the choice of the network architecture,
i.e.  the  number  and  type  of  neurons,  the  location  of  feedback  loops,  and  the  develop-
ment of a suitable training algorithm. The Elman recurrent neural network is a powerful
network  for  extracting  the  informative  features  related  to  the  dynamic  system  in  its
hidden layer (Elman 1990). The conceptual structure of the Elman network is shown in
Figure 3.

An Elman-type DRNN has activation feedback that embodies short-term memory.
A state layer is updated not only with the external input of the network, but also with
activation from the previous forward propagtion. The feedback is modified by a set of
weights to enable automatic adoption through learning (e.g. back-propagation). As the
network can store information for future reference, it is able to learn temporal patterns
as well as spatial patterns. Thus, Elman’s network is one of the neural network models
that are able to reflect the dynamic changes in space. It is therefore adopted in this study
of spatial forecasting.

4 An Integrated Spatio-temporal Forecasting Framework – ISTFF

4.1 Principle

To differentiate our approach from STIFF, we call it ISTFF, i.e. integrated spatio-temporal
forecasting  framework.  This  also  implies  an  improved  STIFF,  given  ISTFF’s  improved
forecasting accuracy.

The key idea of ISTFF is as follows: first, constructing stochastic time series models
to  capture  the  temporal  characteristics  of  each  spatially  independent  subcomponent,
then  building  a  dynamic  recurrent  neural  network  (DRNN)  to  discover  the  hidden
spatial  correlation  between  the  target  subcomponent  and  other  subcomponents;  and,
finally,  combining  the  previous  individual  temporal  and  spatial  forecasts,  based  on
statistical regression, to produce the final forecasting result of the target subcomponent.

4.2 Problem Definition

Spatio-temporal forecasting can be formally defined as follows (Li and Dunham 2002):

1. The research area Ω is composed of n + 1 subcomponents denoted by α

1, . . . ,
n, which can be spatially separated from each other. Without loss of generality, α
α
0
is  assumed  to  be  the  only  target  subcomponent  in  which  the  spatio-temporal
forecasting will be conducted.

0, α

2. For  each  α

i  ∈  Ω,  there  are  m  time  series  observations  α

i1,  α

i2,  . . . ,  α

ij  that  are

recorded as Π

i for convenience (i = 0, n; j = 1, m).

3. Given  the  collection  of  subcomponents  Ω  =  {α
1, . . . , Π

dataset Π = {Π
l  in  the  time  series),  the  problem  of  spatio-temporal  forecasting  for α
mapping relationship f that is as precise as possible:

1,  . . . ,  α
n},  the  whole  available
n}, and the look-ahead steps of s (starting from any step
0  is  to  find  a

0,  α

0, Π

{σ

0(l+1), σ

0(l+2), . . . , σ

0(l+s)} = f{Ω, Π, l, s}

(7)

where σ

0j (j = 1, . . . , s) is the jth step prediction of α

0 (j = 1, . . . , s).

4.3 Algorithm

The problem defined above can be solved by the algorithm with the following steps.

• Step 1: Problem definition. Define the forecasting problem in terms of the specifica-
0 and its spatially-correlated siblings

tion by determining the target subcomponent α
0, α
α

1, . . . , α
n.

• Step 2: Time series analysis – temporal forecasting. For each subcomponent α

i ∈ Ω,
build an ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) model TSi. ARIMA is
the  most  general  model  for  forecasting  time  series  that  can  be  stationary  by  trans-
formations  such  as  differencing  and  logging  (Box  and  Jenkins  1994).  An  ARIMA
model  is  calibrated  by  three  parameters:  p  (the  order  of  autoregressive  process),  d
(the order of non-seasonal differences), and q (the order of moving average process).
The ARIMA(p, d, q) model of the time series {x1, x2, . . . } is defined as:

• Step 3: Spatial forecasting – Elman recurrent neural network. Using the spatial topo-
logical relationship (spatial adjacency) of all components α
i (i = 0, . . . , n), an Elman
recurrent  neural  network  is  built  to  capture  the  spatial  influence  of  all  non-target
subcomponents  on  the  target  subcomponent.  The  network  is  first  trained  and
adjusted accordingly. Then forecasts from each time series model TSi (i ≠ 0) are fed
into  the  network.  The  spatial  forecasts  at  α
0,  identified  as  fs,  are  finally  obtained
from the network output.

• Step  4:  Overall  spatio-temporal  forecasting  –  linear  regression. To  keep  the  combi-
nation easily understable and as simple as possible, linear regression was combined
with the forecasting method to produce the final spatio-temporal forecast. A linear
regression  is  employed  to  merge  the  time  series  model  fT  and  the  Elman  neural
network model fS. The linear regression suggested is as follows:

foverall = c1 × fT + c2 × fS + regression _ const(b)

(9)

where  the  regression  coefficients,  c1  and  c2,  and  regression  constant,  b,  have  to  be
estimated beforehand.

• Step 5: Model validation and accuracy evaluation. The model developed based upon
training data will be validated by testing data, which is called model validation. To
access  the  forecasting  performance  of  the  integrated  model,  the  Normalised  Mean
Square Error (NMSE) is used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy. The NMSE is an
estimator  of  the  overall  deviations  between  predicted  and  actual  values.  Given  N
pairs  of  the  actual  values  (or  targets,  yt)  and  predicted  values  (Wt),  the  NMSE  that
normalizes the MSE by dividing it through the variance of the respective series can
be defined as (Weigend and Gershenfeld 1994):

NMSE

(10)

where σ2 is the estimated variance of the data and ¥ is the mean.
If  a  model  has  a  very  low  NMSE,  then  it  performs  well  in  both  space  and  time.
On the other hand, high NMSE values mean that the model does not perform well. The
accuracies of both training data and test data will be evaluated in this step.

The novelty in our approach lies at Step 3: a modified Elman recurrent neural
network  is  applied  for  spatial  forecasting  (please  refer  to  Section  5  for  detailed
implementation),  and  this  overcomes  the  shortcomings  in  STIFF.  The  spatial  topo-
logical  relations  of  the  target  and  other  components  are  incorporated  in  the  structure
of  the  Elman  network.  Furthermore,  forecasting  accuracy  is  evaluated  by  the  NMSE
in Step 5.

5 Case Study

5.1 Study Area and Data

The  case  study  is  based  on  data  kindly  provided  by  the  Canada  Forest  Service  (CFS)
(CFS 2006). CFS has built a fire database – LFDB (Canada Large Fire Database) – that
contains records of large forest fires of an area exceeding 200 ha from 1959 to 1999. It
also covers every province, region, and forest park in Canada. Figure 4 shows the spatial
distribution of the eight provinces with forest fires in Canada.

To  assess  the  influence  of  the  spatial  association  on  prediction  accuracy,  the
experiment was divided into two groups. The first group has the target-subcomponent
as Alberta (AB), and the second group has the target-subcomponent as Newfoundland
(NF).  Both  groups  have  six  non-target  subcomponents:  Northwest  Territories  (NWT),
British Columbia (BC), Saskatchewan (SK), Manitoba (MB), Ontario (ON), and Quebec
(QC).  The  purpose  of  this  case  study  is  to  forecast  the  annual  average  area  (hectares/
year) in Alberta (AB) and Newfoundland (NF).

First,  the  original  data  is  analysed.  In  LFBD  (CFS  2006),  fire  data  for  different
months is recorded. These data are inconsistent and difficult to use. We summarized the
monthly data into annual data. Usually 80% of the data are used for training, and 20%
are  used  for  validation  in  the  neural  network  analysis.  Here  we  choose  data  between
January  1959  and  December  1989  as  the  training  data  to  forecast  the  data  between
January 1990 and December 1999.

The  experiment  uses  the  Matlab  software  package  to  implement  the  four-step
procedure  of  the  integrated  framework  discussed  above:  the  ARIMA  model  for  the
temporal  forecasting,  the  Elman  neural  network  for  the  spatial  forecasting,  the  linear
regression for combined spatio-temporal forecasting, and the accuracy evaluation. In the

province

following  sections,  we  use  the  province  of  Alberta  as  an  example  to  illustrate  this
procedure in detail.

5.2 Time Series Model for Temporal Forecasting

The  ARIMA  models  are  based  on  the  assumption  that  a  sequence  process  can  be
rendered approximately stationary (or weak stationary), because a stationary process is
relatively easy to predict. A stationary process is the one in which the statistical properties,
such  as  mean,  variance,  autocovariance,  etc.  are  all  constant.  That  is,  its  statistical
properties may be the same in the future as they have been in the past. For this reason,
Figure 5 shows a fraction plot of time series data between January 1959 and December
1989 for Alberta (AB) province. As Figure 5 shows, there is a clear increasing temporal
trend  line,  which  indicates  that  the  time  sequence  is  non-stationary.  After  natural  log
transformation  and  differencing,  a  stationary  sequence  was  obtained,  and  the  order  of
difference  is  reflected  in  parameter  d  as  1  here.  Next,  two  parameters  need  to  be
estimated:  p  (the  order  of  autoregressive  (AR)  process)  and  q  (the  order  of  moving
average  (MA)  process)  (see  Section  4.3,  Step  2).  The  sample  autocorrelation  function
(ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots of Alberta province, which
can  provide  information  about  AR  and  MA  order,  are  then  drawn  in  Figure  6.  From
the sample ACF and PACF in Figure 6, we find that ACF appears to cut off at temporal
lag two, which indicates the order q of the moving average process, and PACF seems to
cut off at temporal lag one, which indicates the order p of the autoregressive. Thus, the
time series model of Alberta (AB) province can be identified as ARIMA (1, 1, 2), where
ARIMA  stands  for  autoregressive  integrated  moving  average  process,  autoregressive
order  p  is  one,  difference  order  d  is  one,  and  moving  average  order  q  is  two.  The
non-linear  least  squares  estimation  of  parameters  is  then  performed  through  a  run  of
Matlab, and the equation used for the province of Albert is described as follows:

Yt = 0.13 + 3.47Yt−1 + ε

t − 1.25ε

t−1 − 0.89ε
t−2

random  variables  with  a  mean  of  zero  and  a  constant  variance.  Following  a  similar
procedure, the ARIMA models were constructed to obtain time series forecasts fT for all
the subcomponents.

5.3 Elman Recurrent Neural Network for Spatial Forecasting

To  incorporate  the  spatial  relationship  of  the  provinces  into  spatial  forecasting,  the
topological  structure  of  the  neural  network  is  designed,  based  on  the  spatial  weight
matrix, which is decided by the polygon adjacency in Figure 4. There are many alternative
ways  of  specifying  spatial  weights  (Anselin  1988,  2002,  2005;  Cliff  and  Ord  1973,
1981).  Typical  specifications  are  the  rook-based  (common  boundaries),  bishop-based
(common  vertices),  and  queen-based  (common  boundaries  and  vertices)  contiguity
spatial weights; and distance-based spatial weights, in which two observations at i and
j  are  considered  neighbours  if  the  distance  between  i  and  j  is  less  than  a  given  cut-off
value. In practice, a spatial weights matrix is rather arbitrarily selected, especially when
there is no formal theoretical foundation for the extent of spatial interaction (Kawabata
and Shen 2007).

After  testing  the  first-order  rook-based  spatial  weights,  queen-based  contiguity
spatial  weights,  and  distance-based  spatial  weights,  using  various  cut-off  distance
values,  the  first-order  queen-based  contiguity  spatial  weights  were  selected,  because
queen-based  contiguity  generally  yielded  better  fits,  and  it  is  more  reasonable  to  con-
sider zones (i.e. provinces) as having common boundaries and vertices as neighbours. In
the spatial weights matrix, one represents the existence of first order adjacency, and zero
represents  the  non-existence  of  first  order  adjacency.  In  Figure  4,  the  spatial  weight
matrices  (6 × 6)  (see  Figure  7)  were  built  using  the  GeoDa  software,  a  tool  for  spatial
data analysis (Anselin 2005).

The designed neural network should include three layers based on the spatial weight
matrix.  The  input  layer  contained  six  nodes.  The  number  of  output  nodes  was  set  to
one. The number of hidden nodes was determined based on the spatial weight matrix,
and was set to six. The designed network is now a standard feedforward neural network
(see  Figure  1  and  the  left  part  of  Figure  8),  which  can  capture  only  the  static  spatial
correlation  between  different  neighbours.  To  reflect  the  dynamic  changes  in  space,  a
recurrent connection layer must be added to the static network by making both current
and previous inputs to the feedforward network. As Figure 2 shows, the dynamic recurrent
neural network provides one such solution. That is, a new layer is added to the hidden

Figure 7 Sketch  map  of  spatial  weights  matrix.  Binary  connectivity  weights  are  used  to
express  the  matrix.  One  means  that  there  exists  connectivity,  and  zero  means  that  no
connectivity exists

Figure 8 Elman  neural  network  structure  designed  for  Alberta  province.  The  solid  line
indicates  first  order  adjacency,  and  dashed  line  indicates  no  first  order  adjacency.  The  left
part of vertical dashed line is a standard static feedforward neural network

layer.  To  reflect  each  neighbour’s  previous  state,  the  previous  state  is  defined  as  the
external  input  of  the  network.  The  recurrent  relation  forms  a  feedback  loop,  in  which
the new layer represents information about the history of network input. We chose the
Elman network, which is a powerful network for implementing a recurrent connection
(see Figures 3 and 8). Thus, the Elman network for predicting province Alberta (AB) is
(6-6-1), structured as shown in Figure 8 (according to Figure 7). The Elman network
for predicting the province Newfoundland is relatively similar to that for Alberta, except
that  the  node  of  AB  in  the  input  layer  will  be  replaced  by  the  Node  NF,  and  the  links
between the layers should be changed accordingly, based on the adjacency map in Figure 7.
The spatial weights matrix was used as weighting in the Elman RNN initialization.
The  temporal  forecasts  fT  for  each  group  training  set  were  then  input  to  the  designed
network, so as to establish the spatial influence of neighbouring provinces on the target
location. Another important issue with the Elman RNN concerns how to select a proper
simulation  function.  We  chose  the  logsig  function  as  the  stimulation  function  for  the
output layer, and the tansig function for the hidden layer. The learning rate is 0.01. This
choice  is  based  on  the  analysis  of  training  and  testing  errors.  Finally,  the  spatial  fore-
casting reached is fS.

5.4 Overall Spatio-Temporal Forecasting

So far, we have obtained temporal forecasting fT and spatial forecasting fS for the target
locations. Our goal is to produce an optimal overall spatio-temporal forecasting foverall.
In the study, we use the linear regression in Equation (9) to combine fT and fS.

Before we carry out the regression analysis, we estimate the trend between observation
variables. Two scatter plots (fT, Real values) and (fS, Real values) are shown in Figure 9,
where the real values mean the observations at different times.

forecasting fT displays a clear linear relation. However, spatial forecasting fS does not show
a clear linear relation

Figure 10 Comparisons of forest fire area prediction in Alberta province by different models

In Figure 9, we see a clear linear trend for temporal forecasting fT. However, spatial
forecasting fS does not show a clear linear relation. The regression coefficient is acquired
after  analysing  the  regression,  which  is  2.538  and  0.976  for  c1  and  c2,  respectively,  of
Equation  (9).  We  see  that  time  forecasting  fT  occupied  more  weight  than  spatial
forecasting  fS  in  the  overall  forecasting.  This  indicates  that  the  linear  combination  of
temporal  forecasting  fT  and  spatial  forecasting  fS  is  not  the  best  choice.  This  will  be
discussed further in the next section.

The  spatio-temporal  forecasting  result  is  basically  identical  with  the  real  value.  At
the same time, we compute foverall based on STIFF, by using a back-propagation neural
network (BPNN) for the spatial forecasting. The forecasting results by different models
for Alberta are represented in Figure 10, and Table 1 shows their accuracies, calculated
on the basis of Equation (10). The results for Newfoundland are reported in Figure 11
and Table 2.

5.5 Accuracy Evaluation and Further Analysis

Figures  10  and  11  and  Tables  1  and  2  show  that  the  ISTFF  method  achieved  better
forecasting  accuracy  than  STIFF,  for  both  Alberta  and  Newfoundland.  Its  prediction
error  is  only  50%  of  that  of  STIFF  for  Alberta,  and  95%  for  Newfoundland.  This
implies that the Elman network in ISTFF obtains better spatial forecasting than the BP
network  in  STIFF.  Compared  with  the  ARIMA,  its  prediction  error  is  only  35%  for
Alberta,  but  is  larger,  16.5%,  for  Newfoundland.  In  other  words,  the  forecasting
performance  of  pure  ARIMA  is  worse  for  Alberta,  but  its  performance  is  evidently
better than that of STIFF and ISTFF for Newfoundland.

In order to understand the difference in the forecasting accuracy of the two provinces,
we  analyze  the  spatial  autocorrelation  of  two  groups  characterized  by  Local  Moran’s
Index (Anselin 1995) – the local form of Moran’s Index, which is calculated using the
GeoDa  software.  The  mean  value  of  Local  Moran’s  Index  of  Alberta  (AB)  with  other
non-target subcomponents is 0.5246 from 1959 to 1999, and the mean value of Local
Moran’s Index of Newfoundland (NF) with non-target subcomponents is 0.0492 from
1959 to 1999. This means that Alberta (AB) has a stronger correlation than Newfoundland
(NF)  in  space.  That  is,  the  spatial  influence  of  other  provinces  on  Newfoundland  is
much  smaller  than  their  influence  on  Alberta.  This  is  supported  by  Figure  4,  because
Newfoundland  is  far  away  from  most  other  provinces,  while  Alberta  is  adjacent  to
several  others.  We  can  therefore  say  that  the  accuracy  of  spatial  forecasting  by  the
Elman network depends heavily on the spatial correlations of the components. This also
applies  to  the  static  feedforward  neural  network  (BPNN)  used  in  STIFF  for  spatial
forecasting.  However,  this  also  suggests  that  both  neural  networks  should  incorporate
the spatial autocorrelation in their structure design, in addition to the spatial topology
(adjacency). This will be the subject of future research.

6 Discussion and Conclusions

This  article  presents  an  application  of  spatio-temporal  data  mining  for  forest  fire
prevention.  The  research  paid  special  attention  to  the  spatio-temporal  forecasting  of
forest  fire.  An  improved  spatio-temporal  integrated  forecasting  framework  –  ISTFF  –
was  proposed,  and  its  use  was  illustrated  by  a  case  study  of  forest  fire  area  prediction
in  Canada.  Comparative  analysis  of  ISTFF  with  ARIMA  and  STIFF  showed  the  high
predication accuracy of ISTFF.

The  improved  accuracy  of  ISTFF  results  from  the  introduction  of  the  Elman
neural  network  for  spatial  forecasting.  This  is  a  recurrent  dynamic  neural  network
that  can  consider  the  states  of  the  input  and  the  states  between  the  input  and  the
output, and is suitable for modelling dynamic change in forest fire over space. Another
contribution of this research is the incorporation of the spatial association of the spatial
components  in  the  initialization  of  the  structure  and  weights  for  the  Elman  network.
This has never before been discussed in the design of any kind of neural network in the
literature.

We also explored the effect of spatial correlation on the accuracy of spatio-temporal
forecasting, when applying a neural network for spatial forecasting. The spatial correlation
of  target  locations  (target  subcomponents)  with  non-target  subcomponents  can  be
characterized by local statistics such as Local Moran’s I (Unwin and Unwin 1998). Our

case  study  shows  that,  if  there  exists  stronger  spatial  correlation  between  target  sub-
component  and  non-target  subcomponents,  ISTFF  can  obtain  better  prediction
performance. On the other hand, if the spatial autocorrelation between the target
subcomponent  and  non-target  subcomponents  is  trivial,  then  ARIMA  is  much  better
than ISTFF. Our on-going research also concerns how to improve prediction accuracy,
by accommodating spatial correlations in the structure of the Elman network.

The case study also shows that, in the linear combination, temporal forecasting fT
outweighs spatial forecasting fS. It confirms that the spatial effect is not linear, and that
the linear combination is not the best choice. In other words, a non-linear ensemble of
temporal  forecasting  and  spatial  forecasting  should  be  introduced.  Our  preliminary
research  shows  that  support  vector  machines  (Vapnik  1995)  can  integrate  spatial  and
temporal  forecasting  nonlinearly,  and  obtain  better  forecasting  accuracy  than  ARIMA
and other methods. This is also valid for the similar case of Newfoundland, where the
spatial correlation of the spatial components is weak (Cheng et al. 2007).

Despite  its  promising  performance,  ISTFF  handled  only  one  variable  in  our  case
study. When the forecasting of one variable depends on other variables, the correlation
between different variables should be taken into account. Thus, we must further extend
ISTFF to address spatio-temporal forecasting involving multiple variables.

The integrated spatio-temporal data mining framework enables the data stored
in  the  forest  fire  information  system  to  be  fully  assimilated  and  manipulated  for  fire
prediction  and  prevention.  We  believe  that  the  analysis  of  the  forecasting  results  will
facilitate the calibration and evaluation of the fire models developed by other methods.
The  methodology  developed  in  this  study  will  also  improve  the  prediction  of  spatio-
temporal processes in other application domains, such as meteorological studies.

ICC2017: Celebrating Cartography

This Special Issue commemorates the 28th International Car-
tographic Conference that was held in Washington, D.C.
from 2nd to 7th July 2017 (Figure 1). Some 916 delegates
from 75 countries participated in this biennial event of the
International Cartographic Association (ICA), which
involved 527 oral presentations and 200 posters, organized
into 144 sessions across 40 research themes (many thanks
to Maeve Carey for supplying these data). The selection
and peer-review of papers included in this Special Issue fol-
lowed an initial evaluation by members of the International
Scientific Program Committee (chaired by Cindy Brewer)
and I am very grateful to the Journal’s editorial staff, Peter
Vujakovic, Gwilym Eades and Martin Davis, for their help
in selecting and editing the manuscripts and to all our
additional reviewers for their contribution to this Special
Issue.

The papers included here reflect the diversity of topics pre-
sented in Washington, from mapping emotions to expanding
cartographic horizons with augmented reality. They examine
new approaches to big geospatial data and generalization,
reflect on the role of maps in education, and consider how
usability studies can provide new insights to improve carto-
graphic design. Accompanying these papers is a report on
the UK’s entries in the international cartographic exhibition

that has been compiled by David Forrest (UK National Del-
egate and a current Vice President of the ICA). This Special
Issue therefore aims to combine some of the academic and
applied aspects of our field, echoing the intention of the orga-
nizers of ICC2017 to provide a celebration of cartography.
As usual, this final Issue of the year includes the Society’s
Annual Report and a record of the Society’s Awards for
2017, that were presented at the very successful joint BCS-
SoC Conference ‘Maps for Changing Reality’ held at Red-
from 5th to 7th September
worth Hall, near Durham,
(Figure 2). It also includes the President’s Address from the
Society’s Annual General Meeting at Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge on 14th November, as a short Viewpoint
paper. My hope is that successive BCS Presidents will be
inclined and encouraged to record in this way their perspec-
tive on the challenges and opportunities facing cartography
as the Society evolves.

It is worth pointing out that the pages of every Issue of the
Journal result from the hard work of many individuals –
including authors, reviewers, editors and typesetters – and
the success of this publication relies upon the generous
sharing of expertise by those who freely give up their time
to evaluate manuscripts. I am therefore very grateful to
each and every reviewer for their important contribution to

publish the best
Editors, Ken Field (until Issue 2), Peter Vujakovic and
Gwilym Eades, deserve our thanks for their valuable contri-
bution to the process of commissioning papers and coordi-
nating reviews, as does the Editorial Assistant, Martin
Davis, whose steadfast commitment to Book and Atlas
Reviews continues to raise the profile of this section. I
should also like to thank the Editorial Board (especially
those whom I did not have the opportunity to thank person-
ally at ICC2017) for their guidance and support, and the staff
at Taylor & Francis, particularly Prempriya Mohan, Tatiana
Faia, Emily Savell and Eilise Norris, for all their assistance.
Next year promises to be an exciting one for the Journal, as
Volume 55 will see the introduction of a new internal
design and the publication of two Special Issues.

NOTES ON THE COVER

The cover includes an artwork that was created for this
Special Issue in celebration of ICC2017 by the graphic

designer and artistic researcher Julia Mia Stirnemann of the
University of Applied Sciences Berne and Vice Chair of the
ICA Commission on Art and Cartography. The regional
map and its inset showing the conference venue and its envir-
ons were hand-painted using watercolours and ink and super-
imposed with digital graphics.

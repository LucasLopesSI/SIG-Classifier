Abstract In geographic association rule mining many patterns are either redundant or
contain well known geographic domain associations explicitly represented in knowledge
resources such as geographic database schemas and geo-ontologies. Existing spatial
association rule mining algorithms are Apriori-like, and therefore generate a large amount
of redundant patterns. For non-spatial data, the closed frequent pattern mining technique
has been introduced to remove redundant patterns. This approach, however, does not
warrant the elimination of both redundant and well known geographic dependences when
mining geographic databases. This paper presents a novel method for pruning both
redundant and well known geographic dependences, by pushing semantics into the pattern
mining task. Experiments with real geographic databases have demonstrated a significant
reduction of the total amount of patterns and the efficiency of the method.

1 Introduction

The frequent pattern mining (FPM) technique plays an important role in many data mining
tasks such as sequential patterns and association rules. As most discovery techniques it has
the objective of identifying non-trivial, valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately
understandable patterns from data. However, it is well known that frequent pattern mining
often generates a large number of frequent itemsets and rules [20], among which a small

number is novel and interesting to the user. In spatial data mining, this problem increases
because of the natural dependences among geographic data, which generate a large amount
of patterns and associations that are well known [2], [4]. While in transactional databases
items are supposed to be independent from each other
(e.g. milk, cereal, bread),
in geographic databases a large amount of data are
independently of their meaning,
semantically dependent (e.g. island within water).

Figure 1 shows two layers of information of a geographic region. In Fig. 1(left) there is a
well known pattern, i.e., a geographic dependence where gas stations do always intersect
streets. If considered in association rule mining, such dependence will produce well known
high confidence rules (e.g. is_a(GasStation) → intersect(Street)). In Fig. 1(right), however,
there is no well known pattern among gas stations and water resources that may produce
well known rules. Relationships as the example shown in Fig. 1(right) are interesting for
spatial data mining, while relationships of the kind shown in Fig. 1(left) are well known and
uninteresting.

Users of some domains may not be interested in strong geographic domain rules such as
in non-obvious rules such as is_a

is_a(GasStation)→ intersect(Street) (100%), but
(GasStation) and intersect(WaterResource) → pollution=high (70%).

In geographic databases, most discovered patterns are strongly related to geographic
dependences which represent strong regularities, but do not contribute to the discovery of
novel and useful knowledge.

Geographic dependences are semantic constraints that represent mandatory relationships
which must hold in geographic databases to warrant the consistency of the data [21] (e.g.
island must be completely located inside a water body). They are part of the concept of
geographic data and are explicitly represented in geo-ontologies [8] and geographic
database schemas [4, 7]. In [7] a case study on real geographic database schemas has
demonstrated the significant amount of well known dependences that
is explicitly
represented in the conceptual schema. Mandatory relationships are represented by
cardinality constraints one-one and one-many [12, 22]. Geographic data with these
association constraints produce well known rules with a high confidence.

Definition 1 (geographic dependence) [4] Is a mandatory spatial relationship between two
geographic feature types A and B where every instance of A must be spatially related to at
least one instance of B.

Figure 2 shows an example of part of a conceptual geographic database schema,
represented in a UML class diagram [9]. It represents part of the data shown in
Figure 1(left), where every gas station intersects one or more streets. Figure 2 illustrates
different mandatory associations (e.g. gas station and street, street and city, city and water
resource, and island and water resource). Geographic objects which do not have mandatory
one-one or one-many associations in their schema (e.g. gas stations and water resources)
may produce more interesting patterns. Observe in Fig. 1(right) that there is no well known
pattern between gas stations and water resources, and no association is represented in the
conceptual schema shown in Fig. 2.

Well known geographic dependences can be either specified by the user or automatically
retrieved with processes of reverse engineering [10] if the schema is not available. When
provided by the user, a larger set of dependences can be specified; not only associations
explicitly represented in the schema, but many other application domain dependences
which produce well known patterns. In [6] we have extended the Weka [27] data mining
toolkit for automatic geographic data preprocessing, with a graphical GUI where the user
can directly select the spatial feature types with well known dependences from the database
and specify new dependences.

For non-spatial data mining, several objective [14, 15, 25, 26, 29] and subjective
measures [17, 23] have been proposed and evaluated [28] to reduce the number of patterns
and evaluate rule interestingness. Most of these approaches apply pruning strategies a
posteriori, after the frequent set computation, i.e., during the generation of association rules.
The main drawback of these measures is that the ideal significance measure is usually hard
to obtain in real applications [25]. Another group of algorithms for non-spatial data has
been proposed to reduce redundant patterns, generating closed frequent itemsets [19, 20,
31]. In these approaches, pruning is performed early, during the frequent set generation. All
approaches reduce the number of either frequent patterns or rules, but do not warrant the
elimination of well known dependences when applied to the geographic domain.

The closed frequent pattern mining technique significantly reduces the number of
frequent sets and has been extensively used in the last years in non-spatial data mining, but
has not been applied to the geographic domain so far. However, if applied to the geographic
domain, this technique does not warrant the elimination of well known geographic patterns.
On the contrary, we will show that well known dependences that pass the minimum support
constraint are retained in closed frequent sets, and therefore several discovered patterns will
contain well known dependences. Another problem is that well known dependences cannot
be simply removed from the closed frequent patterns [5], as will be shown later in
Section 2.

Considering these problems, there is an emerging need for novel data mining algorithms
which take into account the semantics of the data to remove well known patterns and
eliminate redundant frequent sets. Recently, we have introduced a novel method using
background knowledge for pruning uninteresting and well known geographic dependences
in spatial association rule mining [4, 7]. However this approach is based on an Apriori-like
frequent set generation, and does not remove redundant patterns.

In this paper we extend our previous work of dependence elimination to redundancy
elimination. On the contrary of existing approaches which reduce uninteresting association
rules with different objective/subjective measures, we use semantic knowledge to generate
maximal generalized frequent geographic patterns without dependences and without
redundancies.

1.1 Related works and contribution

There are basically two approaches in the literature for extracting frequent patterns from
geographic databases, and both are Apriori-like [1], i.e., generate redundant frequent sets
and have not considered the closed frequent pattern mining technique for pattern pruning.
One is based on quantitative reasoning, which mainly computes distance relationships
during the frequent set generation. Quantitative reasoning approaches [13, 30] deal with
geographic attributes (coordinates x,y) directly. These approaches have the advantage of not
requiring the definition of a reference object, but on the other hand, they only consider
quantitative spatial relationships (e.g. distance).

The other approach is based on qualitative reasoning [2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 18] and deals with
any spatial relationship (e.g. distance, topology, order) between a reference geographic
object type and a set of relevant feature types represented by any geometric primitive (e.g.
points, lines, polygons). Because of the high computational cost, spatial relationships are
normally extracted in a first step, in data preprocessing tasks, while frequent patterns are
generated in another step.

Both qualitative and quantitative reasoning approaches have not focused on interesting
geographic aspects to be considered in FPM. Apart from our previous work, existing
approaches do neither make use of prior knowledge to specify which spatial relationships
should be computed nor to reduce the number of well known semantic patterns. Koperski
[16], for example, presented a top-down, progressive refinement method to extract spatial
relationships, while patterns and rules are reduced using the minimum support threshold.
Clementini [11] presented a similar method for mining association rules from geographic
objects with broad boundaries.

Appice [2] proposed a method to extract all spatial features and spatial relationships to a
deductive relational database. This process is computationally expensive since all spatial
relationships are computed a priori. Although patterns and association rules can be reduced
with pattern constraints, the user has to specify a different constraint for all different
combinations of spatial relationships and possible association rules. Besides requiring a lot
of background knowledge from the user, pruning is performed in post processing steps, i.e.,
after both frequent sets and association rules have already been generated.

Following the qualitative reasoning approach we have recently proposed a novel method
which uses domain knowledge in data mining. We proposed to use geo-ontologies in
geographic data pre-processing in order to reduce spatial joins, computing only topological
relationships semantically consistent [8]. In [3] we proposed an algorithm to extract well
known dependences from geographic database schemas and Apriori-KC to remove well
known dependences among relevant feature types, during the frequent set generation. In [4]

Geoinformatica (2010) 14:201–220

205

we proposed a two-step pruning method where (a) dependences between the target feature
type and the relevant feature types are removed in a pre-processing step, and (b)
dependences among the relevant feature types that cannot be removed in data preprocessing
are removed during the data mining task. In [7] we presented a summary of results and an
the
analysis on disjoint and overlap dependence pruning, with an evaluation of
computational cost of the proposed methods.

Although the well known geographic dependences are completely eliminated in our
previous work, the proposed approach still generates a huge amount of redundant patterns
and association rules [5]. In this paper we extend our previous work of dependence
elimination to redundancy elimination, and make the following contributions:

present a very simple but effective method for pruning redundant and well known
patterns. With experiments we show a reduction of more than 50% of the patterns in
relation to our previous work.
show that the closed frequent pattern mining technique itseltf does not warrant the
elimination of well known dependences when applied to the geographic domain. We
show that the closed frequent pattern mining approach is effective for redundancy
pruning, but is not for dependence elimination. With experiments on real databases we
show that a large amount of the patterns generated by this approach contain well known
dependences.
show that dependences cannot be directly removed from closed frequent sets without
loosing information.
propose an effective algorithm for mining frequent geographic patterns without
redundant and well known patterns. The proposed method is general enough to support
any objective or subjective measure such as confidence, lift, improvement, etc, for
further rule pruning.

The main contribution of our work relies on the fact that the use of semantics in data
mining allows the elimination of the exact patterns that are a priori known as uninteresting.

1.2 Scope and outline

The scope of this paper is limited to the elimination of redundant and well known patterns
in frequent geographic pattern mining.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the basic concepts
and an analysis of frequent and closed geographic patterns with well known dependences,
as well as the replication of such dependences in the closed frequent pattern mining
approach. Section 3 presents the algorithm MG-FGP (Maximal Generalized Frequent
Geographic Patterns) to remove redundant and well known patterns. Section 4 presents
experiments performed over real databases and an analysis of the proposed approach.
Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and presents some directions of future work.

2 Geographic dependences in closed frequent pattern mining

Existing approaches for mining frequent patterns in geographic databases are Apriori-like
and generate candidates and frequent sets. While in transactional data mining the candidate
generation might be a problem, in geographic data mining it is not [22, page 205]. The
number of predicates in geographic FPM is much smaller than the number of items in

206

Geoinformatica (2010) 14:201–220

transactional databases. According to [22], the computational cost relies on the spatial
neighbourhood computation, and depends on the number of instances of the different object
types.

In transactional FPM every row in the dataset is usually a transaction and columns are
items. In qualitative geographic FPM every row is an instance (e.g. Minneapolis) of a
reference object type (e.g. city), called target feature type, and columns are predicates.
Every predicate is related to a non-spatial attribute (e.g. population) of the target feature
type or a spatial predicate. Spatial predicate is a relevant feature type that is spatially related
to specific instances of the target feature type (e.g. contains_factory). In geographic FPM
the set F = {f1, f2, …,fk, ..., fn} is a set of non-spatial attributes and spatial predicates, and
Ψ (dataset) is a set of instances of a target feature type, where each instance is a row W such
that W ⊆ F. There is exactly one tuple in the dataset Ψ for each instance of the target feature
type. Figure 3 shows an example where each row in the dataset is a city (Fig. 3 (a)) and
each item (A, C, D, T, W) is a spatial predicate which corresponds to a relationship of a city
with Port, School, Treated Water, Hospital, and Water Resource.

A predicate set (itemset) is a set X, where X ⊆ F. The support s of a predicate set X is the

percentage of rows in which the set X occurs as a subset, and is denoted as s(X).

The problem of geographic FPM is decomposed in two main steps, where the first is
usually performed as a data preprocessing method because of the high computational cost:

a) Extract spatial predicates: a spatial predicate is a spatial relationship (e.g. distance,
order, topological) between the reference feature type and a set of relevant feature
types;

b) Find all frequent patterns: a set is frequent if its support is at least equal to a certain

threshold, called minsup;

Assertion 1 (anti-monotone property) [1] If a predicate set Z is frequent, then every
subset of Z will also be frequent. If the set Z is not frequent, then every set that contains Z is
not frequent too. All rules derived from Z satisfy the support constraint if Z satisfies the
support constraint.

The focus in this paper relies on the frequent pattern reduction (step b) and on
dependences among the relevant feature types [3]. To understand the problem of
geographic dependences in frequent sets and closed frequent sets let us consider the
example shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3 (a) shows a dataset with six tuples and five predicates.
Every row in the dataset is a city and the predicate sets are relevant feature types (port,
school, water resource, hospital, treated water network) with spatial relationships with
the target feature type (city), described in Fig. 3 (b). For convenience we use letters in the
dataset in Fig. 3 (a) to represent the spatial predicates, and from this point we will refer to
a row or a tuple in the dataset as a “transaction” (tid) and a set of rows as a “set of
transactions” (tidset) to follow the terminology commonly used in the frequent pattern
mining literature.

Figure 3(c) shows the meet-semilattice of the frequent sets with minimum support
50%, i.e., which appear in at least 50% of the tuples in Fig. 3 (a). Figure 3(d) shows the
meet-semilattice of the closed frequent sets with support 50%, which we will explain
later.

In Fig. 3(c) we observe that the frequent sets with minimum support 50% start with
combinations one-by-one, two-by-two, and so on, from the smallest set (with one element)
to the largest set (with four elements). In the dataset in Fig. 3 (a) there is a geographic
dependence between A (Port) and W (Water Resource), since every port must be related to
at least one water resource. Because of the dependence between A and W, every city that
contains port will also contain water resource. A dependence among relevant feature types
occurs when pairs of predicates with geographic objects with dependences appear together.
This happens when the frequent pattern mining algorithm starts the combination of the
2-predicate sets, as can be noticed in Fig. 3(c).

The meet-semilattice in Fig. 3 (c) shows the 25 frequent sets including the identifier of
the transactions where the set appears in the dataset. Notice that six frequent sets have the
geographic dependence {A,W}, which are represented in dark gray. As can be observed in
Fig. 3 (c), geographic dependences appear the first time in frequent sets with two elements,
and are replicated to many larger frequent sets when minsup is reached. Notice that we
cannot eliminate A and W from the dataset because either A or W may have interesting
associations with other predicates (C, D, T).

Among the frequent sets in Fig. 3(c) there are many redundant frequent sets, which are
removed by the closed frequent set approach, as shows the meet-semilattice in Fig. 3 (d).
Among the 25 frequent sets in Fig. 3 (c), 16 are redundant, and are eliminated through the
generation of closed frequent sets, shown in Fig. 3(d), with a reduction from 25 frequent
sets to only nine closed frequent sets.

208

Geoinformatica (2010) 14:201–220

Definition 2 (Closed Frequent Set) [19] a frequent itemset L is a closed frequent itemset if
Ω(L)=L.

The closure operator Ω associates with a frequent predicate set L the maximal set of
predicates common to all transactions (tidset) containing L. Non-closed frequent predicate
sets have the same support as its respective closed frequent predicate set. This property
warrants that no information is lost and that rules generated from non-closed frequent sets
are redundant to rules generated from the closed frequent sets. In Fig. 3 (d) we can observe
that the closed frequent itemset is the largest frequent itemset for every different tidset. The
set {A,D,W}, for example, is a frequent set because it reaches minimum support (50%). It
is also a closed frequent set because in the set of transactions 1345 where it occurs in the
dataset, no set larger than {A,D,W} (with more than three elements) reaches minimum
support. The frequent set {A,D,T} in the transactions 135 in Fig. 3 (c), for example, is not
the largest set that can be generated for transactions 135, since the larger set {A,D,T,W} can
be generated. In this case the tidset(A,D,T) = 135, the tidset(A,D,T,W) = 135, and {A,D,T}
⊂{A,D,T,W}, so the frequent set {A,D,T} is redundant to the set {A,D,T,W}, and therefore
is not closed.

Considering the pair {A,W} with a dependence, observe in Fig. 3 (d) that the closed
the elimination of well known geographic
frequent set approach does not warrant
dependences. As shown in dark gray, among the nine closed frequent sets, three have the
dependence {A,W}: {A,D,W}, {A,C,D,W}, and{A,D,T,W}.

Assertion 2 If a pair with a geographic dependence is a frequent set P, then P ⊆ Q, where Q
is a closed frequent set.

Assertion 2 shows that each frequent dependence will appear in at least one closed
frequent set. For instance let’s consider that the tidset containing P is 1234. By the
definition of closed frequent set, the closure operator Ω associates with a frequent predicate
set P the maximal set of predicates common to all transactions containing P. Then, there
will be one closed frequent set composed of P and all other items that appear in the same
tidset. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that Q is the frequent closed set generated
from the tidset 1234, and that P is not a subset of Q. In this case, Q will not be maximal for
this set of transactions, because the maximal should contain P, and by consequence, Q is
not closed.

Dependences cannot be directly removed from the closed frequent sets. If we eliminate
the closed frequent sets {A,D,W}(1345), {A,C,D,W}(145), and {A,D,T,W}(135) that contain
the dependence, the information in the non-closed frequent sets occurring in the same
transactions of the closed frequent sets is lost. For instance, the elimination of the closed
frequent set {A,C,D,W}(145), in Fig. 3 (d), will remove the information of the subsets
{A,C}(145) and {A,C,D}(145), which are not closed (see Fig. 3 (c)). The elimination of the
closed frequent set with the dependence {A,D,T,W}(135), for instance, would lead to the
loose of information in the subsets {A,T}(135), {T,W}(135),{A,D,T}(135), and {D,T,W}(135),
that have no dependences.

By eliminating geographic dependences from the frequent sets and then apply the closed
frequent set approach for pruning redundant frequent sets, the resultant frequent sets are not
closed in relation to the dataset. For example, in Fig. 3(c) there are six frequent sets
obtained from the tidset 135: {A,T}), {T,W}, {A,D,T}, {A,T,W}, {D,T,W}, and {A,D,T,W}.
Two frequent sets contain the dependence ({A,T,W} and {A,D,T,W}), and {A,D,T,W} is
the closed frequent set. By removing the sets {A,T,W} and {A,D,T,W} with the
dependence from the frequent sets of transactions 135, the remaining sets {A,T}, {T,W},
{A,D,T}, {D,T,W} are not closed because a larger set {A,D,T,W} can still be generated

Geoinformatica (2010) 14:201–220

209

from the dataset. Indeed, {A,T} and {T,W} are redundant in relation to {A,D,T} and
{D,T,W}, respectively.

In this section we have seen two main problems related to well known dependences and

closed frequent patterns:

&

the closed frequent pattern mining technique reduces the number of frequent sets but
does not warrant the elimination of well known dependences;

& well known geographic dependences cannot be directly removed from closed frequent

sets without loosing information.

To overcome these problems of removing both redundant frequent sets and well known
dependences we propose the algorithm MG-FGP to generate maximal generalized frequent
geographic patterns, presented in the following section.

3 Mining maximal generalized frequent geographic patterns

As we have seen in the previous section, well known geographic dependences cannot be
removed from closed frequent sets. Therefore, dependences have to be removed a priori,
before the generation of closed frequent sets. However, since the dependences are removed,
it is impossible to generate closed sets. In this section we introduce the concept of maximal
generalized frequent pattern, and present an algorithm to compute these patterns.

3.1 Maximal generalized frequent geographic patterns

Maximal generalized frequent geographic patterns are the largest frequent sets without well
known dependences that can be generated from a set of transactions.

Definition 3 (Maximal Generalized Frequent Geographic Pattern): a frequent geographic
pattern L is maximal if L=Μ(L).

The maximal operator Μ associates with a frequent predicate set L the largest sets of
predicates common to all
transactions containing L without well known geographic
dependences. In other words, L is maximal if there is no frequent predicate set L’ in the
same transactions of L such that L⊂ L’ and L’-(cid:1)=L’, where (cid:1) is the set of well known
geographic dependences.

Let us consider the meet-semilattice of the frequent sets with 50% support extracted
from the dataset in Fig. 3(a), after the dependence elimination, which is shown in Fig. 4
(left). Now let us consider, for example, the frequent sets generated from transactions 135,
in Fig. 4(left), without well known dependences: {A,T}, {T,W}, {A,D,T}, and {D,T,W}.
Among these sets, {T,W}⊂{D,T,W} and {A,T}⊂{A,D,T}. This means that neither {T,W}
nor {A,T} are either closed or maximal. However, {A,D,T}⊄ {D,T,W}, so both are
maximal. In transactions 135, while only the frequent set {A,D,T,W} is closed and having a
geographic dependence, two frequent sets {A,D,T} and {D,T,W} are maximal and without
well known geographic dependences.

For generating maximal generalized frequent geographic patterns we propose a two-step
method: (1) elimination of geographic dependences from frequent sets and (2) elimination
of redundant frequent sets from the remaining sets without dependences. Applying this
concept over our example, the maximal frequent sets are shown in the meet-semilattice in
Fig. 4(right). If we compare the meet-semilattice of the closed frequent sets with

Fig. 4 (left) Meet-Semilattice of frequent sets without well known dependences and redundancies and (right)
maximal generalized frequent sets without dependences

dependences shown in Fig. 3(d), and the meet-semilattice in Fig. 4(right), with maximal
frequent sets without dependences, our method takes two main advantages:

a)

b)

although the number of closed frequent sets is lower than the number of maximal
frequent sets, 27% of the closed frequent sets contain geographic dependences, while
maximal sets do not contain any dependence;
closed frequent sets generate larger sets, i.e., with more elements in each set, while our
method generates smaller sets.

3.2 An algorithm for mining maximal generalized frequent geographic patterns

Figure 5 shows the pseudo-code of the algorithm MG-FGP. This algorithm is one
simple way to generate maximal generalized frequent geographic patterns without well
known dependences. Given as the set of pairs of geographic objects with dependences
(e.g. {Island, Water}) called semantic constraints,Ψ as the input dataset, and minsup as
minimum support, well known geographic dependences are removed early, from the
candidate sets with two elements, before even compute their frequency. MG-FGP
removes from the candidate sets all pairs of predicates which have geographic
dependences. As in Apriori, MG-FGP performs multiple passes over the dataset
in
order to generate the set of frequent sets without geographic dependences. In the first
pass, the support of the individual elements is computed to determine 1-predicate sets,
called frequent 1-predicate sets. In the subsequent passes, given k as the number of the
current pass, the large (frequent) sets Lk-1 in the previous pass (k -1) are grouped into sets
Ck with k elements, which are called candidate k-predicate sets. The support of each
candidate set is computed, and if it is equal or higher than minimum support, then this set
is considered frequent. This process continues until the large set in the pass results in an
empty set.

Similarly to [24], which eliminates in the second pass candidates that contain both parent
and child specified in concept hierarchies, we eliminate all candidates which contain
geographic dependences, independently of any concept hierarchy.

The dependences are eliminated in an efficient way, in one step, in the second pass,
when generating candidates with two predicates. According to the anti-monotone property

Geoinformatica (2010) 14:201–220

211

Fig. 5 Pseudo-code of MG-FGP to generate large predicate sets without well known dependences

presented in Assertion1, this step warrants that the pairs of geographic objects with a well
known dependence specified in will neither appear together in the frequent sets nor in the
spatial association rules. This makes the method effective and independent of any threshold
such as minimum support, minimum confidence, lift, etc.

The main strength of this step is its simplicity, since one single but very efficient step
warrants the elimination of the exact well known dependence that generates uninteresting
patterns. Indeed, it can be implemented by any algorithm that generates frequent sets.

Once the frequent sets without dependences have been generated, the algorithm starts the
generalization, for pruning redundant frequent sets. All frequent sets Gk, with size k are
compared to the sets Gk+1 with size k+1. When the set of transactions (tidset) in which Gk
appears is the same set where Gk+1 appears, and the set Gk ⊂ Gk+1, then we can say that Gk

212

Geoinformatica (2010) 14:201–220

is redundant, while Gk+1 is more general. When this occurs, Gk is removed from G. This
process continues until all frequent sets in G are maximal.

Another way to compute maximal generalized frequent geographic patterns without well
known dependences is by first generating closed frequent sets using any existing algorithm,
and then transforming the closed sets into maximal generalized sets.

Property 1 if X’ = X ∪ {a} ∪ {b} is a closed set in Ψ with the geographic dependence ab,
then Y = X ∪ {a} and Z = X ∪ {b} are maximal generalized sets.

Proof if Y is not maximal then M(Y) = Y’ ⊃ Y and Y’ ∩ Y ≠ {b}, because a maximal
itemset cannot contain a geographic dependence. Indeed, Y’ ∩ Y ≠ {} →∃ c 2 Y’ | c ∉ Y.
Since X ⊂ Y ∧ c ∉ Y → c ∉ X, then X’ is not closed, what is a contradiction. Then Y is
maximal. Analogously, for Z.

By using Property 1 we can transform closed frequent sets into maximal generalized
frequent sets easily, without reading the database, by simply comparing each closed
frequent set with the set of geographic dependences. If a closed set does not contain any
dependence, then it is directly a maximal generalized set. If a closed set contains a
dependence, then we apply Property 1 to split the closed set into maximal generalized sets
without dependences.

4 Experiments and evaluation

In order to evaluate the proposed method, experiments were performed with two real
geographic databases. In the first experiment, districts of the city of Porto Alegre were
considered as the target feature type (database table with 109 polygons), and eighteen
relevant spatial feature types were considered, including water resources, hospitals, slums,
streets, gas stations, industrial residues repositories, water collection points, etc. Geographic
data were preprocessed and transformed with the toolkit Weka-GDPM [6]. The depend-
ences between gas stations and streets as well as water resource and water collection points
were eliminated. Different values of minimum support have been considered (5%, 10%,
and 15%), in order to show that the closed frequent set approach does not warrant the
elimination of well known geographic dependences even when the support constraint
changes.

A second experiment was performed considering slums as the target feature type
(database table with 512 polygons) and 23 relevant feature types including streams, cellular
antennas, streets, bus stops, etc. The dependence between bus stops and streets was
eliminated in this experiment. In this dataset, three non-spatial attributes of the target
feature type were considered (presence of treated water network, violence risk level,
presence of sewer network).

A third experiment was performed over a completely different database, which
contains information about vegetation, rivers, soil, roads, etc. This database stores
information of a whole country, not being a metropolitan area as the previous database.
In this experiment 13 spatial predicates were considered, and the dependence between
bridge and river has been eliminated.
In this experiment we considered higher
minimum support (15%, 20%, and 25%) in order to provide an analysis when this
threshold changes. In the following sections we describe the results of the different
experiments.

4.1 Experiment I

Figure 6(left) shows an experiment with the first dataset using Apriori [1] (without
removing dependences), Apriori-KC [3] (removing one pair of geographic dependences),
MG-FGP (eliminating one dependence and redundant frequent sets), and closed frequent
sets (without removing dependences). Both MG-FGP and the closed frequent set approach
reduce the number of patterns in relation to Apriori and Apriori-KC in more than 88%.

Figure 6(right) shows the same experiment with the elimination of two pairs of
geographic dependences. As can be seen, Apriori-KC significantly reduces the number of
patterns in relation to Apriori for different values of minimum support. Although MG-FGP
reduces the total number of frequent sets significantly by removing two dependences, the
number of maximal patterns increases. We analyse this in Fig. 7, which shows the content
of the patterns generated by MG-FGP and the closed frequent set approach.

In Figure 7(left) we evaluate the number of predicate sets in each k-predicate set
generated by MG-FGP and the closed frequent set approach, for minimum support 5%.
Notice that our method generates more maximal frequent sets with less elements, while the
closed frequent set approach tends to generate less sets, but with more elements. In this
the closed frequent pattern approach has generated seven sets with nine

predicates, and one set with ten predicates, while the largest set generated by MG-FGP had
only eight predicates.

In Figure 7(right) we can observe that although the closed frequent set approach
eliminates a large number of frequent sets and generates less sets than MG-FGP, around
50% contain well known dependences. This experiment shows that the closed frequent set
approach reduces the frequent sets but does not eliminate well known geographic
dependences.

The objective of this paper is to eliminate redundant and well known patterns using
semantics, and the focus does not rely on efficiency. Therefore, the algorithms have been
implemented in Matlab, in order to compare their output. Although the emphasis of the
proposed method is related to the pattern itself, the dependence pruning step does not affect
the performance of the algorithm. In this naïve Matlab implementation, the closed sets are
generated after computing all frequent sets, analogously to the MG-MGP. Figure 8 shows
the computational time for this experiment. We can observe that the more dependences are
eliminated, the more efficient MP-FGP is.

4.2 Experiment II

The second experiment was performed over a dataset with 512 rows and with 23
predicates. Although the dataset has more rows, spatial predicates are less frequent, and
therefore less frequent sets were generated. In this experiment, the method proposed in
this paper, MG-FGP, reduced the number of frequent sets without dependences generated
by Apriori-KC in around 60%, as shown in Fig. 9. The number of patterns generated by
MG-FGP is similar to the number generated by the closed frequent patterns.

In Figure 10 we analyse the content of the patterns generated by Apriori and the closed
frequent pattern approach. Although the number of maximal frequent sets and closed
frequent sets is similar in this experiment, Fig. 10 (left) shows the amount of patterns with
the dependence generated by the closed frequent set approach. As can be observed for the
different values of minsup (5%, 10%, and 15%), Apriori generates a large number of
frequent sets, among which around 30% contain the dependence. Although the closed
frequent set approach reduces considerably the number of frequent sets produced by
Apriori, an average of 30% of the closed frequent sets does also contain the geographic
dependence, for any value of minsup.

In Fig. 10 (right) we analyse the number of predicates in each k-predicate set generated
by MG-FGP and the closed frequent sets, for minimum support 5%. Similarly to the
previous experiment, our method generates more maximal frequent sets with less elements,
while the closed frequent set approach tend to generate less closed frequent sets but with
more elements. In this experiment the closed frequent pattern approach has generated eight

only seven elements. Similar results were found for other values of minimum support.

4.3 Experiment III

Figure 11 shows an experiment with a different database, from which a dataset of 13
predicates has been generated. In this experiment we considered higher values of minimum
support, 15%, 20%, and 25%. A lower number of frequent sets (Apriori-KC), closed
frequent sets, and maximal frequent sets (MG-FGP) were generated. However, even with
higher minimum support, the closed frequent set approach still generates several closed
frequent sets containing the dependence. As in many other experiments, Fig. 11 (left) shows
that the number of maximal frequent sets in this experiment is higher than the number of
closed frequent sets. However, Fig. 11 (right) shows that more than 40% of the closed
frequent sets in this dataset contain the well known dependence, for all values of minimum
support.

In general words, the method proposed in this paper, besides removing redundant
frequent sets as the closed frequent set approach does, it warrants the elimination of all

semantic dependences that are a priori known as uninteresting. Concerning well known
geographic dependences and the closed frequent pattern mining approach, we can state that:

&

&
&

any well known dependence that reaches minimum support will appear in at least one
closed frequent itemset;
if the dependence has exactly the minimum support, it will be in only one closed frequent set;
the higher the support of the dependence, the higher is the probability for a dependence
to appear in many closed frequent sets. If a dependence has 100% support, then it will
appear in all closed frequent sets.

5 Conclusions and future work

Geographic data have many well known dependences that in frequent pattern mining
produce a large amount of uninteresting frequent sets and association rules. To address this
problem we have introduced a method that first eliminates all well known dependences by
considering the semantics of the data, and then removes redundancies, generating maximal
generalized frequent sets.

It is known that the closed frequent pattern mining approach significantly reduces the
number of frequent sets, pruning all redundant frequent sets. However, we have shown that
this approach does not eliminate well known patterns. On the contrary, this approach tends
to encapsulate such dependences if they are frequent.

One advantage of our method is that it can be applied to any algorithm that generates
frequent sets using syntactic constraints (lift, improvement, etc). Indeed, non-redundant rules
can be extracted from the resultant maximal generalized frequent sets by any of the different
approaches that have been proposed to extract association rules from closed frequent sets.

Experiments have shown that avoiding the dependence reduces significantly the number

of generated patterns.

In this paper we presented a solution to eliminate well known geographic dependences
in frequent geographic pattern mining considering geographic data at a high granularity
level (e.g. water). However, the dependence replication process increases when mining data
at lower granularities (e.g. Superior lake, Missouri river). As future work we will evaluate
our method considering hierarchical geographic dependences when mining geographic data
at multiple granularity levels.

We will also investigate other aspects in which semantics can be used to improve data
mining. On-going future work is computing maximal generalized frequent patterns directly,
without generating frequent patterns or closed frequent patterns.

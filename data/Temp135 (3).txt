This article describes an open source web‐based visualiza‐

tion  tool  for  exploring  stakeholder  conflicts  in  land‐use 

planning.  It  implements  a  multi‐criteria,  decision‐analytic 

framework  which  solves  a  conflict‐constrained  knapsack 

problem in order to find Pareto efficient combinations of ac‐

tions  which  maximize  public  value,  given  the  conflict  con‐

straint. The user interface is centered around an interactive 

map  in  which  geographical  subareas  are  color‐shaded  in 

proportion to the mean strength of preference for a particu‐

lar chosen action within the population in the selected area. 

The aim of this work is to investigate the use of web tech‐

nologies and formal problem‐solving methods for improving 

public  participation  in  land‐use  planning  and  support  local 

governments  in  the  pursuit  of  improved  decision‐making. 

The tool was developed using the free statistical program‐

ming language R and the web application framework Shiny. 

Its  usefulness  is  demonstrated  through  a  case  study  in 

Upplands Väsby municipality in Stockholm County, Sweden. 

The article ends with a summary together with some ideas 

for future research and development.

Land‐use planning is inherently characterized by conflict in multiple dimensions. It typically involves a wide 

range  of  actors  and  stakeholders,  including  citizens,  local  government,  investors,  non‐governmental  orga‐

nizations, corporate businesses, and professionals with conflicting views and differing preferences that are 

tied to a varied spatial landscape. Land‐use conflicts can emerge over a range of specific but interdependent 

issues, including noise and odor pollution, visual blight, health hazards, nature conservation and biological 

diversity, preservation of historic buildings and landmarks, and changes to the neighborhood (von der Dunk, 

Grêt‐Regamey, Dalang, & Hersperger, 2011). Despite conflict being intrinsically tied to space and place, rel‐

atively few studies have represented land‐use conflicts geographically, and even fewer attempts have been 

made to develop spatial decision support systems (SDSS) to analyze such conflicts. Thus, we posit that there 

is a need to develop new methods and tools to better analyze stakeholder conflicts in land‐use planning. In 

this article, we describe a prototype web‐based SDSS for use by planners and related professionals to ad‐

dress the above mentioned problems.

We researched and developed our tool via a case study of Upplands Väsby municipality. Upplands Väsby is 

situated in the Stockholm‐Mälardalen region in east‐central Sweden, the country’s foremost growth engine. The 

landscape is slightly hilly with wooded heights, fields, and lakes, and with a cultural landscape that dates back to 

medieval times. Upplands Väsby is crossed by the Stockholm–Uppsala railroad and the European route E4 high‐

way running north–south, which give rise to pollution and act as physical barriers with negative effects on mobility 

and residential integration. On the other hand, the vicinity of Stockholm and Arlanda Airport has contributed to a 

growing number of businesses choosing to establish themselves in the area, many of which are in the service sec‐

tor. Similarly to many other suburban municipalities within commuting distance of Stockholm, an overwhelming 

majority of the population live in urban areas, whereas only 1,000 people live in the countryside.

In order to accommodate the needs of a growing population, the Upplands Väsby municipal office has facili‐

tated a process of establishing a new comprehensive plan that provides a vision and strategies that are meant to 

guide  the  development  of  the  municipality  towards  2040  (http://www.upplandsvasby.se/byggapbo‐och‐milijo/

oversiktsplan/overdiktsplan.html). In 2012, the municipal office contacted us to support them in developing their 

comprehensive plan. In particular, they wanted academics who could take a skeptical view, in order to support 

critical thinking and inject creativity into the process. With this role in mind, we decided to focus our efforts on 

analyzing stakeholder conflicts that are always present in land‐use planning. In order to do so, we proceeded in 

two  steps.  First,  we  conducted  a  web  survey  to  elicit  public  preferences  about  the  future  of  Upplands  Väsby. 

Second,  based  on  the  survey  results,  we  developed  a  prototype  SDSS  for  visualizing  and  exploring  the  survey 

results with the aim of enabling public officials, urban developers, and decision‐makers to better understand the 

conflicting needs of the public.

This study contributes to the land‐use planning knowledge base in the form of a proof‐of‐concept pro‐

totype  SDSS  developed  with  the  statistical  programming  language  R  (R  Core  Team,  2017)  and  the  web 

development  framework  Shiny  (Chang,  Cheng,  Allaire,  Xie,  &  McPherson,  2017).  Since  the  Shiny  package 

was first released in 2012, a handful of Shiny web applications have been described in peer‐reviewed re‐

search journals ranging from epidemiology to ecology (Moraga, 2017; Verity et al., 2017). A handful of Shiny 

web  applications  have  also  been  described  in  conference  proceedings  related  to  GIS  (e.g.  Hermawati  & 

Sitanggang, 2016; Jahanshiri & Shariff, 2014). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use 

R and Shiny to develop an SDSS for land‐use planning.

This  article  proceeds  as  follows.  Section  2  discusses  related  work.  Section  3  describes  our  data  collection 

method, data sources, and design methodology. Section 4 describes the decision‐analytic framework implemented 

in the tool. In Section 5 the tool is briefly described and illustrated with real‐world data. Section 6 concludes the 

article by discussing some ideas for future research and development.

Traditional GIS have mainly been sophisticated data‐processing and display systems with weak analytical capabili‐

ties. As a result, these systems cannot support complicated planning decisions that require formal problem‐solv‐

ing techniques. However, with the increasing demands of land‐use planning and new capabilities brought about 

by new hardware and software, a variety of GIS have integrated support for quantitative modeling and analysis 

and  have  become  known  as  planning  support  systems  (PSS)  (Harris,  1989)  or  spatial  decision  support  systems 

(SDSS) (Leung, 1997), which is the preferred term in this study. This section reviews three related state‐of‐the‐art 

SDSS for land‐use planning. For a more comprehensive review of the PSS/SDSS literature, Geertman and Stillwell 

(2009), Geertman, Ferreira, Goodspeed, and Stillwell (2015), and Sugumaran and Degroote (2011) are good start‐

ing points. For a review of the integration between GIS and multi‐criteria decision analysis (MCDA), (Malczewski & 

Rinner, 2015) offer an in‐depth and up‐to‐date standard reference. For a review of the synergy between GIS and 

public participation, we recommend Ramasubramanian (2008).

SoftGIS  is  a  collection  of  methods  and  web‐based  tools  that  aim  to  bridge  the  gap  between  citizens  and 

urban planners by allowing the former to express location‐based experiences (Kahila & Kyttä, 2009). For example, 

planners can study the perceived safety of a neighborhood or experiences concerning the natural environment. 

Through a web form, the respondent marks places on a map that they perceive as unsafe, important, positive, 

negative, etc., in relation to their home location. With the help of a visualization tool called softGISview, planners 

and citizens can explore the survey results. Theoretically and normatively, SoftGIS is grounded in human geog‐

raphy and the critical reflective “GIS and society” discourse, including public participation GIS and participatory 

GIS, which aims to create spatially empowered citizens and serve community interests. SoftGIS is based on PHP, 

MySQL, and MapServer for publishing spatial data and interactive maps to the web, as well as other open source 

technologies and web standards including Apache HTTP Server, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Geo‐questionnaire is a method and a web‐based tool for eliciting public preferences and attitudes about land‐

use planning and development of local services (Jankowski, Czepkiewicz, Mlodkowski, & Zwoliński, 2016). The 

method is based on the softGIS approach and aims to integrate local knowledge in the planning process and sup‐

port wide public participation. Single‐choice, multiple‐choice, and open‐ended questions as well as an interactive 

slider with a neutral/lack‐of‐opinion midpoint and two endpoints labeled “definitely no” and “definitely yes” are 

used for eliciting attitudes and preferences. Some form items are accompanied by an interactive map on which the 

respondent marks a location by a single point, line, or polygon. Answers and map responses are visible to other 

respondents. A reported drawback of the method was that aggregation of map polygons was too computationally 

demanding for the ArcGIS 10.2 (Esri, Redlands, CA) software installed on a standard desktop computer; instead, 

the operation had to be performed on a PostgreSQL database management system using the PostGIS extender. 

Even so, it took 19 hours to complete. As a solution to such performance issues, the authors suggest dividing the 

map into “easily identifiable, relatively homogeneous subareas beforehand, and attributing questions regarding 

their use or preference” (p. 921). This is precisely what we have done in our tool. Apart from PostgreSQL, other 

technologies  used  include  the  Python  programming  language,  the  Django  web  framework,  and  geoDjango  for 

geospatial data processing, JavaScript libraries jQuery and OpenLayers, HTML, and CSS.

MCDA4ArcMap is an add‐in for ArcGIS 10 that combines MCDA with interactive thematic maps to support 

a  visual  exploratory  approach  to  decision‐making  (Rinner  &  Voss,  2013).  The  reasons  for  developing  the  tool, 

according to the authors, are that existing MCDA tools are only loosely coupled with GIS software and that few 

vendors have integrated MCDA functionality in their products. The tool includes three MCDA methods: weighted 

linear combination, ordered weighted averaging, and locally weighted linear combination. The authors promote 

it as open source software, and indeed, it is freely available for download from GitHub. However, since it is an 

add‐in for proprietary software, ArcGIS, it cannot be used without it. MCDA4ArcMap was developed in the C# 

programming language on the Microsoft. NET platform.

3.1 | Data collection

Based  on  workshops  and  interviews  with  public  officials,  documents,  and  a  paper‐based  pilot  survey  (with  100 

respondents), we designed a web survey form using the open source content management system Drupal (https://

www/drupal.org)  and  the  Drupal  Webform  module  (https://www.drupal.org/project/webform)  to  elicit  citizens’ 

preferences about the future of Upplands Väsby. A survey invitation letter was sent by traditional mail to 10,000 

persons  randomly  sampled  from  the  municipal  population  registry  consisting  of  31,408  persons  aged  18  years 

or older. We chose traditional mail over email to reach as many people as possible and to minimize the risk of the 

invitation letter being misinterpreted as spam. The total cost of the survey invitation letter was 50,000 SEK, which 

included printing, handling, and mailing. Participation in the survey was voluntary and anonymous. Approximately 

125 letters were returned because the recipient had moved.

In total, 1,032 respondents participated in the survey, which constitutes a response rate of 10.3%, including 513 

(49.7%) men, 498 (48.3%) women, 18 (1.7%) who preferred not to disclose their gender identity, and 3 (0.3%) who 

identified as other gender. This response rate can be compared to that achieved in a citizen survey conducted the 

same year by Statistics Sweden, which achieved a 37% response, albeit using a different survey methodology and 

mailing two reminders. Due to time constraints and limited resources, we could not address issues of non‐response, 

for example by sending reminders. The survey was open between January and March 2015. In sum, the response rate 

suggests that the form was relatively easy to use, despite being cognitively demanding on the part of the respondent.

The form consisted of 20 items divided into four parts. The first part consisted of 10 items that concerned the 

following focus areas (often called objectives or criteria in the MCDA literature; Belton & Stewart, 2002): (1) parks 

and green spaces; (2) diversity in housing supply; (3) investment in public spaces; (4) communications; (5) culture 

and leisure; (6) education; (7) care; (8) school; (9) safety; and (10) ecological sustainability. Each focus area was 

associated with five unique actions (non‐mutually exclusive alternatives) that the respondent was asked to rank 

using an interactive horizontal slider; see Figure 1.

The  slider  was  developed  especially  for  this  survey  and  was  based  on  the  jQuery  UI  slider  widget  

(https://jqueryul.com/slider/). The slider has five handles, one for each action, that can be moved with the mouse 

along a horizontal 15‐point Likert‐type ranking scale consisting of a midpoint indicated by a tick mark and bipolar 

endpoints: seven steps on the left and seven steps on the right. When a handle is dragged, the space between the 

midpoint and the handle is filled with a color gradient—red (left) or green (right) depending on which side of the 

midpoint the handle is dragged—to visualize the relative strength of preference from the midpoint for that partic‐

ular action. The respondent could iteratively adjust the position of each handle until satisfied with the position of 

each action along the scale. Instead of providing numbers and tick marks along the axis of the slider, a semantic 

expression indicates the relative strengths of preference for each action:

1.  are  equally  good;

2.  is slightly better than;

3.  is better than;

4.  is distinctly better than;

5.  is much better than;

6.  is much much better than;

7. 

is extremely much better than; or

8.  is extremely much better than (+).

The first semantic expression, “are equally good”, is the default expression of the slider. It is visible when all han‐

dles are in the same position regardless of where along the axis (i.e. not necessarily the midpoint). If two or more, but

F I G U R E   1  Slider with multiple handles used in the form for measuring the relative strength of preference of 
each action

not all five, handles are overlapping, it implies that they are equally good, although this is not explicitly expressed 

semantically. For example, in the expression “1a, 1b, 1c is better than 1d, 1e” it is implied that the actions on the left‐

hand side (1a, 1b, and 1c) are equally good, and that the actions on the right‐hand side (1d and 1e) are equally good.

The second part consisted of one item for which the respondent was asked to estimate the relative importance 

of each focus area using a second type of interactive horizontal slider with multiple handles. As the respondent 

moved a handle to adjust the importance of a particular focus area, a blue color gradient ranging from weak to 

strong hue visualized its importance.

The  third  part  consisted  of  three  items  in  which  the  respondent  was  asked  to  state  a  preference  between 

two conflicting (either/or) actions. This part of the survey has not yet been implemented in the tool, so it is not 

discussed further.

In the fourth and last part of the form, we asked respondents about their demographic profile, including in 

which geographical subarea (neighborhood) they live, their highest level of educational attainment, occupation, 

length of residency, age, and gender.

We anticipated that the web survey form, in particular the slider widget, would raise questions among those 

with insufficient level of digital literacy. We therefore included an instructional video on how to use the slider for 

each item in the form that used it as an input method. We also provided technical support for the form via email. 

We received 57 emails in total, most containing questions regarding the usability of the slider widget. Some of 

them requested a traditional pen and paper form as a complement to the web form. This underlines the impor‐

tance of affordance and an intuitive interface design that provides visual cues that clearly communicate intended 

functionality and help lead to a positive user experience.

Although the Web survey was but a means to an end in this work and survey validity is beyond the scope of this 

article, it is interesting to note that the survey results suggest that our slider did not exhibit any clear tendencies 

to produce inaccurate or false responses. For example, we believe that the central tendency bias, which occurs 

when respondents avoid marking extreme responses on a scale, was negligible. For brevity, we will not provide 

any support for this claim here; instead we encourage the reader to explore the tool and the data on their own.

3.2 | Data sources

The survey result is the first data source used in the tool. The second data source is geospatial vector data 

of  Upplands  Väsby  municipality  and  its  geographical  subareas.  We  obtained  these  data  in  the  proprietary 
MapInfo TAB file format from the GIS experts at the municipal office and read it into R with the rgdal pack‐
age. As planning at the local government level often calls for a more detailed geographical breakdown than 

that of the municipality, Statistics Sweden has developed the key code system (Nyckelkodsystemet, NYKO) 

for reporting statistics in subareas or neighborhoods within a municipality (https://www.scb.se/vara‐tjanster/

regionala‐statistikprodukter/fardiga‐tabellpaket/nyckelkodsystemnet.nyko/). The key code system has a hi‐

erarchical  structure  composed  of  several  levels  in  which  smaller  homogeneous  areas  can  be  aggregated  to 

form larger areas. In this work, we decided to use NYKO level three, which contains 44 subareas of Upplands 

Väsby municipality with names that we thought were easily recognizable, while at the same time large enough 

to ensure the privacy of respondents. The survey data was anonymized before being made publicly available.

3.3 | Design methodology

We  adopted  an  agile  design  methodology  consisting  of  prototyping,  testing,  analyzing,  and  piecemeal  refine‐

ment. During the initial design phase we produced various prototypes using Balsamiq Mockups (https://balsamiq.

com), an application development tool for creating sketch‐style website wireframes using pre‐built widgets in a 

drag‐and‐drop editor. This enabled us to explore alternative user interfaces and high‐level features of the tool. In 

parallel to rapid prototyping, we carried out a review of the literature to gather information on the state‐of‐the‐

art research and tools. For example, one source of inspiration was the research behind OECD Explorer (https://

stats.oecd.org/OECDregionalstatistics/), a web application for dynamic visualization of official statistics built with 

Adobe Flash and ActionScript. We also participated in workshops with public officials to learn about their needs 

and requirements, conducted interviews with GIS experts at Statistics Sweden, and performed usage scenarios 

and cognitive walkthroughs with students to test and get feedback on prototypes.

After the initial  design phase, we started developing the  tool using R (R Core Team, 2017), a programming 

language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, and Shiny (Chang et al., 2017), a web application 

framework for R designed for dynamic user interfaces and interactive visualizations. Shiny comes with a set of 

pre‐built widgets, interactive elements such as checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus that allow users 

to interact with the application, input data, and manipulate variables and plots. Unlike other web development 

frameworks,  Shiny  only  requires  previous  experience  with  R:  no  knowledge  in  web  development  technologies 

such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is needed. This makes Shiny particularly suitable for statisticians and other pro‐

fessionals who may be familiar with R, but have no previous experience in web development.

We describe a decision‐analytic framework for structuring, evaluating, and analyzing stakeholder conflicts. This 

section is brief; for more details on each respective method and concept, we refer the reader to the references 

provided in the text.

4.1 | Overview

The framework consists of three parts. First, the stakeholders (1) state their preferences regarding the actions 

over a set of criteria, and (2) estimate the relative importance weight of each criterion. Second, (1) a conflict index 

and  a  performance  score  for  each  action  are  calculated,  and  (2)  a  set  of  Pareto  efficient  portfolios  (combina‐

tions) of actions are generated constrained by a conflict measure. Third, the tool is used to interactively explore 

BOHMAN ANd FASTH    |  7

stakeholders’ preferences regarding the actions. We use two preference elicitation methods based on cardinal 

ranking (i.e. a ranking where the strength of preference (cardinality) between each pair of elements is admissible). 

First, we describe cardinal ranking (CAR) used for eliciting criteria weights. Second, we describe CAR for conflict 

evaluations (CAR‐CE) which is used for eliciting both an action’s performance against a criterion and its perfor‐

mance relative to a do nothing action. Both these methods were implemented as jQuery UI sliders; see Figure 1 

for the implementation of CAR‐CE. The use of sliders such as these forces a respondent to express consistent 
rankings, that is, it is not possible to express preference relations such as A ≻ B ∧ B ≻ C ∧ C ≻ A, as it would violate 
the property of transitivity of preference.

4.1.1 | Cardinal ranking for weights elicitation

The CAR method (Danielson, Ekenberg, & He, 2014; Danielson & Ekenberg, 2016) utilizes the simplicity of an ordi‐

nal ranking but extends the ranking with strength of preference steps between each pair of criteria. The strength 
of preference is denoted by ≻

i where i is the number of steps between two criteria. These steps can be expressed 

using semantic labels such as:

∼0 equally important, 0 steps;
≻

1 slightly more important, 1 step;
2 more important, 2 steps; and
3 much more important, 3 steps.

≻

≻

To give a brief example, let G = {G1, G2, G3} be a set of three criteria. A cardinal ranking of the criteria could then 
3 G3, which translates to the following statement: criterion G1 is slightly more important 
be expressed as G1
than criterion G2, which is much more important than criterion G3. The preference statements are then transformed 
into weights (for details, see Danielson et al., 2014 and Danielson and Ekenberg (2016)).

1 G2

≻

≻

4.1.2 | Cardinal ranking for conflict evaluations

The CAR‐CE method (Fasth, Larsson, Ekenberg, & Danielson, 2018) is an application of CAR in which a do nothing 
action A𝛼 is added to the ranking. This enables a decision‐maker to state whether the performance of an action is 
negative or positive relative to the do nothing action. For example, let A = {A1, A2, A3} be a set of three actions eval‐
uated against criterion G1. Assume that the decision‐maker first ranks the actions as A1
2 A3. The decision‐
maker then inserts the do nothing action A𝛼 into the ranking between A2 and A3 which gives the CAR‐CE ranking 
1 A3. Using semantic labels, the ranking can be interpreted as A1 is better than A2, which is slightly 
A1
better than A𝛼, which is slightly better than A3. Actions A1 and A2 are positive relative to A𝛼, whereas A3 is negative 
relative to A𝛼. CAR‐CE preference statements are transformed into scores (for details, see Fasth et al., 2018).

4.2 | Conflict analysis

Conflict can be studied formally using methods of conflict analysis, and various methods, algorithms, and com‐

puter software have been reported in the literature. We have based our approach to conflict analysis on Beinat 

(2001) who specifies four objectives for conflict analysis: (1) determine whether there is conflict between stake‐

holders; (2) identify which stakeholders are in conflict; (3) measure the degree of conflict; and (4) provide infor‐

mation to manage the conflicts and support negotiation. Our framework implements two methods for analyzing 

conflicts.  First,  it  utilizes  two  conflict  indices:  (1)  a  within‐group  conflict  index  for  measuring  conflict  within  a 

stakeholder group; and (2) a between‐group conflict index for measuring conflict between two stakeholder groups 

(Fasth et al., 2018). Second, it solves a portfolio optimization problem multiple times with different levels of the 

BOHMAN ANd FASTH8  |    

conflict index as the constraining resource in order to analyze how a change in conflict affects the portfolio com‐

position.  Formally  it  solves  a  0–1  knapsack  optimization  problem  (Martello  &  Toth,  1990)  where  the  objective 

function is to maximize the overall portfolio value using the conflict index as a resource constraint B:

subject to

x ∈ {0,1}, j = 1, … , n.

The  knapsack  optimization  problem  is  a  problem  of  combinatorial  optimization.  The  name  is  derived  from  the 

problem faced by a person who is interested in filling a knapsack of fixed size with items, each with a set of two 

attributes: a value that quantifies the level of importance of the item, and a volume. Since the knapsack is of fixed 

size, the problem is to figure out how to fill it with the optimal combination of items that yields the highest total 
value. The stakeholders’ overall or aggregated value W(Aj) of an action Aj is given by 

W(Aj) = ∑
k
k is a stakeholder scaling constant (given that 𝜆
≤ 1 and ∑i wk

where 𝜆
i  is stakeholder k’s weight (scaling 
constant) for criterion i (given that 0 ≤ wk
ij is stakeholder k’s performance score of action 
i
j against criterion i. An action’s associated conflict index is denoted by dj, a binary decision variable xj is used to 
state whether an action is included or excluded from the portfolio, and B is the resource constraint, that is, the 

k ≥ 0 and ∑
i = 1), and vk

k = 1), wk

 To generate the front of efficient portfolios, we follow the same approach as in Fasth, Larsson, & Kalinina 

(2016) and Lourenço, Morton, and Bana e Costa (2012) where the problem is solved multiple times using different 

levels of the resource constraint B. In the first iteration B is set to the sum of all actions’ conflict indices, and in the 

following iterations the value of B is reduced by a small number.

In the wake of the European migrant crisis of 2015, immigration and integration of migrants became a major policy 

issue in the Swedish general election held on 9 September 2018. In Upplands Väsby municipality, the nationalist 

Sweden Democrats party gained 12.9% of the vote, up from 6.3% in the previous election of 2014, and became 

the third largest party, reflecting the national result. Against this political background, we illustrate the functional‐

ity of the tool. The application user interface consists of three pages and a top‐level navigation bar with the title 

“Upplands Väsby Data Explorer”. The main page titled “Map” is composed of (from top left to bottom right): (1) a 

menu, (2) a choropleth map, (3) two demographics panels, (4) a tabset panel for details (frequency, value, distance, 

and Pareto plots), and (5) a tabset panel with tables for portfolio details; see Figure 2.

The map widget positioned in the center of the page consists of two layers. The bottom layer is the standard 

tile  layer  of  OpenStreetMap  (https://www.openstreetmap.org),  an  open  source  and  free  general‐purpose  map 

of the world built by a community of volunteers. The second layer is a semi‐transparent choropleth map where 

each geographical subarea is indicated by a polygon. The map polygons are color‐shaded using the color palette 

in proportion to the mean strength of preference for the selected action within the population in the selected 

geographical subareas (i.e. group 1 or group 2). Hovering the mouse over any of the map markers displays a tooltip 

with the subarea name and the group’s mean strength of preference for the selected action: in our case, 10.38 for

areas is available in the top right‐hand corner. In the bottom right‐hand corner, a mini‐map provides geographical 

context relative to the map.

From the menu the user makes all selections and filtering decisions that drive the data analysis. The menu has 

three tabs: “Start”, “G1”, and “G2”. G1 and G2 stand for group 1 and group 2, respectively. They are user‐defined 

groups of survey respondents that the user wants to contrast and analyze. Throughout the application, group 1 

and group 2 are represented by the color steel blue and fire brick, respectively, whereas the total group, denoted 

“T”, is represented by the color dark slate blue. Choices made on the Start tab are high‐level choices that affect 

both groups, whereas choices made on the G1 and G2 tabs only affect the respective group. Since color can have 

a great impact on how people perceive a data display, we have provided a select list with nine different diverging 

color palettes developed especially for thematic maps. The palettes are listed in the “Color Palette” dropdown 

menu and include six that are suitable for color‐blind users. The choice of color palette from this select list affects 

not only the choropleth map but also the data table on page “Table”.

We begin our analysis on the Start tab where we leave the default selections (i.e. the focus area set to the first 

on the list, “parks and green spaces”). Next, on the G1 (group 1) tab, we select eight geographical subareas with 

the highest proportion (roughly 20%) of non‐Swedish citizens. On the G2 (group 2) tab, we select five subareas 

with the lowest proportion (roughly 5%) of non‐Swedish citizens. Once we have made our menu selections, the 

data are analyzed and the results shown on the various data displays. Starting with the choropleth map, we can see 

clear spatial patterns of residential segregation. The geographical subareas with a high proportion of non‐Swedish 

citizens (group 1) are located in or near the city center and to the west of route E4, whereas the subareas with the 

lowest proportion of non‐Swedish citizens (group 2) are located further away from the city center and to the east 

of route E4. We also see that the subareas in group 1 are located next to or near the highway and the railway (they 

are sandwiched between them), whereas the subareas in group 2 are located further away from heavy traffic. 

Furthermore, two subareas in group 2 are located by Lake Norrviken, which is indicative of residential areas with 

higher socioeconomic status. In sum, the map highlights patterns of ethnic residential segregation and socioeco‐

nomic disparities in environmental hazard exposures such as noise and air pollution.

The demographic characteristics of group 1 and group 2 are shown in two panels below the choropleth map in 

Figure 2. The demographic plots are for gender, age, length of residency, occupation, and education level attain‐

ment. As can be seen, the gender distribution is equal overall, with a slight over‐representation of women in group 

1 and men in group 2. The age plot shows that the respondents are overwhelmingly middle‐aged (35–44, 45–54, 

55–64) or senior citizens (65+). Turning to the plot for length of residency, we see that a vast majority of the re‐

spondents have lived in Upplands Väsby between 5 and 9 years. Next, the occupation plot shows that a majority of 

the respondents are employed, while the second largest group identify as senior citizens, which corroborates the 

results observed in the age plot. Finally, the education plot shows that university education is the most common 

type, with high school being the second most common. On closer inspection, the occupation and education plots 

suggest there is a difference in levels of employment and university education attainment, lending further support 

to our hypothesis of a socioeconomic disparity between groups 1 and 2.

In Figure 3, the frequency plots for all five actions a–e (columns 1–5) under focus area 1 “parks and green 

spaces” are shown for group 1 (row 1), group 2 (row 2), and group T (row 3). The plots exhibit unique patterns of 

preference for each action. Beginning with column 1, the preference distribution for action a (“preserve existing 

large green spaces”) is left skewed with an accentuation at the default value 7 and a sharp spike at the maximum 

value 14. The shape of the plots for action b (“build parks in existing urban districts”) in column 2 reveals a different 

type of preferential pattern which is fairly symmetrical and bell‐shaped. In column 3, the plots for action c (“build 

homes close to green areas”) display a type of multimodal distribution with a bell‐shaped major mode around 8 

and two minor modes at each end, suggesting an action with conflict. In column 4, the plot shapes of action d 

(“renovate existing parks”) resemble a left‐skewed half‐normal distribution with a spike at the maximum value 14,

suggesting an action with little conflict. Finally, in column 5, the plots for action e (“improve accessibility to major 

green spaces”) are similar to those for action d, although the midpoint value of 7 is much more prominent.

Figure 4 presents value (column 1), distance (column 2), and Pareto (column 3) plots for group 1 (row 1), group 

2 (row 2), and  group  T (row 3). Beginning with the value plots in the first column, the bars indicate the stake‐

holders’ overall value for each of the actions a–e calculated by Equation 2. As can be seen, all three groups have 

strongest preference for action a followed by action d. Groups 1 and T have third strongest preference for action 

b, followed by actions e and c. Group 2, on the other hand, has third strongest preference for action c, followed 

by action b and e. Next, the bar plots in column 2 show the distance or conflict for each group. The distances for 

groups 1 and 2 are based on the within‐group conflict index, whereas the distances for group T are based on the 

between‐group conflict index. As can be seen, the action with the lowest within‐group conflict for group 1 is ac‐

tion e, followed by actions d, b, c, and a. The bar plot for group 2 is completely different, with action d having the 

lowest conflict, followed by actions e, a, b, and c. For group T, using the between‐group conflict index, action b 

has the lowest conflict, followed by actions d, e, c, and a. The third and last column shows the Pareto plots which 

highlight the tradeoffs between value and conflict and show which portfolios are Pareto efficient. This, in turn, 

enables a decision‐maker to investigate how the portfolio composition (i.e. the combination of actions) changes 

as the conflict increases or decreases. Hovering the mouse over a point in any of the Pareto plots gives detailed 

information about that particular portfolio.

Further  details  of  the  composition  of  the  Pareto  efficient  portfolios  are  presented  in  Figure  5.  To  repeat, 

column a–e indicate if the action is present (1) or not present (0) in the portfolio. The left‐hand table shows the 

portfolios for group 1. Here we see that action d is included in 9 out of 11 portfolios (excluding the empty portfolio 

on the last row in the table) which is approximately equal to 82%, followed by action e which is included in 73% 

of the portfolios, action b in 55%, action a in 45%, and action c in 18% of the portfolios. The middle table shows 

the portfolios for group 2. Here, action d is included in 10 out of 11 or 91% of the portfolios (again, excluding 

the empty portfolio). This is followed by action a which is included in 82% of the portfolios, action e in 45%, and 

finally actions b and c which can each be found in 36% of the portfolios. Note that the least preferred action, 

c, is the same for groups 1 and 2. The results of the combined group T are shown in the right‐hand table. Here, 

actions b and d are included in 6 out of 7 or 86% of the portfolios. This is followed by action e which is included 

in 57% of the portfolios, and finally action a and c which are both found in 29% of the portfolios. In sum, the least 

conflict‐prone action is d (“renovate existing parks”), while the most conflict prone action is c (“build homes close 

to green spaces”). At this point in the analysis, a decision may be taken based on what has been uncovered with 

the tool so far, or perhaps further investigation into the most conflict‐prone actions may be warranted, depending 

on the context.

In  this  article,  we  have  presented  a  prototype  tool  for  visualizing  and  exploring  stakeholder  conflicts  in  land‐

use planning. The tool implements a novel decision‐analytic framework for structuring, evaluating, and analyzing 

stakeholder conflicts. It utilizes two new indices for measuring conflict within and between stakeholder groups. 

The optimization algorithm finds Pareto efficient portfolios, and the corresponding visualizations enable a deci‐

sion‐maker to investigate how the portfolio composition changes as the conflict increases or decreases. The tool 

was implemented as an R Shiny web application that can run on any modern browser, desktop or mobile, and does 

not  require  the  installation  of  a  plug‐in  or  additional  software.  Public  administrators,  planners,  and  politicians 

should be able to account for the information revealed by the application in municipal land‐use planning and city 

development,  thereby  enabling  better‐informed  decisions  and  strengthening  local  democracy.  We  believe  our 

web‐based tool has the potential to alleviate some of the barriers and limitations associated with traditional meth‐

ods of community engagement in land‐use planning, such as town‐hall meetings and charrettes, including lack of

deliberation, distance and time constraints, issues of scale, and high costs. However, the continuing presence of 

the the digital divide reminds us that it is easy to overestimate the benefits of web technology. A great benefit of 

our tool, compared to many other prototypes developed in academia that usually rely on proprietary software, is 

that it is open source. This guarantees public access to the source code for audit, modification, and redistribution 

without additional cost, which in the end encourages community participation and further development.

A benefit of MCDA as an approach to problem structuring and a tool for decision analysis is that it resembles 

how humans intuitively make decisions by analyzing the positive and negative aspects of the alternatives under 

consideration (Figueira, Greco, & Ehrogott, 2005). Therefore, it is a natural and simple approach to problem‐solv‐

ing and decision‐making, which is a strength. An application area that takes advantage of the benefits of MCDA 

is the GIS‐MCDA community. However, one might object that MCDA is too simplistic, since it provides a static 

view or “snapshot” of the current state of the world (i.e. the stakeholders’ current preferences and potentially con‐

flict‐prone actions). An alternative approach would be to develop a system that takes changing preferences into 

account, for example, a dynamic simulation model that simulates a set of future land‐use scenarios in which the 

actions are evaluated, or by adding scenario planning to the current approach, which would enable the generation 

of a set of future scenarios under which the actions could be evaluated (see, for example, Montibeller, Gummer, & 

Tumidei, 2006). However, these two alternative approaches were not part of the initial problem definition and the 

defined requirements, and the artifact was therefore not developed to fulfill them.

6.1 | Future research

Much work remains to be done in order to move this tool from a prototype proof‐of‐concept to a more mature 

production system. We conclude this section with a discussion of three ideas for future research and develop‐

ment. First, the tool needs to be made more flexible to accommodate the different needs of the user. Integrating 

support for all 290 municipalities in Sweden is an obvious first step. Currently the tool uses the NYKO system for 

the municipal subdivisions of Upplands Väsby. However, NYKO data sets are not publicly accessible, but owned by 

the municipalities, and may only be used with their permission. Furthermore, the NYKO system was established at 

the beginning of the 1970s and is becoming increasingly outdated. Fortunately, Statistics Sweden has developed 

a new nationwide geospatial data classification called DeSO (Demografiska statistikområden) which was released 

as open data on January 1, 2018. A second step would be to include additional map layers and data sources, such 

as  income,  political  party  preference,  air  quality,  or  emissions  statistics.  Integrating  support  for  other  levels  of 

government beyond the local level would be another step in this direction.

Second, the web survey form should be integrated with the visualization tool. At the time of writing, they are 

separate systems and built with different technologies: the former with Drupal and the latter with Shiny. Both of 

these web frameworks are free and open source, but they are also quite different as they serve different needs. 

Furthermore, they are not interoperable. Another potential problem with Shiny is that its open source server has 

limited security and authentication features, which are likely to be important elements in building user trust in 

the tool. Among the many possible options that we are currently investigating, the Python programming language 

is particularly interesting since it is general‐purpose and offers both web development with frameworks such as 

Django and scientific computing with libraries such as SciPy and Pandas.

Third, the slider widget needs to be systematically evaluated in a controlled environment to ensure its validity 

and reliability as an instrument for measuring preference. The slider can be compared to a visual analog (continu‐

ous) scale, which, in general, is a validated instrument for interval measurement. However, the majority of studies 

have been conducted in medicine and psychology, especially in pain, fatigue, and anxiety research, and compar‐

atively few in social survey research, except perhaps marketing. The slider widget, the form, and the underlying 

CAR preference elicitation method were developed in parallel, which resulted in the slider implementation of CAR 

being somewhat unpolished; this likely made it more cognitively demanding for some of the respondents than 

BOHMAN ANd FASTH16  |    

cues.

necessary. In hindsight, we probably should have included a sixth, “do nothing” action, and a separate checkbox 

next to the slider to indicate no preference. Other interesting points for future research include investigating the 

effect of measurement resolution (the number of discrete points along the scale), the length of the scale, the use 

of semantic expressions (verbal descriptors), and the use of color gradients as a means of providing affordance 

Fourth, the visualization tool could implement support for social media interaction. This would enable users to 

share opinions and interesting insights, and to discuss the results for an improved understanding of their commu‐

nities and potential areas of conflict.

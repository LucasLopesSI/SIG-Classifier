Computational approaches do little to recognize the evolution that occurs at the conceptual level during the research process. This can result in misunderstanding between knowledge producers and consumers and so inhibit the reusability of outcomes. In this article, we describe how changes at the conceptual level can be represented, along with related changes to data and methods, and how appropriate connections between these various artefacts can be maintained. To demonstrate these ideas, we show how categories used in remote sensing and land cover analysis change over time and how these changes are linked to various research activities. We present a new system (called AdvoCate) that augments typical GIS and remote sensing functionality with a conceptual model of categories that can undergo change, and that also captures the cause of conceptual change and its extent. We argue that concepts and categories should be represented explicitly and richly within GIS, because without this, we have a poor idea of what our modeled entities really mean, and by implication how they should be used appropriately. We demonstrate the usefulness of this deeper representation using examples of category evolution from a land cover mapping exercise. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"classification; GIS; land cover; mapping; model; remote sensing; research",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082917463

Although crowdsourced geospatial data applications have been demonstrated to be valuable tools for gathering real-time disaster situation information, they only provide limited utility for disaster response coordination because of the lack of semantic compatibility and interoperability. To help overcome the semantic incompatibility and heterogeneity problems, we use Geospatial Semantic Web (GSW) technologies. We then combine GSW technologies with Web Feature Service requests to access multiple servers. However, a GSW-based geographic information system often has poor performance due to the complex geometric computations required. The objective of this research is to explore how to use optimization techniques to improve the performance of an interoperable geographic situation-awareness system (IGSAS) based on GSW technologies for disaster response. We conducted experiments to evaluate various client-side optimization techniques for improving the performance of an IGSAS prototype for flood disaster response in New Haven, Connecticut. Our experimental results show that the developed prototype can greatly reduce the runtime costs of geospatial semantic queries through on-the-fly spatial indexing, tile-based rendering, efficient algorithms for spatial join, and caching, especially for those spatial-join geospatial queries that involve a large number of spatial features and heavy geometric computation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"algorithm; crowdsourcing; disaster management; flood; GIS; heterogeneity; optimization; performance assessment; real time; spatial data; Connecticut; New Haven; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079715450

Although topological relations between directed lines and other types of spatial objects, such as regions and bodies, have been widely investigated, few studies have focused on the topological relations between directed lines and directed regions. This research focuses on the representation and application of directed line–directed region (DLDR) topological relations, and may contribute to spatial querying and spatial analyses related to directed spatial objects or time-varying objects. Compared with other topological relation models, a DLDR model that considers the starting and ending points of the directed line and the front and back faces of directed regions is proposed in this research to describe the topological relations between directed lines and directed regions. DLDR topological relations are presented, the completeness of the 111 DLDR topological relations is proved, and the topological relations based on the 9-intersection model (9IM), 9+-intersection model (9+-IM), and DLDR model are compared. The formalism of the DLDR model and the corresponding geometric interpretations of the 111 DLDR topological relations are presented, seven propositions are stated to prove the completeness of the 111 DLDR topological relations, and the case study shows that more detailed topological relation information can be obtained based on the DLDR model. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"comparative study; geometry; GIS; spatial analysis; topology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079707923

For instance, agents (pedestrians) are often guided via unrealistic detours around places without clear paths (e.g., squares) or if there are vertical constraints such as overpasses/bridges. This is partly explained by the fact that the main sources of navigation networks in current outdoor navigation are two-dimensional road/street networks. Utilizing a three-dimensional space-based navigation model, compatible with some indoor approaches, is a popular way to address the above-mentioned issues. A 3D space-based navigation model is generated by treating 3D spaces as nodes and the shared faces as edges. Inputs of this model are enclosed 3D spaces (volumes). However, outdoor spaces are generally open and unbounded. This article puts forward an approach to enclose outdoor spaces and mimic the indoor environments to derive a network based on connectivity and accessibility of spaces. The approach uses 2.5D maps and consists of three major steps: object footprint determination, footprint classification and space creation. Two use cases demonstrate the proposed approach. Enclosing outdoor spaces opens a new research direction toward providing seamless indoor/outdoor navigation for a range of agents. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"GIS; map; navigation; pedestrian; road",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078949274

We focus on two key issues in active mobile phone data—systematic gaps in tracking records and positioning uncertainty—and investigate their effects on human mobility pattern analyses. To address gaps in records, we develop an imputation strategy that utilizes local environment information, such as parcel boundaries, and recording time intervals. We evaluate the performance of the proposed imputation strategy by comparing raw versus imputed data with participants’ online survey responses. The results indicate that imputed data are superior to raw data in identifying individuals’ frequently visited places on a weekly basis. To assess the location accuracy of active mobile phone data, we investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of the positional uncertainty of each record and examine via Monte Carlo simulation how inaccurate location information might affect human mobility pattern indicators. Results suggest that the level of uncertainty varies as a function of time of day and the type of land use at which the position was determined, both of which are closely related to the location technology used to determine the location. Our study highlights the importance of understanding and addressing limitations of mobile phone derived positioning data prior to their use in human mobility studies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"data quality; GPS; Internet; mobile phone; mobility; Monte Carlo analysis; sampling; spatial analysis; tracking; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078671481

However, solar radiation is usually influenced by three groups of dynamic factors: sun–earth position, terrain, and atmospheric effects. Therefore, an integrated approach to accurately consider the impacts of those dynamic factors on solar radiation is essential to estimate solar radiation over rugged terrain. In this study, a spatial and temporal gap-filling algorithm was proposed to obtain a seamless daily MODIS albedo dataset. A 1 km-resolution digital elevation model was used to model the impact of local topography and shading by surrounding terrain on solar radiation. A sunshine-based model was adopted to simulate radiation under the influence of clouds. A GIS-based solar radiation model that incorporates albedo, shading by surrounding terrain, and variations in cloudiness was used to address the spatial variability of these factors in mountainous terrain. Compared with other independent solar radiation products, our model generated a more reliable solar radiation product over rugged terrain, with an R2 of 0.88 and an RMSE of 2.55 MJ m−2 day−1. The improved solar radiation products and open source app can be used further in practice or scientific research. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"albedo; data set; digital elevation model; GIS; MODIS; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078069097

In this article, a new workflow is introduced, consisting of a segmentation step and a vectorization step to acquire high-quality polygon representations of building footprints from the Siegfried map series. For segmentation, an ensemble of U-Nets is trained, yielding pixel-based predictions with an average intersection over union of 88.2% and an average precision of 98.55%. For vectorization, methods based on contour tracing and orientation-based clustering are proposed to approximate idealized polygonal representations. The workflow has been tested on 10 randomly selected map sheets from the Siegfried map, showing that the time required to manually correct these polygons drops to about 45 min per map sheet. Of this sample, approximately 10% of buildings required manual corrections.

Available PTG methods are based on homogeneous space, while the network space is typically heterogeneous, which constrains individuals to the network. Therefore, the PTG of the network must consider the geographic network. Based on this, we put forward a method for calculating the encounter probability of objects that are moving in a network by considering network constraints on movement. These constraints not only restrict the space-time accessibility of the moving objects, but also affect the probability of them visiting locations or encountering other objects in space and time. Therefore, in network space, our method improves measures of the likelihood of encounters between moving objects, thereby enabling more accurate predictions of encounter events and their probabilities. Finally, the performance of the method is experimentally evaluated. In the experiment, campus road network data and simulated trip data are used to calculate the encounter probabilities of two moving objects and to determine when and where two moving objects meet with the highest probability. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"GIS; heterogeneity; historical geography; movement; network analysis; prediction; probability",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077910078

The quality of the extracted results relies on the geometrical shape, spatial tessellation, and placement of the grids in the DEM structure. The traditional DEM structure consists of square grids with an eight-neighborhood relationship, where there is an inconsistent distance measurement between orthogonal neighborhoods and diagonal neighborhoods. The directional difference results in the extracted VLs by the D8 algorithm not guaranteeing isotropy characteristics. Alternatively, hexagonal grids have been proved to be advantageous over square grids due to their consistent connectivity, isotropy of local neighborhoods, higher symmetry, increased compactness, and more. Considering the merits above, this study develops an approach to VL extraction from DEMs based on hexagonal grids. First, the pre-process phase contains the depression filling, flow direction calculation, and flow accumulation calculation based on the six-neighborhood relationship. Then, the flow arcs are connected, followed by estimating the flow direction. Finally, the connected paths are organized into a tree structure. To explore the effectiveness of hexagonal grids, comparative experiments are implemented against traditional DEMs with square grids using three sample regions. By analyzing the results between these two grid structures via visual and quantitative comparison, we conclude that the hexagonal grid structure has an outstanding ability in maintaining the location accuracy and bending characteristics of extracted valley networks. That is to say, the DEM-derived VLs based on hexagonal grids have better spatial agreement with mapped river systems and lower shape diversion under the same resolution representation. Therefore, the DEMs with hexagonal grids can extract finer valley networks with the same data volume relative to traditional DEM. © 2020 The Authors.

In urban growth models such as cellular automata (CA), time has typically been defined as a sequence of discrete time steps. However, most urban growth processes such as land-use changes are asynchronous. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of various temporal dynamics scenarios on urban growth simulation, in terms of urban land-use planning, and to introduce an asynchronous parcel-based cellular automata (AParCA) model. In this study, eight different scenarios were generated to investigate the impact of temporal dynamics on CA-based urban growth models, and their outputs were evaluated using various urban planning indicators. The obtained results show that different degrees of temporal dynamics lead to various patterns appearing in urban growth CA models, and the application of asynchronous (event-driven) CA models achieves better simulation results than synchronous models. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"cellular automaton; GIS; growth modeling; land use change; land use planning; temporal analysis; urban growth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076162034

In mapping practice, however, we often face situations when only small sample data are available. In this article, we present a semi-supervised machine learning approach for predictive mapping in which the natural aggregation (clustering) patterns of environmental covariate data are used to supplement limited samples in prediction. This approach was applied to two soil mapping case studies. Compared with field sample only approaches (decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines), maps using the proposed approach can better capture the spatial variation of soil types and achieve higher accuracy with limited samples. A cross validation shows further that the proposed approach is less sensitive to the specific field sample set used and thus more robust when field sample data are small. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"mapping; prediction; soil type; spatial variation; supervised learning",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076088377

However, several factors limit their usage, such as missing pixels, line drops, and cloud cover in satellite images. Being measured close to the Earth's surface, LST is mainly influenced by the land use/land cover (LULC) distribution of the terrain. This article presents a spatio-temporal interpolation method which semantically models LULC information for the analysis of LST.

Quantifying such water bodies as hydrologic network features is critical for ecosystem and species conservation, emergency management, and water resource planning; however, such features are incompletely mapped at national and state levels. By merging an airborne LiDAR-derived point cloud with a normalized water index using airborne optical imagery we demonstrate an improvement upon single-source methods for identifying these water bodies; classification accuracies increased over 10% by using this multi-source fusion method. Furthermore, the method presented here illustrates a cost-effective pathway to improve the National Inventory of Dams (NID) and includes a framework for estimating dam heights, with results showing strong correlations between derived dam heights and those recorded in the NID (r=.78). With the steady increase in available LiDAR coverage, the 87,000+ dams in the NID could be updated using this technique, a method which could also be expanded for global inventories of SIs and dams. © 2019 The Authors.

Numerous quality issues have been discussed in the vast literature, while the fitness of OSM for road navigability is only partly explored. Navigability depends on logical consistency, which focuses on the existence of logical contradictions within a data set. Researchers have discussed the insufficiency of established methods and the lack of a computational paradigm to assess the quality of the OSM data. To address the research gaps, the current work extended the capabilities of the Quantum GIS Processing Toolbox for assessment of spatial data. The models and scripts developed are able to assess logical consistency based on geographical topological consistency, semantic information, and morphological consistency. The established and proxy indicators are selected for measuring the logical consistency of OSM data for navigability. For empirical validation, OSM Punjab data are compared with authoritative data from HERE (proprietary) and the Remote Sensing Centre (RSC), Punjab, India. The results conclude that even the proprietary road data sets are not free from logical inconsistencies and data contributed by the masses are credible and navigable.

Human movements are recorded in a variety of data sources and each describes unique mobility characteristics. Revealing similarity and difference in mobility data sources facilitates grasping comprehensive human mobility patterns. This study introduces a new method to measure similarities on two origin–destination (OD) matrices by spatially extending an image-assessment tool, the structural similarity index (SSIM). The new measurement, spatially weighted SSIM (SpSSIM), utilizes weight matrices to overcome the SSIM sensitivity issue due to the ordering of OD pairs by explicitly defining spatial adjacency. To evaluate SpSSIM, we compared performances between SSIM and SpSSIM with resampling the orders of OD pairs and conducted bootstrapping to test the statistical significance of SpSSIM. As a case study, we compared OD matrices generated from three data sources in San Diego County, CA: U.S. Census-based Longitudinal Employer–Household Dynamics Origin–Destination employment statistics, Twitter, and Instagram. The case study demonstrated that SpSSIM was able to capture similarities of mobility patterns between datasets that varied by distance. Some regions showed local dissimilarity while the global index indicated they were similar.

It is therefore possible to collect large amounts of information related to local events from existing social networks. Mining this abundant information can feed users and organizations with situational awareness to make responsive plans for ongoing events. Despite the fact that a number of studies have been conducted to detect local events using social media data, the event content is not efficiently summarized and/or the correlation between abnormal neighboring regions is not investigated. This article presents a spatial-temporal-semantic approach to local event detection using geo-social media data. Geographical regularities are first measured to extract spatio-temporal outliers, of which the corresponding tweet content is automatically summarized using the topic modeling method. The correlation between outliers is subsequently examined by investigating their spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A case study on the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) is conducted using Twitter data to evaluate our approach. This reveals that up to 87% of the events detected are correctly identified compared with the official TIFF schedule.

Determining coverage requires knowledge about travel behavior and accessibility across a region, as well as supporting methods of measurement and derivation when actual travel cannot necessarily be observed. When service is provided using vehicles that move freely without the restriction posed by roads (e.g., airplanes, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles/drones, boats, ships, and submarines), straight-line travel is regularly assumed. However, this common assumption is often violated by geographical obstructions, resulting in overestimated service coverage. To date, no methods have been developed capable of accounting for obstacle-limited service coverage. Existing methods either completely ignore obstructions or crudely estimate impacts on travel. In this research, we develop a novel method, ESP-Cover, capable of deriving accurate obstacle-limited coverage without introducing representation errors. A location siting problem involving drone-based package delivery is presented to highlight the necessity of explicitly accounting for obstacles in system design. The assessment results demonstrate the importance of accurate derivation of the obstacle-limited coverage for spatial decision-making and the accuracy of the ESP-Cover method in coverage derivation. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"accessibility; facility location; GIS; location decision; public transport; spatial analysis; travel behavior",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074576672

Terrain shading algorithms based on digital elevation models can be categorized into two types: area-based and point-specific. In this article, we evaluated two shading algorithms using designed mathematic surfaces. Theoretical shading effects over four Gauss synthetic surfaces were calculated and used to evaluate the terrain shading algorithms. We evaluated the area-based terrain shading algorithm, Hillshade tool of ArcGIS, and the point-specific shading algorithm from Solar Analyst (SA) in ArcGIS. Both algorithms showed shading overestimation, and Hillshade showed more accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.20%, as compared to the MAE of 1.66% of SA. The MAE of Hillshade increases exponentially as the spatial extent of the study area increases because the solar position for all locations on the surface is the same in Hillshade. Consequently, we suggest that the surface should be divided into more tiles in Hillshade when the discrepancy in the latitude of the whole surface is greater than 4°. Skyshed, which represents the horizon angle distribution in SA, is error-prone over more complex terrain because horizon angle interpolation is problematic for such areas. We also propose a new terrain shading algorithm, with solar positions calculated using local latitude for each cell and the horizon angle calculated for every specific time interval, but without projections.

However, little work has been conducted to reveal how multi-modal transportation data impact on this identification process. In our study, we propose a data-driven approach that addresses the relationships between travel behavior and urban structure: first, multi-modal transportation data are aggregated to extract explicit statistical features; then, topic modeling methods are applied to transform these explicit statistical features into latent semantic features; and finally, a classification method is used to identify functional zones with similar latent topic distributions. Two 10-day-long “big” datasets from the 2,370 bicycle stations of the public bicycle-sharing system, and up to 9,992 taxi cabs within the core urban area of Hangzhou City, China, as well as point-of-interest data are tested to reveal the extent to which different travel modes contribute to the detection and understanding of urban land functions. Our results show that: (1) using latent semantic features delineated from the topic modeling process as the classification input outperforms approaches using explicit statistical features; (2) combining multi-modal data visibly improves the accuracy and consistency of the identified functional zones; and (3) the proposed data-driven approach is also capable of identifying mixed land use in the urban space.

Since there are no mature raster management pipelines on the web, this study explores two inherently different techniques for handling raster data.

The approach extracts the one-dimensional temporal signature of a selected property of NTPs and applies existing path similarity measures to the signatures.

Although many studies have introduced various models to explain the spatiotemporal dynamics in housing markets, it is always challenging to consider both dimensions in a model. Some recent studies have identified spatiotemporal interactions of house prices by combining spatial and temporal models via spatial vector autoregression. The approach, however, assumes spatial homogeneity of the variables due to insufficient degrees of freedom. Since the housing market is generally conceived as heterogeneous, we suggest an alternative model of the spatial vector autoregressive Lasso without the homogeneity assumption. As an empirical example, we examine the spatiotemporal interaction between house sales price and rent in Seoul, Korea. The results show that rent for apartments in Gangnam-gu, a socioeconomic core of Seoul, has positive impacts on rent for apartments in surrounding suburbs rather than their sales price. Moreover, the suggested model outperforms the classical method in terms of explanation, prediction, and autocorrelation of residuals. This research is expected to provide a methodological guide to explore the interaction between house sales price and rent, and insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of the housing market in Seoul. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"empirical analysis; housing market; price dynamics; residential development; socioeconomic status; spatiotemporal analysis; Seoul [Seoul (ADS)]; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073941847

There remains a significant gap in methods for imputing nominal attribute values (e.g., Street Name) in map databases. Here, we present an imputation algorithm called the Membership Imputation Algorithm (MIA), targeting spatial databases and enabling imputation of nominal values in spatially referenced records. By targeting membership classes of spatial objects, MIA harnesses spatio-temporal characteristics of data and proposes efficient heuristics to impute the class name (i.e., a membership). Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to impute the membership with high levels of accuracy (over 94%) when assigning Street Name(s), across highly diverse regional contexts. MIA is effective in challenging spatial contexts such as street intersections.

However, due to its lack of forward looking, the global trajectory of agents usually seems unreasonable. As a method of optimizing the overall reward, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can better correct the problems that exist in the traditional local motion simulation method. In this article, we propose a local motion simulation method integrating optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA) and DRL, referred to as ORCA-DRL. The main idea of ORCA-DRL is to perform local collision avoidance detection via ORCA and smooth the trajectory at the same time via DRL. We use a deep neural network (DNN) as the state-to-action mapping function, where the state information is detected by virtual visual sensors and the action space includes two continuous spaces: speed and direction. To improve data utilization and speed up the training process, we use the proximal policy optimization based on the actor–critic (AC) framework to update the DNN parameters. Three scenes (circle, hallway, and crossing) are designed to evaluate the performance of ORCA-DRL. The results reveal that, compared with the ORCA, our proposed ORCA-DRL method can: (a) reduce the total number of frames, leading to less time for agents to reach their destination; and (b) effectively avoid local optima, evidenced by smoothed global trajectories. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082526301

A polygon overlay algorithm is proposed based on this data structure. The overlay of two complex GIS polygons is transformed into the intersection computation of their 3D triangular presentations. The intersection computation of two sets of triangles is reduced considerably by utilizing TriMeta to filter out the disjoint triangle pairs and rapidly identify the contained triangle.

To infer the semantic information and localize the components on building facades, this article proposes a novel approach to model facades with semantics by constructing hierarchical topological graphs. This method utilizes the topological characteristics of building facades. In the first-layer layout graph, the algorithm takes the nearest cluster as the vertex and the distance between components as the edge. Thus, a topology graph is generated for the facade. The proposed algorithm is divided into three steps. First, the topology graph is obtained by calculating the spacing between the components. It is reasonable to calculate the topological graph by encoding the topological edges. If this calculation is not effective, the topology is justified by adjusting the spacing between components. Finally, the vertices in the graph are used to repair the occluded parts of the facade. In the second-layer graph, a grid is constructed according to the first-layer graph. Then, the attributes of the nodes are used to reconstruct the facade. The experimental results show that this method has a high accuracy of 90% and that the average time consumption is 6 s. © 2020 The Authors.

Content production on online platforms is grounded in the geography of their users and their digital infrastructure. These constraints shape place representation, that is, the amount, quality, and type of digital information available in a geographic area. In this article we study the place representation of user-generated content (UGC) in Los Angeles County, relating the spatial distribution of the data to its geo-demographic context. Adopting a comparative and multi-platform approach, this quantitative analysis investigates the spatial relationship between four diverse UGC datasets and their context at the census tract level (about 685,000 geo-located tweets, 9,700 Wikipedia pages, 4 million OpenStreetMap objects, and 180,000 Foursquare venues). The context includes the ethnicity, age, income, education, and deprivation of residents, as well as public infrastructure. An exploratory spatial analysis and regression-based models indicate that the four UGC platforms possess distinct geographies of place representation. To a moderate extent, the presence of Twitter, OpenStreetMap, and Foursquare data is influenced by population density, ethnicity, education, and income. However, each platform responds to different socio-economic factors and clusters emerge in disparate hotspots. Unexpectedly, Twitter data tend to be located in denser, more deprived areas, and the geography of Wikipedia appears peculiar and harder to explain. These trends are compared with previous findings for the area of Greater London. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078029777

Consequently, it is difficult to compare existing geoparsers or to compare a new geoparser with existing ones.

First, we review previous research on the determinants of air quality. Then, we explain the MGWR model, together with two global models: ordinary least squares (OLS) and OLS containing a spatial lag variable (OLSL) and a commonly used local model: geographically weighted regression (GWR). To detect and account for any variation of the spatial autocorrelation of air pollution over space, we construct two extra local models which we call GWR with lagged dependent variable (GWRL) and MGWR with lagged dependent variable (MGWRL) by including the lagged form of the dependent variable in the GWR model and the MGWR model, respectively. The performances of these six models are comprehensively examined and the MGWR and MGWRL models outperform the two global models as well as the GWR and GWRL models. MGWRL is the most accurate model in terms of replicating the observed air quality index (AQI) values and removing residual dependency. The superiority of the MGWR framework over the GWR framework is demonstrated—GWR can only produce a single optimized bandwidth, while MGWR provides covariate-specific optimized bandwidths which indicate the different spatial scales that different processes operate. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; conceptual framework; least squares method; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073972926

Using spatial datasets like land classification and slope, along with predefined LZ geometry specifications, GRAIL Tools generates binary suitability filters that distinguish between suitable and unsuitable terrain. GRAIL Tools combines input suitability filters, searches for LZs at user-defined orientations, and plots results. To refine GRAIL Tools, we: (a) verified software output; (b) conducted validation assessments using five unpaved LZ sites; and (c) assessed input dataset resolution on outcomes using 30 and 1-m datasets. The software was verified and validated in California and the Baltics, and all five LZs were correctly identified in either the 30 or the 1-m data. The 30-m data provided numerous LZs for consideration, while the 1-m data highlighted hazardous conditions undetected in the 30-m data. Digital elevation model grid size affected results, as 1-m data produced overestimated slope values. Resampling the data to 5 m resulted in more realistic slopes.

Study areas in Sheffield, London, Rome, and Paris were used for testing, and two measures (overall accuracy, OA and kappa index) were used for evaluation. Experiments were designed to verify this approach, with each pair of OSM and reference datasets initially compared after reclassification. Correspondence from one study area was then applied to another for further validation. Results show that OA was between 70 and 90% and the kappa index varied between 0.6 and 0.8.

For humans and robots to navigate seamlessly through such environments, new flexible approaches need to be developed. Navigation systems generally rely on a network (nodes and edges) as an abstraction of underlying space availability. However, indoor and outdoor networks have different origins. While indoor systems rely on indoor space subdivision approaches, current outdoor systems utilize road-based network approaches. Linking such networks via particular nodes is possible but restrictive. Many spaces in the built environment are not strictly indoor or outdoor spaces and are thus often omitted from navigation networks, further limiting navigation options. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a new space definition framework in which the entire built environment is categorized into indoor, outdoor, semi-indoor and semi-outdoor spaces. We provide strict definitions for the four space categories. Our framework allows the same navigation network extraction approaches to be used and therefore enables seamless indoor/outdoor path computation for single or combinations of locomotion modes. The notions of semi-indoor and semi-outdoor spaces offer new options for further tailoring of the navigation path with respect to environmental factors, which we demonstrate with two use cases. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"building; conceptual framework; environmental factor; navigation; public space",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070090038

We examined the effects of sampling design on the quality of spatial data collected for a koala citizen science project in Australia. Data were collected from three samples—volunteers (n = 454), an Internet panel (n = 103), and landowners (n = 35)—to assess spatial data quality, a dimension of citizen science projects rarely considered. The locational accuracy of koala observations among the samples was similar when benchmarked against authoritative data (i.e., an expert-derived koala distribution model), but there were differences in the quantity of data generated. Fewer koala location data were generated per participant by the Internet panel sample than the volunteer or landowner samples. Spatial preferences for land uses affecting koala conservation were also mapped, with landowners more likely to map locations for residential and tourism development and volunteers less likely. These spatial preferences have the potential to influence the social acceptability of future koala conservation proposals. With careful sampling design, both citizen observations and land use preferences can be included within the same project to augment scientific assessments and identify conservation opportunities and constraints. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"benchmarking; data quality; design; local participation; marsupial; sampling; spatial data; species conservation; Australia; Phascolarctidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068740492

A new encoding mode is established with the introduction of the Gosper curve, which has good spatial aggregation. On this basis, straightforward encoding, lossless coding compression, and lossy coding compression can be carried out. First, the bidirectional correlation between the Gosper curve and the hexagonal grid data is established, and the Gosper coding value of each raster unit is determined. Then, the lossless compression of the data is completed by performing run-length encoding on the coding set. Following the Gosper curve trend, partial grid units are semantically changed via adjacent fusion under certain threshold constraints. The run-length encoding is carried out again to complete the lossy compression and further reduce the amount of encoding required. A break-detection step is added during the process to avoid regional breaks. The experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently compress data. Additionally, data compression of multi-resolution and varying fusion thresholds is explored to summarize general patterns. Finally, the method proposed is compared with traditional row-coding compression in hexagonal and quadrilateral grids to highlight its advantages for hexagonal raster data. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"correlation; data processing; data set; raster; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068700508

We begin with a review of the existing optimization-based methods and point out limitations of current models. We then demonstrate how to utilize the structure of the network-flow model to approach the feature-matching problem, as well as the important factors for designing optimization-based conflation models. The proposed model can be solved by general linear programming solvers or network flow solvers. Due to the network flow formulation we adopt, the proposed model can be solved in polynomial time. Computational experiments show that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing optimization-based conflation models.

These gaps prevent the capture of comprehensive provenance, useful for reuse and reproducibility. In addition, the lack of automated tools for capturing provenance hinders the broad generation and compilation of provenance information. This work presents a provenance engine (PE) that captures and represents provenance information using a combination of the Web Processing Service (WPS) standard and the ISO 19115 geospatial lineage model. The PE, developed within the MiraMon GIS & RS software, automatically records detailed information about sources and processes. The PE also includes a metadata editor that shows a graphical representation of the provenance and allows users to complement provenance information by adding missing processes or deleting redundant process steps or sources, thus building a consistent geospatial workflow. One use case is presented to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the PE: the generation of a radiometric pseudo-invariant areas bench for the Iberian Peninsula. This remote-sensing use case shows how provenance can be automatically captured, also in a non-sequential complex flow, and its essential role in the automation and replication tasks in work with very large amounts of geospatial data. © 2019 The Authors.

Such raw trajectories can be transformed into so-called semantic trajectories, which are sequences of stops that occur at “places of interest.” Trajectory data analysis can be enriched if spatial and non-spatial contextual data associated with the moving objects are taken into account, and aggregation of trajectory data can reveal hidden patterns within such data. When trajectory data are stored in relational databases, there is an “impedance mismatch” between the representation and storage models. Graphs in which the nodes and edges are annotated with properties are gaining increasing interest to model a variety of networks. Therefore, this article proposes the use of graph databases (Neo4j in this case) to represent and store trajectory data, which can thus be analyzed at different aggregation levels using graph query languages (Cypher, for Neo4j). Through a real-world public data case study, the article shows that trajectory queries are expressed more naturally on the graph-based representation than over the relational alternative, and perform better in many typical cases. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"data processing; database; GIS; GPS; graphical method; spatial data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069674823

MLP spatially weighted classification models and an MLP contiguity-constrained classification model are developed to conduct spatially constrained regionalization. The proposed methods have been tested with an attribute-rich point dataset of geological surveys in Ukraine. The experiments show that consideration of the spatial effects, such as the use of spatial attributes and their respective whitening, improve the output of regionalization.

Due to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of different cities, selecting a business location in a new area has become a challenge. The application of multi-source geospatial data makes it possible to describe human activities and urban functional zones at fine scale. We propose a knowledge transfer-based model named KTSR to support citywide business location selections at the land-parcel scale. This framework can optimize customer scores and study the pattern of business location selection for chain brands. First, we extract the features of each urban land parcel and study the similarities between them. Then, singular value decomposition was used to build a knowledge-transfer model of similar urban land parcels between different cities. The results show that: (1) compared with the actual scores, the estimated deviation of the proposed model decreased by more than 50%, and the Pearson correlation coefficient reached 0.84 or higher; (2) the decomposed features were good at quantifying and describing high-level commercial operation information, which has a strong relationship with urban functional structures. In general, our method can work for selecting business locations and estimating sale volumes and user evaluations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"business; knowledge economy; location decision; retailing; spatial analysis; spatial planning; supermarket; China",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068694649

As bike borrowing and return at different stations in different periods are not balanced, the bikes in a bike-sharing system need to be redistributed frequently to rebalance the system. Therefore, traffic flow forecasting of the bike-sharing system is an important issue, as this is conducive to achieving rebalancing of the bike system. In this article, we present a new traffic flow prediction approach based on the temporal links in dynamic traffic flow networks. A station clustering algorithm is first introduced to cluster stations into groups. A temporal link prediction method based on the dynamic traffic flow network method (STW+M) is then proposed to predict the traffic flow between stations. In our method, the non-negative tensor decomposition and time-series analysis model capture the rich information (temporal variabilities, spatial characteristics, and weather information) of the across-clusters transition. Then, a temporal link prediction strategy is used to forecast potential links and weights in the traffic flow network by investigating both the network structure and the results of tensor computations. In order to assess the methods proposed in this article, we have used the data of bike-sharing systems in New York and Washington, DC to conduct bike traffic prediction and the experimental results have shown that our method produces the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and mean square error (MSE). Compared to four prediction methods from the literature, our RMSE and MSE of the two datasets have been lowered by an average of 2.55 (Washington, DC) and 2.41 (New York) and 3.35 (Washington, DC) and 2.96 (New York), respectively. The results show that the proposed approach improves predictions of traffic flow. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"algorithm; cluster analysis; cycle transport; prediction; public transport; time series analysis; traffic congestion; District of Columbia; New York [United States]; United States; Washington [District of Columbia]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068610126

In the context of multiple-aspect trajectories, where mobility data are enriched with several semantic dimensions, current state-of-the-art approaches present some limitations concerning the relationships between attributes and their semantics. Existing works are either too strict, requiring a match on all attributes, or too flexible, considering all attributes as independent. In this article we propose MUITAS, a novel similarity measure for a new type of trajectory data with heterogeneous semantic dimensions, which takes into account the semantic relationship between attributes, thus filling the gap of the current trajectory similarity methods.

We here present our findings on StarBorn, a novel LBG with a strong focus on game play. Users conquer game-tiles by visiting real-world locations and collecting land cover data. Within three months, StarBorn generated 13,319 land cover classifications by 84 users. Results show that data are concentrated around users’ daily life spaces, agreement among users is highest for urban and industry land cover, and user-generated land cover classifications exhibit high agreement with an authoritative data set. However, we also observe low user retention rates and negative correlations between number of contributions and agreement rates with an authoritative land cover product. We recommend that future work consider not only game play, but also how motivational aspects influence behavior and data quality.

Integrated in the data collection component, we also propose a typology of crowdsourcing tasks that—coupled with the functional components—establishes a foundation for VGIS research and design. We characterize these components, arguing that they are necessary in the development of VGIS, however, there is still a need for a more detailed study of the flow of processes and subprocesses and how they work under the criteria of different types of projects to continue facilitating their design. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"crowdsourcing; data interpretation; data processing; data set; GIS; technological development; typology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067415837

However, standard tools may be insufficient for 3D scientific visualization. In particular, single-source illumination of 3D models may be deficient for topographically complex terrains. We present an approach for 3D terrain modeling with multiple-source illumination in the virtual environment of the Blender free and open-source software. The approach includes the following key stages: (1) automatic creation of a polygonal object; (2) selecting an algorithm to model the 3D geometry; (3) selecting a vertical exaggeration scale; (4) selecting types, parameters, a number, and positions of light sources; (5) selecting methods for generating shadows; (6) selecting a shading method for the 3D model; (7) selecting a material for the 3D model surface; (8) overlaying a texture on the 3D model; (9) setting a virtual camera; and (10) rendering the 3D model. To illustrate the approach, we processed a test DEM extracted from the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean version 3.0 (IBCAO 3.0).

Indeed, the dynamic nature of GIS&T introduces both new paradigms and increasingly powerful tools for exploring spatial relationships. However, while past efforts among educators and practitioners have identified knowledge and competencies important to GIS&T learning, less attention has been directed at methods used to teach GIS&T. For example, while some instructors employ traditional approaches such as lectures and structured laboratory exercises, others have shifted to active learning strategies such as “flipped classrooms” and collaborative, project-oriented assignments. In this article, we assess the pedagogical approaches used to teach GIS&T courses through an Internet-based survey of 318 college and university faculty. Our findings demonstrate that active learning pedagogies are becoming more firmly established, supplementing or replacing traditional teaching approaches. Contrary to our assumptions, age and teaching experience are not factors that influence the adoption of active learning strategies.

Interestingly, almost all major datasets represent places and even entire regions as point coordinates. There are two key reasons for this. First, complex geometries are difficult to store and query using the current Linked Data technology stack to a degree where many queries take minutes to return or will simply time out. Second, the absence of complex geometries confirms a common suspicion among GIScientists, namely that for many everyday queries place-based relational knowledge is more relevant than raw geometries alone. To give an illustrative example, the statement that the White House is in Washington, DC is more important for gaining an understating of the city than the exact geometries of both entities. This does not imply that complex geometries are unimportant but that (topological) relations should also be extracted from them. As Egenhofer and Mark (1995b) put it in their landmark paper on naive geography, topology matters, metric refines.

This article discusses one of these exceptions. Spatial relations between points are frequently modeled as vectors in which both distance and direction are of equal prominence. However, in Tobler's first law of geography, such a relation is described only from the perspective of distance by relating the decreasing similarity of observations in some attribute space to their increasing distance in geographic space. Although anisotropic versions of many geographic analysis techniques, such as directional semivariograms, anisotropy clustering, and anisotropic point pattern analysis, have been developed over the years, direction remains on the level of an afterthought. We argue that, compared to distance, directional information is still under-explored and anisotropic techniques are substantially less frequently applied in everyday GIS analysis. Commonly, when classical spatial autocorrelation indicators, such as Moran's I, are used to understand a spatial pattern, the weight matrix is only built from distance, without direction being considered. Similarly, GIS operations, such as buffering, do not take direction into account either, with distance in all directions being treated equally. In reality, meanwhile, particularly in urban structures and when processes are driven by the underlying physical geography, direction plays an essential role. In this article we ask whether the development of early GIS, data (sample) sparsity, and Tobler's law lead to a theory-induced blindness for the role of direction. If so, is it possible to envision direction becoming a first-class citizen of equal importance to distance instead of being an afterthought only considered when the deviation from a perfect circle becomes too obvious to be ignored?. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"autocorrelation; geographical thought; geographical variation; GIS; matrix; numerical model; spatial analysis; urban area; vector",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067847655

While Linked Data has found its way into everyday applications such as search engines and question answering systems, there is a growing disconnect between the classical ways in which Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are still used today and the open-ended, exploratory approaches used to retrieve and consume data from knowledge graphs such as Linked Data.

The article uses GPS tracking data provided by HOURCAR, a non-profit car-sharing service in Minnesota, as a case study to demonstrate our method and present the results. We also implement the DB-SMoT algorithm as a comparison. The results show that our four-step method can handle various time intervals between consecutive records, group consecutive stops close to each other, and distinguish different types of stops and their inferred activities.

In recent years, this has fueled the interest in knowledge graph summarization techniques that compute representative subgraphs for a given collection of nodes. In addition, many of the most densely connected entities in knowledge graphs are places and regions, often characterized by thousands of incoming and outgoing relationships to other places, actors, events, and objects. In this article, we propose a novel summarization method that incorporates spatially explicit components into a reinforcement learning framework in order to help summarize geographic knowledge graphs, a topic that has not been considered in previous work. Our model considers the intrinsic graph structure as well as the extrinsic information to gain a more comprehensive and holistic view of the summarization task.

However, the output quality of geocoding systems is found to impact the conclusions of subsequent studies that employ this workflow. The published development of geocoding systems has been limited to the same set of interpolation methods and reference data sets for quite some time. We introduce a novel geocoding approach utilizing object detection on remotely sensed imagery based on a deep learning framework to generate rooftop geocoding output. This allows geocoding systems to use and output exact building locations without employing typical geocoding interpolation methods or being completely limited by the availability of reference data sets. The utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated over a sample of 22,481 addresses resulting in significant spatial error reduction and match rates comparable to typical geocoding methods. For different land-use types, our approach performs better on low-density residential and commercial addresses than on high-density residential addresses.

We first create a multi-feature-fusion framework to extract driving errors using smartphone sensors. Then, the detected errors are geo-statistically analyzed with road networks and driving trajectories to identify driving error hotspots. We next construct a “scenic tuple” for representing the occurrence of driving errors. Finally, the individualized hazardous driving scenes are extracted by mining a long-term collection of scenic tuples. Results demonstrate that our proposed approach can effectively identify driving errors.

When current methods are used to process polygons with irregular shapes or complex branch convergence zones, the extracted line structural features tend to be inaccurate and topologically erroneous. In this article, we propose an improved partition lines extraction algorithm of constrained Delaunay triangulation to counter these issues. The proposed method aims to maintain consistency between the extracted line structure characteristics and the actual object structure, especially for complex branch convergence zones. First, we describe three types of aggregation patterns (Type A, B, and C aggregation zones) that occur in partition line extractions for LN patches of complex branch convergence zones using Delaunay triangulation. Then, a partition line extraction algorithm that accounts for the direction between the edges of triangles and the distance of nodes in aggregation zones is proposed. Finally, we test our method for a dataset relating to Guizhou Province, China.

In geographic information science, spatial record linkage is a form of geocoding that pertains to the resolution of text-based linkage between pairs of addresses into matches and non-matches. These approaches link text-based address sequences, integrating sources of data that would otherwise remain in isolation. While recent innovations in machine learning have been introduced in the wider record linkage literature, there is significant potential to apply machine learning to the address matching sub-field of geographic information science.

Many public facilities, such as hospitals, tend to be centrally located to ensure they are most accessible to local residents; as a result, they may contribute significantly to a city's traffic congestion. In this study, a multi-objective spatial optimization model was provided to help formulate hospital relocation plans, taking into account both traffic congestion and hospital accessibility. Using intra-urban movement data, we proposed a method to estimate the area-wide traffic congestion caused by hospital visits and to identify potential hospitals to be relocated. An NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) algorithm was applied to solve the hospital relocation optimization problem; we applied our model to study optimal hospital relocation plans in Beijing.

Many spatio-temporal clustering methods have been designed for geo-referenced time series. Under some special circumstances, such as monitoring traffic flow on roads, existing methods cannot handle the temporally dynamic and spatially heterogeneous correlations among road segments when detecting clusters. Therefore, this article develops a spatio-temporal flow-based approach to detect clusters in traffic networks. First, a spatio-temporal flow process is modeled by combining network topology relations with real-time traffic status. On this basis, spatio-temporal neighborhoods are captured by considering traffic time-series similarity in spatio-temporal flows. Spatio-temporal clusters are further formed by successive connection of spatio-temporal neighbors. Experiments on traffic time series of central London's road network on both weekdays and weekends are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"cluster analysis; flow modeling; neighborhood; road traffic; spatiotemporal analysis; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062363605

To reduce the data volume while preserving the model appearance, this article proposes a novel simplification method for complex 3D building models. Texture discontinuities are addressed by developing a new data model that records the mapping relation between the texture coordinates of each vertex and its neighboring triangles. The surface mesh of the building model is then segmented into regions, guided by topology and appearance. Finally, the mesh segmentation information is used to derive an improved error metric that considers both geometric and texture errors, and the texture coordinates are adjusted after each simplification operation.

During construction, a TileArc is calculated and flagged as the shortest path in a tile. Based on the built road-network pyramid carrying hierarchical TileArcs, a multi-level and flexible shortest path query can be executed efficiently.

The traditional Priority-Flood (PF) approach is widely used due to its relatively high efficiency when dealing with a small-sized DEM. However, it seems inadequate and inefficient when dealing with large high-resolution DEMs. In this work, we examined the relationship between the PF algorithm calculation process and the topographical characteristics of depressions, and found significant redundant calculations in the local micro-relief areas in the conventional PF algorithm. As such calculations require more time when dealing with large DEMs, we thus propose a new variant of the PF algorithm, wherein redundant points and calculations are recognized and eliminated based on the local micro-relief water-flow characteristics of the depression-filling process. In addition, depressions and flatlands were optimally processed by a quick queue to improve the efficiency of the process. The proposed method was applied and validated in eight case areas using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model (SRTM-DEM) with 1 arc-second resolution. These selected areas have different data sizes. A comparative analysis among the proposed method, the Wang and Liu-based PF, the improved Barnes-based PF, the improved Zhou-based PF, and the Planchon and Darboux (P&D) algorithms was conducted to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The results showed that the proposed algorithm is 43.2% (maximum) faster than Wang and Liu's variant of the PF method, with an average of 31.8%. In addition, the proposed algorithm achieved similar performance to the improved Zhou-based PF algorithm, though our algorithm has the advantage of being simpler. The optimal strategies using the proposed algorithm can be employed in various landforms with high efficiency. The proposed method can also achieve good depression filling, even with large amounts of DEM data. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"algorithm; comparative study; digital elevation model; efficiency measurement; flood; hydrological modeling; microrelief; optimization; Shuttle Radar Topography Mission",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059352876

Extracting multilane roads and establishing a high level of expressed detail play important roles in the field of automated cartographic generalization. An accurate and detailed extraction process benefits geographic analysis, urban region division, and road network construction, as well as transportation applications services. The road networks in OSM have a high level of detail and complex structures; however, they also include many duplicate lines, which degrade the efficiency and increase the difficulty of extracting multilane roads. To resolve these problems, this work proposes a machine-learning-based approach, in which the road networks are first converted from lines to polygons. Then, various geometric descriptors, including compactness, width, circularity, area, perimeter, complexity, parallelism, shape descriptor, and width-to-length ratio, are used to train a random forest (RF) classifier and identify the candidates. Finally, another RF is trained to evaluate the candidates using all the geometric descriptors and topological features; the outputs of this second trained RF are the predicted multilane roads.

The results of the analyses show that the variables that represent diversity were more significant when regressed against burglary crime rates than standard socio-demographic data traditionally used in crime studies, which do not generally use diversity variables. The findings of this study highlight the importance of neighborhood cohesion in the crime system, and the key place for diversity statistics in quantifying the relationships between neighborhood diversities and burglary.

Previous studies have shown that gully erosion activity can be reflected in the dynamic changes of the shoulder-lines. In this study, active gully erosion sites along the shoulder-lines are investigated. Three typical test areas with different loess landforms are selected, and the loess shoulder-lines are derived from 1 m resolution digital elevation models. First, height profiles of the loess shoulder-lines are extracted. Then, from the perspective of frequency domains, active gully erosion sites are identified using the Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT). The experimental results show that the HHT method can effectively mine the intrinsic characteristics of the shoulder-lines. The detailed information components (non-components) and trend components of the height profiles can be obtained via ensemble empirical mode decomposition and a significance test. In addition, the HHT method was employed to identify the instantaneous frequency curve catastrophe points of the loess shoulder-line height profiles, and the physical meaning is clear: a higher frequency denotes greater energy and more severe erosive processes, and the catastrophe point locations represent the active gully erosion sites. Evidence from a recent field survey and a comparison with another method supports the results, indicating that the method proposed in this study could potentially be effective for the exploration and analysis of geomorphologically sensitive locations in loess landform studies. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"catastrophic event; digital elevation model; geomorphology; gully erosion; loess; topography; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059338124

In particular, the ability to estimate an animal's spatial location probabilistically at temporal sampling intervals between known fix locations allows researchers to quantify how individuals interact with one another and their environment on finer temporal and spatial scales than previously explored. This article extends methods from time geography, specifically probabilistic space–time prisms, to quantify and summarize animal–road interactions toward understanding related diurnal movement behaviors, including road avoidance. The approach is demonstrated using tracking data for fishers (Martes pennanti) in New York State, where the total probability of interaction with roadways is calculated for individuals over the duration tracked. Additionally, a summarization method visualizing daily interaction probabilities at 60 s intervals is developed to assist in the examination of temporal patterns associated with fishers’ movement behavior with respect to roadways. The results identify spatial and temporal patterns of fisher–roadway interaction by time of day. Overall, the methodologies discussed offer an intuitive means to assess moving object location probabilities in the context of environmental factors.

Overcoming the current geospatial data challenges involves adopting the best practices to expose, share, and integrate data on the Web, that is, Linked Data. In this article, we have developed a framework for generating, enriching, and exploiting geospatial Linked Data from multiple and heterogeneous geospatial data sources. This proposal allows connecting two interoperability universes (SDIs, more specifically Web Feature Services, WFS, and Semantic Web technologies), which is evaluated through a study case in the (geo)biodiversity domain. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"data set; GIS; spatial data; World Wide Web",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057561353

Over the past two decades, even though various approaches for 3D urban models have been investigated, their use has been limited because of the lack of spatial accuracy, details, and the complex processes. It is difficult to maintain highly detailed texture information without using a hybrid of aerial image and ground-based imaging techniques, which are costly. Furthermore, it is hard to develop a fully automated process for 3D urban mapping that achieves high spatial accuracy. With regard to the issues, this research aims to develop a semi-automated process for 3D building models that would help image-based approaches. It helps acquire qualified texture information and improve the appearance of building façades in a large city. In particular, this research first investigates an optimal overlap of consecutive aerial images that generates sufficient information to texture each façade, thus making this process more cost-effective. Second, this research develops an application to semi-automatically build 3D buildings and textured 3D buildings. The application is developed in C++.

Here—following Agnew, Tuan, and others—we consider place as being made up of three components—location, locale, and sense of place—which are recognizable at multiple scales and vary historically as a product of social and political processes. Using the testimonies of two survivors of the Holocaust, we sketch the components of a model for a GIS of place that allows for this theory of place to be visualized and analyzed. The model is, crucially, both multi-scalar and sensitive to uncertainty, as a GIS of place needs to be able to zoom in and out of the different scales at which place is experienced, as well as capture both uncertain data and uncertainty as data. We see potential in the representations proposed for scaling up from the anecdotal to the general in the sense that any narrative can be grouped and classified according to places and scales as shown here.

The current approach for land-use allocation using optimization mostly utilizes objective functions and constraints that are non-spatial in nature. Application of spatial constraints could take care of the contiguity and compactness of land uses and can be utilized to address urban sprawl. Because a land-use model is used as an input to transportation modeling, a better spatial allocation strategy for more compact land-use projections will promote better transportation planning and sustainable development. This study formulates a scenario-based approach to normative modeling of urban sprawl. In doing so, it seeks to improve the land-use projections by employing a spatial optimization model with contiguity and compactness consideration. This study incorporates urban sprawl measures based on smart growth principles together with a mixed-use factor, and adjacency consideration of nearby land uses. The objective function used in the study maximizes net suitability based on imposed constraints. These constraints are based on smart growth principles that enhance walkability in neighborhoods, promote better health for residents, and encourage mixed-use development. The formulated model has been applied to Collin County, TX, a fast-developing suburban county located to the north of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The suitability of land cells indicates the probability of conversion, which is calculated using spatial discrete choice analysis with Moran eigenvector spatial filtering for vacant cells at a resolution of 150 × 150 m employing factors of the built environment, and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. This study demonstrates how spatial proximity between land uses, which has been ignored to date, can be used to control sprawl, resulting in better mixing of different land uses based on constraints imposed in a spatial optimization problem. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"discrete choice analysis; eigenvalue; forecasting method; land use planning; optimization; spatial analysis; suburban area; sustainable development; transportation planning; urban sprawl; Collin County; Texas; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070601811

However, most of these studies have focused on the final land use scenarios in the projected year, without considering how to reach the final optimized land use scenario. To fill this gap, a spatio-temporal land use multi-objective optimization (STLU-MOO) model is innovatively proposed in this research to determine possible spatial land use solutions over time. The STLU-MOO is an extension of a genetic land use multi-objective optimization model (LU-MOO) in which the LU-MOO is generally carried out in different years, and the solutions at year T will affect the solutions at year T + 1. We used the Wuhan agglomeration (WHA) as our case study area. The STLU-MOO model was employed separately for the nine cities in the WHA, and social, economic, and environmental objectives have been considered. The success of the experiments in the case study demonstrated the value and novelty of our proposed STLU-MOO model. In addition, the results also indicated that the objectives considered in the case study were in conflict. According to the results, the optimal land use plan in 2050 can be traced back to 2040, 2030, and 2020, providing a series of Pareto solutions over the years which can provide spatio-temporal land use multi-objective optimization solutions to support the land use planning process. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"land use change; land use planning; numerical model; optimization; scenario analysis; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067358363

Sustainable urban planning is central to address the dilemma of economic growth and ecosystem protection, where the use of land is critical. Sustainable land use patterns are spatially explicit in nature, and can be structured and addressed using spatial optimization integrating GIS and mathematical models. This research discusses prominent sustainability concerns in land use planning and suggests a generalized multi-objective spatial optimization model to facilitate conventional planning. The model is structured to meet land use demand while satisfying the requirements of the physical environment, society and economy. Unlike existing work relying on raster data, due to its simple data structure and ease of spatial relationship evaluation, this research develops an approach for identifying land use solutions based on vector data that better reflects the actual shape and spatial layout of land parcels as well as the ways land use information is managed in practice. An evolutionary algorithm is developed to find the set of efficient (Pareto) solutions given the complexity of vector-based representations of space. The proposed approach is applied in an empirical study of Dafeng, China in order to support local urban growth and development.

The battlefield itself provides an example of the way in which physical geography can contribute to our understanding of historical events. According to historical accounts, the rolling landscape of the Hastings battle site was unquestionably an important factor in understanding the conflict. Yet surprisingly few analyses of the local terrain exist to test this proposition. In part, this is because historians of the battle have largely affirmed that the current battle site bears little or no physical resemblance to that present in 1066, and thus is unsuitable for contemporary analysis that might shed light on the outcome of the battle itself. By applying advanced geographical analysis using the RUSLE model, this study demonstrates that there is in fact considerable evidence to suggest that a limited amount of sediment was removed, hence the battlefield has in fact changed very little since the battle. This finding is significant, insofar as it opens the door to new research on the Battle of Hastings which may shed additional light on the events that occurred there and the factors that influenced the outcome of this key conflict in British history. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"GIS; historical cartography; historical perspective; satellite data; topographic mapping; East Sussex; England; Hastings [East Sussex]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065014460

With rural development, however, these connections will change and may weaken the adaptation of relocation plans to future rural systems. As yet, most studies still use empirical social connections to guide relocation planning, while a few have incorporated predicted connections in the context of rural development into relocation decisions. Meanwhile, spatial optimization approaches have seldom been adopted to solve this geographical decision issue. Accordingly, our study proposes a novel spatial relocation framework that incorporates changed inter-village social connections under future rural development scenarios. Empirical inter-village connections and their policy-induced changes in central China were explored using social network analysis. An integration of particle swarm optimization and geographic information systems was adopted to identify the relocation solutions with maximum inter-village connections and maximum spatial land use compactness, and to examine how connection changes under different policy scenarios influenced relocation outcomes. The results demonstrate the significance of incorporating policy-induced social connections into relocation plans, and most importantly, show the negative relations between changed social connections and the migration distance/direction of relocated settlements.

A new grey wolf-inspired approach is put forward to determine the urban growth rules of CA cells by using the GWO algorithm, which is suitable for solving optimization problems. The inspiration for GWO comes from the social leadership of wolf groups, as well as their hunting behavior. The GWO-optimized urban growth rules for CA describe the relationship between the spatial variables and the urban land-use status for each cell in the formation of “if–then.” The GWO algorithm and CA model are then integrated as the GWO–CA model for urban growth simulation and optimization. By taking Nanjing City as an example, the simulation accuracy in terms of urban cells is 86.6%, and the kappa coefficient is 0.715, indicating that the GWO algorithm is efficient at obtaining urban growth rules from spatial variables. The validation of the GWO–CA model also illustrates that it performs well in terms of the simulation and spatial optimization of urban growth, and can further contribute to urban planning and management. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"algorithm; cellular automaton; computer simulation; integrated approach; numerical model; optimization; urban growth; urban planning; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059341268

However, matching data are often obtained from different sources and have problems of positional discrepancy and different levels of detail. To resolve these problems, this article presents a multiscale polygonal object-matching approach, called the minimum bounding rectangle combinatorial optimization (MBRCO) with spatial district (SD). This method starts with the MBRCO algorithm and its enhancement using the SD to find corresponding MBRs of one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many matching pairs. Then, it aligns the MBRs of the matching pairs to identify object-matching pairs, which are evaluated using a matching criterion to find geometrically corresponding objects. Our approach was experimentally validated using two topographical datasets at 1:2k and 1:10k. The proposed approach outperforms the common two-way area overlap method and another method based on the contextual information and relaxation labeling algorithm. The proposed method achieved accurate aggregation of the many-to-many matching pairs under the positional discrepancy scenario. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"accuracy assessment; algorithm; data set; GIS; model validation; optimization; spatial analysis; spatial data; topographic mapping",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056795907

To identify the spatial structure and explore the effects of internal features on this structure, we propose a spatial-adjacency-based method for interactions between urban main roads (main road corridors) and the urban landscape. Dongguan was used as the research area, for the sample period 1997–2013. Urban land patches were analyzed comprehensively, based on the spatial relationship with main roads, and according to landscape indices and landscape gradients. Furthermore, to explore the overall spatial attraction and spillover effects of the main road corridors, an extended Voronoi-based spatial-adjacency measuring index (EVSAI) was proposed to measure geographic adjacency. Finally, we established one complete set of classification criteria relevant to the changing patterns of the spatial structure. The experimental results indicated a dense network of main road corridors in the regions adjacent to the central area of Dongguan. The findings further revealed that the landscape pattern experienced three stages of spatiotemporal changes spanning the 16 years: central sprawl (1997–2005), peripheral sprawl (2005–2009), and central sprawl (2009–2013). © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"environmental degradation; geographical research; landscape structure; roadside environment; spatiotemporal analysis; spillover effect; urban sprawl; urbanization; China; Dongguan; Guangdong",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056758745

The current geographical analysis models can provide prediction and decision support-oriented information in various domains through analysis and simulation results. However, the complexity of models is increasing due to their continuous development and related research, and the relationships between models are becoming increasingly complicated, which severely hinders the ability to select and use suitable models. To bridge the requirements of model understanding with related abundant information, a data model for geographical analysis models is designed with consideration of their evolution and application processes. In addition to basic metadata (e.g., name, classification, and modeling approach), evolution and application information, which is often neglected in traditional model expression methods, can provide clues about model development histories and usage relationships. Thus, this information will provide scientists with a comprehensive understanding and will form an overall picture of geographic models that can be used for future research. Based on the analysis of the elements related to the evolution and application information, the data model is designed and an information abstraction strategy is proposed. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is employed as a case study to show the capacity of the designed data model to contribute to both sharing of geographical analysis model knowledge and further model analysis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"GIS; metadata; modeling; soil and water assessment tool",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056748165

Existing outlier detection methods cannot statistically identify significant outliers by considering the co-occurrences of multiple categories of spatial points. Therefore, this study develops a non-parametric statistical test method to detect significant cross-outliers from two categories of spatial points divided into primary and reference ones. Firstly, the cross K function is employed to test the significance of co-occurrences of the two categories of points, and the co-occurrence intensity of each primary point is quantitatively defined as the number of reference points in its circular buffer. Then, the edge-constrained Delaunay triangulation is utilized to construct a reasonable spatial neighborhood for each primary point. On this basis, the Monte Carlo method is utilized to simulate the distribution of reference points in the support domain of each primary point delineated using the α-shape algorithm, and those primary points with significantly different local co-occurrence intensity are determined as spatial cross-outliers.

This article presents the methodology and results of an inter-sensor comparison of built-up area data derived from Landsat, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and SPOT5/SPOT6. The assessment was performed for 13 cities across the world for which cartographic reference building footprints were available. Several validation approaches were used: cumulative built-up curve analysis, pixel-by-pixel performance metrics, and regression analysis. The results indicate that Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 contribute greatly to improved built-up area detection compared to Landsat, within the global human settlement framework. However, Sentinel-2 tends to show high omission errors while Landsat tends to have the lowest omission error. The built-up area obtained from SPOT5/SPOT6 shows high consistency with the reference data for all European cities, and hence can potentially be considered as a reference dataset for wall-to-wall validation in Europe. © 2018 The Authors.

Cloud computing, due to its capabilities to deliver on-demand computing resources, has been embraced to develop and deploy interactive and scalable remote geovisualization applications. However, current cloud computing frameworks do not offer a versatile resource management scheme that is readily applicable for online remote visualization services, which usually require maintaining a satisfactory service level over time under dynamic workloads. To address this gap, we propose an automatic cloud resource management approach based on a bi-level scheduling and horizontal scaling scheme to exploit cloud resources efficiently. At the lower level, a dynamic task-scheduling scheme using collaborative filtering techniques is proposed to allocate virtual cloud resources to execute sub-tasks. The scheduling scheme considers spatio-temporal patterns presented in visualization views. At the upper level, reinforcement learning is adopted to perform resource auto-scaling based on a reward function that integrates three different facets, namely: time cost, resource cost, and service stability. The original reinforcement learning algorithm is improved in two main aspects: (1) considering the delay of resource provisioning that is common in cloud environments; and (2) using online Gaussian estimation to estimate Q values. Task scheduling and auto-scaling interact with each other and are integrated to deliver a comprehensive and responsive resource management solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several existing cloud resource management methods. The proposed approach is also applicable for other interactive visualization applications, which have similar workload characteristics and performance requirements as interactive remote geovisualization. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"GIS; remote sensing; spatial data; visualization",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055945780

However, most existing studies consider visitors as one group, while overlooking the difference in mobility patterns between subgroups of visitors and residents. In this research, we analyzed the mobility pattern of local Twitter users and visitor Twitter users, from the flow network and evenness distribution of user activities. The results show that short distance movement is the dominant type of activity not only for residents, but also for visitors. Moreover, intra-county movement accounts for the primary type of movement for all groups of Twitter users. Besides, the centrality index of Twitter users reconstructs a core–peripheral structure, and there is some relationship between the centrality index and population size. Further, the spatial distribution of evenness index at different spatial scales shows a clear “T”-shaped core–peripheral structure.

Extensive research has therefore been carried out to assess the quality of this product by applying a range of measures versus reference datasets, but little effort to date has been focused on quantitative quality estimation without reference datasets. The aim of this study is therefore to quantitatively estimate the completeness of street blocks in an OSM dataset. This was accomplished by initially exploring the relationship between geometric indicators (i.e., area, perimeter, and density) and street block completeness in an OSM road dataset, before these relationships were applied to quantitatively estimate completeness in other datasets. The results of this study show that: (1) street block completeness is positively correlated with density and negatively correlated with area and perimeter; and (2) in most cases, estimated completeness values for all street blocks within an OSM road dataset do not differ by more than 10% in absolute terms from actual completeness values.

A fundamental aspect of those models lies in the calibration of spatial parameters underlying such dynamics. Although there are many studies on the calibration of LC models, current efforts have a common goal of seeking to find a single global optimum solution, even though land change dynamics may be inherently heterogeneous throughout a given space. This article presents a calibration approach for finding multiple optimal solutions. A crowding niching genetic algorithm (CNGA) is incorporated into a cellular automata LC model. The model is applied to simulate urban expansion in Wallonia (Belgium) as a case study. Our findings demonstrate the ability of the model to locate multiple solutions simultaneously.

GIS practitioners often model terrains with 2D grids. However, TINs (Triangulated Irregular networks) are also increasingly used in practice. One such example is the 3D city model of the Netherlands (3DTOP10NL), which covers the whole country as one massive triangulation with more than one billion triangles. Due to the massive size of terrain datasets, the main issue is how to efficiently store and maintain them. The international 3D GIS standard CityGML allows us to store TINs using the Simple Feature representation. However, we argue that it is not appropriate for storing massive TINs and has limitations. We focus in this article on an improved storage representation for massive terrain models as TINs. We review different data structures for compactly representing TINs and explore how they can be implemented in CityGML as an ADE (Application Domain Extension) to efficiently store massive terrains. We model our extension using UML, and XML schemas for the extension are automatically derived from these UML models. Experiments with massive real-world terrains show that, with this approach, we can compress CityGML files up to a factor of ~20 with one billion+ triangles, and our method has the added benefit of explicitly storing the topological relationships of a TIN model. © 2018 The Authors.

In contrast to the point-like character of in situ observations and photographic analyses, the modeling of landscape visibility from digital data has the advantage of scanning geographical space in a systematic way. However, the tools currently available for visibility modeling are limited to the mapping of viewsheds. They require complementary operations for a complete landscape assessment, including direct and easy computation of landscape metrics. Furthermore, none of those tools integrates recent technical advances to better characterize the visible landscape by tangential vision (i.e., from ground level as opposed to vision by viewshed from above). Starting from this, PixScape software proposes to integrate a large set of functions for modeling landscape visibility while remaining interfaced with GIS software. This software can be used to perform a complete landscape assessment by computing a wide range of original landscape metrics. It performs tangential analysis in addition to viewshed analysis, which can produce more realistic outcomes. Because landscape visibility analysis over large areas implies significant computation time, the software also integrates a multi-resolution process intended to speed up calculations while also taking into account the cognitive abilities of human vision. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"GIS; landscape; software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053264341

While most studies have focused on approaches to better measure mixed land use, the dynamic activity patterns used to distinguish land use types have seldom been discussed. In light of this, in this study, a mixed land use evaluation model is constructed, which is driven by dynamic human activities hidden in social media data. Specifically, temporal topics related to human activities are first extracted from Twitter messages. On this basis, these topics are clustered with successive measurements of both temporal and semantic similarities, and then, they are further transformed into dynamic features. In addition, the dynamic feature-based Shannon entropy is employed for mixed land use evaluation. For verification, the building classes from OpenStreetMap are referenced to investigate their correlations with dynamic features in mixed land uses. Finally, a strong correlation demonstrates the effectiveness and power of the proposed method in the evaluation of mixed land uses. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"human activity; land use; modeling; social media; World Wide Web",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052920448

When clustering big geo-data such as social media check-in data, geotagged photos, and taxi trajectory points, traditional spatial clustering algorithms are facing more challenges. On the one hand, existing spatial clustering tools cannot support the clustering of massive point sets; on the other hand, there is no perfect solution for self-adaptive spatial clustering. In order to achieve clustering of millions or even billions of points adaptively, a new spatial clustering tool—HiSpatialCluster—was proposed, in which the CFSFDP (clustering by fast search and finding density peaks) idea to find cluster centers and the DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) idea of density-connect filtering for classification are introduced. The tool’s source codes and other resources have been released on Github, and experimental evaluation was performed through clustering massive taxi trajectory points and Flickr geotagged photos in Beijing, China. The spatial clustering results were compared with those through K-means and DBSCAN as well. As a spatial clustering tool, HiSpatialCluster is expected to play a fundamental role in big geo-data research. First, this tool enables clustering adaptively on massive point datasets with uneven spatial density distribution.

All these trends provide an urgent need for the development of comprehensive and efficient contingency plans in urban spaces. Evacuation plans are important solutions to protect people from unforeseen effects of disasters. However, evacuees’ speed differences have been ignored or little considered among most of the existing research on developing organized evacuation plans. This article presents a novel approach to planning a multi-speed evacuation. The objective is to minimize the whole network clearance time. Evacuees are grouped and each group is allocated a departure time and an evacuation route in order to minimize traffic conflicts. Three scheduling strategies and four priority rules are defined for determining the departure time of evacuation groups. Experiments based on a real-world case have been conducted to validate the approach and compare the performance of these strategies and rules. The major conclusion is that, with the proposed approach, an evacuation plan can avoid traffic congestion and minimize the whole network clearance time, and the choice of scheduling strategies and priority rules should be based on practical evacuation objectives. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"efficiency measurement; experimental study; hazard management; model validation; performance assessment; planning method; traffic congestion; urban planning; vulnerability",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052630885

Location-based services pose privacy risks for users, due to the inferences that could be made about them from their location information and the potential misuse of this data by service providers or third-party companies. A common solution is to apply masking or location obfuscation, which degrades location information quality while keeping a geographic coordinate structure. However, there is a trade-off between privacy, quality of service, and quality of information, the last one being a valuable asset for companies. NRand is a location privacy mechanism with obfuscation capabilities and resistance against filtering attacks. In order to minimize the impact on location information quality, NRand-K has been introduced. This algorithm is designed for use when releasing location information to third parties or as open data with privacy concerns. To assess the impact of location obfuscation on exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), a comparison is performed between obfuscated data with NRand, NRand-K, and unaltered data. For the experiments, geolocated tweets collected during the Central Italy 2016 earthquake are used. Results show that NRand-K reduces the impact on ESDA, where inferences were similar to those obtained with the unaltered data. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"comparative study; coordinate; information; spatial analysis; Italy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052621846

This fusion combines the technical capabilities of advanced cyber-infrastructure with the spatial analysis capabilities of GIS. How expert GIS practitioners perceive, use, and value the various components of CyberGIS is unknown, making student preparation for CyberGIS competency difficult. To address this gap, we reviewed the CyberGIS literature to develop a set of 37 key CyberGIS concepts. Then, we used Q-methodology to interview 20 expert GIS users to understand the components of CyberGIS they viewed as most applicable to their GIS practice. Three distinct conceptions of CyberGIS expertise emerged: the spatial analyst, the domain-specific problem solver, and the CyberGIS-enabled computer scientist. The CyberGIS-enabled computer scientist emphasized the underlying technologies which allow spatial analysts to discover and implement advanced methods and processes in GIS, which are then utilized by problem solvers to address domain-focused issues. These three contrasting perceptions of CyberGIS expertise raise questions about the nature of curriculum and instruction appropriate to develop competent CyberGIS practitioners.

Using sensor data streams enables real-time applications such as environmental hazard detection, or earthquake, wildfire, or radiation monitoring. In-depth analysis of such spatial fields is often based on a continuous representation. With very large numbers of concurrent observation streams, novel algorithms are necessary that integrate streams into rasters, or other continuous representations, continuously in real time. In this article, we present an approach leveraging data stream engines (DSEs) to achieve scalable, high-throughput inverse distance weighting (IDW). In detail, we designed and implemented a novel stream query operator framework that extends general-purpose DSEs. The proposed framework includes a two-panel, spatio-temporal grid-based index and several algorithms, namely the Shell and k-Shell algorithms, to estimate individual grid cells efficiently and adaptively for different sampling scenarios. For our performance experiments, we generated several different spatio-temporal stream data sets based on the radiation deposits in the Fukushima region after the nuclear accident of 2011 in Japan.

For example, a tourist guide translates from a map (“the fountain is north-west of the church”) into a cognitive frame for a tourist (“the fountain in front of the church”). While different types of cognitive reference frames and their relevance for language cultures have been studied in considerable depth, we still lack adequate transformation models. In this article, we argue that transformations in current Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are inappropriate to this end. Appropriate transformation models need to go beyond point discretization to take into account vague transformations, in order to deal with forms, sizes, and vagueness of spatial relations relative to ground objects. We argue that neural fields should be used to denote fuzzy positions, directions, and sizes in a particular frame. We propose fuzzy vector spaces to approximate neural field behavior with affine transformations, including fuzzy translation, rotation, and scaling, in order to efficiently transform between different cognitive perspectives. We use an implementation in Haskell to describe a geographic map from the perspective of six well-known cognitive frames of reference.

It is commonly computed using Shannon's equation, and has been widely used to characterize disorder and to bridge the gap between disorder and thermodynamic interpretations. However, the thermodynamic basis of Shannon entropy is questioned by researchers, and it is suggested to use Boltzmann entropy as an alternative. Very recently, the first and only computation method has been proposed for the Boltzmann entropy of a landscape gradient, but the method is not efficient as it involves a series of numerical processes, which are computation-intensive and time-consuming. To improve it, a novel method is proposed in this study by developing an analytical solution to the key mathematical problem of the original method and incorporating a parallelization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is both effective and efficient. Developed based on the proposed method, a software tool (as well as its source code) is released for free use. The proposed method and the developed tool shall contribute to an easy computation of the Boltzmann entropies of not only landscape gradients, but also remote sensing images and other quantitative raster data. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"entropy; experimental study; gradient analysis; imaging method; raster; remote sensing; thermodynamics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040621226

This study proposes a spatio-temporal data integrated compression method of vehicle trajectories based on stroke paths coding compression under the road stroke network constraint. The road stroke network is first constructed according to the principle of continuous coherence in Gestalt psychology, and then two types of Huffman tree—a road strokes Huffman tree and a stroke paths Huffman tree—are built, based respectively on the importance function of road strokes and vehicle visiting frequency of stroke paths. After the vehicle trajectories are map matched to the spatial paths in the road network, the Huffman codes of the road strokes and stroke paths are used to compress the trajectory spatial paths. An opening window algorithm is used to simplify the trajectory temporal data depicted on a time–distance polyline by setting the maximum allowable speed difference as the threshold. Through analysis of the relative spatio-temporal relationship between the preceding and latter feature tracking points, the spatio-temporal data of the feature tracking points are all converted to binary codes together, accordingly achieving integrated compression of trajectory spatio-temporal data. A series of comparative experiments between the proposed method and representative state-of-the-art methods are carried out on a real massive taxi trajectory dataset from five aspects, and the experimental results indicate that our method has the highest compression ratio. Meanwhile, this method also has favorable performance in other aspects: compression and decompression time overhead, storage space overhead, and historical dataset training time overhead. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"algorithm; comparative study; data set; GIS; network analysis; road transport; spatiotemporal analysis; trajectory",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052493064

We use a linear regression model with logarithmic transformation to approximate how the magnitude of each indicator changes with different data collection durations—from 1 to 12 months. The results indicate that both ROG and entropy increase when the amount of data increases. However, the rate of increase slows down and approaches zero eventually. We also approximated the limit values and verified that with 12-month data, we are at approximately >95% magnitude of the limit values for both indicators in all three cities. The clustering analysis also demonstrated that there are outlier users who exhibit distinct patterns. This case study focuses on three Chinese cities (Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou) and provides a useful reference to explore the balance point between data effectiveness and an appropriate sample size from LBSM data. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"GIS; human activity; modeling; regression analysis; social media; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Shanghai",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052491530

Social media data suffers from a variety of biases and limitations; nevertheless, with a proper understanding of the drawbacks, these data can be powerful. As cities seek to become “smarter,” they can potentially use social media data to creatively address the needs of their most vulnerable groups, such as ethnic minorities. However, questions remain unanswered regarding who uses these social networking platforms, how people use these platforms, and how representative social media data is of users' everyday lives. Using several forms of regression, I explore the relationships between a conventional data source (the U.S. Census) and a subset of Twitter data potentially representative of minority groups: tweets created by users with an account language other than English. A considerable amount of non-stationarity is uncovered, which should serve as a warning against sweeping statements regarding the demographics of users and where people prefer to post. Further, I find that precisely located Twitter data informs us more about the digital status of places and less about users' day-to-day travel patterns. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"social media; spatial analysis; World Wide Web; Houston; Texas; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045319172

However, signal jumps in mobile phone location data may create “fake moves,” which will generate fake activity patterns of “stops-and-moves.” These “fake moves” share similar spatiotemporal features with real short-distance moves, and the stops and moves of trajectories (SMoT), which is the most extensively used stop identification model, often fails to distinguish them when the dataset has coarse temporal resolution. This study proposes the stops, moves, and uncertainties of trajectories (SMUoT) model to address this issue by introducing uncertain segment analysis to distinguish “fake moves” and real short-distance moves. A real mobile phone location dataset collected in Shenzhen, China is used to evaluate the performance of SMUoT. We find that SMUoT improves the performance (i.e., 15 and 19% increase in accuracy and recall rate for a one-hour temporal resolution dataset, respectively) of stop identification and exhibits high robustness to parameter settings. With a better reliability of “stops-and-moves” pattern identification, the proposed SMUoT can benefit various individual activity-related research based on mobile phone location data for many fields, such as urban planning, traffic analysis, and emergency management. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"activity pattern; mobile phone; spatiotemporal analysis; trajectory; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044950232

The assessment of VGI quality and fitness-of-use is still a challenge because of the non-standardized and crowdsourced data collection process, as well as the unknown skill and motivation of the contributors. However, the frequent approach of assessing VGI quality against external data sources using ISO quality standard measures is problematic because of a frequent lack of available external (reference) data, and because for certain types of features, VGI might be more up-to-date than the reference data. Therefore, a VGI-intrinsic measure of quality is highly desirable. This study proposes such an intrinsic measure of quality by developing the concept of aggregated expertise based on the characteristics of a feature's contributors. The article further operationalizes this concept and examines its feasibility through a case study using OpenStreetMap (OSM).

This analysis provided new information on the background of people attending a festival in Jerusalem. Case study 2 located geographical entities from the text in a cartographic visualization and provided supportive information to compare contemporary textual resources. For the disciplines of textual and conjectural criticism (case study 3), spatio-temporal analysis opens a new window to study what would be the most probable variant of the original text. The case study puts emendations that have been proposed over centuries in a 3D spatial context and provides in this way a sophisticated tool to relate different alternative variants of a specific text. From the case studies, it can be concluded that spatializing, visualizing, and spatially analyzing geographical concepts from the texts in Acts 2 contributes to the field of New Testament interpretation.

The goodness-of-fit was assessed by comparison to logistic regression (LR) analysis. The LR analysis produced consistent coefficients for each independent variable across the study area. In contrast, an LCR analysis, with a three-class assumption, resulted in a different magnitude and directional effects of the coefficients for each class. The LCR analysis enabled the identification of both spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous areas.

At the local government level, open data initiatives have resulted in higher transparency in policy, a greater engagement between decision-makers and citizens, and have changed the culture about how data analysis and evidence are used to support local governance. This article, based on data collected through an on-line survey, participatory workshops with data user communities in four cities (in Colombia and Spain), and interviews with Valencia good-government office, identifies four elements for a conceptual framework to improve the re-usability of open geographic data in cities. The essential elements defined in this research are the definition of data user communities and their needs, the creation of the community of reuse, user-focused metadata, and reuse-focused legal terms. The definition of these indicators provides a framework for authorities to re-shape their current open data strategy to include data user requirements.

Understanding the intertwined usages of these three transit modes at different places and time allows for better sensing of urban mobility and the built environment. In this article, we leverage a comprehensive data collection of bus, metro, and taxicab ridership from Shenzhen, China to unveil the spatio-temporal interplay between different mass transit modes. To achieve this goal, we develop a novel spectral clustering framework that imposes spatio-temporal similarities between mass transit mode usage in urban space and differentiates urban spaces associated with distinct ridership patterns of mass transit modes. Five resulting categories of urban spaces are identified and interpreted with auxiliary knowledge of the city's metro network and land-use functionality. In general, different categorized urban spaces are associated with different accessibility levels (such as high-, medium-, and low-ranked) and different urban functionalities (such as residential, commercial, leisure-dominant, and home–work balanced). The results indicate that different mass transit modes cooperate or compete based on demographic and socioeconomic attributes of the underlying urban environments. Our proposed analytical framework provides a novel and effective way to explore the mass transit system and the functional heterogeneity in cities. It demonstrates great potential for assisting policymakers and municipal managers in optimizing public transportation facility allocation and city-wide daily commuting distribution. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"bus transport; mass transport; metro system; public space; public transport; taxi transport; urban transport; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051333651

These patterns are essentially related to the underlying geographical processes and landscapes. Thus, when deriving small-scale maps from a large-scale map, one of the most important constraints that cartographers or systems should follow is to retain the basic patterns of point objects on the target map. However, no research in the literature currently evaluates the quality of point feature generalization in terms of spatial pattern. This study proposes an approach to quantitatively measure the pattern change after generalization. The basic idea of the approach is to extend advanced image analysis techniques (e.g., texture recognition) to measure the patterns of point objects in a map space. Specifically, there are two main steps: firstly, the original space is converted into the raster space by utilizing a regularly spaced grid (i.e., a grayscale image) with cell attributes representing the local intensity level of point features; secondly, the texture analysis operation is performed on the grid to obtain the feature descriptors of the point pattern. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in comparing the point patterns before and after generalization. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"cartography; image analysis; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; raster; spatial variation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051091579

Aggregated geospatial big data have been widely used to quantitatively estimate population distribution at fine spatial scales over a given time period. However, it is still a challenge to estimate population density at a fine temporal resolution over a large geographical space, mainly due to the temporal asynchrony of population movement and the challenges to acquiring a complete individual movement record. In this article, we propose a method to estimate hourly population density by examining the time-series individual trajectories, which were reconstructed from call detail records using BP neural networks. We first used BP neural networks to predict the positions of mobile phone users at an hourly interval and then estimated the hourly population density using log-linear regression at the cell tower level. The estimated population density is linearly correlated with population census data at the sub-district level. Trajectory clustering results show five distinct diurnal dynamic patterns of population movement in the study area, revealing spatially explicit characteristics of the diurnal commuting flows, though the driving forces of the flows need further investigation. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"artificial neural network; census; commuting; GIS; mobile phone; population distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; trajectory; urban planning; urban population",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045767142

The delineation methods usually include conventional techniques of reservoir evaluation and mathematical models. The conventional reservoir evaluation results generally depend on the experts' knowledge and experience in the field. The mathematical methods mostly require accurate models to be proposed. Considering spatial relationships and characteristics of geological reservoir problems, including nonlinearity, complexity and uncertainty, a novel model called geospatial case-based reasoning for oil–gas reservoir evaluation was proposed in this article. The key components of the new model, including: (1) the joint representation of spatial relationship and attribute features; (2) the model of spatial relationship and attribute similarity joint reasoning; and (3) the methods of establishing weights for the spatial relationship and attribute features, are completely constructed. A case study of the proposed model for gas reservoir evaluation was carried out. Compared with the backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) and the geological empirical evaluation (GEE) methods, the model presented in this article performs 6.38% and 46.81% better than BP-ANN and GEE, respectively. Furthermore, its execution is simpler, more convenient, and importantly, its utilization hardly requires any professional knowledge of the field. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; back propagation; hydrocarbon reservoir; knowledge; natural gas; numerical method; spatial analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045736845

This article presents a novel approach to understanding the asymmetry in route choice (i.e., the degree to which people choose different walking routes for their outbound and return journeys). The study utilizes a large volume of traces of individual routes, captured using a smartphone application. The routes are aggregated to a regular grid, and matrix statistics are developed to estimate the aggregate degree of route asymmetry for different types of route (shortest, longest, weekday, weekend, etc.). The results suggest that people change their route approximately 15% of the time. Although this varied little when observing trips made at the weekend or on a weekday, people taking journeys that deviated substantially from the shortest possible path were 6 percentage points less likely to change their routes than those taking journeys that were closest to the shortest path (14 and 20% asymmetry, respectively). The absolute length also impacted on the asymmetry of journeys, but not as substantially. This result is important because, for the first time, it reports a correlation between deviation from shortest route and aggregate pedestrian choice. © 2018 The Authors.

In this study, we present a novel approach to analyze the demand–supply of health care services using taxi data. Taxi data provide observations of individual travel activities, and hence can be used to characterize the actual demand–supply of health care services. We apply the proposed approach in Guangzhou, China to carry out a case study. The results show the spatial disparities in health care service access. About 21.05% of the total population has high hospital accessibility, while the remaining 78.95% has relatively low hospital accessibility (i.e., roughly an “80/20” distribution). It is found that 6.29% of the population lives in high-density suburban communities but has relatively low hospital accessibility. Most of the hospitals serve a population that is compatible with their capacity. One hospital is found to have a small capacity but to serve a large population, while two hospitals have relatively high capacities but serve small populations.

Previous studies focus mainly on housing price analysis at a macro scale, without fine-scale study due to a lack of available data and effective models. By integrating a convolutional neural network for united mining (UMCNN) and random forest (RF), this study proposes an effective deep-learning-based framework for fusing multi-source geospatial data, including high spatial resolution (HSR) remotely sensed imagery and several types of social media data, and maps urban housing prices at a very fine scale. With the collected housing price data from China's biggest online real estate market, we produced the spatial distribution of housing prices at a spatial resolution of 5 m in Shenzhen, China. By comparing with eight other multi-source data mining techniques, the UMCNN obtained the highest housing price simulation accuracy (Pearson R = 0.922, OA = 85.82%).

These advances have provided new opportunities for geographical information science and spatial analysis—allowing the tools and theories to be expanded to new domain areas and providing the impetus for theory and methodological development. In this light, old problems of inference and analysis are rediscovered and need to be reinterpreted, and new ones are made apparent. This article describes a new typology of geographical analysis problems that relates to uncertainties in the relationship between individual-level data, represented as point features, and the geographic context(s) that they are associated with. We describe how uncertainty in context linkage (uncertain geographic context problem) is also related to, but distinct from, uncertainty in point-event locations (uncertain point observation problem) and how these issues can impact spatial analysis. A case study analysis of a geosocial dataset demonstrates how alternative conclusions can result from failure to account for these sources of uncertainty. Sources of point observation uncertainties common in many forms of user-generated and big spatial data are outlined and methods for dealing with them are reviewed and discussed. © 2018 The Authors.

Estimating the spatial distribution of heavy metals in soils is essential to preventing their build-up. This article aims to identify the effects of spatial scales, spatial autocorrelation, sampling methods, and proportion on interpolation models in estimating the distribution of heavy metals in soils. Six interpolation models (area-and-point kriging, AAPK; inverse distance weighting, IDW; local polynomial interpolation, LP; ordinary kriging, OK; simple kriging, SK; and thin plate spline, TPS), three sampling methods (random, stratified, and systematic sampling), and five sampling proportions (1, 5, 10, 15, and 20%) are considered in this study using sets of simulated data, and the real situation was tested for verification. The results show that, in general, with the increase of spatial autocorrelation or the sampling percentage, the accuracy and stability of different interpolation models gradually increase; however, the various interpolation models have their own specific characteristics and application conditions. The best application conditions of the interpolation models compared with other models under the same situation are summarized and explained in theory.

As a result, the question of how to update spatial data across different scales has become an attractive topic. One promising strategy is to use an updated larger-scale dataset as a reference for detecting and updating changed objects represented in a to-be-updated smaller-scale dataset. For such an update method, an understanding of the different types of changes that can occur is crucial. Using polygonal building data as an example, this study examines the various possible changes from different perspectives, such as the reasons for their occurrence, the forms in which they manifest, and their effects on output. Then, we apply map algebra theory to establish a cartographic model for updating polygonal building data. Supported by concepts of map algebra, an update procedure involving change detection, filtering, and fusion is implemented through a series of set operations. In addition to traditional polygon overlay functions, the constrained Delaunay triangulation model and knowledge of map generalization procedures are employed to construct set operations. The proposed method has been validated through tests using real-world data. The experimental results show that our method is effective for updating 1:10k map data using 1:2k map data. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"cartography; detection method; map generalization; numerical method; polygon; spatial data; triangulation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042555310

Therefore, pathfinding in point clouds is rapidly emerging. However, processing of raw point clouds can be very expensive, as these are semantically poor and unstructured data. In this article we present an innovative octree-based approach for processing of 3D indoor point clouds for the purpose of multi-story pathfinding. We semantically identify the construction elements, which are of importance for the indoor navigation of humans (i.e., floors, walls, stairs, and obstacles), and use these to delineate the available navigable space. To illustrate the usability of this approach, we applied it to real-world data sets and computed paths considering user constraints. The structuring of the point cloud into an octree approximation improves the point cloud processing and provides a structure for the empty space of the point cloud. It is also helpful to compute paths sufficiently accurate in their consideration of the spatial complexity. The entire process is automatic and able to deal with a large number of multi-story indoor environments. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"data set; indoor air; multistorey building; three-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042318655

Empirical evaluation of the validity of VGI to reveal geographic phenomena in historical periods (e.g., decades ago) is lacking, although such evaluation is desirable for assessing the possibility of broadening the temporal scope of VGI applications. This article presents an evaluation of the validity of VGI to reveal historical geographic phenomena through a citizen data-based habitat suitability mapping case study. Citizen data (i.e., sightings) of the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) were elicited from local residents through three-dimensional (3D) geovisualization interviews in Yunnan, China. The validity of the elicited sightings to reveal the historical R. bieti distribution was evaluated through habitat suitability mapping using the citizen data in historical periods. The results of controlled experiments demonstrated that suitability maps predicted using the historical citizen data had a consistent spatial pattern (correlation above 0.60) that reflects the R. bieti distribution (Boyce index around 0.90) in areas free of significant environmental change across historical periods. This in turn suggests that citizen data have validity for mapping historical geographic phenomena. It provides supporting empirical evidence for potentially broadening the temporal scope of VGI applications. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"data processing; empirical analysis; environmental change; GIS; habitat structure; historical record; mapping; temporal analysis; visualization; China; Yunnan; Pygathrix bieti",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042305370

In general, the existing methods of space–time series prediction can be divided into two main categories: statistical machine learning methods. Comparatively, machine leaning methods have obvious advantages with respect to handling nonlinear problems. However, space–time dependence and the heterogeneity of space–time data are not well addressed by the existing machine learning methods. Because of this limitation, an accurate prediction of a space–time series is still a challenging problem. Therefore, in this study, both space–time dependence and heterogeneity are incorporated into the feedback artificial neural network, and heterogeneous space–time artificial neural networks (HSTANNs) are developed for space–time series prediction. First, to handle spatial heterogeneity, space–time series clustering is used to divide the study area into a set of homogeneous sub-areas. Then, a space–time autocorrelation analysis is employed to explore the space–time dependence structure of the dataset. Finally, a HSTANN is established for each sub-area. Further, HSTANNs are applied to predict the concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei. The experimental results show that when compared with other methods, the accuracy of the forecasting results is considerably improved by using HSTANNs. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; data mining; heterogeneity; machine learning; nonlinearity; particulate matter; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; time dependent behavior; time series; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042305170

They can discover clusters with arbitrary shapes, are robust to noise, and do not require prior knowledge (or estimation) of the number of clusters. The idea of using a scan circle centered at each point with a search radius Eps to find at least MinPts points as a criterion for deriving local density is easily understandable and sufficient for exploring isotropic spatial point patterns. However, there are many cases that cannot be adequately captured this way, particularly if they involve linear features or shapes with a continuously changing density, such as a spiral. In such cases, DBSCAN tends to either create an increasing number of small clusters or add noise points into large clusters. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel anisotropic density-based clustering algorithm (ADCN). To motivate our work, we introduce synthetic and real-world cases that cannot be handled sufficiently by DBSCAN (or OPTICS). We then present our clustering algorithm and test it with a wide range of cases. We demonstrate that our algorithm can perform equally as well as DBSCAN in cases that do not benefit explicitly from an anisotropic perspective, and that it outperforms DBSCAN in cases that do. Finally, we show that our approach has the same time complexity as DBSCAN and OPTICS, namely O(n log n) when using a spatial index and O(n2) otherwise. We provide an implementation and test the runtime over multiple cases. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"algorithm; GIS; noise; spatial analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042302499

After investigating 100 road networks worldwide obtained from OpenStreetMap, it has been found that road networks are mostly disassortative or uncorrelated in stroke and named road representations, but assortative when represented as axial lines. Inconsistency in different measures persists regardless of method of representation; therefore, qualitative dichotomy or trichotomy is insufficient to describe the actual connection pattern in road networks.

Numerous studies have been carried out to delineate the drainage patterns based on gridded digital elevation models (DEMs). The triangulated irregular network (TIN) has been increasingly applied in hydrological applications due to the advantages of high storage efficiency and multi-scale adaptive performance. Much of the previous literature focuses mainly on filling the depressions on gridded DEMs rather than treating the special cases in TIN structures, which has hampered its applications to hydrological models. This study proposes a triangulation-based solution for the removal of flat areas and pits to enhance the simulation of flow routing on triangulated facet networks. Based on the drainage-constrained TIN generated from only a gridded DEM by the compound point extraction (CPE) method, the inconsistent situations including flat triangles, V-shape flat edges and sink nodes are respectively identified and rectified. The optimization algorithm is an iterative process of TIN reconstruction, in which the flat areas are generalized into their center points and the pits are rectified by embedding break lines. To verify the proposed algorithm and investigate the potential for flow routing, flow paths of steepest descent are derived by the vector-based tracking algorithm based on the optimized TIN. A case study of TIN optimization and flow path tracking was performed on a real-world DEM. The outcomes indicate that the proposed approach can effectively solve the problem of inconsistencies without a significant loss in accuracy of the terrain model. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"accuracy assessment; algorithm; digital elevation model; drainage; efficiency measurement; hydrological modeling; optimization; triangulated irregular network",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042256974

Geographic Information Systems and Technology (GIS&T) textbook development has been influenced by a unique set of circumstances, mainly the rapid development of the discipline within an interdisciplinary environment, which has resulted in a continuous state of evolution. We examine the anatomy of GIS&T textbooks through a comparison of their organization, content, and depth of coverage. Specifically, utilizing the Geographic Information Science and Technology Body of Knowledge (BoK) as a comprehensive reference, we categorize the content of 26 of the most widely used introductory GIS textbooks. Our results show that there has been consistent coverage of topics over time, with analytical methods and geospatial data being the most prominent topics covered in texts. However, individual textbooks place varying emphasis on the BoK knowledge areas, which is potentially useful to instructors seeking books that emphasize particular knowledge areas. Additionally, long-term trends indicate a shift toward an emphasis on new forms of geospatial data (e.g., social media). Ongoing efforts to expand and revise the BoK reflect how the discipline continues to manage its own evolution as new geographic research linked to GIS and GIScience emerges. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"anatomy; geographical research; GIS; knowledge; spatial data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042254998

We conducted interdisciplinary research by integrating flood modeling and traffic analysis to reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of the interplay between these two processes. A simplified simulation tool, which is capable of building a road network model, assigning trip paths with the effect of road closures, and evaluating travel delay and vehicle volume redistribution in a given PFF scenario, was developed to capture the traffic disruption in the face of PFF events. Modeling outputs from a case study in the city center of Shanghai showed that the delay of vehicles diverted to dry links or trapped in flooded links may reach 0.5 to 8 times the travel time in no-flood scenarios. Overall, approximately 1–7% of vehicle volumes on flooded links would be redistributed onto dry links (more likely major arterial roads). However, the vehicle volume variation during each time interval demonstrated evident disparity with the spatiotemporal change of flood inundations. Simulating and mapping the congestion can largely facilitate the identification of vulnerable links. Future research will test the method in other intra-urban areas and try to bridge the gap between modeling outputs and smart city planning and management. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"computer simulation; flash flood; interdisciplinary approach; modeling; numerical model; rainfall; road traffic; smart city; traffic congestion; travel time; urban planning; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040739871

This research proposes a new patch-based CA model to incorporate a spatial constraint based on the growth patterns of urban patches into the conventional CA model for reducing the uncertainty of the distribution of simulated new urban patches. In this model, the growth pattern of urban patches is first estimated using a developed indicator that is based on the local variations in existing urban patches. The urban growth is then simulated by integrating the estimated growth pattern and land suitability using a pattern-calibrated method. In this method, the pattern of new urban patches is gradually calibrated toward the dominant growth pattern through the steps of the CA model. The proposed model is applied to simulate urban growth in the Tehran megalopolitan area during 2000–2006–2012. The results from this model were compared with two common models: cell-based CA and logistic-patch CA. The proposed model yields a degree of patch-level agreement that is 23.4 and 7.5% higher than those of these pre-existing models, respectively. This reveals that the patch-based CA model simulates actual development patterns much better than the two other models. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"calibration; cellular automaton; computer simulation; land use change; numerical model; urban growth; Iran; Tehran [Iran]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040686744

However, the discovery of clusters of spatio-temporal events with different shapes and densities remains a challenging problem because of the subjectivity in the choice of two critical parameters: the spatio-temporal window for estimating the density around each event, and the density threshold for evaluating the significance of clusters. To make the clustering of spatio-temporal events objective, in this study these two parameters were adaptively generated from statistical information about the dataset. More precisely, the density threshold was statistically modeled as an adjusted significance level controlled by the cardinality and support domain of the dataset, and the appropriate sizes of spatio-temporal windows for clustering were determined by the spatio-temporal classification entropy and stability analysis. Experiments on both simulated and earthquake datasets were conducted, and the results show that the proposed method can identify clusters of different shapes and densities. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"classification; cluster analysis; data mining; data set; earthquake; GIS; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039165173

To enable this method, we focused on determining the matched areal object pairs that have all relations, one-to-one relationships to many-to-many relationships, in different spatial data sets by fusing geometric criteria without user invention. First, we identified candidate corresponding areal object pairs with a graph-based approach in training data. Second, three matching criteria (areal hausdorff distance, intersection ratio, and turning function distance) were calculated in candidate corresponding pairs and these criteria were normalized. Third, the shape similarity was calculated by weighted linear combination using the normalized matching criteria (similarities) with the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation method. Fourth, a threshold (0.738) of the shape similarity estimated in the plot of precision versus recall versus all possible thresholds of training data was applied, and the matched pairs were determined and identified. Finally, we visually validated the detection of similar areal feature pairs and conducted statistical evaluation using precision, recall, and F-measure values from a confusion matrix.

However, wildlife occurrences recorded by patrols in ranger-based monitoring programs suffer from positional errors, because recorded locations represent the positions of the ranger and differ from the actual occurrence locations of wildlife (hereinafter referred to as positional errors in patrol data). This study presented an evaluation of the impact of such positional errors in patrol data on SDM and developed a heuristic-based approach to mitigating the positional errors. The approach derives probable wildlife occurrence locations from ranger positions, utilizing heuristics based on species preferred habitat and the observer's field of view. The evaluations were conducted through a case study of SDM using patrol records of the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) in Yunnan, China.

Such models can help explain and estimate the scale effect and are thus of great interest. As patch morphology significantly influences patch evolution over data scale transformation, this study proposes a model that applies patch morphology metrics to explain and estimate the change in the patch and category area ratio in the upscaling of raster categorical data. In the experimental evaluation, area scaling of GlobeLand30 data under majority aggregation is studied intensively. Two metrics—the ratio of the patch area after aggregation to its original area and the ratio of the category area after aggregation to its original area—are used in this evaluation. The experimental results indicate that this model can adequately describe the pattern of the patch area change and precisely estimate the category area change arising from the resolution change. It is also demonstrated that the spatial distribution of patches has much less influence on the change in the category areas compared with the patch morphology. Additionally, the modeling approach in this study may also be adopted to investigate the scaling of other landscape metrics. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"GIS; modeling; patch size; raster; scale effect; spatial distribution",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031111570

We study the possibilities of UAS-based aerial surveys to produce photogrammetrically sound, high-resolution DEMs intended for geomorphometric modeling. The study was conducted at the Zaoksky testing ground (Russia). To carry out an aerial survey, we used a UAS Geoscan-101 equipped with a Sony DSC-RX1 camera and a Topcon GNSS receiver. Aerial photographs were processed using Agisoft PhotoScan Professional software. Applying dense point cloud generation and classification, we produced DEMs with resolutions of 6 cm, 20 cm, and 1 m. Using a universal spectral analytical method, we derived models of several morphometric variables (i.e., slope gradient, horizontal, vertical, minimal, and maximal curvatures) from DEMs with resolutions of 20 cm and 1 m. We found that it is possible to produce noiseless models and well-readable maps of morphometric variables for grassy areas with separately standing groups of trees and shrubs. However, UAS-based DEMs cannot be applied for modeling of forested areas: there occur pronounced unrecoverable artifacts due to errors of automated classification of the dense point cloud. Finally, we present recommendations for the production of UAS-derived, photogrammetrically sound, high-resolution DEMs intended for geomorphometry. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"aerial survey; digital elevation model; GNSS; morphometry; remote sensing; shrub; tree; Russian Federation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030244867

The alarming rise in urban density in Kuwait has caused issues for the residents' lifestyles, the economy and the environment. These issues have been aggravated by urban planning which perpetuated a city-centric urban form without modelling the impacts of current patterns of urban growth. A spatial model using Agent Based Modelling (ABM) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is proposed to model disaggregate future changes in land-use patterns given forecast population estimates and planning policies. The two main impacts considered are housing shortage and traffic congestion, as these are the two most significant social impacts for Kuwaitis. This article discusses the design methodology and parameterization of the ABM and the agent groups. It characterizes urban growth by rules for different citizen groups, historical growth patterns and the influence of decision-makers. The model is validated against data for the period 1995-2015 and simulations run to 2050; the results predict that continued city-centric growth will aggravate the problems, with more than 50% increase in housing shortage and congestion unless the government intervenes to rectify the situation. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"decision making; future prospect; GIS; numerical model; socioeconomic impact; urban development; urban growth; urban housing; urban planning; urban policy; Kuwait [Middle East]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026549563

It is necessary to develop representation and design methods which are suited to imprecise spatiotemporal data. This led to the recent proposal of the F-Perceptory approach. F-Perceptory models fuzzy primitive geometries that are appropriate in representing homogeneous regions. However, the real world often contains cases that are much more complex, describing geographic features with composite structures such as a geometry aggregation or combination. From a conceptual point of view, these cases have not yet been managed with F-Perceptory. This article proposes modeling fuzzy geographic objects with composite geometries, by extending the pictographic language of F-Perceptory and its mapping to the Unified Modeling Language (UML) necessary to manage them in object/relational databases. Until now, the most commonly used object modeling tools have not considered imprecise data. The extended F-Perceptory is implemented under a UML-based modeling tool in order to support users in fuzzy conceptual data modeling. In addition, in order to properly define the related database design, an automatic derivation process is implemented to generate the fuzzy database model. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"database; fuzzy mathematics; geometry; GIS; numerical model; spatial analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038429770

Various geographical small areas including specialized geographies such as Primary Care Service Areas (PCSAs) are used to measure primary care relevant outcomes and services, or to target interventions. PCSAs are small areas, the majority of patients resident in which obtain their primary care services from within the geography. The extent of this self-sufficiency of use is measured by the Localization Index (LI). PCSAs have been built in the US, Australia and Switzerland using an allocation algorithm, which, while simple and easy to implement, may require the use of various ad-hoc parameters. In this article we propose an optimization based approach to creating PCSAs, - an approach which has previously been used to generate labour flow regions in Ireland. The approach is data driven, thus requiring a minimal number of ad-hoc parameters. We compared the resulting PCSAs (or `rPCSAs') with PCSAs generated using the traditional allocation algorithm. We found that rPCSAs were generally larger, offered greater LIs and reflected patient travel patterns better than traditional PCSAs. Accounting for the larger size of rPCSAs showed that rPCSAs offered better LIs than similar sized traditional PCSAs. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"algorithm; GIS; health services; numerical model; optimization; primary health care; spatial analysis; Australia; Switzerland; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038424023

This article proposes a modified method based on previous research to simultaneously discover people's zones and movement patterns, called movement patterns between functional zones (MPFZ). The method attempts to take full advantage of taxi GPS data to identify MPFZs by merging the movement traces satisfying the merging conditions. Considering movement directions, movement numbers and the adjacent constraints that consist of spatial relationship and attribute features, the merging conditions limit the movement traces to be merged. The new MPFZs are discovered by an iteration process and are measured by the following three evaluation indices: v-value, a-value and c-value, which represent coverage, accuracy and their trade-off. Using a real-world taxi dataset of Beijing, 24 new MPFZs are discovered, which have higher v-, a- and c-values than the unmerged MPFZs. The results of the real-world dataset experiment show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient. The proposed method can also be applied to other types of transportation data and regions by adjusting the dataset utilized and controlling the iteration process. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"data set; GPS; movement; urban planning; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038422504

Each cell in a traditional CA model has a state that evolves according to transition rules, taking into consideration its own and its neighbors’ states and characteristics. Here, we present a multi-label CA model in which a cell may simultaneously have more than one state. The model uses a multi-label learning method—a multi-label support vector machine, Rank-SVM—to define the transition rules. The model was used with a multi-label land-use dataset for Luxembourg, built from vector-based land-use data using a method presented here. The proposed multi-label CA model showed promising performance in terms of its ability to capture and model the details and complexities of changes in land-use patterns. Applied to historical land use data, the proposed model estimated the land use change with an accuracy of 87.2% exact matching and 98.84% when including cells with a misclassification of a single label, which is comparably better than a classical multi-class model that achieved 83.6%.

Global logistic regression (LR) is a popular model employed to define the transition rules of Urban-CA. By considering the local characteristics, Geographically Weighted Logistic Regression (GWLR) provides interesting capabilities for urban growth modelling. In this research, in addition to using GWLR in the definition of transition rules, the advantages of integrating GWLR and LR for urban growth simulation were evaluated; these have not been considered in previous studies. Local and global probabilities obtained from the calibration of GWLR and LR were combined to define the transition rules of an Urban-CA. Urban growth was simulated in the Islamshahr sub-region located southwest of Tehran, Iran for the two periods 1992-1996 and 1996-2002, and data from these periods were used for training and testing the prediction abilities, respectively. In the first period, GWLR showed good performance and a significant contribution to the enhancement of the simulation performance, but in the second period, the effectiveness of LR on the prediction accuracy increased. Due to their complementary roles, the integration of the GWLR and LR models resulted in improved simulation performance in both periods. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"cellular automaton; computer simulation; integrated approach; logistics; numerical model; performance assessment; regression analysis; urban area; urban growth; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Tehran (PRV)]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026434208

Graphics processing units (GPUs) are powerful tools in data parallel processing but lie idle most of the time. In this study, we propose an approach to improve the performance of vector data rendering by using the parallel computing capability of many-core GPUs. Vertex transformation, largely a mathematical calculation that does not require communication with the host storage device, is a time-consuming procedure because all coordinates of each vector feature need to be transformed to screen vertices. Use of a GPU enables optimization of a general-purpose mathematical calculation, enabling the procedure to be executed in parallel on a many-core GPU and optimized effectively. This study mainly focuses on: (1) an organization and storage strategy for vector data based on equal pitch alignment, which can adapt to the GPU's calculating characteristics; (2) a paging-coalescing transfer and memory access strategy for vector data between the CPU and the GPU; and (3) a balancing allocation strategy to take full advantage of all processing cores of the GPU.

This study presents a new method based on multidirectional hill-shading maps, which identify the gully (i.e., shadow area) from inter-gully (i.e., non-shadow area). These shadows obtained from various illumination azimuths are merged; consequently, the border of the shadows, which is the gully boundary line, can be achieved. In this process, two key parameters, namely, altitude and azimuth of light, affect the accuracy of gully boundary extraction. The experiments in Yaojiawan area of China show that the method of average median slope of all sampling profiles across the gully boundary is effective and practical for light altitude selection. Moreover, the six azimuths are sufficient for gully boundary extraction in a loess hilly area. The application in the Madigou area indicates the replicability and rationality of this method. A comparison with the positive-negative terrain and slope variation method confirms a higher accuracy of gully boundary extraction by the proposed method in terms of visual interpretation, length, and contour-matching difference with reference to manually digitalized results.

Quick effective emergency response is the primary task post-disaster. A dynamic network flow model can be used to obtain an effective emergency material rescue plan for the transportation network. Strong timeliness is a critical factor to emergency response. However, very few efficient algorithms were presented for most dynamic network flow problems. To solve this issue, this article introduces a novel low-time-complexity exact algorithm using the continuous-time dynamic network flow (CTDNF) and the base state with amendment (BSA) model in the geographic information science field. Besides, this new CTDNF-BSA algorithm is improved to solve more complex cases with dynamic capacity and transmit time in a dynamic transportation network. Both numerical and geographic experiments were conducted to assess the correctness, time and space performance of the presented CTDNF-BSA algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that the CTDNF-BSA algorithm can attain the optimal solution with good computing time and space performance as compared with traditional algorithms. Geographic cases in dynamic situations for real emergency response illustrated that the CTDNF-BSA algorithm can provide effective decision support for emergency material rescue planning in a dynamic transportation environment. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","dynamic capacity; dynamic network flow; dynamic transmit time; emergency response; GIS","algorithm; dynamic analysis; earthquake damage; GIS; modeling; transportation system",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019071997

Granular computing rule extraction is combined with a feed forward artificial neural network to form a classifier capable of training a neural network on the basis of the rules provided by granular computing. It provides a transparent structure despite the traditional multi-layer neural networks. It also allows the classifier to be applied on a set of rules for each incoming pattern. Drawbacks of original granular computing (GrC) are covered, where some input patterns remained unclassified. The study was applied to classify seismic vulnerability of the statistical units of the city of Tehran, Iran. Slope, seismic intensity, height and age of the buildings were effective parameters. Experts ranked 150 randomly selected sample statistical units with respect to their degree of seismic physical vulnerability. Inconsistency of the experts' judgments was investigated using the induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator. Fifty-five classification rules were extracted on which a neural network was based. An overall accuracy of 88%, κ = 0.85 and R2 = 0.89 was achieved.

Methods and algorithms intended for plane square-gridded DEMs should not be directly applied to spheroidal equal angular DEMs. This is because these grids have fundamentally different geometry. However, some researchers continue to apply square-grid algorithms to spheroidal equal angular DEMs. It seems appropriate to consider once again the specifity of morphometric treatment of spheroidal equal angular DEMs. This article, first, demonstrates possibilities of direct calculation of local, nonlocal, and combined morphometric variables from spheroidal equal angular DEMs exemplified by slope gradient, catchment area, and topographic index. Second, the article shows computational errors when algorithms for plane square-gridded DEMs are unreasonably applied to spheroidal equal angular DEMs. The study is exemplified by two DEMs. A medium-resolution DEM of a relatively small, high-mountainous area (Mount Elbrus) was extracted from the SRTM1 DEM. A low-resolution DEM of a vast region with the diverse topography (the central and western regions of Kenya) was extracted from the SRTM30_PLUS DEM.

Other factors that may influence the prevalence of asthma are atmospheric parameters, physiographic elements and personal characteristics. These parameters can be incorporated into a model to monitor and predict the health conditions of asthmatic patients in various contexts. Such a model is the base for any asthma early warning system. This article introduces a novel ubiquitous health system to monitor asthmatic patients. Ubiquitous systems can be effective in monitoring asthmatic patients through the use of intelligent frameworks. They can provide powerful reasoning and prediction engines for analyzing various situations. Our proposed model encapsulates several tools for preprocessing, reasoning and prediction of asthma conditions. In the preprocessing phase, outliers in the atmospheric datasets were detected and missing sensor data were estimated using a Kalman filter, while in the reasoning phase, the required information was inferred from the raw data using some rule-based inference techniques. The asthmatic conditions of patients were predicted accurately by a Graph-Based Support Vector Machine in a Context Space (GBSVMCS) which functions anywhere, anytime and with any status. GBSVMCS is an improved version of the common Support Vector Machine algorithm with the addition of unlabeled data and graph-based rules in a context space. Based on the stored value for a patient's condition and his/her location/time, asthmatic patients can be monitored and appropriate alerts will be given. Our proposed model was assessed in Region 3 of Tehran, Iran for monitoring three different types of asthma: allergic, occupational and seasonal asthma. The input data to our system included air pollution data, the patients’ personal information, patients’ locations, weather data and geographical information for 270 different situations. Our results showed that 90% of the system's predictions were correct. The proposed model also improved the estimation accuracy by 15% in comparison to conventional methods. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","asthma; GIS; prediction; reasoning; ubiquitous system","asthma; atmospheric pollution; disease prevalence; early warning system; GIS; health risk; monitoring system; prediction; support vector machine; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Tehran (PRV)]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013077320

It has been repeatedly used to examine spatially varying relationships between epidemic diseases and predictors. Malaria, a serious parasitic disease around the world, shows spatial clustering in areas at risk. In this article, we used GWR to explore the local determinants of malaria incidences over a 7-year period in northern China, a typical mid-latitude, high-risk malaria area. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), temperature difference, elevation, water density index (WDI) and gross domestic product (GDP) were selected as predictors. Results showed that both positively and negatively local effects on malaria incidences appeared for all predictors except for WDI and GDP. The GWR model calibrations successfully depicted spatial variations in the effect sizes and levels of parameters, and also showed substantially improvements in terms of goodness of fits in contrast to the corresponding non-spatial ordinary least squares (OLS) model fits. For example, the diagnostic information of the OLS fit for the 7-year average case is R2 = 0.243 and AICc = 837.99, while significant improvement has been made by the GWR calibration with R2 = 0.800 and AICc = 618.54. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","geographically weighted regression; local determinants examination; malaria incidence; remote sensing monitoring data; spatial analysis models","malaria; modeling; regression analysis; remote sensing; spatial analysis; China",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030867985

To compute the conformity, the geometric similarity between the VGI road arc and the corresponding ground truth road arc, which is selected by the adaptive searching distance, is measured based on the symmetric arc similarity method; the geometric quality is assessed based on an assessment matrix. Also, the symmetric arc similarity method is independent of directions and with a feature of shift-independence, which is applicable to assess the geometric qualities of different VGI road networks and makes the assessment result consistent with the actual situation of the real world.

Hammond proposed criteria for classifying and mapping physiographic regions of the United States. Hammond produced a map entitled “Classes of Land Surface Form in the Forty-Eight States, USA”, which is regarded as a pioneering and rigorous treatment of regional physiography. Several researchers automated Hammond?s model in GIS. However, these were local or regional in application, and resulted in inadequate characterization of tablelands. We used a global 250 m DEM to produce a new characterization of global Hammond landform regions. The improved algorithm we developed for the regional landform modeling: (1) incorporated a profile parameter for the delineation of tablelands; (2) accommodated negative elevation data values; (3) allowed neighborhood analysis window (NAW) size to vary between parameters; (4) more accurately bounded plains regions; and (5) mapped landform regions as opposed to discrete landform features. The new global Hammond landform regions product builds on an existing global Hammond landform features product developed by the U.S. Geological Survey, which, while globally comprehensive, did not include tablelands, used a fixed NAW size, and essentially classified pixels rather than regions. Our algorithm also permits the disaggregation of “mixed” Hammond types (e.g. plains with high mountains) into their component parts. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"algorithm; classification; elevation; geological survey; GIS; mapping method; regional geography; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015250072

Water features are sensitive to scale change, therefore multiple representations are required to maintain visual and geographic logic at smaller scales. Partial pruning of polygonal features – such as long, sinuous reservoir arms, stream channels too narrow at the target scale, and islands that begin to coalesce – entails concurrent management of the length and width of polygonal features as well as integrating pruned polygons with other generalized point and linear hydrographic features to maintain stream network connectivity. The implementation follows data representation standards developed by the US Geological Survey (USGS) for the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Portions of polygonal rivers, streams, and canals are automatically characterized for width, length, and connectivity.

The results indicates a more accurate prediction pattern when a secondary geoinformation decision was included, thus suggesting that different types of geoinformation should be jointly analyzed.

Existing methods for identifying spatial co-location patterns usually require users to specify two thresholds, i.e. the prevalence threshold for measuring the prevalence of candidate co-location patterns and distance threshold to search the spatial co-location patterns. However, these two thresholds are difficult to determine in practice, and improper thresholds may lead to the misidentification of useful patterns and the incorrect reporting of meaningless patterns. The multi-scale approach proposed in this study overcomes this limitation. Initially, the prevalence of candidate co-location patterns is measured statistically by using a significance test, and a non-parametric model is developed to construct the null distribution of features with the consideration of spatial auto-correlation. Next, the spatial co-location patterns are explored at multi-scales instead of single scale (or distance threshold) discovery. The validity of the co-location patterns is evaluated based on the concept of lifetime. Experiments on both synthetic and ecological datasets show that spatial co-location patterns are discovered correctly and completely by using the proposed method; on the other hand, the subjectivity in discovery of spatial co-location patterns is reduced significantly. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","lifetime; multi-scale; pattern reconstruction; significance test; spatial co-location pattern","autocorrelation; data set; mining; spatial analysis; spatial variation; threshold",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006958112

Considering the capabilities of smart terminal devices, a 360° spherical level of detail (LoD) model for mobile street view services that renders panoramic images on the inner surface of a sphere via LoD is proposed in this article. Panoramic images are segmented into tiles and organized in a pyramid tile structure for LoD rendering to improve the rendering efficiency of the proposed model. A projection model between panoramic images and the spherical surface is presented to map the panoramic tiles on the spherical graticule. A street view-rendering algorithm of panoramic images is proposed with the rendering function of OpenGL for Embedded Systems (OpenGL ES). A street view service app running on Android, based on the proposed approach, is implemented to assess two aspects of the panoramic view model, namely visualization effect and efficiency. Experiment results reveal that the 360° spherical LoD model of the panoramic image can display 3D street view scenes better than the cubic panoramic view model. The proposed model also has an excellent 3D visualization effect and high-efficiency rendering ability for mobile street view services. Therefore, it is applicable in large-scale mobile street view services both online and offline and in augmented reality navigation. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","level of detail; mobile device; panoramic image; rendering; spherical; street view","algorithm; image processing; mobile phone",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006900419

This article aims at accommodating both spatial and non-spatial attributes in detecting clusters without the need to set parameters by default or prior knowledge. A novel adaptive dual clustering algorithm (ADC+) is proposed to obtain satisfactory clustering results considering the spatial proximity and attribute similarity with the presence of noise and barriers. In this algorithm, Delaunay triangulation is utilized to adaptively obtain spatial proximity and spatial homogenous patterns based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, a hierarchical clustering method is employed to obtain clusters with similar attributes. The hierarchical clustering method adopts a discriminating coefficient to adaptively control the depth of the hierarchical architecture. The clustering results are further refined using an optimization approach. The advantages and practicability of the ADC+ algorithm are illustrated by experiments on both simulated datasets and real-world applications. It is found that the proposed ADC+ algorithm can adaptively and accurately detect clusters with arbitrary shapes, similar attributes and densities under the consideration of barriers. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptive dual clustering; data mining; Delaunay triangulation; hierarchical structure; rural settlement zoning","algorithm; data mining; hierarchical system; optimization; rural area; settlement pattern; triangulation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006049856

In this study, a Geographic Service Recommender Model (GSRM) is proposed, which loosely comprises three essential steps. Firstly, location sequences are obtained through a clustering operation on GPS locations. To improve efficiency, a programming model with a distributed algorithm is employed to accelerate the clustering. Secondly, in order to mine spatial and temporal information from the cluster trajectory, an algorithm (MiningMP) is designed. Last but not least, the next possible location to which the user will travel is predicted. An integrated framework of GSRM could then be constructed and provide the appropriate geographic recommendation service by considering location sequences as well as other related semantic information. Experiments were conducted based on real GPS trajectories from Microsoft Research Asia (182 users within a period of five years). The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our proposed GSRM model is effective and efficient at predicting locations and can provide users with personalized smart recommendation services in the following possible position with excellent performance in scalability, adaptability, and quality of service. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","distributed computing; location prediction; location-based services; recommender service; trajectory pattern","algorithm; database; experimental study; GPS; service quality; spatial data; spatiotemporal analysis; trajectory; travel time",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996847851

We propose an alternative way by summarizing the warning messages based on landmarks, so that the messages can be short and convey even more information. We have designed two approaches to output such messages. They are the nearest landmark approach and the threshold approach, which differ in the way of determining which landmarks will be influenced by a certain flooded region. These two methods are implemented and we compare their performance through real and synthetic datasets. Experimental results show that the threshold approach usually takes less execution time than the nearest landmark approach.

Conventional model fitting methods have restricted ability to produce accurate estimates of the land cover-temperature association due to the lack of procedures to address two important issues: spatial dependence in proximal spatial units and high correlations among predictor variables. In this study, we seek to develop an effective framework called spatially filtered ridge regression (SFRR) to estimate the variations in the quantity and distribution of land surface temperature (LST) in response to various land cover patterns. The SFRR effectively integrates spatial autoregressive models and ridge regression, and it achieves reliable parameter estimates with substantially reduced mean square errors. We show this by comparing the performance of the SFRR to other widely adopted models using Monte Carlo simulation followed by an empirical study over central Phoenix. Results highlight the great potential of the SFRR in producing accurate statistical estimates, providing a positive step toward informed and unbiased decision-making across a wide variety of disciplines.

However, creating and maintaining gazetteers is still a complex task. Even though some online gazetteers provide rich sets of geographic names in planetary scale (e.g. GeoNames), other sources must be used to recognize references to urban locations, such as street names, neighborhood names or landmarks. We propose integrating Linked Data sources to create a gazetteer that combines a broad coverage of places with urban detail, including content on geographic and semantic relationships involving places, their multiple names and related non-geographic entities. Our final goal is to expand the possibilities for recognizing, disambiguating and filtering references to places in texts for geographic information retrieval (GIR) and related applications. The resulting ontological gazetteer, named LoG (Linked OntoGazetteer), is accessible through Web services by applications and research initiatives on GIR, text processing, named entity recognition and others. The gazetteer currently contains over 13 million places, 140 million attributes and relationships, and 4.5 million non-geographic entities.

This platform supports the collection of data required to build a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and the uptake, spatialization and dissemination of raw data generated from the outputs of different SWAT models for the Black Sea region. Scientists are documenting the data served by the platform in ISO standardized metadata to support informed use. SCOPED-W primarily targets the community of SWAT users in the Black Sea region but it can easily be replicated in other geographical areas. Additionally, the SCOPED approach is based on data interoperability that makes it fully compatible with other domains of application as demonstrated here with three original use cases.

The problem associated with wayfinding approaches solely based on information about network segments and personal preferences is that the information about segments in the database may not, correctly and/or adequately address user preferences. The problem associated with wayfinding approaches solely based on the ratings given to routes by wheelchair users is the lack of rates (or scores) for all possible routes between all possible origin-destination pairs in the network. This article discusses an approach to combine these two approaches for wayfinding to augment each other's shortcomings. To evaluate the personalized wayfinding approach, we utilize a route index, called a comparison index. The results show that with a P-value of 9%, the routes obtained from our approach are more accessible than the routes obtained from another approach developed in another study. To evaluate the collaborative wayfinding approach, a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted which reflects the updates in routes as users' feedbacks become available. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","accessibility; collaborative wayfinding; personalized pedestrian wayfinding; wheelchair users","accessibility; computer simulation; database; disability; Monte Carlo analysis; multicriteria analysis; navigation; pedestrian",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988815063

Although the development of electronic and telecommunication equipment has led to an increased amount and refined resolution of data about individuals’ spatio-temporal trajectories, the potential of such data, especially in the context of environmental health studies, has not been fully realized due to the lack of methodology that addresses location uncertainties. This article describes a methodological framework for deriving information about people's continuous activities from individual-collected Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is vital for a variety of environmental health studies. This framework is composed of two major methods that address critical issues at different stages of GPS data processing: (1) a fuzzy classification method for distinguishing activity patterns; and (2) a scale-adaptive method for refining activity locations and outdoor/indoor environments. Evaluation of this framework based on smartphone-collected GPS data indicates that it is robust to location errors and is able to generate useful information about individuals’ life trajectories. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","data mining; fuzzy logic; GIS; GPS; scale space; spatial uncertainty","activity pattern; data mining; fuzzy mathematics; GIS; GPS; methodology; monitoring; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988442252

We summarize 12 types of local topologies built on trajectory-region intersections, and derive their transition graph; then we capture and model evolving local topologies with two types of trajectory-region strings, a movement string and a stop-move string. The stop-move string encodes the stop information further during a trajectory than the movement string. Such a string-format expression of trajectory-region movement, although conceptually simple, carries unprecedented information for effectively interpreting how trajectories move with respect to regions. We also design the corresponding Finite State Automations for a movement string as well as a stop-move string, which are used not only to recognize the language of trajectory-region strings, but also to deal effectively with trajectory-region pattern queries. When annotated with the time information of stops and intersections, a trajectory-region movement snapshot and its evolution during a time interval can be inferred, and even the relationships among trajectories with respect to the same region can be explored. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","intersection; movement string; stop-move string; trajectory-region movement; trajectory-region pattern","automation; movement; numerical model; spatial analysis; topology; trajectory",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984870814

The use of a finite representation, instead of the real numbers theoretically required, causes many robustness problems which are well known in the literature. Such problems are made even worse in a distributed context, where data is exchanged between different systems and several perturbations can be introduced in the data representation. In order to discuss the robustness of a spatial dataset, two implementation models have to be distinguished: the identity and the tolerance model. The robustness of a dataset in the identity model has been widely discussed in the literature and some algorithms of the Snap Rounding (SR) family can be successfully applied in such contexts. Conversely, this problem has been less explored in the tolerance model. The aim of this article is to propose an algorithm inspired by those of the SR family for establishing or restoring the robustness of a vector dataset in the tolerance model. The main ideas are to introduce an additional operation which spreads instead of snapping geometries, in order to preserve the original relation between them, and to use a tolerance region for such an operation instead of a single snapping location. Finally, some experiments on real-world datasets are presented, confirming how the proposed algorithm can establish the robustness of a dataset. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","computational techniques; geographic information systems; spatial relationships; vector-based","algorithm; data set; experimental study; GIS; numerical model; spatial data; vector",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84980010027

Furthermore, the effect of positional uncertainty is often not assessed, despite its relevance to geographical applications. Although there has been much work in investigating the aforementioned types of uncertainty in isolation, combined approaches have not been much researched. This has resulted in a lack of tools for conducting mixed uncertainty analyses that include positional uncertainty. This research addresses the issue by first presenting a new, flexible, simulation-oriented conceptualization of positional uncertainty in geographic objects called F-Objects. F-Objects accommodates various representations of uncertainty, while remaining conceptually simple. Second, a new Python-based framework is introduced, termed Wiggly and capable of conducting mixed uncertainty propagation using fuzzy Monte Carlo simulation (FMCS). FMCS combines both traditional Monte Carlo with fuzzy analysis in a so-called hybrid approach. F-Objects is implemented within the Wiggly framework, resulting in a tool capable of considering any combination of: (1) probabilistic variables; (2) fuzzy variables; and (3) positional uncertainty of objects (probabilistic/fuzzy). Finally, a realistic GIS-based groundwater contamination problem demonstrates how F-Objects and Wiggly can be used to assess the effect of positional uncertainty. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"assessment method; GIS; groundwater pollution; Monte Carlo analysis; spatial variation; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976571095

Given that one of the dominant motivations for the provision of open data is to generate ‘value’, both economic and civic, there are valid concerns over the costs incurred in this pursuit. Typically, costs of open data are framed as internal to the data providing government. Building on the strong history of GIScience research on data provision via spatial data infrastructures, this article considers both the direct and indirect costs of open data provision, framing four main areas of indirect costs: citizen participation challenges, uneven provision across geography and user types, subsidy of private sector activities, and the creation of inroads for corporate influence on government. These areas of indirect cost lead to the development of critical questions, including constituency, purpose, enablement, protection, and priorities. These questions are posed as a guide to governments that provide open data in addressing the indirect costs of open data. © 2017 The Authors.

However, it is difficult to quantify the correct mix or the spatial relations among different POI types indicative of specific urban functions. In this research, we develop a statistical framework to help discover semantically meaningful topics and functional regions based on the co-occurrence patterns of POI types. The framework applies the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling technique and incorporates user check-in activities on location-based social networks. Using a large corpus of about 100,000 Foursquare venues and user check-in behavior in the 10 most populated urban areas of the US, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology by identifying distinctive types of latent topics and, further, by extracting urban functional regions using K-means clustering and Delaunay triangulation spatial constraints clustering. We show that a region can support multiple functions but with different probabilities, while the same type of functional region can span multiple geographically non-adjacent locations. Since each region can be modeled as a vector consisting of multinomial topic distributions, similar regions with regard to their thematic topic signatures can be identified. Compared with remote sensing images which mainly uncover the physical landscape of urban environments, our popularity-based POI topic modeling approach can be seen as a complementary social sensing view on urban space based on human activities. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"human activity; modeling; public space; remote sensing; social network; urban area; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021144614

Big geospatial data poses two unique challenges. First, raster and vector data structures and analyses have developed on largely separate paths for the last 20 years. This is creating an impediment to geospatial researchers seeking to utilize big data platforms that do not promote heterogeneous data types. Second, big spatial data repositories have yet to be integrated with big data computation platforms in ways that allow researchers to spatio-temporally analyze big geospatial datasets. IPUMS-Terra, a National Science Foundation cyberInfrastructure project, addresses these challenges by providing a unified framework of integrated geospatial services which access, analyze, and transform big heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. As IPUMS-Terra's data volume grows, we seek to integrate geospatial platforms that will scale geospatial analyses and address current bottlenecks within our system. However, our work shows that there are still unresolved challenges for big geospatial analysis. The most pertinent is that there is a lack of a unified framework for conducting scalable integrated vector and raster data analysis. We conducted a comparative analysis between PostgreSQL with PostGIS and SciDB and concluded that SciDB is the superior platform for scalable raster zonal analyses. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"comparative study; GIS; raster; software; spatial data; spatiotemporal analysis; vector",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021111617

In this article, we present a new approach to the detection of urban events based on location-specific time series decomposition and outlier detection. The approach first extracts long-term temporal trends and seasonal periodicity patterns. Events are defined as anomalies that deviate significantly from the prediction with the discovered temporal patterns, i.e., trend and periodicity. Specifically, we adopt the STL approach, i.e., seasonal and trend decomposition using LOESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing), to decompose the time series for each location into three components: long-term trend, seasonal periodicity, and the remainder. Events are extracted from the remainder component for each location with an outlier detection method. We analyze over a billion taxi trips for over seven years in Manhattan (New York City) to detect and map urban events at different temporal resolutions. Results show that the approach is effective and robust in detecting events and revealing urban dynamics with both holistic understandings and location-specific interpretations. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"data set; decomposition analysis; periodicity; spatial variation; temporal variation; time series analysis; urban area; Kansas; Manhattan; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021104491

The framework is applied to a Call Detail Record (CDR) dataset collected in Singapore. First, a comparative analysis is performed to understand how friends share urban space differently from random people. Then, we derive two metrics to quantify the “bonding” and “bridging” capabilities of places in the city. The two metrics reflect the potential of a place in connecting friends and random people (e.g., chance encounters), respectively. Finally, we examine the temporal signature of the places’ bonding capabilities, and associate the results with various types of Points of Interest (POIs). We find that: (1) friends are more likely to share urban space than random people, and they also share more locations; (2) a place could play different roles in connecting friends vs. random people, and the relationship (between bonding and bridging) varies depending on the time and type of a day (weekdays vs. weekends); (3) the temporal signature of bonding capability is strongly related to the semantics of a place; (4) certain POI types (e.g., shopping malls) tend to have a much higher impact on bonding capability than others (e.g., sports centers). © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"comparative study; data set; GIS; mobile phone; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021089751

Two-dimensional Fourier transforms have been most successful when modeling features with a high frequency over the sample space. This research focuses on applications of 2D discrete Fourier transforms for karst and spur and groove coral reefs, using ArcGIS geoprocessing tools extended with Python NumPy numerical methods. Ten-meter digital elevation data from Puerto Rico and Kentucky holokarst landscapes and five-meter bathymetry from more unidirectional spur and groove coral reefs at Midway Atoll were analyzed. Our method identifies the dominant contributing waves in frequency space, and analyzed power contributions by 5° and 15° azimuth bins. A limiting factor in this analysis is the spatial extent of consistent morphology in the landscape. In contrast to time-domain Fourier analysis, dominant landform frequencies can thus be of low magnitude, creating an imprecise estimate of wave morphometry and direction since this is derived from the combination of inverted x and y frequency values, and the limited frequency grain inherent in the discrete model degrades precision in the solution.

The quantification of this perception would be very useful in many applications. This article presents the first approach to determining the visible volume, which we call the 3D-viewshed, in each and all the points of a DEM (Digital Elevation Model). Most previous visibility algorithms in GIS (Geographic Information Systems) are based on the concept of a 2D-viewshed, which determines the number of points that can be seen from an observer in a DEM. Extending such a 2D-viewshed to 3D space, then to all the DEM-points, is too expensive computationally since the viewshed computation per se is costly. In this work, we propose the first approach to compute a new visibility metric that quantifies the visible volume from every point of a DEM. In particular, we developed an efficient algorithm with a high data and calculation re-utilization.

Three new parallel strategies are proposed. First, a decomposition strategy considering the calculation complexity of polygons and limited GPU memory is developed to achieve balanced workloads among multiple GPUs. Second, a parallel CPU/GPU scheduling strategy is proposed to conceal the data read/write times. The CPU is engaged with data reads/writes while the GPU rasterizes the polygons in parallel. This strategy can save considerable time spent in reading and writing, further improving the parallel efficiency. Third, a strategy for utilizing the GPU's internal memory and cache is proposed to reduce the time required to access the data. The parallel boundary algebra filling (BAF) algorithm is implemented using the programming models of compute unified device architecture (CUDA), message passing interface (MPI), and open multi-processing (OpenMP). Experimental results confirm that the implemented parallel algorithm delivers apparent acceleration when a massive dataset is addressed (50.32 GB with approximately 1.3 × 108 polygons), reducing conversion time from 25.43 to 0.69 h, and obtaining a speedup ratio of 36.91.

However, the upper throughput limit of street networks is unknown in detail. This article studies the transport process of networks and finds that any connected network has a maximum throughput depending on the topological and structural properties of the network. Based on this, the maximum throughput of street networks is obtained. Experiments show that when the street network remains unchanged, the maximum throughput of the street network is limited and is dependent on road capacity and average path length, regardless of adopted routing algorithms. Our findings suggest that the throughput of networks can be improved by increasing node capacity or decreasing average path length, but the maximum transport capacity of the network cannot be greater than the ratio of the sum of all the nodes' capacities to the average path length of the network, no matter what routing strategies are adopted.

Here we tested the potential of geo-located tweets from the social media application, Twitter, as a covariate in the production of population maps. The density of geo-located tweets in 1x1 km grid cells over a 2-month period across Indonesia, a country with one of the highest Twitter usage rates in the world, was input as a covariate into a previously published random forests-based census disaggregation method.

In this article, a Spatial Anomaly Points and Regions Detection method using multi-constrained graphs and local density (SAPRD for short) is proposed. The SAPRD algorithm first models spatial proximity relationships between spatial entities by constructing a Delaunay triangulation, the edges of which provide certain statistical characteristics. By considering the difference in non-spatial attributes of adjacent spatial entities, two levels of non-spatial attribute distance constraints are imposed to improve the proximity graph. This produces a series of sub-graphs, and those with very few entities are identified as candidate spatial anomalies. Moreover, the spatial anomaly degree of each entity is calculated based on the local density. A spatial interpolation surface of the spatial anomaly degree is generated using the inverse distance weight, and this is utilized to reveal potential spatial anomalies and reflect their whole areal distribution. Experiments on both simulated and real-life spatial databases demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the SAPRD algorithm. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"algorithm; anomaly; database; detection method; interpolation; triangulation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977590631

Realizing the threat that ticks pose to public health, two Dutch citizen science projects have collected tick bite reports since 2006. This unique volunteered geographical dataset, which currently has nearly 35,000 reports, was used to identify environmental and other circumstantial factors associated with tick bites. For this, we first enriched the tick bite reports with temperature, precipitation, vegetation and volunteered data associated with the location of the tick bite. Using this enriched dataset, we then derived a series of features to characterize the environmental and volunteer-related conditions in which each tick bite occurred. Next, we discretized these features using the Jenks Natural Breaks algorithm and, after that, we mined frequent environmental patterns associated with tick bites using the AprioriClose algorithm. Finally, we checked that these patterns are specifically associated with the tick bites by comparing them with the frequent patterns mined from pseudo-random locations. The frequent patterns were visualized using heat maps and ring maps and two representative patterns associated with tick bites were projected into geographic space to study their spatio-temporal distribution. Our results show that factors linked to human activity are more relevant to model tick bites than seasonal accumulations of temperature, vegetation or precipitation. In particular, the number of warm and dry days per season are present in a significant number of patterns and the majority of tick bites are produced within a distance of half a kilometer of a forest, recreational or built-up area. The study of patterns in the time-series revealed that there are several persistent patterns consistently occurring each year and the validation process showed that the volunteer tick bites collection is capturing environmental conditions associated with tick bites, suggesting that these reports have a high scientific value. These results support the creation of a Dutch tick bite risk map that, in turn, will open the door to the design of public health interventions to reduce the incidence of Lyme disease. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"disease incidence; GIS; health risk; model validation; population structure; public health; risk assessment; tick; Netherlands; Ixodida",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84970021735

However, while massive and manifold data is continuously produced voluntarily and applications are built for information and knowledge extraction, the initially introduced concept of VGI lacks certain methodological perspectives in this regard which have not been fully elaborated. In this article we highlight and discuss an important gap in this concept, i.e. the lack of formal acknowledgment of temporal aspects. By coining the proposed advanced framework ‘Volunteered Geo-Dynamic Information’ (VGDI), we attempt to lay the ground for full conceptual and applied spatio-temporal integration. To illustrate that integrative approach of VGDI and its benefits, we describe the potential impact on the field of dynamic population distribution modeling. While traditional approaches in that domain rely on survey-based data and statistics as well as static geographic information, the use of VGDI enables a dynamic setup. Foursquare venue and user check-in data are presented for a test site in Lisbon, Portugal. Two core modules of spatio-temporal population assessment are thereby addressed, namely time use profiling and target zone characterization, motivated by the potential integration in existing population dynamics frameworks such as the DynaPop model. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"geodynamics; GIS; modeling; population distribution; population dynamics; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964596860

Besides gathering data for scientific research and to support management, the platform raises awareness about invasive plants. The platform has been available since March 2013 and receives data from a smartphone application and a Web application. Validated sightings are shown on an online map.

Inter-volunteer agreement exceeded 90% for about 80% of the images and was negatively correlated with volunteer-expressed uncertainty about image classification. A total of 343 relatively difficult images were independently classified as cropland, non-cropland or impossible by two experts. The experts disagreed weakly (one said impossible while the other rated as cropland or non-cropland) on 27% of the images, but disagreed strongly (cropland vs. non-cropland) on only 7%.

To preserve the drainage pattern during the generalization process, this article proposes a solution to deal with many factors, such as the tributary length and the order in river tributary selection. This leads to a multi-objective optimization problem solved with a Genetic Algorithm. In the multi-objective model, different weights are used to aggregate all objective functions into a fitness function. The method is applied on a case study to evaluate the importance of each factor for different types of drainage and results are compared with a manually generalized network. The result can be controlled by assigning different weights to the factors. From this work, different weight settings according to drainage patterns are proposed for the river network generalization. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"cartography; drainage; genetic algorithm; GIS; stream channel; tributary",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960976686

Road networks are amongst the most frequently occurring spatial content within the OSM database. These road network representations are usable in many applications. However the quality of these representations can vary between locations. Comparing OSM road networks with authoritative road datasets for a given area or region is an important task in assessing OSM's fitness for use for applications like routing and navigation. Such comparisons can be technically challenging and no software implementation exists which facilitates them easily and automatically. In this article we develop and propose a flexible methodology for comparing the geometry of OSM road network data with other road datasets. Quantitative measures for the completeness and spatial accuracy of OSM are computed, including the compatibility of OSM road data with other map databases. Our methodology provides users with significant flexibility in how they can adjust the parameterization to suit their needs. This software implementation is exclusively built on open source software and a significant degree of automation is provided for these comparisons.

The local convex hull method recently developed for home range delineation to provide these measures was compared with that of the widely applied parametric kernel density estimation and with the commonly used tile method. The assessment used location records from 14 years of aerial surveys on four mammalian herbivores selected because of their distinct distribution patterns. Impala showed an almost continuous distribution with few gaps, wildebeest a wide distribution with regional concentrations, waterbuck a linear distribution along rivers, and sable antelope a widespread but patchy distribution. The kernel method tended to extend ranges beyond observed records, obscuring gaps within distributions. With parametric kernel approaches, bandwidth obtained via Least Squares Cross Validation techniques was not optimal when the local abundance was widely disparate, as was the case for wildebeest. The LoCoH method most effectively revealed meaningful gaps. The LoCoH method is advantageous for precisely mapping the distributions of conspicuous species for which the absence of records indicates true gaps in occurrence. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"abundance; aerial survey; assessment method; GIS; herbivore; least squares method; mapping; population distribution; ungulate; Aepyceros melampus; Hippotragus; Kobus ellipsiprymnus; Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953449792

Results of our investigation show that reproducibility issues related to data are a serious concern, while reproducibility issues related to analysis methods and processes face fewer challenges.

The NMAs varied greatly in their engagement with the community generating volunteered geographic information (VGI) and in their future plans. From an assessment of NMA standard practices, it was evident that much VGI was acquired with a positional accuracy that, while less than that typically acquired by NMAs, actually exceeded the requirements of the nominal data capture scale used by most NMAs. Opportunities for VGI use in map revision and updating were evident, especially for agencies that use a continuous rather than cyclical updating policy. Some NMAs had also developed systems to engage with citizen sensors and examples are discussed. Only rarely was VGI used to collect data on features beyond the standard set used by the NMAs. The potential role of citizen sensing and so its current scale of use by NMAs is limited by a series of concerns, notably relating to issues of data quality, the nature and motivation of the contributors, legal issues, the sustainability of data source, and employment fears of NMA staff.

First, screen pixels are inversely projected onto a 3D terrain surface, and then onto the 2D vector plane. Next, these pixels are classified into three categories in terms of their intersection situation with the 2D lines. After that, a multiple sampling process is applied to the pixels that intersect with the 2D lines in order to eliminate visual artifacts, such as intermittence and aliasing (in pixel scale). Finally, a suitable point-in-polygon judgment is implemented to color each sample point quickly. The algorithm is realized in a heterogeneously parallel model so that the performance is improved and becomes acceptable. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"digital terrain model; GIS; optimization; pixel; three-dimensional modeling; vector",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971219338

The interpretation process requires highly structured models representing semantics. Formal grammars can describe structures as well as the parameters of buildings and their parts. We propose a novel approach for the automatic learning of weighted attributed context-free grammar rules for 3D building reconstruction, supporting the laborious manual design of rules. We separate structure from parameter learning. Specific Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used to generate a weighted context-free grammar and predict structured outputs such as parse trees. The grammar is extended by parameters and constraints, which are learned based on a statistical relational learning method using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). MLNs enforce the topological and geometric constraints. MLNs address uncertainty explicitly and provide probabilistic inference. They are able to deal with partial observations caused by occlusions. Uncertain projective geometry is used to deal with the uncertainty of the observations. Learning is based on a large building database covering different building styles and façade structures. In particular, a treebank that has been derived from the database is employed for structure learning. © 2016 The Authors.

Specifically, a fuzzy logic reasoning was adopted to overcome the influence of location uncertainty by estimating the probability of different activity types for single GPS points. Based on that approach, a segment aggregation method was developed to infer activity patterns, while adjusting for uncertainties of point attributes. Validations of the proposed methods were carried out based on a convenient sample of three subjects with different types of smartphones.

We apply a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based method for matching cycling tracks to a “bicycle network” extracted from crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, and evaluate its effective differences in terms of optimal routing compared with a simple geometric point-to-curve method. OSM has quickly established itself as a popular resource for bicycle routing; however, its high-level of detail presents challenges for its applicability to popularity-based routing. We propose a solution where bikeways are prioritized in map-matching, achieving good performance; the HMM-based method matched correctly on average 94% of the route length. In addition, we show that the extremely biased nature of the trajectory dataset, which is typical of volunteered user-generated data, can be of high importance in terms of popularity-based routing. Most computed routes diverged depending on whether the number of users or number of tracks was used as an indicator of popularity, which may imply varying preferences among different types of cyclists. Revising the number of tracks by diversity of users to surmount local biases in the data had a more limited effect on routing. © 2016 The Authors.

Existing methods have focused on the similarities of spatial relations and spatial scenes but have not considered the variations in geometrical representations and relations over scales. This study developed some new measures to assess the similarities of both single- and multi-scale qualitative locations. Region- and cell-based models were used to formalize qualitative locations of spatial objects with respect to multi-scale frames of reference. The similarities were assessed by integrating the similarities of frames and qualitative relations. The frame similarity measures how two objects are compared considering the common elements that they occupy in the reference frames. Moreover, the similarity of qualitative relation measures how two relations relate two objects to the corresponding elements in the frames. The location similarities at a single level integrate the similarities of the frames and qualitative relations, whereas the location similarities at multiple scales incorporate the variations in qualitative locations over scales. These methods were used to assess location similarities concerning residential areas, roads, and lakes. The results indicated that the location-based measurements can disclose the distributions of the similarities and that the cell-based model is more accurate than the region-based model. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"accuracy assessment; geometry; GIS; location theory; numerical model; qualitative analysis; spatial analysis; spatial data; variance analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959016880

However, in most geospatial applications the current literature does not elaborate on specifications of the SVM method with respect to data sampling, attribute selection and optimal parameters choices. Therefore the main objective of this study is to present and investigate the SVM technique for modeling urban land use change. The SVM model building procedure is presented together with the detailed evaluation of the output results with respect to the choice of datasets, attributes and the change of SVM parameters. Geospatial datasets containing nine land use classes and spatial attributes for the Municipality of Zemun, Republic of Serbia were used for years 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2011. The Correlation-based Feature Subset method, kappa coefficient, Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and kappa simulation were used to perform the model evaluation and compare the model outputs with the real land use datasets. The obtained results indicate that the SVM-based models perform better when implementing balanced data sampling, reduced data sets to informative subsets of attributes and properly identify the optimal learning parameters. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"algorithm; data set; land use change; modeling; remote sensing; support vector machine; urban planning; Serbia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991512343

The latter predominates in the design of building footprints and building parts such as façades. Thus the identification and modeling of this valuable information facilitates the reconstruction of these buildings and their parts. This article presents a novel approach for the automatic identification and modelling of symmetries and their hierarchical structures in building footprints, providing an important prior for façade and roof reconstruction. The uncertainty of symmetries is explicitly addressed using supervised machine learning methods, in particular Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Unlike classical statistical methods, for SVMs assumptions on the a priori distribution of the data are not required. Both axial and translational symmetries are detected. The quality of the identified major and minor symmetry axes is assessed by a least squares based adjustment. Context-free formal grammar rules are used to model the hierarchical and repetitive structure of the underlying footprints. We present an algorithm which derives grammar rules based on the previously acquired symmetry information and using lexical analysis describing regular patterns and palindrome-like structures. This offers insights into the latent structures of building footprints and therefore describes the associated façade in a relational and compact way. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"automation; building; design; esthetics; hierarchical system; least squares method; machine learning; modeling; support vector machine",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991434478

Its advantage lies in simultaneously improving trend estimation, variogram estimation and spatial interpolation. MODIS data and simulated data were used as sampling fields to draw sample sets using scLHS, cLHS, cLHS with x and y coordinates as covariates, simple random and spatial even sampling methods, and the distribution and prediction errors of sample sets from different methods were evaluated.

The work presents an agent-based model that simulates the movement of police vehicles, using a record of real calls for service and real levels of police staffing in spatially explicit environments to emulate the demands on the police force. The GPS traces of the simulated officers are compared with real officer movement GPS data in order to assess the quality of the generated movement patterns.

First, the SPAWNN toolkit distinguishes between self-organizing neural networks and spatial context models with which the networks can be combined to incorporate spatial dependence and provides implementations for both. This distinction maintains modularity and enables a multitude of useful combinations for analyzing spatial data with self-organizing neural networks. Second, SPAWNN interactively links different self-organizing networks and data visualizations in an intuitive manner to facilitate explorative data analysis. Third, it implements cutting-edge clustering algorithms for identifying clusters in the trained networks. Toolkits such as SPAWNN are particularly needed when researchers and practitioners are confronted with large amounts of complex and high-dimensional data.

This article presents a method for automatically deriving road attributes by analyzing and mining movement trajectories (e.g. GPS tracks). We have investigated the automatic extraction of eight road attributes: directionality, speed limit, number of lanes, access, average speed, congestion, importance, and geometric offset; and we have developed a supervised classification method (decision tree) to infer them. The extraction of most of these attributes has not been investigated previously. We have implemented our method in a software prototype and we automatically update the OpenStreetMap (OSM) dataset of the Netherlands, increasing its level of completeness. The validation of the classification shows variable levels of accuracy, e.g. whether a road is a one- or a two-way road is classified with an accuracy of 99%, and the accuracy for the speed limit is 69%. When taking into account speed limits that are one step away (e.g. 60 km/h instead of the classified 50 km/h) the classification increases to 95%, which might be acceptable in some use-cases.

Compared with the existing algorithms, which only focus either on geometry simplification or on topological consistency, our algorithm simplifies the map composed of series of polylines and constraint points while maintaining the topological relationships in the map, maximizing the number of removal points, and minimizing error distance efficiently. Unlike some traditional geometry simplification algorithms, such as Douglas and Peucker's, which add points incrementally, we remove points sequentially based on a priority determined by heuristic functions. In the first stage, we build a graph to model the topology of points in the map from which we determine whether a point is removable or not. As map generalization is needed in different applications with different requirements, we present two heuristic functions to determine the priority of points removal for two different purposes: to save storage space and to reduce computation time. The time complexity of our algorithm is O(nlogk) which is efficient enough to be considered for real-time applications. Experiments on real maps were conducted and the results indicate that our algorithm produces high quality results; one heuristic function results in higher removal points saving storage space and the other improves the time performance significantly. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"algorithm; map generalization; map graphics; topology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953449795

This study applies the displacement operator in cartographic generalization to resolve such spatial conflicts and to improve the clarity and legibility of map. The immune genetic algorithm (IGA) is used in this study for buildings displacement to solve conflicts. IGA is based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and employs the self-adjusting mechanism of antibody concentration to enhance population diversity. Meanwhile, the elitism retention strategy is adopted in IGA to guarantee that the best individual (antibody) is not lost and destroyed in the next generation to strengthen convergence efficiency. The compared experiment between IGA and GA shows that the displacement result produced by IGA performs better than GA. Finally, in order to make the displaced map more attractive to cartographers, two constraints – the building alignment constraint and building tangent relation constraint – are applied in IGA to restrict the buildings’ displacement. The same experimental data are adopted to prove that the improved IGA is useful for maintaining the two constraints. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"building; cartography; displacement; genetic algorithm; mapping",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949514798

Raster-based shortest path techniques are widely applied in route planning for wayfinding, corridor alignment, robotics and video gaming to derive an obstacle avoiding path, but represent an approximation approach for solving this problem. This research compares vector and raster approaches for identifying obstacle-avoiding shortest paths/routes. Empirical assessment is carried out for a number of planning applications, highlighting representational issues, computational requirements and resulting path efficiency. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"algorithm; GIS; optimization; raster; vector",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945406862

However, the outcome of such models is accompanied by uncertainties that have to be taken into account in order to address their reliability for science and decision-making. While a range of approaches exist that quantify the disagreement of land change maps, the quantification of uncertainty remains a major challenge. The aim of this article is therefore to reveal uncertainties in land change modeling by developing two measures: quantity uncertainty and allocation uncertainty. We choose a Bayesian Belief Network modeling approach for deforestation in Brazil to develop and apply the two measures to the resulting probability surface. Quantity uncertainty describes the uncertainty about the correct number of cells in a land change map assigned to different land change categories and allocation uncertainty expresses the uncertainty about the correct spatial placement of a cell in the land change map. Thus, uncertainty can be quantified even in those cases where no reference data exist. Informing about uncertainty in probabilistic outcomes may be an important asset when land change projections are being used in science and decision-making and moreover, they may also be further evaluated for other spatial applications. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"Bayesian analysis; deforestation; land use change; mapping; modeling; probability; uncertainty analysis; Brazil",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944413397

In this article we investigate an alternative to obtaining CityGML LOD3 models: the automatic conversion from already existing architectural models (stored in the IFC format). Existing conversion algorithms mostly focus on the semantic mappings and convert all the geometries, which yields CityGML models having poor usability in practice (spatial analysis, for instance, is not possible). We present a conversion algorithm that accurately applies the correct semantics from IFC models and that constructs valid CityGML LOD3 buildings by performing a series of geometric operations in 3D.

We argue that geospatial analysis provides an important perspective to measure the concept. In particular, measuring territorial control can be seen as an application of calculating service areas around points of control. The modeling challenge is acute for areas with limited road infrastructure, where no complete network is available to perform the analysis, and movements largely occur off road. We present a new geospatial approach that applies network analysis on a hybrid transportation network with both actual road data and hexagon-fishnet-based artificial road data representing on-road and off-road movements, respectively. Movement speed or restriction can be readily adjusted using various input data. Simulating off-road movement with hexagon-fishnet-based artificial road data has a number of advantages including scalability to small or large study areas and flexibility to allow all-directional travel. We apply this method to measuring territorial control of armed groups in Sub-Saharan Africa where inferior transport infrastructure is the norm. Based on the Uppsala Conflict Data Program's (UCDP) Georeferenced Event Data (GED) as well as spatial data on terrain, population locations, and limited transportation networks, we enhance the delineation of the specific areas directly controlled by each warring party during civil wars within a given travel time. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","geographic information systems; hexagon grid; hybrid movement; network analysis; spatial analysis; territorial control","GIS; modeling; network analysis; spatial analysis; territorial dispute; transportation infrastructure; violence; war; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977553669

Some of the greatest hurdles to implementing these visions include security risks, user privacy, scalability, the integration of heterogeneous data, and financial cost. In this work, we propose a crowdsensing mobile-device platform that empowers citizens to collect and share information about their surrounding environment via embedded sensor technologies. This approach allows a variety of urban areas (e.g., university campuses, shopping malls, city centers, suburbs) to become equipped with a free ad-hoc sensor network without depending on proprietary instrumentation. We present a framework, namely the GeoTracer application, as a proof-of-concept to conduct multiple experiments simulating use-case scenarios on a university campus. First, we demonstrate that ambient sensors (e.g. temperature, pressure, humidity, magnetism, illuminance, and audio) can help determine a change in environment (e.g. moving from indoors to outdoors, or floor changes inside buildings) more accurately than typical positioning technologies (e.g. global navigation satellite system, Wi-Fi, etc.). Furthermore, each of these sensors contributes a different amount of data to detecting events. for example, illuminance has the highest information gain when trying to detect changes between indoors and outdoors. Second, we show that through this platform it is possible to detect and differentiate place types on a university campus based on inferences made through ambient sensors. Lastly, we train classifiers to determine the activities that a place can afford at different times (e.g. good for studying or not, basketball courts in use or empty) based on sensor-driven semantic signatures. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","crowdsensing; semantics; smart city; volunteered geographic services","accuracy assessment; cost analysis; financial system; GIS; satellite data; smart city; urban population",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977511124

They facilitate (spatial) search, deliver contextual information to recommended systems, enrich textual information with geographical references, and provide stable identifiers to interlink actors, events, and objects by the places they interact with. Hence, it is unsurprising that gazetteers, such as GeoNames, are among the most densely interlinked hubs on the Web of Linked Data. A wide variety of digital gazetteers have been developed over the years to serve different communities and needs. These gazetteers differ in their overall coverage, underlying data sources, provided functionality, and geographic feature type ontologies. Consequently, place types that share a common name may differ substantially between gazetteers, whereas types labeled differently may, in fact, specify the same or similar places. This makes data integration and federated queries challenging, if not impossible. To further complicate the situation, most popular and widely adopted geo-ontologies are lightweight and thus under-specific to a degree where their alignment and matching become nothing more than educated guesses. The most promising approach to addressing this problem, and thereby enabling the meaningful integration of gazetteer data across feature types, seems to be a combination of top-down knowledge representation with bottom-up data-driven techniques such as feature engineering and machine learning. In this work, we propose to derive indicative spatial signatures for geographic feature types by using spatial statistics. We discuss how to create such signatures by feature engineering and demonstrate how the signatures can be applied to better understand the differences and commonalities of three major gazetteers, namely DBpedia Places, GeoNames, and TGN. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","gazetteer; geo-ontologies; linked data; spatial Signatures; spatial statistics","GIS; spatial analysis; spatial data; statistical data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977489595

Because of this, new network-based measures have been introduced for their planar analogues, including the network based K-function. These new measures involve the calculation of network distances between point events rather than traditional Euclidean distances. Some have suggested that the underlying structure of a network, such as whether it includes directional constraints or speed limits, may be considered when applying these methods. How different network structures might affect the results of the network spatial statistics is not well understood. This article examines the results of network K-functions when taking into consideration network distances for three different types of networks: the original road network, topologically correct networks, and directionally constrained networks. For this aim, four scenarios using road networks from Tampa, Florida and New York City, New York were used to test how network constraints affected the network K-function. Depending on which network is under consideration, the underlying network structure could impact the interpretation.

However, research literature also often found institutional resistance when implementing VGI as part of the decision-making process. This research develops a conceptual framework as the foundation to conduct a cross-case comparison for four empirical cases in recreation and invasive species monitoring, but general enough for other such case comparisons. The VGI Reporting Assessment Framework (VGI-RAF) adopted aspects of the Decision Situation Assessment (DSA) framework as the foundation to address institutional flexibility, stakeholder dynamics, and technical considerations. Using a cross-case comparison can accumulate deep observations from cases and increase validity of insights through comparing processes. Results show that eight aspects of the VGI-RAF reveal the suitability of embedding voluntary information within existing institutional decision-making processes. VGI-RAF depicts considerations for: (1) existing participation arrangements, (2) institutional arrangements, (3) managers' needs and stakeholder expectation, and (4) interaction mechanism and technical needs. The cross-comparison results indicate that a public participation mechanism should be accompanied by VGI development to increase effectiveness. Institutional arrangements should match local government's information needs with participants' expectations. Knowledge gaps between institutional information needs and volunteer knowledge should be filled through technology enhancements. For ease of implementation and to promote long-term success, we recommend that volunteered information be connected with existing communication channels to minimize changes to existing information systems. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"conceptual framework; GIS; invasive species; local government; local participation; monitoring; recreational activity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949032522

However, recent proposals have used background geographic information and social media data to enrich these trajectories with a semantic dimension, giving rise to the concept of semantic trajectories. Only a few works have proposed similarity measures for semantic trajectories or multidimensional sequences, having limitations such as predefined weight of the dimensions, sensitivity to noise, tolerance for gaps with different sizes, and the prevalence of the worst dimension similarity. In this article we propose MSM, a novel similarity measure for multidimensional sequences that overcomes the aforementioned limitations by considering and weighting the similarity in all dimensions. MSM is evaluated through an extensive experimental study that, based on a seed trajectory, creates sets of semantic trajectories with controlled transformations to introduce different kinds and levels of dissimilarity. For each set, we compute the similarity between the seed and the transformed trajectories, using different measures. The results showed that MSM was more robust and efficient than related approaches in the domain of semantic trajectories. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"GIS; numerical model; sensitivity analysis; trajectory; two-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937831516

In this article, the representation and computation of geometry-oriented topological relations (GOTR) are developed. GOTR is the integration of geometry and topology. The geometries are represented by blades, which contain both algebraic expressions and construction structures of the geometries in the conformal geometric algebra space. With the meet, inner, and outer products, two topology operators, the MeetOp and BoundOp operators, are developed to reveal the disjoint/intersection and inside/on-surface/outside relations, respectively. A theoretical framework is then formulated to compute the topological relations between any pair of elementary geometries using the two operators. A multidimensional, unified and geometry-oriented algorithm is developed to compute topological relations between geometries. With this framework, the internal results of the topological relations computation are geometries. The topological relations can be illustrated with clear geometric meanings; at the same time, it can also be modified and updated parametrically. Case studies evaluating the topological relations between 3D objects are performed. The result suggests that our model can express and compute the topological relations between objects in a symbolic and geometry-oriented way. The method can also support topological relation series computation between objects with location or shape changes. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"computer simulation; geometry; GIS; numerical model; topology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936817074

Three types of geographic data, namely the locations of greenhouses, collecting stations and road networks, were used in a geographic information system to compute the volume of collected catch crops and carrying distance between greenhouses and collecting stations. Carbon emission from transportation of the catch crop was calculated using an improved ton-km method, and the results were compared with the carbon content of the catch crop to evaluate the carbon balance. We found that the total fresh weight of the collected catch crops was 67900 t, of which 70% was collected at the top 15 of 73 stations.

The services in MDI-DE can contribute to fulfilling reporting commitments for various European and national legislation. The services of MDI-DE (just like other services affected, for instance, by INSPIRE) have to meet specific requirements regarding performance, availability and conformity (quality of service, QoS). Although SOA is an important field in scientific research there are very few publications and studies available on QoS, especially regarding INSPIRE requirements. The services of MDI-DE were analyzed using various existing tools. Their usefulness to reflect where either the aspect's performance, availability or conformity needs improvement was partly verified. Due to varying results and the neglect of some services for various reasons it can be stated that the more tools are used, the more conclusive the outcome. Furthermore, service quality was not coherent when measured with different tools. This means that measuring QoS in terms of INSPIRE will be very difficult to do in the future and there is the danger that people will choose the tools with which their services perform best. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"GIS; legislation; performance assessment; qualitative analysis; satellite data; Germany",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931076286

This study attempts to map and understand the effects of potential spatial supermarket redlining on food access in urban disadvantaged neighborhoods of Hartford, Connecticut. Using a combination of statistical and spatial analysis, we first built a Supermarket Redlining Index (SuRI) from five indicators (sales volume, employee count, accepts food coupons from federally assisted programs, and size and population density of the service area) to rank supermarkets in the order of their importance. Second, to understand the effects of supermarket closures in the inner city, a Supermarket Redlining Impact Model (SuRIM) was built with 11 indicators describing both socioeconomic and food access vulnerabilities. The interaction of these vulnerabilities identified neighborhoods that are maximally impacted by spatial supermarket redlining. Results mapped critical areas in the inner city of Hartford where, if a nearby supermarket closed down or relocated to a suburb with limited mitigation efforts to fill the grocery gap, a large number of minority, poor, and disadvantaged residents would experience difficulties to access healthy food, leading to food insecurity or perhaps a food desert. In conclusion we suggest mitigation efforts to reduce this impact of large supermarket closures. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955406540

Such meaning could be added through personal experience or by informing the observer via some form of communication. To investigate the effects of providing such contextual information on navigational performance, experiments were conducted in a large rural virtual environment where the delivery method of the information was varied between onscreen and PDA display.

This article will introduce an algorithm for rendering creases - linework representing visually significant morphological features - at animation speeds, made possible with recent advances in graphics processing unit (GPU) architectures and rendering APIs. Beginning with a preprocessed high-resolution drainage network model, creases are rendered from selected stream segments if their weighted criteria (slope, flow accumulation, and surface illumination), attenuated by perspective distance from the viewpoint, exceed a threshold. The algorithm thus provides a methodology for crease representation at continuous levels of detail down to the highest resolution of the preprocessed drainage model over a range of surface orientation and illumination conditions. The article also presents an implementation of the crease algorithm with frame rates exceeding those necessary to support animation, supporting the proposition that parallel processing techniques exposed through modern GPU programming environments provide cartographers with a new and inexpensive toolkit for constructing alternative and attractive real-time animated landscape visualizations for spatial analysis. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"Apis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955368764

While numerous aggregated mathematical and statistical approaches have been developed to model the residence choice behavior of households, disaggregated approaches such as the agent-based modeling have shown interesting capabilities. In this article, a novel agent-based approach is developed to simulate the residential location choice of tenants in Tehran, the capital of Iran. Tenants are considered as agents who select their desired residential alternatives according to their characteristics and preferences for various criteria such as the rent, accessibility to different services and facilities, environmental pollution, and distance from their workplace and former residence. The choice set of agents is limited to their desired residential alternatives by applying a constrained NSGA-II algorithm. Then, agents compete with each other to select their final residence among their alternatives.

Qualitative data can take many forms, including interviews, documents, photographs, and audio and video clips. Content analysis for example, is an effective qualitative method for analyzing text-based data. We argue that basic concepts, (i.e. how to store data, data requirements, visualization techniques, and modes of analysis) within qualitative GIS have not been adequately defined, rendering difficult the replication of work performed and hindering the development of incremental knowledge in the field. Database management systems provide a means for storing, managing, and analyzing qualitative GIS data. A standardized and well-designed open source database system provides a mechanism for qualitative GIS projects, ensuring consistency and project replication. Qualitative GIS data stored in a database allows for additional visualization options, such as geographic word clouds. To demonstrate the concepts we performed content analysis on Master Transportation Plans from Calgary and Montreal using SpatiaLite, an open source database system. We developed Structured Query Language (SQL) queries to generate and populate groups and theme tables within the SpatiaLite database.

In the present study, a hybrid link-node Dijkstra's (HLND) algorithm is proposed to exactly solve the shortest path problem in road networks with turn restrictions. A new hybrid link-node labelling approach is devised by using a link-based labelling strategy at restricted nodes with turn restrictions, and a node-based labelling strategy at unrestricted nodes without turn restrictions.

Statistics that describe the level of clustering usually assume that point events are isotropic. Many point events are influenced by linear features and clusters of these point events often have an elongated shape. Existing statistical cluster detection approaches often ignore these types of processes. This study proposes a new method, termed an L-function analysis for clusters influenced by linear features (L-Function-l) to test anisotropic point patterns with respect to the orientation of nearby linear features. To explicitly account for the influence of the underlying linear features on the point events, a number of ellipses with varying lengths, orientations and eccentricities are used to replace the circles that are drawn in the original L-function analysis. A case study of testing anisotropically clustered patterns of mosquito larval sites is used to illustrate the application of this method. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides a more flexible and comprehensive description of point patterns than the original L-function analysis. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"anisotropy; cluster analysis; larva; mosquito",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955207088

Spatial non-stationarity of statistical associations between variables further influences the demographic analyses. This study investigates the implications of these two phenomena within the context of migration-environment associations. Global and local statistical models are fit across increasing levels of aggregation using household level survey data from rural South Africa. We raise the issue of operational scale sensitivity, which describes how the explanatory power of certain variables depends on the aggregation level. We find that as units of analysis (households) are aggregated, some variables become non-significant in the global models, while others are less sensitive to aggregation. Local model results show that aggregation reduces spatial variation in migration-related local associations but also affects variables differently. Spatial non-stationarity appears to be the driving force behind this phenomenon as the results from the global model mask this relationship. Operational scale sensitivity appears related to the underlying spatial autocorrelation of the non-aggregated variables but also to the way a variable is constructed. Understanding operational scale sensitivity can help to refine the process of selecting variables related to the scale of analysis and better understand the effects of spatial non-stationarity on statistical relationships. © 2015.

As more road network data have become available, many studies have considered using road network data to delineate built-up areas. This study investigated the three existing approaches to delineating built-up areas on a map: the grid-based approach, kernel density analysis and an approach based on street blocks. These approaches are evaluated and compared from three angles. First, two measures were proposed to quantitatively evaluate the land area of the delineated built-up areas; second, a questionnaire was designed to visually compare the representations of the delineated built-up areas; and, third, the time complexity of using each approach was tested. The three approaches were applied to different sets of road network data for New Zealand; data from buildings and residential areas were used as benchmarks. The results showed that: (1) in a quantitative assessment, both the grid-based approach and kernel density analysis can usually detect more built-up areas than the approach based on street blocks; (2) on visual inspection, most of the students who completed the questionnaire performed the representations using the approach based on street blocks; and (3) in time complexity, the approach based on street blocks always takes the least time. © 2015.

The multi-represented datasets contain different representations for identical real-world entities. Therefore, update propagation is useful and required for maintaining multi-represented datasets. The key to update propagation is the detection of identical features in different datasets that represent corresponding real-world entities and the detection of changes in updated datasets. Using polygon features of settlements as examples, this article addresses these key problems and proposes an approach for multi-represented feature matching based on spatial similarity and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN). Although this approach only utilizes the measures of distance, area, direction and length, it dynamically and objectively determines the weight of each measure through intelligent learning; in contrast, traditional approaches determine weight using expertise. Therefore, the weight may be variable in different data contexts but not for different levels of expertise. This approach can be applied not only to one-to-one matching but also to one-to-many and many-to-many matching. Experiments are designed using two different approaches and four datasets that encompass an area in China. The goals are to demonstrate the weight differences in different data contexts and to measure the performance of the BPNN-based feature matching approach. © 2015.

Major research efforts have so far dealt with data quality analysis but the modality of OSM's evolution across space and time has barely been noted. This study aims to analyze spatio-temporal patterns of contributions in OSM by proposing a contribution index (CI) in order to investigate the dynamism of OSM. The CI is based on a per cell analysis of the node quantity, interactivity, semantics, and attractivity (the ability to attract contributors). Additionally this research explores whether OSM has been constantly attracting new users and contributions or if OSM has experienced a decline in its ability to attract continued contributions. Using the Stuttgart region of Germany as a case study the empirical findings of the CI over time confirm that since 2007, OSM has been constantly attracting new users, who create new features, edit the existing spatial objects, and enrich them with attributes. This rate has been dramatically growing since 2011. The utilization of a Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Markov) model provides evidence that by the end of 2016 and 2020, the rise of CI will spread out over the study area and only a few cells without OSM features will remain. © 2015.

Buildings in the downtown area are expected to have great photovoltaic (PV) potential for future solar panel installation. This study presents a comprehensive method for estimating geographical PV potential using remote sensed LiDAR data for buildings in downtown San Francisco. LiDAR derived DSMs and DTMs were able to generate high quality building footprints using the object-oriented classification method. The GRASS built-in solar irradiation model (r.sun) was used to simulate and compute PV yields. Monthly and yearly maps, as well as an exquisite 3D city building model, were created to visualize the variability of solar irradiation across the study area. Results showed that monthly sum of solar irradiation followed a one-year cycle with the peak in July and troughs in January and December. The mean yearly sum of solar irradiation for the buildings in the study area was estimated to be 1675kWh/m2. A multiple regression model was used to test the significance of building height, roof area and roof complexity against PV potential. Roof complexity was found to be the dominant determinant. Uncertainties of the research are mainly from the inherent r.sun limitations, boundary problems, and the LiDAR data accuracy in terms of both building footprint extraction and 3D modeling. Future work can focus on a more automated process and segment rooftops of buildings to achieve more accurate estimation of PV potential. The outcome of this research can assist decision makers in San Francisco to visualize building PV potential, and further select ideal places to install PV systems.

Three example assignation parameters used are: choice of center, choice of shape of central sector, and choice of shape of outer sectors.

Landmarks are commonly selected manually, which involves time-consuming and tedious tasks. Automatic selection of landmarks has recently gained the attention of researchers but currently there are only a few techniques that can select appropriate landmarks. In this article, we present a technique based on a neural network model, where both static and dynamic features are used for selecting landmarks automatically. To train and test this model, two labeling approaches, manual labeling and rule-based labeling, are also discussed.

Recently, numerous studies have been carried out in safety analysis to investigate the relationships between crashes and related factors. Trip generation as a function of land use, socio-economic, and demographic characteristics might be appropriate variables along with network characteristics and traffic volume to develop safety models. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) describe the relationships between crashes and the explanatory variables by estimating the global and fixed coefficients. Since crash occurrences are almost certainly influenced by many spatial factors; the main objective of this study is to employ Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) on 253 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in Mashhad, Iran, using traffic volume, network characteristics and trip generation variables to investigate the aspects of relationships which do not emerge when using conventional global specifications. GWPR showed an improvement in model performance as indicated by goodness-of-fit criteria.

Traditionally, a simplified line is represented by critical points selected from the original one. However, this study focuses on maintaining the areas of the polygons in the process of simplification of polygonal boundaries. Therefore, the proposed method in this article is a supplement to the existing line simplification methods, and it improves the quality of the simplification of polygonal boundaries in terms of positional and area errors. Based on the sub-divisions of the original polyline, using the critical points detected from the polyline by the use of line simplification methods, the framework of the proposed method includes three main components, as follows: (1) establishment of the straight-line-segment fitting model based on both the critical and intermediate points on the sub-polyline; (2) introduction of both area and end-point constraints to reduce the geometric distortions due to the line simplification; and (3) derivation of the solution of boundary simplification by the use of STLSC. An empirical example was conducted to test the applicability of the proposed method. The results showed that: (1) by imposing the linear fitting model on both the critical and intermediate points on the sub-polylines in the proposed STLSC method, the positional differences between the original points and the simplified line are approximately in a normal distribution; and (2) by introducing both end-point and area constraints in the proposed STLSC method, the areas of the simplified polygons are the same as those of the original ones at different scales, and the two neighboring fitted lines are connected to each other at the optimized position. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"empirical analysis; geometry; GIS; least squares method; numerical method; polygon",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943359181

Due to the complex shapes and alignments of polygons, the similarity between non-overlapping polygons is important to cluster polygons. This study attempts to present an efficient method to discover clustering patterns of polygons by incorporating spatial cognition principles and multilevel graph partition. Based on spatial cognition on spatial similarity of polygons, four new similarity criteria (i.e. the distance, connectivity, size and shape) are developed to measure the similarity between polygons, and used to visually distinguish those polygons belonging to the same clusters from those to different clusters. The clustering method with multilevel graph-partition first coarsens the graph of polygons at multiple levels, using the four defined similarities to find clusters with maximum similarity among polygons in the same clusters, then refines the obtained clusters by keeping minimum similarity between different clusters. The presented method is a general algorithm for discovering clustering patterns of polygons and can satisfy various demands by changing the weights of distance, connectivity, size and shape in spatial similarity. The presented method is tested by clustering residential areas and buildings, and the results demonstrate its usefulness and universality. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"algorithm; cluster analysis; GIS; polygon; spatial cognition; spatial data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943353777

Hence, protection methodologies are primarily applied to the data to ensure that individual privacy is not violated. This article addresses one group of location protection methodologies, namely geographical masks that are applicable for crime data representations. The purpose is to identify which mask is the most appropriate for crime incident visualizations. A global divergence index (GDi) and a local divergence index (LDi) are developed to compare the effects that these masks have on the original crime point pattern. The indices calculate how dissimilar the spatial information of the masked data is from the spatial information of the original data in regards to the information obtained via spatial crime analysis. The results of the analysis show that the variable radius mask and the donut geomask should be primarily used for crime representations as they produce less spatial information divergence of the original crime point pattern than the alternative local random rotation mask and circular mask. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"GIS; spatial analysis; spatial data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943353686

We present an effective straightforward approach to identifying and constructing the valid volumetric cadastral object from the given faces, and build the topological relationships among 3D cadastral objects on-the-fly, based on input consisting of loose boundary 3D faces made by surveyors. This is drastically different from most existing methods, which focus on the validation of single volumetric objects after the assumption of the object's creation. Existing methods do not support the needed types of geometry/topology (e.g. non 2-manifold, singularities) and how to create and maintain valid 3D parcels is still a challenge in practice. We will show that the method does not change the faces themselves and faces in a given input are independently specified.

Under the rubric of non-photorealistic rendering (NPR), automated procedures in this vein render silhouettes and creases to represent, respectively, view-dependent and view-independent landscape features. This article presents two algorithms and implementations for rendering silhouettes from adaptive tessellations of point-normal (PN) triangles at speeds approaching those suitable for animation. PN triangles use cubic polynomial models to provide a surface that appears smooth at any required resolution. The first algorithm, drawing on standard silhouette detection techniques in surface meshes, builds object space facet adjacencies and image space pixel adjacencies in the graphics pipeline following adaptive tessellation. The second makes exclusive use of image space analysis without referencing the underlying scene world geometry. Other than initial pre-processing operations, recent advances in the OpenGL API allow implementations for both algorithms to be hosted entirely on the graphics processing unit (GPU), eliminating slowdowns through data transfer across the system memory bus.

First, the bend structures of the linear features are identified by using a constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT in abbreviation) model and represented by binary bend-structure trees. By matching the independent bends represented by the bend-structure trees, corresponding independent bends are obtained. These corresponding independent bends are further used to match their child bends based on hierarchical bend structures so that corresponding bends are obtained. On this basis, the two linear features are split into pairs of corresponding subpolylines by the start and end points of the corresponding bends. Second, structures of the corresponding subpolylines are identified by the Douglas-Peucker algorithm and represented by binary line generalization trees (BLG-trees in abbreviation). The corresponding subpolylines are split into smaller corresponding subpolylines by matching the nodes of the BLG-trees. Third, the corresponding points are identified by using the linear interpolation algorithm for every pair of corresponding subpolylines. Finally, straight-line trajectories are employed to generate a family of intermediate-scale linear features.

In this article we present an approach that leverages the complementary nature of social multimedia content by utilizing heterogeneous sources of social media feeds to assess the impact area of a natural disaster. More specifically, we introduce a novel social multimedia triangulation process that uses both Twitter and Flickr content in an integrated two-step process: Twitter content is used to identify toponym references associated with a disaster; this information is then used to provide approximate orientation for the associated Flickr imagery, allowing us to delineate the impact area as the overlap of multiple view footprints. In this approach, we practically crowdsource approximate orientations from Twitter content and use this information to orient Flickr imagery accordingly and identify the impact area through viewshed analysis and viewpoint integration. This approach enables us to avoid computationally intensive image analysis tasks associated with traditional image orientation, while allowing us to triangulate numerous images by having them pointed towards the crowdsourced toponym location.

Comparison of a VGI dataset with a reference dataset in order to find data correspondence is a common process in some analyses of VGI data, such as quantitative analysis of its quality. This study addresses this case and presents an automated feature matching method for VGI linear data. The proposed method consists of two main steps. In the first step, a feature point matching method based on a novel descriptor, named Location-Orientation Rotary Descriptor (LORD), is performed. The proposed LORD descriptor uses the location and orientation information of the linear data in a log polar structure and in a rotary manner. In the second step, a new segment matching strategy based on the buffered linear features is performed to reject the outliers of the previous step. The usefulness of the proposed method was demonstrated by applying it to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) dataset, as a VGI dataset, using an official reference dataset. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"data processing; data set; GIS; methodology; spatial data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940032540

Major shortcomings comprise the potentially long execution times and the vast amount of messaging overhead that arise from common poll-based approaches. To overcome these issues, an approach for an event-driven architecture for web-based geospatial processing is proposed within this article. First, this article presents a thorough qualitative discussion of different available technologies for push-based notifications. The aim of this discussion is to find the most suitable push-based messaging technologies for application with OGC Web Processing Services (WPS). Based on this, an event-driven architecture for asynchronous geospatial processing with the WPS is presented, building on the Web Socket Protocol as the transport protocol and the OGC Event Service as the message-oriented middleware. The proposed architecture allows pushing notifications to clients once a task has completed. This paradigm enables the efficient execution of web-based geospatial processing tasks as well as the integration of geographical analyses into event-driven real-time workflows. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933278442

The Base Model represents the hypothesis about the error behavior. The Binomial Model is fixed and consists of counting the number F of fail events in a sample of a determined size. The π parameter of the Binomial Model is derived from the Base Model by means of a desired tolerance. By comparing the probabilities associated to F and π a statistical acceptance/rejection decision is achieved. This method allows us to know and control the user's and producer's risk of acceptance/rejection. An example using a 2D line string data set from a commercial product is presented.

An essential goal of geoportals is to facilitate the discovery of the available resources. Such a process relies heavily on the quality of metadata. While multiple metadata standards have been established, data contributers may adopt different standards when sharing their data via the same geoportal. This is especially the case for user-generated content where various terms and topics can be introduced to describe similar datasets. While this heterogeneity provides a wealth of perspectives, it also complicates resource discovery. With the fast development of the Semantic Web technologies, there is a rise of Linked-Data-driven portals. Although these novel portals open up new ways to organize metadata and retrieve resources, they lack effective semantic search methods. This article addresses the two challenges discussed above, namely the topic heterogeneity brought by multiple metadata standards and the lack of established semantic search in Linked-Data-driven geoportals. To harmonize the metadata topics, we employ a natural language processing method, namely Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LLDA), and train it using standardized metadata from Data.gov. With respect to semantic search, we construct thematic and geographic matching features from the textual metadata descriptions, and train a regression model via a human participants experiment. We evaluate our methods by examining their performances in addressing the two issues. Finally, we implement a semantics-enabled and Linked-Data-driven prototypical geoportal using a sample dataset from Esri's ArcGIS Online. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"database; GIS; heterogeneity; Internet; metadata; performance assessment; software; technological development",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933039993

Several experiments were carried out to investigate nine types of road intersections for interchange detection and to analyze characteristic ones. Furthermore, an approach to the detection of both intersections and segments of interchanges was proposed and validated. The road networks across different scales were tested and results show that: (1) the T-shaped and Cross-shaped junctions are very common in road networks, but they are not the most characteristic ones for interchange detection; (2) the y-shaped, Y-shaped types, X-shaped, Fork-shaped and Multi-leg may be the characteristic types for interchange detection; (3) the proposed approach to detecting interchanges is effective, and most of the intersections and segments of interchanges can be detected.

Client applications or other services thus have to deal with unrelated preprocessing tasks, such as data transformation and attribute annotation, leading to potential inconsistencies. Furthermore, to build informative interfaces that guide users to quickly understand the analysis methods, an analysis service needs to explicitly model the method parameters, which are often interrelated and have rich auxiliary information.

The spatial data linkage service aggregates multisource heterogeneous data into linked layers with flexible attribute mapping, providing client applications and services with a unified access as if querying a big table.

When clusters with distinctly different local densities exist, the determination of suitable density level is still an unsolved problem. On that account, an iterative detection and removal method is proposed in this study. In each step of the novel method, there are two stages. In the detection stage, density level is statistically modeled as a significance level controlled by the number and support domain of the points in the dataset, and then a hypothesis test is used to detect the high-density points. In the removal stage, the Delaunay triangulation network is used to construct clusters and support domains for the identified high-density points, and then the high-density points and their support domains are removed from the dataset. The detection and removal operation are iteratively implemented until no high-density points can be detected. Experiments and comparisons show that the proposed method, on the one hand, outperforms four state-of-the-art methods for detecting clusters of complex shapes and diverse densities, and on the other hand, no user-specified parameters are required. In addition, the support domains of clusters are very useful for spatial analysis. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929706043

In terms of recreational boating, scholars are interested both in boaters' spatial distribution and movement patterns and in the factors associated with their movements, e.g. travel costs, environmental impacts, and social impacts of the movements. Spatial factors are also key to policymakers' decisions about where to establish new boating facilities, how protected areas are used by boaters and in crafting policy that minimizes conflict between recreational boating and other waterway uses. However, systematic studies regarding the recreationist movement are scant, especially at the fine geographic level. One reason for the lack of research is that gathering spatial data presents significant practical problems. In the Florida Saltwater Fishing Study, we integrated Google Map APIs into the online survey instrument to collect spatially-referenced data regarding boaters' movement on water. Results appear to be accurate, highly cost effective, and easily integrated with other survey information such as angler catch, effort, expenditures and attitudes. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"Apis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929704828

Since it is not available on the basis of individual persons, it has become necessary to derive data from aggregated census data. A variety of approaches have been published in the past, yet they are not entirely suitable for use in the micro-scale context of highly urbanized areas, due mainly to their broad spatial scale and missing temporal scale. Here we introduce an enhanced approach for the spatio-temporal estimation of building populations in highly urbanized areas. It builds upon other estimation methodologies, but extends them by introducing multiple usage categories and the temporal dimension. This allows for a more realistic representation of human activities in highly urbanized areas and the fact that populations change over time as a result of these activities. The model makes use of a variety of micro-scale data sets to operationalize the activities and their spatio-temporal representations. The outcome of the model provides estimated population figures for all buildings at each time step and thereby reveals spatio-temporal behavior patterns. It can be used in a variety of applications concerning the implications of human behavior in urban areas. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929703306

While previous research has explored a variety of spatial optimization models to accomplish such a task, most work assumes that the population with demand is relatively static. However, this assumption neglects to account for potential feedbacks in the relief distribution system. For example, a population's behavior can both affect and be affected by the placement of relief services, resulting in a dynamic spatial distribution of demand. This article presents a hybrid modeling approach that utilizes GIS data with agent-based and spatial optimization models to position emergency relief teams in Bay County, Florida during a hurricane event. Non-evacuating household agents choose to remain at home or seek shelter, while relief team agents are periodically repositioned to account for changes in the spatial distribution of household agents. A total of 220 simulations are run to explore a variety of scenarios. Results show different repositioning timing strategies and the magnitude of the feedback effect drastically changes the level of access households have to relief teams.

This simplification may overlook some important characteristics of AMPN. To explore the AMPN as a directional network model, we introduce the concept of directional heterogeneity in the study of AMPN data. The heterogeneity is twofold: (1) the imbalance of vertex (difference between outgoing and incoming calls of the vertex); and (2) the reciprocity of each edge (difference between the directed weights of the same edge). Taking the data of Singapore as an example, we systematically analyze the directional heterogeneity of AMPN. Our findings include three aspects. First, the AMPN shows as more unbalanced in the night-time than in the daytime, and its imbalance decreases as vertex granularity increases. Second, the directional heterogeneity varied with locations. Specifically, the residential area is dominated by deficits and others by surpluses. Third, the trajectories of incoming and outgoing calls follow a similar geographical pattern (i.e. southeast-north-south-north-southeast), indicating the calling behavior and routine mobility of users over time and space. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"calling behavior; heterogeneity; mobile communication; mobility; modeling; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939263552

The objective is to use a form-based algorithm, analyzing flow over single cells by dividing them into eight triangular facets and to estimate the surface flow paths on a raster DEM. For each cell on a gridded DEM, the triangular form-based multiple flow algorithm (TFM) was used to distribute flow to one or more of the eight neighbor cells, which determined the flow paths over the DEM. Because each of the eight facets covering a cell has a constant slope and aspect, the estimations of - for example - flow direction and divergence/convergence are more intuitive and less complicated than many traditional raster-based solutions. Experiments were undertaken by estimating the specific catchment area (SCA) over a number of mathematical surfaces, as well as on a real-world DEM. Comparisons were made between the derived SCA by the TFM algorithm with eight other algorithms reported in the literature. The results show that the TFM algorithm produced the closest outcomes to the theoretical values of the SCA compared with other algorithms, derived more consistent outcomes, and was less influenced by surface shapes. The real-world DEM test shows that the TFM was capable of modeling flow distribution without noticeable 'artefacts', and its ability to track flow paths makes it an appropriate platform for dynamic surface flow simulation. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"algorithm; digital elevation model; GIS; numerical model; overland flow; raster; triangulation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891952677

Therefore, optimizing the placement of crossing structures in road networks is suggested as a strategic conservation planning method. This research explores two approaches for using the maximal covering location problem (MCLP) to determine optimal sites to install new wildlife crossing structures. The first approach is based on records of traffic mortality, while the second uses animal tracking data for the species of interest. The objective of the first is to cover the maximum number of collision sites, given a specified number of proposed structures to build, while the second covers as many animal tracking locations as possible under a similar scenario. These two approaches were used to locate potential wildlife crossing structures for endangered Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) in Collier, Lee, and Hendry Counties, Florida, a population whose survival is threatened by excessive traffic mortality. Historical traffic mortality records and an extensive radio-tracking dataset were used in the analyses. Although the two approaches largely select different sites for crossing structures, both models highlight key locations in the landscape where these structures can remedy traffic mortality and habitat fragmentation. These applications demonstrate how the MCLP can serve as a useful conservation planning tool when traffic mortality or animal tracking data are available to researchers. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"conservation planning; endangered species; felid; mortality; optimization; planning method; spatial analysis; tracking; Collier County; Florida [United States]; Hendry County; Lee County [Florida]; United States; Animalia; Puma concolor coryi",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891950918

The basic assumption is that a higher count of co-occurrences of two geographical places implies a stronger relatedness between them. The spatial structure of China at the provincial level is explored from the co-occurrences of two provincial units in one document, extracted by a web information retrieval engine. Analysis on the co-occurrences and topological distances between all pairs of provinces indicates that: (1) spatially close provinces generally have similar co-occurrence patterns; (2) the frequency of co-occurrences exhibits a power law distance decay effect with the exponent of 0.2; and (3) the co-occurrence matrix can be used to capture the similarity/linkage between neighboring provinces and fed into a regionalization method to examine the spatial organization of China.

Using LiDAR and TLS datasets of a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) dominant ecosystem, tree canopy and trunk obstructions were isolated relevant to a discrete visibility beam in a short-range line-of-sight model. Cumulative obstruction factors from vegetation were compared with reference visibility values from digital photographs along sightline paths. LiDAR-derived tree factors were augmented with single-scan TLS data for obstruction prediction. Good correlation between datasets was found up to 10m from the terrestrial scanner, but fine scale visibility modeling was problematic at longer distances. Analysis of correlation and regression results reveal the influence of obstruction shadowing inherent to discrete LiDAR and TLS, potentially limiting the feasibility of modeling visibility over large areas with similar technology. However, the results support the potential for TLS-derived subcanopy metrics for augmenting large amounts of aerial LiDAR data to significantly improve models of forest structure. Subtle LiDAR processing improvements, including more accurate tree delineation through higher point density aerial data, combined with better vegetation quantification processes for TLS data, will advance the feasibility and accuracy of data integration. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"forest ecosystem; lidar; numerical model; remote sensing; vegetation; visibility; Pinus contorta",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891944532

In this article we use a Schelling-like agent-based model to consider how changes to the built environment of cities relate to changes in residential segregation by income and ethnicity. To develop this model we exploit insights from a high resolution historical GIS which maps 100% of the population of Newark, NJ in 1880. Newark in 1880 had a complex social landscape characterized by areas of significant social and economic segregation and areas of relative integration. We develop a Schelling model capable of reproducing these residential patterns. We use this model to explore the decentralization of housing, a specific phenomenon associated with the demise of the walking city in the late 19th century. Holding agent preferences constant, but allowing the landscape of the Schelling model to evolve in ways that reflect historical changes to the built environment, produces changes to the social landscape that are also consistent with history. Our work suggests that changes in residential segregation do not necessarily imply changes to individual attitudes and preferences. Changes in residential segregation can be generated by changes to the built environment, specifically the geographic distribution of housing. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"GIS; modeling; nineteenth century; residential location; social segregation; twentieth century; urban area; New Jersey; Newark; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891907442

Based on the divide and group principle in geovisualization, the article proposes a new methodology that combines Geo-SOM and hierarchical clustering to tackle this problem. Geo-SOM was used to ""divide"" the dataset into several homogeneous subsets; hierarchical clustering was then used to ""group"" neighboring homogeneous subsets for pattern exploration in different levels of granularity, thus permitting exploration of patterns at multiple scales. An artificial dataset was used for validating the method's effectiveness. As a case study, the rush hour motorcycle flow data in Taipei City, Taiwan were analyzed. Compared with the best result generated solely by Geo-SOM, the proposed method performed better in capturing the homogeneous zones in the artificial dataset. For the case study, the proposed method discovered six clusters with unique data and spatial patterns at different levels of granularity, while the original Geo-SOM only identified two.

Although a distributed computing environment is suitable for large-scale geospatial computation, emerging advanced computing infrastructure remains unexplored in GIScience applications. This article introduces three categories of geospatial applications by effectively exploiting clusters of CPUs, GPUs and MICs for comparative analysis. Within these three benchmark tests, the GPU clusters exemplify advantages in the use case of embarrassingly parallelism. For spatial computation that has light communication between the computing nodes, GPU clusters present a similar performance to that of the MIC clusters when large data is applied. For applications that have intensive data communication between the computing nodes, MIC clusters could display better performance than GPU clusters.

In E-ST, a sensor object is introduced into the model as a flexible real-time data source. An event type that is generating and driving conditions is registered into a geographic object, so an event can not only express spatiotemporal change in a geographic object, but also drive spatiotemporal change in some geographic objects. As a dynamic GIS data model, the E-ST has five characteristics - Temporality and Spatiality, Real-time, Extendability, Causality, and Realizability.

To ensure that a WMTS can successfully fulfill users' expectations and requirements, the performance of a service must be measured to track latencies and bottlenecks that may downgrade the overall quality of service (QoS). Traditional synthetic workloads used to evaluate WMTS applications are usually generated by repeated static URLs, through randomized requests, or by an access log replay. These three methods do not take request characteristics and users' behaviors into consideration, while access logs are not available for systems still under development. Thus, the evaluation outcomes obtained by these methods cannot represent the real performance of online WMTS applications. In this article a new workload model named HELP (Hotspot/think-timE/Length/Path) is proposed to measure the performance of a prototype WMTS. This model describes how users browse a WMTS map and statistically characterizes complete map navigation behaviors. Then, the HELP model is implemented in HP LoadRunner and used to generate a synthetic workload to evaluate the target WMTS. Experimental results illustrate that the performance representation of the HELP workload is more accurate than that of the other two models, and how a bottleneck in the target system was identified. Additional statistical analysis of request logs and ""hotspots"" visualizations further validate the proposed HELP workload. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"mapping; performance assessment; spatial data; visualization; World Wide Web",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939252305

The open-source Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), which has been widely used to access diverse formats of geospatial raster data, has been applied recently to parallel geospatial raster processing. This article first explores the efficiency and feasibility of parallel raster I/O using GDAL under three common ways of domain decomposition: row-wise, column-wise, and block-wise. Experimental results show that parallel raster I/O using GDAL under column-wise or block-wise domain decomposition is highly inefficient and cannot achieve correct output, although GDAL performs well under row-wise domain decomposition. The reasons for this problem with GDAL are then analyzed and a two-phase I/O strategy is proposed, designed to overcome this problem. A data redistribution module based on the proposed I/O strategy is implemented for GDAL using a message-passing-interface (MPI) programming model. Experimental results show that the data redistribution module is effective. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919435582

Although least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) have been widely accepted as a classifier, their effect on smoothing noisy data is almost unknown. In this article, the smoothness of LSSVM was explored, and its effect on smoothing noisy data in DEM construction was tested. In order to improve the ability to deal with large datasets, a local method of LSSVM has been developed, where only the neighboring sampling points around the one to be estimated are used for computation. A numerical test indicated that LSSVM is more accurate than the classical smoothing methods including TPS and kriging, and its error surfaces are more evenly distributed. The real-world example of smoothing noise inherent in lidar-derived DEMs also showed that LSSVM has a positive smoothing effect, which is approximately as accurate as TPS. In short, LSSVM with a high efficiency can be considered as an alternative smoothing method for smoothing noisy data in DEM construction. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919427588

This article develops methods for extracting and analyzing hotspots or locations with relatively high levels of mobility activity. We use kernel density estimation (KDE) to convert a large collection of mobile objects into a smooth, continuous surface. We then develop a topological algorithm to extract critical geometric features of the surface; these include critical points (peaks, pits and passes) and critical lines (ridgelines and course-lines). We connect the peaks and corresponding ridgelines to produce a surface network that summarizes the topological structure of the surface. We apply graph theoretic indices to analytically characterize the surface and its changes over time. To illustrate our approach, we apply the techniques to taxi cab data collected in Shanghai, China. We find increases in the complexity of the hotspot spatial distribution during normal activity hours in the late morning, afternoon and evening and a spike in the connectivity of the hotspot spatial distribution in the morning as taxis concentrate on servicing travel to work.

Heterogeneous road networks not only exist at different levels of detail (LoD), but also have different coordinate systems, leading to difficulties in matching and integrating them. To overcome these difficulties, a pattern-based method was implemented. Based on the authors' previous work on detecting patterns of divided highways, complex road junctions, and strokes to eliminate the LoD effect of road networks, the proposed method extracts the local networks around each node in a road network and uses them as the matching units for the nodes. Second, the degree of shape similarity between the matching units is measured using a Minimum Road Edit Distance based on a transformation. Finally, the proposed method hierarchically matches the nodes in a road network using the Minimum Road Edit Distance and eliminates false matching nodes using M-estimators. An experiment involving matching heterogeneous road networks with different LoDs and coordinate systems was carried out to verify the validity of the proposed method. The method achieves good and effective matching regardless of differences in LoDs and road-network coordinate systems. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"coordinate; GIS; network analysis; pattern recognition; road transport; urban area",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908304138

In this article, a model is developed to study the sparsely sampled network-constrained movement of several objects by calculating both potential and feasible (i.e. more likely) co-presence opportunities over time. The approach is applied to the context of a static sensor network, where the location of an object is only registered when passing a sensor location along a road network. Feasibility is incorporated based on the deviation from the shortest path. As an illustration, the model is applied to a large Bluetooth tracking dataset gathered at a mass event. The model output consists of maps showing the temporal evolution of the distribution of feasible co-presence opportunities of tracked visitors over the network (i.e. the number of visitors that could have been present together). We demonstrate the model's usefulness in studying the movement and distribution of a crowd over a study area with relatively few sampling locations. Finally, we discuss the results with a special emphasis on the distinction between feasible and actual presence, the need for further validation and calibration, and the performance of the implementation. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"calibration; data set; feasibility study; GIS; model validation; network analysis; temporal analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908282794

Available information about the observed phenomenon may be incomplete or imprecise and therefore insufficient for quantitative modeling. We address this problem by reasoning about the plume movement and size on a qualitative level and present an algorithm for tracking a dynamic plume that integrates this qualitative information with the collected sensor data. We evaluate our algorithm using simulated data sets of three different moving and expanding gas plumes. By means of simulations we show that the qualitative methods can be used to infer new information about the properties of a moving plume and to adapt the sensor movement for tracking the plume.

Possible applications include information extraction, data fusion, generalization and schema transformation. On the basis of spatial and temporal references, SSTA transfers thematic attribute values into a coarser spatio-temporal resolution using descriptive statistical operations. Reusable geoprocessing functions are increasingly offered in Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) through standardized interfaces using mainstream network technologies. Due to the variety of use cases, a Web service for SSTA promises a high potential for reuse. However, offering functionalities for geoprocessing within an SDI raises some challenges. The aggregation process itself, as well as the encapsulation of the aggregation functionalities within an SDI, require thorough design considerations. This article addresses these challenges by developing a generic framework for SSTA services within an SDI. A prototype of the framework is realized using several open-source software components. Following a modular approach, the communication between those loosely-coupled components is enabled through open, standardized interfaces. The result of the proposed work is a framework that enables users to easily perform a statistical ad-hoc aggregation on distributed spatio-temporal data. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905593876

Traditionally, spatial analysis in public health has focused on the county, ZIP code, or tract level because of limitations to geocoding at highly resolved scales. Using 2005 birth and death data from North Carolina, we examine our ability to geocode population-level datasets at three spatial resolutions - zip code, street, and parcel. We achieve high geocoding rates at all three resolutions, with statewide street geocoding rates of 88.0% for births and 93.2% for deaths. We observe differences in geocoding rates across demographics and health outcomes, with lower geocoding rates in disadvantaged populations and the most dramatic differences occurring across the urban-rural spectrum. Our results suggest that highly resolved spatial data architectures for population-level datasets are viable through geocoding individual street addresses. We recommend routinely geocoding administrative datasets to the highest spatial resolution feasible, allowing public health researchers to choose the spatial resolution used in analysis based on an understanding of the spatial dimensions of the health outcomes and exposures being investigated. Such research, however, must acknowledge how disparate geocoding success across subpopulations may affect findings. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905580798

Existing models only formalize spatial objects, frames of reference, and their relations at one scale, thus limiting their applicability in representing location changes of spatial objects across scales. A topology-based, multi-scale qualitative location model is proposed to represent the associations of multiple representations of the same objects with respect to the frames of reference at different levels. Multi-scale regional partitions are first presented to be the frames of reference at multiple levels of scale. Multi-scale locations are then formalized to relate multiple representations of the same objects to the multiple frames of reference by topological relations. Since spatial objects, frames of reference, and topological relations in qualitative locations are scale dependent, scale transformation approaches are presented to derive possible coarse locations from detailed locations by incorporating polygon merging, polygon-to-line and polygon-to-point operators. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905568641

Unfortunately, there may be circumstances in which access to such Internet-resident web services is infeasible or unreliable. These disconnected environments can theoretically occur during major power outages, malicious attacks on communications infrastructure, natural disasters, or in remote operating environments. One might also envision applications in which a disconnected service is preferred over Internet-resident services, such as when the local internet service is overloaded with traffic, making communication though it difficult. To this end, this article presents a software stack (a map stack) that can serve GIS information from low power embedded nodes. The system combines a spatially enabled SQL database, location-based routing, and multi-scale map rendering to serve information-rich GIS data on common hand-held devices at minimal energy consumption. The maps are rendered on browsers on off-the-shelf mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. The system also provides a crowd sourced capability where end users can annotate maps with up-to-date information on the scene of the natural disaster. We have prototyped a fully functional map stack on a battery powered Gumstix Overo air platform. We show that the map stack is a highly extensible platform that provides low latency, and low energy dissemination of maps during a natural disaster. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905565743

This article integrates the Huff Model with the FCA method to articulate population selection on services. Through the proposed approach, population demand on healthcare services is adjusted by a Huff Model-based selection probability that reflects the impacts of both distance impedance and service site capacity. The new approach moderates the over- or under-estimating of population demand that occurred with previous methods. Furthermore, the method uses a continuous distance impedance weight function instead of the arbitrarily defined subzones of previous studies. A case study of spatial access to primary care in Springfield, MO, showed that the proposed method can effectively moderate the population demand on service sites and therefore can generate more reliable spatial access measures. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"accessibility; health care; health services; numerical model; spatial analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902317529

Non-personal accounts, spam users and junk tweets, however, pose severe problems to the extraction of meaningful information and the validation of any research findings on tweets or twitter users. Therefore, the detection of such users is a critical and fundamental step for twitter-related geographic research. In this study, we develop a methodological framework to: (1) extract user characteristics based on geographic, graph-based and content-based features of tweets; (2) construct a training dataset by manually inspecting and labeling a large sample of twitter users; and (3) derive reliable rules and knowledge for detecting non-personal users with supervised classification methods. The extracted geographic characteristics of a user include maximum speed, mean speed, the number of different counties that the user has been to, and others. Content-based characteristics for a user include the number of tweets per month, the percentage of tweets with URLs or Hashtags, and the percentage of tweets with emotions, detected with sentiment analysis. The extracted rules are theoretically interesting and practically useful.

However, employing GPS alone for indoor localization is not always possible due to the system's inability to determine location inside buildings or in places of signal occlusion. In this context, the application of local wireless networks for determining position is a promising alternative solution, although they still suffer from a number of limitations due to energy and IT-resources. Our research outlines the potential for employing indoor wireless network positioning and sensor-based systems to improve the collection of tracking data indoors. By applying various methods of GIScience we developed a methodology that can be applicable for diverse human indoor mobility analysis. To show the advantage of the proposed method, we present the result of an experiment that included mobility analysis of 37 participants.

Existing flow mapping approaches often aggregate flows using predetermined high-level geographic units (e.g. states) or bundling partial flow lines that are close in space, both of which cause a significant loss or distortion of information and may miss major patterns. In this research, we developed a flow clustering method that extracts clusters of similar flows to avoid the cluttering problem, reveal abstracted flow patterns, and meanwhile preserves data resolution as much as possible. Specifically, our method extends the traditional hierarchical clustering method to aggregate and map large flow data. The new method considers both origins and destinations in determining the similarity of two flows, which ensures that a flow cluster represents flows from similar origins to similar destinations and thus minimizes information loss during aggregation. With the spatial index and search algorithm, the new method is scalable to large flow data sets. As a hierarchical method, it generalizes flows to different hierarchical levels and has the potential to support multi-resolution flow mapping. Different distance definitions can be incorporated to adapt to uneven spatial distribution of flows and detect flow clusters of different densities. To assess the quality and fidelity of flow clusters and flow maps, we carry out a case study to analyze a data set of 243,850 taxi trips within an urban area. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"algorithm; cluster analysis; data acquisition; data quality; hierarchical system; mapping; spatial data; spatial distribution; transportation system; urban transport",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902252938

In Brazil, as well as in other tropical countries, this process raised worries regarding the possible direct and indirect effects of the crop's expansion on the conversion of native vegetation coverings. Therefore, the modeling of spatial-economic surfaces, representing the potential rent variation in its spatial component, for economic activities, may be a useful tool in the decision-making process. Hence, here we propose and present the results of a combined framework composed of two modules using the modeling platform Dinamica EGO. The first module simulates sugarcane's growth, calculating the daily response of the crop to environmental conditions during the stages of the plant's development. The second module estimates rents for sugarcane cultivation in Brazil, identifying areas where this activity would bring higher economic return, looking at simulated productivity, production costs and selling prices in a way that is spatially explicit for Brazil. Two different scenarios for production costs were tested, and results ranged from negative values to maxima of R$/ha 929 and R$/ha 1176 for standard and efficient costs of production, respectively. The model successfully indicated non-profitable and profitable areas, and regions where high expected economic return overlaps endangered ecosystems. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"biofuel; conservation management; cost-benefit analysis; crop production; cultivation; decision making; economic activity; economic analysis; energy crop; GIS; land use change; profitability; spatial data; sugar cane; Brazil",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902249382

GIS-derived view measures requiring digital elevation surface models are used in hedonic property models to quantify the amenity value of view for parcel sales transactions. Ideally models should represent surface elevations that are temporally synchronized with parcel sale dates. Temporal synchronization for studies spanning multiple years may require significant effort. Few studies have undertaken this effort, leading us to investigate in this research the need to be temporally explicit. We evaluate two competing surface model approaches based on: (1) a single year 2000 LiDAR surface product; and (2) annual-specific surface products for 1995-2002. Two competing view measures based on the different surface approaches are constructed for 561 parcel transactions during 1995-2002 in a coastal North Carolina county and are input into hedonic regression models. Results showed that being temporally explicit did matter in terms of finding significantly different view measures but did not matter in terms of finding significantly different effects of view on parcel sales prices. Despite mixed results for our case study, we advise that future research involving GIS-based view measurement should consider the spatial and temporal contexts of study area development patterns when evaluating the need to be temporally explicit. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"coastal zone; digital elevation model; GIS; hedonic analysis; lidar; price dynamics; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896101178

Indeed the AGENT model, whose robustness has been tested and approved through the European project AGENT, gives very good results in generalizing dense urban areas by means of enlargement, removal and displacement of buildings. But this model does not tackle the question of including particular structures like building alignments in the process, which is a crucial issue. The problem is that integrating such structures does not fit into the accurate top-down hierarchy of urban agents. In order to face this problem, we propose to partly re-engineer the model by introducing the concept of reactional agents whose behavior is very different from hierarchical agents of the original model as they use bottom-up activation. In this view, urban alignment is considered to be a reactional agent activated only by its inner buildings, which generalizes the aligned buildings together into one entire structure. Associating reactional alignment behavior with new generalization actions on alignments significantly improves the model and gives better results in dense urban areas. Moreover, the idea could probably be used for other applications. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"building; cartography; modeling; urban area; urban planning",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896092592

The objective of this article is to demonstrate the extent of sub-optimality produced by Traveling Salesman solution procedures implemented in the context of Geographic Information Systems and to discuss the consequences that such solutions have for practice. Toward that end, an analysis is made of Traveling Salesman solutions from implementations in four Geographic Information System packages. These implementations are tested against the optimal solution for a range of problem sizes. Computational results are presented in the context of a school bus routing application. This analysis concludes that no Traveling Salesman implementation in GIS is likely to find the optimal solution when problems exceed 10 stops. In contrast, optimal solutions can be generated with desktop linear programming software for up to 25 cities. Moreover, one GIS implementation consistently found solutions that were closer to optimal than its competitors. This research strongly suggests that for applications with fewer than 25 stops, the use of an optimal solution procedure is advised, and that GIS implementations can benefit from the integration of more robust optimization techniques. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"bus transport; comparative study; GIS; mathematical analysis; optimization; software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896090242

Most of these computational models demand a variety of large-scale environmental and socio-economic data to investigate the relationship between urban expansion and its driving forces. These requirements are not always fulfilled, particularly in developing countries due to a lack of data availability. This necessitates methods not suffering from data limitations to ease their application. Consequently, this research presents a morphological approach for predicting urban expansion on the basis of spatiotemporal dynamics of urban margins by investigating the interior metropolitan area of Tehran, Iran as a case study. To assess the model's performance, urban expansion is monitored from 1976 to 2012. The proposed model is evaluated to ensure that the prediction performance for the year 2012 is acceptable. For the year 2024, the model predicts Tehran's urban expansion at an overall R2 of 88%.

Until recently, evaluation of simulation models has focused on map comparison techniques that evaluate the degree to which predictions match real-world observations. However, methods that change the focus of evaluation from patterns to processes have begun to surface; that is, rather than asking if a model simulates a correct pattern, models are evaluated on their ability to simulate a process of interest. We build on an existing agent-based modeling validation method in order to present a temporal variant-invariant analysis (TVIA). The enhanced method, which focuses on analyzing the uncertainty in simulation results, examines the degree to which outcomes from multiple model runs match some reference to how land use parcels make the transition from one land use class to another over time. We apply TVIA to results from an agent-based model that simulates the relationships between landowner decisions and wildfire risk in the wildland-urban interface of the southern Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA.

Most projects involving GIS 1.0 and 2.0 raise community weaknesses, failures and other problems and use them to motivate change. The projects often create a future that does not differ greatly from the past or last long. Although looking into community problems is important and sometimes necessary, the steps of problem-solving do not always leave people feeling happy. To inspire communities to create change based on their strengths and achievements, and to provide better participant experience, this article develops the concept of a new form of GIS called Appreciative GIS (AGIS). AGIS are grounded in the affirmative premise that every community, however challenged, is gifted with certain assets, potentials and strengths which, when effectively exploited, can take that community to a better and sustainable future. Based on Earth's internal structure, the article develops a useful layered community model where crust, mantle and core strata represent the community's body, life-draining and life-giving elements in that order. The model helps explain the different views of the community from current GIS and AGIS perspectives. A Total GIS (TGIS) cube is also developed and used to indicate that current GIS commonly focus on elements of the mantle or what we do not have, what we cannot do and what makes us weak. AGIS, on the other hand, dig up the core and cultivate what we have, what we can possibly do and what makes us strong. In a significant departure from the linear approach of problem-solving, the article suggests implementing AGIS through a 7G cyclical method. The article contends that although AGIS may not be the whole enchilada, they can serve as a beacon of hope and a powerful source of inspiration especially for individuals and groups who are perceived or made to perceive themselves as dysfunctional, weak or poor. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"community development; conceptual framework; GIS; local participation; participatory approach; sustainable development",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896071513

Such image-derived vector maps, however, are generally presented with congested and twisted polygons with step-like boundaries. They include unclassified polygons and polygons with geometric conflicts such as unreadable small areas and narrow corridors. The complex and poorly readable representations usually make such maps not comply well with the Gestalt principle of cartography. This article describes a framework designed to improve the representation by resolving these problematic polygons. It presents a polygon similarity model integrating semantic, geometric and spectral characteristics of the image-derived polygons to eliminate small and unclassified polygons. In addition, an outward-inward-buffering approach is presented to resolve the narrow-corridor conflicts of a polygon and improve its overall appearance. A case study demonstrates that the implementation of the framework reduces the number of the polygons by 32% and the length of the polygon boundaries by 20%. At the same time, it does not cause distinct changes the distribution of land-use types (less than 0.05%) and the overall accuracy (decreased only 0.02%) as compared with the original image-derived land-use maps. We conclude that the presented framework and models effectively improve the overall representation of image-derived maps without distinct changes in their semantic characteristics and accuracy. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"geometry; image analysis; image classification; land use; map; polygon; remote sensing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893014673

In this article, we propose to assess the location correctness of visually generated Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) as a quality reference measure. The location correctness is determined by checking the visibility of the point of interest from the position of the visually generated VGI (observer point); as an example we utilize Flickr photographs. Therefore we first collect all Flickr photographs that conform to a certain point of interest through their textual labelling. Then we conduct a reverse viewshed analysis for the point of interest to determine if it lies within the area of visibility of the observer points. If the point of interest lies outside the visibility of a given observer point, the respective geotagged image is considered to be incorrectly geotagged. In this way, we analyze sample datasets of photographs and make observations regarding the dependency of certain user/photo metadata and (in)correct geotags and labels. In future the dependency relationship between the location correctness and user/photo metadata can be used to automatically infer user credibility. In other words, attributes such as profile completeness, together with location correctness, can serve as a weighted score to assess credibility. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"data quality; GIS; photograph; spatial analysis; viewshed; visibility",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892997579

The impacts of temporal inaccuracy and incomplete data reporting on the results of these tests remain completely unexplored. This study examines the influence of these problems individually and collectively, using a series of simulations.

Unfortunately, current geographical information systems (including ArcGIS) remains very difficult to use as spatial analysis tools, because they organize and expose functionalities according to GIS data structures and processing algorithms. As a result, GIS interfaces are conceptually confusing, cognitively complex, and semantically disconnected from the way human reason about spatial analytical activities. In this article, we propose an approach that structures GIS analytical functions based on the notion of ""analytical intent"". We describe an experiment that replaces ArcGIS desktop interface with a conversational interface, to enable mixed-initiative user-system interactions at the level of analytical intentions. We initially focus on the subset of GIS functions that are relevant to ""finding what's inside"" as described by Mitchell, but the general principles apply to other types of spatial analysis.

Complex geoinformation management, like public policy, must go beyond these boundaries. The article calls attention to the underexposed role of dilemmas in geoinformation management and how to cope with them. It uses lessons from the development of 'integrated surveys' at the former International Training Centre for Aerial Survey (ITC) in The Netherlands as an early and practical case of managing geoinformation for public policy some 40 years ago. These lessons are apparently also relevant to modern digital geoinformation management, as in SDI. Focus on public policy requires not only integration of geospatial data from different sources but also integration of geoinformation into complex decision-making processes. This complexity probably creates dilemmas because of mutually incompatible perspectives between different actors on what is to be managed. Geoinformation management for public policy therefore requires the ability to find, over and over again, a common ground between and beyond incompatible perspectives. The article proposes a 'transdisciplinary' framing of geoinformation management to support the required thinking outside the box. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Dilemmas; Geoinformation management; Integrated surveys; Public policy; Transdisciplinarity","GIS; information management; policy making; spatial data; survey; Netherlands",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892975438

The question of whether the OSM road network should be updated through periodic data imports from public domain data, or whether the currency of OSM data should rather rely on more traditional data collection efforts by active contributors, has led to perpetual debates within the OSM community. A US Census TIGER/Line 2005 import into OSM was accomplished in early 2008, which generated a road network foundation for the active community members in the US. In this study we perform a longitudinal analysis of road data for the US by comparing the development of OSM and TIGER/Line data since the initial TIGER/Line import. The analysis is performed for the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, and 70 Urbanized Areas. In almost all tested states and Urbanized Areas, OSM misses roads for motorized traffic when compared with TIGER/Line street data, while significant contributions could be observed in pedestrian related network data in OSM compared with corresponding TIGER/Line data. We conclude that the quality of OSM road data could be improved through new OSM editor tools allowing contributors to trace current TIGER/Line data. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"data quality; GIS; mapping; road transport; urban area; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889653591

In line with the Dutch practice of modeling geo-information, the ADE is developed using a model driven approach. The classes are designed in UML and automatically mapped to GML schema. The current OGC CityGML specification does not provide rules or guidance on correctly modeling an ADE in UML. This article fills this gap by studying how CityGML can be extended for specific applications starting from the UML diagrams. Six alternatives for modeling ADEs in UML are introduced and compared. The optimal alternative is selected and applied to obtain the national 3D standard. The approach was extensively discussed with international experts, who were members of both SIG3D and other working groups. As a consequence the approach was adopted by the SIG3D, the Special Interest Group 3D which, among other things, work on the 3D standard CityGML in cooperation with OGC. Therefore the approach contains many issues that can be generalized and reused by future domain extensions of CityGML. To further support this, the article formulates a model-driven framework to model CityGML ADEs.

Its use of geographical weighting arises from the expectation that observations close together by distance are likely to share similar characteristics. In practice, however, two points can be geographically close but socially distant because the contexts (or neighborhoods) within which they are situated are not alike. Drawing on a previous study of geographically and temporally weighted regression, in this article we develop what we describe as contextualized Geographically Weighted Regression (CGWR), applying it to the field of hedonic house price modeling to examine spatial heterogeneity in the land parcel prices of Beijing, China. Contextual variables are incorporated into the analysis by adjusting the geographical weights matrix to measure proximity not only by distance but also with respect to an attribute space defined by measures of each observation's neighborhood.

Traditional cell-based CA do not generate reliable results at such resolutions because single cells might only represent components of land-use entities (i.e. houses or parks in urban residential areas), while recently proposed entity-based CA models usually ignore the internal heterogeneity of the entities. This article describes a patch-based CA model designed to deal with this problem by integrating cell and object concepts. A patch is defined as a collection of adjacent cells that might have different attributes, but that represent a single land-use entity. In this model, a transition probability map was calculated at each cell location for each land-use transition using a weight of evidence method; then, land-use changes were simulated by employing a patch-based procedure based on the probability maps. This CA model, along with a traditional cell-based model were tested in the eastern part of the Elbow River watershed in southern Alberta, Canada, an area that is under considerable pressure for land development due to its proximity to the fast growing city of Calgary. The simulation results for the two models were compared to historical data using visual comparison, Ksimulation indices, and landscape metrics. The results reveal that the patch-based CA model generates more compact and realistic land-use patterns than the traditional cell-based CA. The Ksimulation values indicate that the land-use maps obtained with the patch-based CA are in higher agreement with the historical data than those created by the cell-based model, particularly regarding the location of change. The landscape metrics reveal that the patch-based model is able to adequately capture the land-use dynamics as observed in the historical data, while the cell-based CA is not able to provide a similar interpretation. The patch-based approach proposed in this study appears to be a simple and valuable solution to take into account the internal heterogeneity of land-use classes at fine spatial resolutions and simulate their transitions over time. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.",,"automation; comparative study; computer simulation; data interpretation; land use change; numerical model; spatial resolution; urban development; urban growth; urban planning; watershed; Alberta; Calgary; Canada; Elbow River",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888866913

The framework is presented using an ontological approach where ontologies at different levels of generalization, e.g. domain, application, and task ontologies, are linked together through participation and inheritance relationships. S_Events are entered into a schedule as a new S_Entry, or modifications can be made to existing entries including reschedule, postpone, change location, and delete as schedules vary over time. These schedule updates are formalized through changes to planned start and end times and the planned locations of S_Entries are expressed using SWRL, a semantic web rule language. SWRL is also used for reasoning about schedule changes and the space-time conflicts that can occur. The sequence of entries in a schedule gives rise to S_trajectories representing the locations that individuals plan to visit in order to carry out their schedule, adding an additional spatial element to the framework.

These three methods are then used to assess the impacts of a vacant land greening program which turns vacant lots into temporary greenspaces. This research explores the differences between findings when access to greenspace is measured based on distance to any greenspace, total amount of greenspace to which residents have access, or a hybrid measure in which access is determined based on proximity to a threshold amount of greenspace. Not only do assessments of equity differ between the three approaches, but so do determinations of the impact of greening vacant land. Blacks, Hispanics and renters are more likely to live close to a public greenspace than whites or homeowners, but live in proximity to smaller overall amounts of greenspace. Greening vacant land increases the proportion of all residents who live within walking distance of a greenspace and lessens but does not eliminate differences in total greenspace access. The greatest effects of greening vacant land are seen in addressing differences in relative likelihood of having access to a threshold amount of greenspace. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"assessment method; greenspace; homeownership; land use planning; public access; socioeconomic status",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888299777

Maximum Entropy methods impute population weights that are constrained to match a set of census tract-level summary statistics. Once allocated, the household characteristics are summarized to revise estimates of tract-level demographic summary statistics, and to derive measures of ambiguity. The revised summary statistics are compared with original tract summaries within a context of expected variation. Allocation ambiguity is quantified for each household as a function of the distribution of imputed sample weights over all census tracts, and by computed metrics of confusion and variety of allocation to any census tract. The process reported here allows differentiation of households with regard to inherent ambiguity in the allocation decision. Ambiguity assessment represents an important component that has been neglected in spatial allocation work to date but can be seen as important additional knowledge for demographers and users of small area estimates. For the majority of tested variables, the revised tract level summaries correlate highly with original tract summary statistics. In addition to assessments for individual households, it is also possible to compute average allocation ambiguity for individual tracts, and to associate this with demographic characteristics not utilized in the allocation process. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"census; GIS; maximum entropy analysis; methodology; spatial data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880148736

However, even the ""wind-of-change"" scenario, will result in new households averaging higher VMT per household than the Metro Boston average observed in 2005.

The concept of accessibility dates to the 1950s, but this type of application to transportation planning is new. Previous research has established the coevolution of transportation and land use, demonstrated the dependence of accessibility on both, and made the case for the use of accessibility measures as a planning tool. This study builds off of these findings by demonstrating the use of accessibility-based performance measures in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area. This choice of performance measure also allows for transit and highway networks to be compared side-by-side. For roadway modeling, zone-to-zone travel time matrix was computed using stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) assignment with travel time feedback to trip distribution. A database of schedules was used on the transit networks to assign transit routes. This travel time data was joined with the land use data from each scenario to obtain the employment, population, and labor accessibility from each traffic analysis zone (TAZ) within specified time ranges. Tables of person-weighted accessibility were computed for 20 minutes with zone population as the weight for employment accessibility and zone employment as the weight for population and labor accessibility. Maps of accessibility by zone were produced to show the spatial distribution of accessibility across the region. The results show that a scenario where population and employment growth are concentrated in the center of the metropolitan area would produce the highest accessibility no matter which transportation network changes are made. However, another scenario which concentrates population growth in the center of the metropolitan area and shifts employment growth to the periphery consistently outperforms the scenario representing the projected 2030 land use without any growth management strategy. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"accessibility; employment; land use; metropolitan area; population growth; transportation planning; travel time; Minneapolis; Minnesota; Saint Paul; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885453049

Unlike traditional zoning, where geographic locations are defined by one single universal plan of discrete land parcels or 'zones' for the study area, adaptive zoning establishes a compendium of different zone plans, each of which is applicable to one journey origin or destination only. These adaptive zone plans are structured to represent strong spatial interactions in proportionately more detail than weaker ones. In recent articles, it has been shown that adaptive zoning improves, by a large margin, the scalability of models of spatial interaction and road traffic assignment. This article confronts the method of adaptive zoning with an application of the scale and complexity for which it was intended, namely an application of mode choice modeling that at the same time requires a large study area and a fine-grained zone system. Our hypothesis is that adaptive zoning can significantly improve the accuracy of mode choice modeling because of its enhanced sensitivity to the geographic patterns and scales of spatial interaction. We test the hypothesis by investigating the performance of three alternative models: (1) a spatially highly detailed model that is permissible to the maximum extent by available data, but requires a high computational load that is generally out of reach for rapid turnaround of policy studies; (2) a mode choice model for the same area, but reducing the computational load by 90% by using a traditional zone system consisting of fewer zones; and (3) a mode choice model that also reduces the computational load by 90%, but based on adaptive zoning instead. The tests are carried out on the basis of a case study that uses the dataset from the London Area Transport Survey. Using the first model as a benchmark, it is found that for a given computational load, the model based on adaptive zoning contains about twice the amount of information of the traditional model, and model parameters on adaptive zoning principles are more accurate by a factor of six to eight. The findings suggest that adaptive zoning has a significant potential in enhancing the accuracy of mode choice modeling at the city or city-region scale. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"discrete choice analysis; numerical model; transportation mode; transportation planning; zoning system; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885441644

There has been considerable user interest in its applicability to subsequent time periods, particularly given the potential propensity of characteristics and attributes in some areas to change during inter-censual periods. Users often purchase commercial geodemographic classification products in the belief that purely census-based classifications such as the 2001 OAC are uniformly unreliable because there is no temporal updating of input data. Yet there is evidence to suggest that whilst some UK neighborhoods are prone to sudden changes, many others change very little over protracted time periods.

Using mid-year population estimates and dwelling stock data, this article develops three temporal uncertainty indicators.

Multiply sourced, its value is greatly increased by the inclusion of metadata that adequately and accurately describes that content - particularly if such data are to be integrated with more formal data sets. Typically, digital photography is tagged with location and attribute information that variously describe the location, events or objects in the image. Often inconsistent and incomplete, these attributes reflect concepts at a range of geographic scales. From a spatial data integration perspective, the information relating to ""place"" is of primary interest. The challenge therefore is in selecting the most appropriate tags that best describe the geography of the image. This article presents a methodology based on an information retrieval technique that separates out ""place related tags"" from the remainder of the tags. Different scales of geography are identified by varying the size of the sampling area within which the imagery falls. This is applied in the context of urban environments, using Flickr imagery. Empirical analysis is then used to assess the correctness of the chosen tags (i.e. whether the tag correctly describes the geographic region in which the image was taken). Logistic regression and Bayesian inference are used to attach a probability value to each place tag. The high correlation values achieved indicate that this methodology can be used to automatically select place tags for any urban region and thus hierarchically structure UGC in order that it can be semantically integrated with other data sources. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"Bayesian analysis; data set; image processing; metadata; photography; regression analysis; urban area",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881314396

This article describes a methodology addressing the nature of these spatio-temporal activities that has the potential to contribute solutions to this problem. A key element of this approach is the awareness that both the planning and acting phases must be considered in supporting such activities. This means the development of plans that can be amended ad-hoc, whilst still adhering to the spatio-temporal constraints of the activity. The results of such an approach are the ability for a more descriptive representation of a spatio-temporal activity, which can then be used to support spatio-temporal accessibility analyses and disclose geographic information objects that are no longer accessible to the mobile information seeker. The introduction of these spatio-temporal constraints also allows the mobile information seeker to build up an itinerary that adheres to the given spatio-temporal constraints of the activity. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"accessibility; activity pattern; GIS; mobile communication; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881304727

This research attempts to explore and interpret patterns embedded in the network of phone-call interaction and the network of phone-users' movements, by considering the geographical context of mobile phone cells. We adopt an agglomerative clustering algorithm based on a Newman-Girvan modularity metric and propose an alternative modularity function incorporating a gravity model to discover the clustering structures of spatial-interaction communities using a mobile phone dataset from one week in a city in China. The results verify the distance decay effect and spatial continuity that control the process of partitioning phone-call interaction, which indicates that people tend to communicate within a spatialproximity community. Furthermore, we discover that a high correlation exists between phone-users' movements in physical space and phone-call interaction in cyberspace.

Optimality is defined in terms of minimizing some impedance value over the length of the route - the value to be minimized might be distance, travel time, financial cost, or any other metric. Conventional analysis procedures assume that impedance values of all possible travel routes are known a priori, and when this assumption holds, efficient solution strategies exist that allow truly optimal solutions to be found for even very large problems. When impedance values are not known with certainty a priori, exact solution strategies do not exist and heuristics must be employed. This study evaluated how the quality of the solutions generated by one such heuristic were impacted by the nature of the uncertainty in the cost database, the nature of the costs themselves, and the parameters used in the heuristic algorithm. It was found that all of these factors influenced the qualities of the solutions produced by the heuristic, but encouragingly, an easily controlled parameter of the heuristic algorithm itself played the most important role in controlling solution quality. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"algorithm; efficiency measurement; GIS; heuristics; parameterization; spatial data; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875793834

Unfortunately, paths calculated with this method are subject to distortions that stem from the imposed node-link structure. Due to the distortions, the calculated paths may be longer than the true optimum paths in continuous space, and because of this, they may also look highly unrealistic when displayed on a map. This study examines how the quality of the raster-based paths can be improved by using larger connectivity patterns on the one hand, and placing nodes on the sides of the cells of a raster instead of at their centers, on the other. In addition, the utility of the quadtree structure is examined.

Yet analytical methods for investigating more advanced research questions from such detailed movement datasets remain limited in scope and sophistication. Recent advances in the study of movement data has focused on characterizing types of dynamic interactions, such as single-file motion, while little progress has been made on quantifying the degree of such interactions. In this article, we introduce a new method for measuring dynamic interactions (termed DI) between pairs of moving objects. Simulated movement datasets are used to compare DI with an existing correlation statistic. Two applied examples, team sports and wildlife, are used to further demonstrate the value of the DI approach. The DI method is advantageous in that it measures interaction in both movement direction (termed azimuth) and displacement. Also, the DI approach can be applied at local, interval, episodal, and global levels of analysis. However the DI method is limited to situations where movements of two objects are recorded at simultaneous points in time. In conclusion, DI quantifies the level of dynamic interaction between two moving objects, allowing for more thorough investigation of processes affecting interactive moving objects. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"computer simulation; correlation; data set; dynamic analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873299470

Based on the exploitation of classical geographical sources (e.g. digital elevation models, optical images, and vector databases) and thematic sources (e.g. climate, meteorological, pedological and land cover databases), the system computes speed maps for different kinds of vehicles moving both on-road and off-road. Such computations are realized through a ground-vehicle interaction module that estimates the vehicle performance from experimental results, numerical simulations and empirical relationships. The system's architecture is built using a GIS interface that manages the data, the computation and the presentation layers. An operational version of this tool has been tested and validated on several operational theatres in France and in northern Africa. The results show good agreement between the predicted mobility performance of various vehicles and those observed on the field.

More and more academic institutions, private companies, and even individuals publish their own geographical information resources in the form of GIServices on the Internet. In today's resource-rich environment, fast and accurate service discovery is a significant problem for industry and academia, as well as regular users. To solve this problem, researchers introduced Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to the domain of GIServices. Being the core of SOA, a registry catalogue implements message exchange services. But current catalog service mechanisms lack the capability to search services, to monitor and to provide accurate descriptions for quality of service in an active manner. Therefore, current catalogue services are not able to overcome problems such as limited registered resources, inaccurate registration information and the uncertainty of service status in various geospatial applications. A catalogue framework for GIServices is proposed that effectively integrates the Quality of GIServices (QoGIService) theory, as well as service crawling/search and dynamic monitoring techniques.

Currently, high performance clusters are the only economically viable solution given the development of multicore technology and computer component cost reduction in recent years. Massive spatial data processing demands heavy I/O operations, however, and should be characterized as a data-intensive application. Data-intensive application parallelization strategies, such as decomposition, scheduling and load-balance, are much different from that of traditional compute-intensive applications. In this article we introduce a Split-and-Merge paradigm for spatial data processing and also propose a robust parallel framework in a cluster environment to support this paradigm. The Split-and-Merge paradigm efficiently exploits data parallelism for massive data processing. The proposed framework is based on the open-source TORQUE project and hosted on a multicore-enabled Linux cluster. A specific data-aware scheduling algorithm was designed to exploit data sharing between tasks and decrease the data communication time.

Given the variety and number of geospatial services advertised online, finding appropriate geospatial services has become a tremendous challenge for potential users. Geospatial service classification provides a basis for developing matching criteria to improve the efficiency of service discovery. At present, most classification-based matching methods require users to provide classification descriptions using a specified taxonomy. These requirements seriously limit the application of classification-based matching. To solve these kinds of problems, this article presents a hybrid geospatial service classification-matching method. Based on the differences in classification descriptions, three strategies are proposed: (1) the existing classification matching method is used for requests with classifications described using homogeneous taxonomies; (2) a formal-concept-analysis-based service classification matching method is proposed for service requests with classifications described using heterogeneous taxonomies; and (3) an interface-similarity-based service classification decision method is proposed for requests without classification descriptions. The feasibility of the hybrid geospatial service classification matching method is verified by two sets of experiments. The results reveal that this method can effectively broaden the application of classification-based matching in geospatial service discovery. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"classification; decision analysis; GIS; spatial data; World Wide Web",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871018267

However, in practice this assumption is appropriate only in a restricted spatial location, where the local experimental variograms vary slowly. Therefore, an adaptive method is developed in this article to model non-stationary variograms, for which the estimator and the indicator for characterization of spatial variation are a Voronoi map and the standard deviation of mean values displayed in the Voronoi map, respectively. For the adaptive method, the global domain is divided into different meshes with various sizes according to the variability of local variograms. The adaptive method of non-stationary variogram modeling is applied to simulating error surfaces of a LiDAR derived DEM located in Sichuan province, China.

Extending the virtual globe platform from the present centralized mode into a decentralized mode can significantly improve platform capacity and service quality without additional investment in hardware, but presents new challenges such as the time cost of finding a peer, unstable offering, and low service capacity. A GeoODP2P network is designed based on specific features of spatial data transmission. Next, we discuss peer selection mechanisms that relieve the negative influence of peers, and propose a pre-fetch mechanism that takes advantage of the unique characteristics of the P2P environment. This article implements a simulation system for a GeoODP2P network and presents a prototype platform that incorporates P2P functionality. Peer selection and pre-fetch mechanisms are studied and tested on this simulation system.

The proposed framework incorporates the concept of kinematics to represent the movement of isolines as advection displacement vectors. Comparison of displacement vectors from the four datasets shows differences in isotherm shifts for both median values and interquartile ranges along with several prominent, well defined difference regions across the globe. Among the four datasets used in the study, the two reanalysis datasets have the smallest median difference in displacement vectors indicating the least spatiotemporal difference. As both reanalysis datasets are based on actual observations, this result validates the displacement vector representation. The CNRM CM3 20C3M dataset contains an Antarctic Cooling that led to most of the differences in displacement vectors against the other datasets. The research shows the effectiveness of GIS enabled displacement vectors analysis to elicit spatial differences in climate patterns among GCM data and reanalysis data.

These limitations arise from spatial structures such as buildings and trees that affect spatial and temporal distributions of solar fluxes over urban surfaces. The traditional solar radiation models implemented in GIS can address this problem only partially. They can be adequately used only for 2-D surfaces such as terrain and rooftops. However, vertical surfaces, such as facades, require a 3-D approach. This study presents a new 3-D solar radiation model for urban areas represented by 3-D city models. The v.sun module implemented in GRASS GIS is based on the existing solar radiation methodology used in the topographic r.sun model with a new capability to process 3-D vector data representing complex urban environments. The calculation procedure is based on the combined vector-voxel approach segmenting the 3-D vector objects to smaller polygon elements according to a voxel data structure of the volume region. The shadowing effects of surrounding objects are considered using a unique shadowing algorithm.

Methods based on the automation of the modeling process offer a variety of three-dimensional structures, saving time and money. Geometry synthesis is currently used in many fields including digital cinema, electronic entertainment and simulation. There is a need to replace designers' work with intelligent automated algorithms, especially in the case of terrain modeling. This article addresses the problem of modeling virtual caves and tunnels and presents alternative solutions in the form of a hybrid system. The innovative approach combines two independent methods well known in computer graphics: shape grammars and shape morphing for modeling three-dimensional geometry. In the modeling process, it is possible to obtain the characteristics of 3D structures with non-spherical mesh topology. The objects and their transformations are described by functions, while production grammars define the geometry modeling process. The scene graph can be expanded by classic productions and optimized by morphing productions. Obtained shapes can be freely deformed in subsequent productions. The system offers control over the process of modeling and the resulting structure can be rendered up to a high level of realism.

In this study, we investigate the quality of DSMs derived from opto-electronic scanner data (ADS80; acquired in autumn 2010) using photogrammetric image correlation techniques based on the multispectral nadir and backward looking sensor data. As reference, we take a high precision airborne LiDAR data set with a spatial resolution of ca. 0.5m, acquired in late summer 2010, covering the Grabengufer/Dorfbach catchment near Randa, VS. We find the deviations between the two datasets are surprisingly low. In terrain with inclination angles of less than 30° the RMSE is below 0.5m. In extremely steep terrain of more than 50° the RMSE goes up to 2m and outliers increase significantly.

Surprisingly, it has not seen much application in environmental studies. The article presents a method of using thermovision for topoclimatic studies. The method is based on the spatial distribution of land surface temperature (LST). The LST distribution indicates the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth surface and depends primarily on terrain shape and land cover types. By analyzing the LST distribution, one can determine spatial topoclimatic variability. The LST derived topoclimatic classification was compared with the theoretical topoclimatic classification based on heat balance. New classes of topoclimates were created and some of the existing types were diversified into more detailed subtypes. The analysis of selected lowland areas in north-western Poland revealed that both land cover and terrain shape characteristics had a significant impact on the LST distribution, contrary to the expectation of land cover characteristics being more important than terrain shape.

The DEM, with a spatial resolution of 1m, and the TWI are evaluated against two seasons of water level measurements from 30 sites in the peatland. The TWI is calculated with a form-based flow routing algorithm which produces a natural flow routing pattern. In permafrost wetlands the topography is the major driver and is very important even though its magnitude is low. Site-specific wetness (SSW) measurements from the sites were compared with the different peatland types that occur in the study area, i.e. fen, internal fen and palsa.

Rockfall models are sensitive to the resolution of input data, i.e. the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) used. Nowadays, high resolution elevation data are available area-wide from airborne laser scanning (ALS). However, rockfall models are designed for analysis on a certain scale, which means that high resolution input might not necessarily improve model results (e.g. for regional scale studies). Our aim is to estimate the reach of rockfall by analysing different input resolutions of an ALS DTM. The presented empirically-based model, implemented in Python 2.7, is a modified version of the zenital method including an iterative random walk trajectory model, which is designed for rockfall hazard assessment at the regional scale. Trajectories and rockfall probability maps are generated for selected DTM input resolutions. The comparison shows that high resolution DTMs do consider local topography better and thus lead to more realistic results than low resolution DTMs. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"digital terrain model; hazard assessment; random walk method; rockfall; spatial resolution",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867410389

Slope analysis is usually used as the first step in much more sophisticated analyses as well as in complex models of natural phenomena. Fuzzy surfaces provide representation of geographical phenomena with all aspects of the uncertainty (i.e. both in terms of the description of reality or the uncertainty of measurement). The uncertainty in the input surface is crucial for analysis of slope. A high level of uncertainty can significantly affect the result of slope analysis. The Neighbourhood method was utilized for calculating with fuzzy numbers and to perform slope analysis of the fuzzy surface. The main reason for choosing this method is that it belongs to the most common tools in GIS software (e.g. both ArcGIS and GRASS). The computation with fuzzy numbers instead of crisp numbers allows evaluation of uncertainty of the resultant slope. The aim of this article is to present the process of slope calculation with fuzzy numbers as well as all necessary algorithms that are needed for such calculation. The further analysis of uncertainty provides important information for the process of decision making. The level of uncertainty in the results of the above-mentioned analysis can be as important as the actual result. It is especially important in situations where the amount of uncertainty varies at higher values. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"algorithm; fuzzy mathematics; GIS; image analysis; slope; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867409902

This article develops a case study of OpenStreetMap, one of the most successful VGI projects, and its default editor, Potlatch2. Ten participants with no prior experience of VGI contribution, were instructed to contribute data to OSM in a structured exercise, while being monitored using an eye tracker and audio/video screen capture software. Each participant was asked to Think Aloud, i.e. describe what they were thinking and doing as they completed the tasks. The results highlight significant usability issues impacting learnability, especially from the perspective of a new contributor: hidden functionality, lack of user feedback between interactions and the inefficient and inconsistent placement of functionality and map controls.

The ultimate objective is to develop methodologies to ensure the feature enrichment of authoritative data, using crowd sourced data. Users increasingly find that they wish to use data from both kinds of geographic data sources. Different techniques and methodologies can be developed to solve this problem. In our previous research, a position map matching algorithm was developed for integrating authoritative and crowd sourced road vector data, and showed promising results (Anand etal. 2010). However, especially when integrating different forms of data at the feature level, these techniques are often time consuming and are more computationally intensive than other techniques available. To tackle these problems, this project aims at developing a methodology for automated conflict resolution, linking and merging of geographical information from disparate authoritative and crowd-sourced data sources. This article describes research undertaken by the authors on the design, implementation, and evaluation of algorithms and procedures for producing a coherent ontology from disparate geospatial data sources. To integrate road vector data from disparate sources, the method presented in this article first converts input data sets to ontologies, and then merges these ontologies into a new ontology. This new ontology is then checked and modified to ensure that it is consistent. The developed methodology can deal with topological and geometry inconsistency and provide more flexibility for geospatial information merging. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"algorithm; GIS; mapping method; methodology; topology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864567346

These issues could have a potentially detrimental effect on the quality of OSM data while at the same time damaging the perception of OSM in the GIS community.

The analysis and visualization of these activities allow us to have a better understanding of the role of boundary spanning in the resourcing of each project, the incubation mechanism advocated by OSGeo, and the significance of the social interrelatedness among projects. The data consisted of the subversion (SVN) commit history made by individual developers in the programming code repository. We applied several network analytical and visualization techniques to explore the data. Our findings indicate that more than one in seven developers spanned multiple projects which potentially had the effects of shaping the projects' directions, and increased knowledge flow and innovation. In addition, the OSGeo's incubation mechanism provided an important encouragement for boundary spanning and increased knowledge sharing.

A theoretical framework of information relevance was used to understand the attributes of information that were most important in relation to the characteristics of the users' activity and their community. The key finding was that the discussion amongst GIS designers should not be whether to choose VGI or PGI as the information data set, but to consider which combination of VGI and PGI relating to different geographic features and task characteristics would best meet the users' needs. VGI is likely to be most relevant to the user when a geographic feature is dynamic rather than static in nature, and can also provide a level of detail that is unlikely to arise through PGI.

This article demonstrates that error propagation theory is not applicable because the critical assumption behind it cannot be satisfied. In fact, the non-random, non-normal, and non-stationary nature of DEM error makes it very challenging to apply statistical methods. This article presents approximation theory as a new methodology and illustrates its application to DEMs created by linear interpolation using contour lines as the source data. Applying approximation theory, a DEM's accuracy is determined by the largest error of any point (not samples) in the entire study area. The error at a point is bounded by max(|δ node|+M 2h 2/8) where |δ node| is the error in the source data used to interpolate the point, M 2 is the maximum norm of the second-order derivative which can be interpreted as curvature, and h is the length of the line on which linear interpolation is conducted.

While all of them address different visions and needs, they share a common theme: How do we manage massive amounts of heterogeneous data, derive knowledge out of them instead of drowning in information, and how do we make our findings reproducible and reusable by others? In a network of knowledge, topics span across scientific disciplines and the idea of domain ontologies as common agreements seems like an illusion. In this work, we argue that these trends require a radical paradigm shift in ontology engineering away from a small number of authoritative, global ontologies developed top-down, to a high number of local ontologies that are driven by application needs and developed bottom-up out of observation data. Similarly as the early Web was replaced by a social Web in which volunteers produce data instead of purely consuming it, the next generation of knowledge infrastructures has to enable users to become knowledge engineers themselves. Surprisingly, existing ontology engineering frameworks are not well suited for this new perspective. Hence, we propose an observation-driven ontology engineering framework, show how its layers can be realized using specific methodologies, and relate the framework to existing work on geo-ontologies. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"bottom-up approach; infrastructure; Internet; philosophy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861560141

Their primary goal is to minimize the loss of life and property, especially in neighborhoods with high population densities, where response time is of great importance. In recent years, mobile phones have become a primary communication device during emergencies. The portability of cell phones and ease of information storage and dissemination has enabled effective implementation of cell phones by first responders and one of the most viable means of communication with the population. Using cellular location data during evacuation planning and response also provides increased awareness to emergency personnel. This article introduces a multi-objective, multi-criteria approach to determining optimum evacuation routes in an urban setting. The first objective is to calculate evacuation routes for individual cell phone locations, minimizing the time it would take for a sample population to evacuate to designated safe zones based on both distance and congestion criteria. The second objective is to maximize coverage of individual cell phone locations, using the criteria of underlying geographic features, distance and congestion. In summary, this article presents a network-based methodology for providing additional analytic support to emergency services personnel for evacuation planning. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"disaster management; mobile communication; multicriteria analysis; multiobjective programming; population density; telecommunication",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861555365

Through a design-based research approach we develop a prototype framework, ""GeoGame"", that allows users to play board-game-style simulations on top of an online map. Through several iterations we demonstrate the implementation of a range of design artifacts including: real-time, multi-user editing of online maps, web services, game lobby, user-modifiable rules and scenarios building, chat, discussion, and market transactions. Based on observational, analytical, experimental and functional evaluations of design artifacts as well as a literature review, we argue that a MMO GeoGame-framework offers a viable approach to address the complex dynamics of human-environmental systems that require a simultaneous reconciliation of both top-down and bottom-up decision making where stakeholders are an integral part of a modeling environment.

The heterogeneous data formats and data transfer mechanisms make the data collection and integration a difficult task for the EEA. An approach is needed for facilitating the interoperable exchange of environmental data on a large scale. A core element of this approach is the Sensor WebEnablement (SWE) technology of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) which allows the standardized, interoperable, vendor and domain independent exchange of sensor data. The main contribution of this article is a lightweight profile for the OGC Sensor Observation Service that ensures the necessary interoperability for seamlessly integrating the environmental data provided by the EEA's member states and thus forms the foundation for the developed data exchange mechanisms. This is complemented by information about the resulting Sensor Web architecture and the integration into the EEA's existing IT infrastructure.

One such aspect is that of access to distributed earth observation data and computing resources. Earth observation research often utilizes large datasets requiring extensive CPU and memory resources in their processing. These resource intensive processes can be chained; the sequence of processes (and their provenance) makes up a scientific workflow. Despite the exponential growth in capacity of desktop computers, their resources are often insufficient for the scientific workflow processing tasks at hand. By integrating distributed computing capabilities into a geospatially enabled scientific workflow environment, it is possible to provide researchers with a mechanism to overcome the limitations of the desktop computer. Most of the effort on extending scientific workflows with distributed computing capabilities has focused on the web services approach, as exemplified by the OGC's Web Processing Service and by GRID computing. The approach to leveraging distributed computing resources described in this article uses instead remote objects via RPyC and the dynamic properties of the Python programming language. The Vistrails environment has been extended to allow for geospatial processing through the EO4Vistrails package (). In order to allow these geospatial processes to be seamlessly executed on distributed resources such as cloud computing nodes, the Vistrails environment has been extended with both multi-tasking capabilities and distributed processing capabilities.

One of the key objectives of WISERD is to develop a spatial framework that enhances a researcher's ability to discover socio-economic research data relating to Wales with the aim of encouraging collaborative research and re-use of existing data. This article describes the development of an online geoportal designed to meet this objective. Using free and open-source software (FOSS) components and services, a range of software tools has been developed to capture standards-compliant metadata for a variety of data sources. The geoportal is unique in that, in our review of over 120 geoportals worldwide, we have not previously encountered a geoportal dedicated to supporting quantitative and qualitative social science academic and policy research. A particularly innovative aspect of the geoportal has involved the building of a rich meta-database of government surveys, geo-referenced semantically-tagged qualitative data (generated from primary research), 'grey' data (e.g. from transcripts, journal publications, books, PhD theses) and Government administrative data.

The same applies to algorithms that produce gridded datasets from sparse or abundant raw data. Further use of the resulting data products has been challenging, especially for dissemination outside the institute of origin. Due to the gradually increasing size of data products, simply downloading copies of them is becoming impossible. A gradual transition from traditional download methods to web services is therefore observed. Web services allow for on-the-fly access to subsets of data that were hitherto considered as indivisible granules. Here we compare the most mature candidates to serve gridded data through the web: the Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) protocols. In the framework of the new Dutch National Model and Data Centre (NMDC.eu) a distributed data storage has been created by coupling OPeNDAP servers. A WCS service layer is provided for the same data.

These hazards present a problem for navigation, because they typically appear in an unplanned manner and are seldom included in databases used for accessibility mapping. Tactile maps are a traditional tool used by blind and vision-impaired people for navigation through urban environments, but such maps are not automatically updated with transitory hazards. As an alternative approach to static content on tactile maps, we use volunteered geographic information (VGI) and an Open Source system to provide updates of local infrastructure. These VGI updates, contributed via voice, text message, and e-mail, use geographic descriptions containing place names to describe changes to the local environment. After they have been contributed and stored in a database, we georeference VGI updates with a detailed gazetteer of local place names including buildings, administrative offices, landmarks, roadways, and dormitories. We publish maps and alerts showing transitory hazards, including location-based alerts delivered to mobile devices. Our system is built with several technologies including PHP, JavaScript, AJAX, Google Maps API, PostgreSQL, an Open Source database, and PostGIS, the PostgreSQL's spatial extension.

Within marine biology, the Census of Marine Life served as the catalyst for such a global data aggregation effort. Under the Census framework, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System was established to coordinate an unprecedented aggregation of global marine biogeography data. The OBIS data system now contains 31.3 million observations, freely accessible through a geospatial portal. The challenges of storing, querying, disseminating, and mapping a global data collection of this complexity and magnitude are significant. In the face of declining performance and expanding feature requests, a redevelopment of the OBIS data system was undertaken. Following an Open Source philosophy, the OBIS technology stack was rebuilt using PostgreSQL, PostGIS, GeoServer and OpenLayers. This approach has markedly improved the performance and online user experience while maintaining a standards-compliant and interoperable framework. Due to the distributed nature of the project and increasing needs for storage, scalability and deployment flexibility, the entire hardware and software stack was built on a Cloud Computing environment. The flexibility of the platform, combined with the power of the application stack, enabled rapid re-development of the OBIS infrastructure, and ensured complete standards-compliance. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"biogeography; complexity; data set; GIS; information system; mapping; marine ecosystem; software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859740785

The availability of Internet-based options for implementing PPGIS presents new opportunities for increased efficiency and new modes of access. Here we used a mixed-mode approach to evaluate paper versus Internet mapping methods for the same PPGIS survey in Wyoming. We compared participant characteristics, mapping participation, and the spatial distribution of mapped attributes between participants who responded to the paper versus Internet option. The response rate for those who completed the paper version of the survey was nearly 2.5 times the response rate of the Internet version. Paper participants also mapped significantly more places than did Internet participants (43 vs. 18). Internet participants tended to be younger, more likely to have a college degree, and had lived in the region for less time than paper participants. For all but one attribute there was no difference in the spatial distribution of places mapped between Internet and paper methods. Using a paper-based PPGIS survey resulted in a higher response rate, reduced participant bias, and greater mapping participation.

Once incidents are georeferenced they can be spatially queried and analyzed. However, one major challenge for evaluating SAR in a spatial context is the lack of explicitly spatial data (addresses or coordinates) for historic incidents; they must be georeferenced from textual descriptions. This study implemented two established approaches for georeferencing incidents, the 'Point-Radius' and 'Shape' methods. Incorporating uncertainty measurements into a spatial database allows for more appropriate analyses of spatial dependence and the spatial distribution of incidents. From 2005-2010, 1,271 of 1,356 Yosemite Search and Rescue YOSAR incidents (93.7%) could be georeferenced using the Point-Radius Method, with a mean uncertainty radius=560±51 m and mean uncertainty area of 3.60±0.840km2. However, when the Shape Method was applied to six case studies by considering the reference object shape, the uncertainty areas were reduced considerably (by up to 99.5% of the uncertain area generated by the Point-Radius Method). This is the first spatially-explicit study of SAR incidents and yields valuable insights into the role of georeferenced data in emergency preparedness. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"database; GIS; spatial analysis; spatial data; spatial distribution; uncertainty analysis; California; United States; Yosemite National Park",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82155184347

Residential histories associate a person with a list of addresses of residence and the length of occupancy at each address. Tenure histories document the list of persons occupying a residence along with length of occupancy. These histories were created using fuzzy matching on name address pairs between sequential years. Simulated annual phone listing data were used to develop and test the methodology which was then applied to an actual white page phone listing for a study town in Maine. The approach is applied locally and generates partial local residential and tenure histories that capture local migrations. We see these local history sets as building blocks for constructing more geographically extensive histories over time.

Geocoding systems may match these input addresses to the closest available nearby address range and assign low confidence values (match scores) to increase match rates, but little is published describing the matching or scoring techniques used in these systems. This article sheds light on these practices by investigating the need for, technical approaches to, and utility of nearby matching methods used to increase match rates in geocode data. The scope of the problem is motivated by an analysis of a commonly used health dataset. The technical approach of a geocoding system that includes a nearby matching approach is described along with a method for scoring candidates based on spatially-varying neighborhoods. This method, termed dynamic nearby reference feature scoring, identifies, scores, ranks, and returns the most probable candidate to which the input address feature belongs or is spatially near. This approach is evaluated against commercial systems to assess its effectiveness and resulting spatial accuracy. Results indicate this approach is viable for improving match rates while maintaining acceptable levels of spatial accuracy. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"accuracy assessment; data set; error analysis; interpolation; neighborhood; spatial analysis; spatial variation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82155183114

Under the influence of the format defined for TIGER files decades ago, most address databases and street geocoding algorithms are organized around street centerlines, associating numbering ranges to thoroughfare segments between two street crossings. While this method has been successfully employed in the USA for a long time, its transposition to other countries may lead to increased errors. This article presents an evaluation of the centerline-geocoding resources provided by Google Maps, as compared to the point-geocoding method used in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, which we took as a baseline. We generated a textual address for each point object found in the city's point-based address database, and submitted it to the Google Maps geocoding API. We then compared the resulting coordinates with the ones recorded in Belo Horizonte's GIS. We demonstrate that the centerline segment interpolation method, employed by the online resources following the American practice, has problems that can considerably influence the quality of the geocoding outcome. Completeness and accuracy have been found to be irregular, especially within lower income areas. Such errors in online services can have a significant impact on geocoding efforts related to social applications, such as public health and education, since the online service can be faulty and error-prone in the most socially demanding areas of the city. In the conclusion, we point out that a volunteered geographic information (VGI) approach can help with the enrichment and enhancement of current geocoding resources, and can possibly lead to their transformation into more reliable point-based geocoding services. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"accuracy assessment; algorithm; database; GIS; interpolation; urban area; Brazil",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82155183112

Location mentions are particularly important in disaster messages as they can show emergency responders where problems have occurred. This article explores the sorts of locations that occur in disaster-related social messages, how well off-the-shelf software identifies those locations, and what is needed to improve automated location identification, called geo-parsing. To do this, we have sampled Twitter messages from the February 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand. We annotated locations in messages manually to make a gold standard by which to measure locations identified by a Named Entity Recognition software. The Stanford NER software found some locations that were proper nouns, but did not identify locations that were not capitalized, local streets and buildings, or non-standard place abbreviations and mis-spellings that are plentiful in microtext. We review how these problems might be solved in software research, and model a readable crisis map that shows crisis location clusters via enlarged place labels. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"automation; earthquake event; software; tsunami event; Canterbury [South Island]; Christchurch [Canterbury]; New Zealand; South Island",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82155178491

Arcanjo, F., Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Departamento de Ciência da Computação, Brazil","User interaction in social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, is increasingly becoming a source of useful information on daily events. The online monitoring of short messages posted in such networks often provides insight on the repercussions of events of several different natures, such as (in the recent past) the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the royal wedding in Britain and the death of Osama bin Laden. Studying the origins and the propagation of messages regarding such topics helps social scientists in their quest for improving the current understanding of human relationships and interactions. However, the actual location associated to a tweet or to a Facebook message can be rather uncertain. Some tweets are posted with an automatically determined location (from an IP address), or with a user-informed location, both in text form, usually the name of a city. We observe that most Twitter users opt not to publish their location, and many do so in a cryptic way, mentioning non-existing places or providing less specific place names (such as ""Brazil""). In this article, we focus on the problem of enriching the location of tweets using alternative data, particularly the social relationships between Twitter users. Our strategy involves recursively expanding the network of locatable users using following-follower relationships. Verification is achieved using cross-validation techniques, in which the location of a fraction of the users with known locations is used to determine the location of the others, thus allowing us to compare the actual location to the inferred one and verify the quality of the estimation. With an estimate of the precision of the method, it can then be applied to locationless tweets. Our intention is to infer the location of as many users as possible, in order to increase the number of tweets that can be used in spatial analyses of social phenomena. The article demonstrates the feasibility of our approach using a dataset comprising tweets that mention keywords related to dengue fever, increasing by 45% the number of locatable tweets. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Internet; social network; World Wide Web",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82155178489

Increasingly, this information is of a spatio-temporal nature, which enables tracking of phenomena through both space and time. Despite the increasing availability of spatio-temporal data, however, the methods for processing and analyzing these data are lacking. Existing geocoding techniques are no exception. Geocoding enables the geographic location of people and events to be known and tracked. However, geocoded information is highly generalized and subject to various interpolation errors. In addition, geocoding for spatio-temporal data is especially challenging because of the inherent dynamism of associated data. This article presents a methodology for geocoding spatio-temporal data in ArcGIS that utilizes several additional supporting procedures to enhance spatial accuracy, including the use of supplementary land use information, aerial photographs and local knowledge. This hybrid methodology allows for the tracking of phenomenon through space and over time. It is also able to account for reporting inconsistencies, which is a common feature of spatio-temporal data.

Cloud computing, a promising platform with a large pool of storage and computing resources, could be a practical solution for hosting vast amounts of data and for real-time processing. In this article, we explored the feasibility of using Google App Engine (GAE), the cloud computing technology by Google, for a module in navigation services, called Integrated GNSS (iGNSS) QoS prediction. The objective of this module is to predict quality of iGNSS positioning solutions for prospective routes in advance. iGNSS QoS prediction involves the real-time computation of large Triangulated Irregular Networks (TINs) generated from LiDAR data. We experimented with the Google App Engine (GAE) and stored a large TIN for two geoprocessing operations (proximity and bounding box) required for iGNSS QoS prediction. The experimental results revealed that while cloud computing can potentially be used for development and deployment of data- and/or compute-intensive geospatial applications, current cloud platforms require improvements and special tools for handling real-time geoprocessing, such as iGNSS QoS prediction, efficiently.

This produces likely sequences of events that a user may compare and analyze using spatial or temporal criteria. The branching events model is especially useful for spatiotemporal decision support systems, as decision-makers are able to identify alternative locations and times of events and, depending on the context, also identify regions of multiple possible events.

There are many techniques for estimating robust trends but evaluating the significance of the trends can be difficult due to this increased variance. This article presents a novel approach called the Contextual Mann-Kendall (CMK) test for assessing significant trends. This test uses the principle of spatial autocorrelation to characterize geographical phenomena, according to which a pixel would not be expected to exhibit a radically different trend from neighboring pixels. The procedure removes serial correlation through a prewhitening process. Then, similar to the logic of the Regionally Averaged Mann-Kendall (RAMK) test, it combines the information from neighboring pixels while adjusting for cross-correlation. CMK was compared with the Mann-Kendall (MK) test in which contextual information was not involved for the mean annual NDVI over 22 years (1982-2003) in West Africa. With the MK test, ∼11% of the study area showed significant (p < 0.001) trends which increased to 16% when tested using the CMK test. Thus the CMK test produces a result that makes intuitive sense from a geographical perspective and enhances the ability to detect trends in relatively short time series. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"assessment method; autocorrelation; image analysis; NDVI; pixel; spatial analysis; time series analysis; trend analysis; West Africa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053994880

Originating from time geography, space-time cubes provide an approach to integrate spatial and temporal air pollution information into a 3D space. The base of the cube represents the variation of air pollution in a 2D geographical space while the height represents time. This way, the changes of pollution over time can be described by the different component layers of the cube from the base up. The diurnal ambient ozone (O3) pollution in Houston, Texas is modeled in this study using the space-time air pollution cube. Two methods, land use regression (LUR) modeling and spatial interpolation, were applied to build the hourly component layers for the air pollution cube. It was found that the LUR modeling performed better than the spatial interpolation in predicting air pollution level. With the availability of real-time air pollution data, this approach can be extended to produce real-time air pollution cube is for more accurate air pollution measurement across space and time, which can provide important support to studies in epidemiology, health geography, and environmental regulation. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"atmospheric dynamics; atmospheric pollution; interpolation; ozone; real time; spatiotemporal analysis; two-dimensional modeling; urban pollution; Houston County [Texas]; Texas; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053986618

It expands on two of the commonly used spatial interpolation methods, IDW (inverse distance weighting) and OK (ordinary kriging), and applies them to analyze spatial data observed on a network. The study first provides the methodological framework, and it then examines the validity of the proposed methods by cross-validating elevations from two contrasting patterns of street network and comparing the MSEs (Mean Squared Errors) of the predicted values measured with the two proposed network-based methods and their conventional counterparts. The study suggests that both network-based IDW and network-based OK are generally more accurate than their existing counterparts, with network-based OK constantly outperforming the other methods. The network-based methods also turn out to be more sensitive to the edge effect, and their performance improves after edge correction. Furthermore, the MSEs of standard OK and network-based OK improve as more sample locations are used, whereas those of standard IDW and network-based IDW remain stable regardless of the number of sample locations. The two network-based methods use a similar set of sample locations, and their performance is inherently affected by the difference in their weight distribution among sample locations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"GIS; interpolation; kriging; numerical method; spatial analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051756403

Spatially structured random effects (SRE) and unstructured random effects (URE) terms added to the conventional logistic regression model take into account overdispersion and residual spatial structure, which if unaccounted for could cause incorrect identification of risk factors. Mapping and/or calculating the ratio of random effects that are spatially-structured monitor the extent of residual spatial structure. The monitoring provides insights into identification of unknown covariates that have similar spatial structures to those of SRE. Adding such covariates to the model has the potential to diminish the residual spatial structure, until possibly all or most of the spatial structure can be explained. Risk factors identified are the added covariates that have statistically significant regression coefficients. We apply the methods to the analysis of domestic burglaries in Cambridgeshire, England. Small-area analysis of crime where data often display apparent spatial structure would particularly benefit from the methodologies.

These methods have difficulty in dealing with flow data, as each instance is associated with a pair of zones. This study develops a new concept, flow line interpolation, to fill the abovementioned gap. We also develop a first flow line interpolation method to estimate commuting flow data between spatial units in a target zoning scheme based on such data in a source zoning scheme. Three models (i.e., areal-weighted, intelligent, and gravity-type flow line interpolation) are presented.

This assumption is often unrealistic real-world situations. The article proposes a new approach to GIS-based multicriteria analysis. It develops a local form of the global WLC model. The range sensitivity principle is used as a central concept for developing the local WLC model. The principle postulates that the greater the range of criterion values is, the greater the weight assigned to that criterion should be. Consequently, the local criterion weight can be defined for each neighborhood witha study area as a function of the range of criterion values a given neighborhood. The range of criterion values provides also the base for defining the local value function.

TIGER data for the year 2000, however, are of limited positional accuracy and were deemed of insufficient quality to support the 2010 Census. In response the US Census Bureau embarked on the MAF/TIGER Accuracy Improvement Project (MTAIP) in an effort to improve the positional accuracy of the database, modernize the data processing environment and improve cooperation with partner agencies. Improved TIGER data were released for the entire US just before the 2010 Census. The current study characterizes the positional accuracy of the TIGER 2009 data compared with the TIGER 2000 data based on selected road intersections. Three US counties were identified as study areas and in each county 100 urban and 100 rural sample locations were selected. Features in the TIGER 2000 and 2009 data were compared with reference locations derived from high resolution natural color orthoimagery. Results indicate that TIGER 2009 data are much improved in terms of positional accuracy compared with the TIGER 2000 data, by at least one order of magnitude across urban and rural areas in all three counties for most accuracy metrics. TIGER 2009 is consistently more accurate in urban areas compared with rural areas, by a factor of at least two for most accuracy metrics. Despite the substantial improvement in positional accuracy, large positional errors of greater than 10m are relatively common in the TIGER 2009 data, in most cases representing remnant segments of minor roads from older versions of the TIGER data. As a result, based on the US Census Bureau's suggested accuracy metric, the TIGER 2009 data meet the accuracy expectation of 7.6m for two of the three urban areas but for none of the three rural areas. The suggested metric is based on the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) protocol and was found to be very sensitive to the presence of a small number of very large errors. This presents challenges during attempts to characterize the accuracy of TIGER data or other spatial data using this protocol. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"accuracy assessment; census; data processing; spatial data; transportation infrastructure; urban area; urban transport; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051737958

Scholars postulate that this problem is exacerbated when one uses a definition of neighborhoods that is based on administrative units; doing so leads to an aspatial measure of segregation, which may or may not adequately account for the spatial relationships among residential locations. In this article, we assess whether aspatial and spatial definitions of neighborhoods produce different perceived levels of income segregation. Using an original individual-level dataset on income in San Mateo County, California, we define each individual's neighborhood in three ways - two aspatial and one spatial. On the basis of these definitions of neighborhoods, we then estimate residential income segregation using the local Moran's I statistic. We report two primary findings. First, the three measures generate different perceived levels of income segregation. Specifically, we observe less income segregation when using the aspatial measures as compared with the spatial one. Second, the inconsistencies between these measures are systematic in such a way as to lead to different inferences when used to predict individual voter turnout. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"data set; income distribution; neighborhood; residential location; statistical analysis; California; San Mateo County; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958862610

Dasymetric mapping techniques can be employed to estimate population characteristics of small areas that do not correspond to census enumeration boundaries. Several types of ancillary data have been used in dasymetric mapping but performance is often limited by their relatively coarse resolution and moderate correspondence to actual population counts. The current research examines the performance of using high resolution ancillary data in the form of individual address point datasets which represent the locations of all addressable units within a jurisdiction. The performance of address points was compared with several other techniques, including areal weighting, land cover, imperviousness, road density and nighttime lights. Datasets from 16 counties in Ohio were used in the analysis, reflecting a range of different population densities. For each technique the ancillary data sources were employed to estimate census block group population counts using census tracts as source zones, and the results were compared with the known block group population counts. Results indicate that address points perform significantly better compared with other types of ancillary data. The overall error for all block groups (n = 683) using address points is 4.9% compared with 10.8% for imperviousness, 11.6% for land cover, 13.3% for road density, 18.6% for nighttime lights and 21.2% for areal weighting. Using only residential address points rather than all types of locations further reduces this error to 4.2%. Analysis of the spatial patterns in the relative performance of the various techniques revealed that address points perform particularly well in low density rural areas, which typically present challenges for traditional dasymetric mapping techniques using land cover datasets. These results provide very strong support for the use of address points for small area population estimates. Current developments in the growing availability of address point datasets and the implications for spatial demographic analyses are discussed. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"census; data set; demographic method; land cover; mapping method; population estimation; rural area; spatial analysis; Ohio; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958818016

ArcGIS was employed to provide the primary user interface, process network data, and visualize the results. In addition, the GIS, through its powerful capabilities to process spatial data, could allow decision- makers to quickly determine the potential impact of a contamination event, at any stage, as a function of both time and geography. Two contamination scenarios along the farm-to-fork chain were examined to show the geographic zone and the proportion of the population affected by the contamination. A constraint Voronoi data structure was developed to define influence zones (these were color coded according to a dynamic risk index), to identify those areas that are at greatest immediate risk as time progresses, and to estimate the population affected by these contamination events.

However, it is often inappropriate to use the default geographic units to perform spatial analysis due to unstable estimates with small areas (e.g. cancer rates for census blocks or tracts). Regionalization is aggregating small units into relatively larger areas while optimizing a homogeneity measure (such as the sum of squared differences). For exploratory spatial analysis, regionalization may help remove spurious data variation through aggregation and discover hidden patterns in data (such as areas of unusually high cancer rates). Towards this goal, this research introduces several improvements to a recent group of regionalization methods - REDCAP (Guo 2008) and conducts evaluation experiments with synthetic data sets to assess and compare the capability of regionalization methods for exploratory spatial analysis. One of the major improvements is the integration of a local empirical Bayes smoother (EBS) with the regionalization methods. We generate a large number of synthetic data sets with controlled spatial patterns to evaluate the performance of both new and existing methods. Evaluation results show that the new methods (integrated with EBS) perform significantly better than their original versions and other methods (including the EBS method on its own) in terms of detecting the true patterns in the synthetic data sets. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Bayesian analysis; data set; empirical analysis; regionalization; spatial analysis; spatial data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958801999

The uWATER-Pumping Assessment (uWATER-PA) toolkit, on the other hand, is an extended package targeting the specific environmental issue of groundwater pumping impacts. The uWATER-PA package is an excellent alternative to evaluating complex groundwater pumping assessment issues before investing significant time, labor, and funds in monitoring and detailed scientific study. It incorporates simulation of the physics of groundwater flow and user interaction into GIS software. A graphical user interface makes both data entry and interpretation of results intuitive to non-technical individuals. Results are presented as colored drawdown maps and can be saved in GIS format for future dissemination.

However, current research within GIScience in this area has largely ignored issues related to scale and granularity - in other words how much are the patterns that we see a function of the size of the looking glass that we apply? In this article we investigate the implications of varying the temporal scale at which three movement parameters, speed, sinuosity and turning angle are derived, and explore the relationship between this temporal scale and uncertainty in the individual data points making up a trajectory. A very rich dataset, representing the movement of 10 cows over some two days every 0.25s is investigated. Our cross-scale analysis shows firstly, that movement parameters for all 10 cows are broadly similar over a range of scales when the data are segmented to remove quasi-static subtrajectories. However, by exploring realistic values of GPS uncertainty using Monte Carlo Simulation, it becomes apparent that fine scale measurement of all movement parameters is masked by uncertainties, and that we can only make meaningful statements about movement when we take these uncertainties into account. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"computer simulation; data set; GIS; GPS; Monte Carlo analysis; research; trajectory",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958296650

Yet a lack of suitable data, coupled with poor classification schemas, has stymied efforts to create such a national perspective. This research reports on metrics and classification methodologies that have been applied to large scale topographic data, that afford a systematic classification of certain retail spaces potentially at the national coverage. By analysing the form, composition, extent and patterns of buildings within retail spaces, together with their degree of centrality and levels of access, we demonstrate that it is possible to classify different types of retail space. The research illustrates the utility of fine scale topographic data beyond mere mapping. The article compares three methodologies used for classification (Boolean, fuzzy logic and Bayesian modelling) and evaluates them through comparison with known locations of various retail types as a way of assessing the validity of these approaches.

This response is difficult to predict due to the fact that the city is a nonlinear system of organized complexity. Models of cities which seek to explain this response are necessarily complicated and dynamic. Where an analytical solution is not possible we turn to computer simulation and interactive visualization in order to understand their output. Allowing human participation in such simulations provides a sandbox in which to experiment with the dynamic behaviour of an urban model and play a part in its evolution. Two possible options for structuring this participation are: toy retail systems, which allow unconstrained experimentation, and games, which impose rules and involve role-play and competition. To explore these ideas we construct a toy retail system and a two-player retail game, both of which are derived from an existing agent-based retail model.

In the face of increasing global competition and a difficult economic climate, the capital must compete effectively to encourage and support such investors. Through a collaborative study with London's official FDI promotion agency, Think London, the need for a coherent framework for data, methodologies and tools to inform business location decision-making became apparent. This article discusses the development of a rich environment to explore, compare and rank London's business neighbourhoods. This is achieved through the development and evaluation of a model for location-based decision support. First, we discuss the development of a geo-business classification for London which draws upon methods and practices common in geodemographic neighbourhood classification. A geo-business classification is developed, encapsulating relevant location variables using Principal Components Analysis into a set of composite area profiles. Second, we discuss the implementation of an appropriate Multi-Criteria Decision Making methodology, in this case Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), enabling the aggregation of the geo-business classification and decision-makers' preferences into discrete decision alternatives.

Many of the existing solutions, however, behave like car navigation systems and do not include references to such landmarks. This research provides empirical evidence to identify the information requirements for an automated pedestrian navigation system. The two experiments discussed within this article helped identify the criteria that govern the relative saliency of features of interest within an urban environment. There are a large variety of features of interest that can be used as directional aids within route descriptions (buildings, statues, monuments, hills, roads, etc). Different measures are therefore required in order to calculate the saliency of the different classes of features. The research revealed that the most important measures of saliency include name, size, age, and colour. The research confirmed that that relative visibility and the direction of approach to the feature also affect a landmark's saliency.

The potential of this operation has increased considerably as data sources and Web services to manipulate them are becoming widely available via the Internet. Standards from the OGC enable such geospatial 'mashups' to be seamless and user driven, involving discovery of thematic data. The user is naturally inclined to look for spatial clusters and 'correlation' of outcomes. Using classical cluster detection scan methods to identify multivariate associations can be problematic in this context, because of a lack of control on or knowledge about background populations. For public health and epidemiological mapping, this limiting factor can be critical but often the focus is on spatial identification of risk factors associated with health or clinical status. In this article we point out that this association itself can ensure some control on underlying populations, and develop an exploratory scan statistic framework for multivariate associations. Inference using statistical map methodologies can be used to test the clustered associations. The approach is illustrated with a hypothetical data example and an epidemiological study on community MRSA.

These data can be used in many application domains such as traffic management, urban planning, tourism, bird migration, and so on. Raw trajectory data, as generated by mobile devices have very little or no semantics, and in most applications a higher level of abstraction is needed to exploit these data for decision making. Although several different methods have been proposed so far for trajectory querying and mining, there are no software tools to help the end user with semantic trajectory data analysis. In this article we present a software architecture for semantic trajectory data mining as well as the first software prototype to enrich trajectory data with both semantic information and data mining. As a prototype we extend the Weka data mining toolkit with the module Weka-STPM, which is interoperable with databases constructed under OGC specifications. We tested Weka-STPM with real geographic databases, and trajectory data stored under the Postgresql/PostGIS DBMS. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"data mining; database; GIS; software; visualization; Aves; Gallirallus australis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953318177

Injury prevention research aims to identify vulnerable populations and places by analyzing the spatial patterns of demographic and socio-economic risk factors associated with elevated injury rates. The stakeholders in injury prevention and control are often distributed across government and public health institutions, non-profits, and even the private sector (e.g. insurance firms). While this situation calls for distributed, online research tools, their implementation may conflict with health data confidentiality and license limitations for socio-economic data. In this article, we present the Online Injury Atlas for Ontario, which was designed with the explicit goal of making use of, and contributing to, the Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure. We propose a service-based architecture that integrates publicly accessible map services with protected data layers. Thereby, we demonstrate the benefits of using spatial data infrastructures alongside private data at different levels of protection.

Many different actors are involved in these steps: the owner (public or private); the planning, construction, and operation managers; the environmental teams executing the monitoring; the government department or agency responsible for protecting the environment and the health of the population; and, finally, the policy-makers. The environmental agency itself is composed of various domain experts dealing with different environmental arenas (air, water, etc.). Since most of the collected information refers to space and time, GISs are natural tools for storing and processing the data.

Previous research has highlighted the shortcomings associated with traditional visualization techniques used to assess these impacts, and also the means by which such information is then disseminated to the wider public during the consultation stages of the wind farm planning process. This research is concerned with examining the potential of Web-based mapping and digital landscape visualization techniques for addressing some of these shortcomings. This article reports the findings of a Web-based survey study designed to evaluate the potential of online GIS-based approaches for improving the effectiveness and dissemination of wind farm visualizations and enhancing public participation in the wind farm planning process.

It is beneficial to integrate / conflate these multi-source geospatial datasets, since the integration of multi-source geospatial data can provide insights and capabilities not possible with individual datasets. However, multi-source datasets over the same geographical area are often disparate. Accurately integrating geospatial data from different sources is a challenging task. Among the subtasks of integration/conflation, the most crucial one is feature matching, which identifies the features from different datasets as presentations of the same real-world geographic entity. In this article we present a new relaxation-based point feature matching approach to match the road intersections from two GIS vector road datasets. The relaxation labeling algorithm utilizes iterated local context updates to achieve a globally consistent result. The contextual constraints (relative distances between points) are incorporated into the compatibility function employed in each iteration's updates. The point-to-point matching confidence matrix is initialized using the road connectivity information at each point. Both the traditional proximity-based approach and our relaxation-based point matching approach are implemented and experiments are conducted over 18 test sites in rural and suburban areas of Columbia, MO. The test results show that our relaxation labeling approach has much better performance than the proximity matching approach in both simple and complex situations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"accuracy assessment; data set; GIS; mapping; matrix; spatial data; vector",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951644389

This is because GIS could process geo-data focusing on their meaning and not on their syntax and/or structure. An important aspect for achieving these objectives is the establishment of an automatic means of correspondence between geo-data and their conceptualization in Higher Levels Ontologies (HLO). In this article, a new type of Ontology is proposed (Data-Representation Ontology (DRO)). This Ontology describes the semantic embedded in geo-data, which cannot be represented in current types of Ontologies. Across this Ontology, heterogeneous geographical data can be integrated in the semantic space contributing positively to the development of solutions for the problems of interoperability between heterogeneous systems. Likewise, we propose a new method for the automatic generation of the DRO and its interrelationships with HLO, based on pattern classification techniques. The experiments show that once the DRO is generated, the classifier can classify all data correctly. Thus, these data are semantically enriched. Moreover, this article shows how the topological relationships can enrich the semantics in the generated Ontology and increase the effectiveness of spatial analysis. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"data processing; data set; GIS; spatial analysis; topology; Hyphomicrobium-like organism",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951607858

Such patterns emerged during our study of the process of ghettoization of Jews as implemented in Budapest during the course of 1944. As part of an NSF-sponsored research project on the geography of the Holocaust, we built a Historical GIS of the Budapest Ghetto with the objective of discovering patterns of Jewish concentration and dispersion as well as simulating potential daily spatial interactions between the Jewish and the non-Jewish population. Spatial analytical techniques allowed us to discover distinct spatial patterns of isolation, interrelation and concentration, but a whole set of patterns appeared that were the opposite of what we expected, and that could only be explained by thinking of distance not in spatial terms but in social ones.

The present study depicts the estimation of water quality parameters, namely turbidity and phosphate, through regression analysis using the reflectance derived from remote sensing data on the west coast of Mumbai, India. The predetermined coastal water samples were collected using the global positioning system (GPS) and were measured concurrently with satellite imagery acquisition. To study the influence of wastewater, the linear correlations were established between water quality parameters and reflectance of visible bands for either set of imagery for the study area, which was divided into three zones: creek water, shore-line water and coastal water. Turbidity and phosphate have the correlation coefficients in the range 0.75-0.94 and 0.78-0.98, respectively, for the study area. Negative correlation was observed for creek water owing to high organic content caused by the discharges of domestic wastewater from treatment facilities and non-point sources. Based on the least square method, equations are formulated to estimate turbidity and phosphate, to map the spatial variation on the GIS platform from simulated points.

Most database systems used in GIS are relational in nature, capturing change by exhaustively storing all versions of data, or updates replace previous versions. This stems from the inherent difficulty of modelling geographic objects and associated data in relational tables, and this is compounded when the necessary time dimension is introduced to represent how these objects evolve. This article describes an object-oriented (OO) spatio-temporal conceptual data model called the Feature Evolution Model (FEM), which can be used for the development of a spatio-temporal database management system (STDBMS). Object versioning techniques developed in the fields of Computer Aided Design (CAD) and engineering design are utilized in the design. The model is defined using the Unified Modelling Language (UML), and exploits the expressiveness of OO technology by representing both geographic entities and events as objects. Further, the model overcomes the limitations inherent in relational approaches in representing aggregation of objects to form more complex, compound objects. A management object called the evolved feature maintains a temporally ordered list of references to features thus representing their evolution.

We implemented the random forest model within a spatial framework to determine which pine forests in Mpumalanga are highly susceptible to S. noctilio infestations. Results indicate that a majority (63%) of pine forest plantations located in Mpumalanga have a high susceptibility (>70%) to S. noctilio infestation. A KHAT value of 0.84 and F measures above 0.87 indicate that the random forest model is a robust classifier that produces accurate results. Additionally, the use of the backward variable selection method enabled us to simplify the random forest modeling process and identify the minimum number of explanatory variables that offer the best discriminatory power and help in the empirical interpretation of the final random forest model.

An alternative method applies interpolation techniques to the locations of vertices composing polygons are interpolated between observations and metrics are computed from the interpolated polygon shapes. We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation of both techniques using simulated polygons composed of varying numbers of vertices, which were allowed to move randomly over varying numbers of discrete time periods. We observed differences in the success of the two methods when applied to three metrics: Area, Perimeter, and Area/Perimeter Ratio.

Although many methods are available to model land transition potentials, they are usually not user-friendly and require the specification of many parameters, making the task difficult for decision makers not familiar with the tools, as well as making the process difficult to interpret. In this article we propose a simple method for modeling transition potentials. SimWeight is an instance-based learning algorithm based on the logic of the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The method identifies the relevance of each driver variable and predicts the transition potential of locations given known instances of change. A case study was used to demonstrate and validate the method. Comparison of results with the Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network (MLP) suggests that SimWeight performs similarly in its capacity to predict transition potentials, without the need for complex parameters. Another advantage of SimWeight is that it is amenable to parallelization for deployment on a cloud computing platform. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"algorithm; artificial neural network; computer simulation; deforestation; GIS; land use change; learning; nearest neighbor analysis; numerical model; performance assessment",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649514497

This research presents a modular framework for assessing predictive accuracy of business-as-usual deforestation in the future by comparing two existing approaches: GEOMOD Modeling (GM) and Land Change Modeler (LCM). The comparison uses data from a case study in Chiquitanía, Bolivia. Data from 1986 and 1994 are used to simulate land-cover of 2000; the resulting maps are compared with an observed land-cover map of 2000. GM and LCM simulate business-as-usual deforestations at the pixel level. The model structures of GM's linear extrapolation and LCM's Markov Chain are compared to review quantity of LUCC; and the model structures of GM's empirical frequency, LCM's logistic regression, and LCM's multilayer perceptron are compared to review (spatial) allocation of LUCC. Relative operating characteristics, figure of merit, and multiple resolution analysis are employed to assess predictive accuracy of multiple transition modeling. By design, GM lacks the potential to model multiple transitions, and the LCM's multilayer perceptron may produce different results for each simulation due to its stochastic element. Based on the model structure and predictive accuracy comparisons, the LCM seems more suitable than the GM for a REDD application. When a project is to employ a predictive method for its spatially explicit baseline setting, then it is highly recommended to use the proposed framework to assess accuracy of the baseline as part of a project design document. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"accuracy assessment; assessment method; computer simulation; deforestation; emission control; forest cover; GIS; land cover; land use change; logistics; numerical model; regression analysis; stochasticity; Bolivia; Chiquitania Forest; Santa Cruz [Bolivia]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649507106

It allows the initial dataset to be enriched with explicit geographic structures that were implicit in the initial data. It helps both to make the geographical context explicit and to preserve characteristic structures. Then this enrichment is used as knowledge input for the following step: that is, the selection of roads in rural areas using graph theory techniques. After that, urban roads are selected by means of a block aggregation complex algorithm. Continuity between urban and rural areas is guaranteed by modelling continuity using strokes.

Few studies on vaccination strategies have explicitly considered the mobility of individuals. This article aims to evaluate the efficacy of three vaccination strategies in a dynamic social network, in which individuals are mobile between and within communities. The three vaccination strategies are applied to this social network for evaluation, including a travel-based, a contact-based, and a random vaccination strategy. Simulation results show that the contact-based strategy, commonly seen in previous studies, is not always the most effective strategy in dynamic networks. This strategy is preferable for a population with a large number of intercommunity travelers, for instance in urban areas. On the other hand, the travel-based strategy, although directly accounting for individual mobility, is not necessarily the most effective in dynamic networks either. This strategy is recommended for a population with a small number of intercommunity travelers, such as rural areas. In addition, one advantage of the travel-based strategy over the other two is its efficacy in confining the spatial extent of affected areas. Results suggest that the intercommunity travel of individuals should be a major consideration for choosing proper vaccination strategies. By adding the spatial context into vaccination strategies, this research provides new insights into community-based planning for infectious disease control. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"computer simulation; disease control; infectious disease; local participation; social network; vaccination",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958581393

Input data can come from a variety of sources and may be categorized according to their reliability and/or quality. The output from the 3D model is a prediction of subsurface conditions based on these data and the reliability of the output model is highly dependent on both the quality of input data and the types of interpolation methods used. This article presents a new quality weighting methodology that allows the user to assign a differential weighting factor to data points of variable quality in the modeling process. Input data are categorized into high and low quality datasets which are then recombined using a grid math process in which a differential ""weighting"" factor is applied.

This article concerns the accuracy of SRTM in low-relief areas with heterogeneous vegetation cover. Three questions were addressed about low-relief SRTM topographic representation: to what extent are errors spatially autocorrelated, and how should this influence sample design? Is spatial resolution or production method more important for explaining elevation differences? How dominant is the association of vegetation cover with SRTM elevation error? Two low-relief sites in Louisiana, USA, were analyzed to determine the nature and impact of SRTM error in such areas. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data were employed as reference, and SRTM elevations were contrasted with the US National Elevation Dataset (NED). Spatial autocorrelation of errors persisted hundreds of meters spatially in low-relief topography; production method was more critical than spatial resolution, and elevation error due to vegetation canopy effects could actually dominate the SRTM representation of the landscape. Indeed, low-lying, forested, riparian areas may be represented as substantially higher than surrounding agricultural areas, leading to an inverted terrain model. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"accuracy assessment; autocorrelation; data set; digital elevation model; digital terrain model; error analysis; land cover; lidar; Shuttle Radar Topography Mission; spatial analysis; spatial resolution; Louisiana; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958575127

Image mining identifies and models objects from a series of remote sensing images and communicates this information to stakeholders. Stereology is the science of deriving properties of objects from lower dimensional features. This article first applies stereology to quantify properties of crisp objects on single images. Next it addresses the development of an object in space and time. Finally, it quantifies uncertainty of fuzzy objects. The article is illustrated with a case study from Cambodia, where flooding regularly occurs along the Mekong River. Nine Landsat images have been mined to assess the size of the flooding in space and time. Areal estimates obtained with stereology from single images show a high precision. Estimates of a space-time volume of the size of flooding in space and time include uncertainty estimates that could be ascribed to atmospheric distortion and limited resolution. Finally stereology is applied to estimate the effects on area estimates of fuzzified boundaries. All information can be transferred to stakeholders, e.g. to quantify the size of a disaster.

The standard tests to assess the positional accuracy use only the magnitude of the vector and omit the azimuth. This article suggests that the use of both values allows a much more complete analysis of the positional error. A set of tests is proposed that are relevant for this purpose and demonstrate that some important features are not identified by the common procedures. The test samples come from two datasets. The first is obtained from the comparison of 100 homologous points in two conventional maps, and the second one comes from the geometric calibration of a photogrammetric scanner. The results are analyzed and discussed, showing that important issues such as error anisotropy are detected only by means of the circular statistics tests and density maps of distribution. Therefore, tests that assess the goodness of fit for uniform distribution in azimuths, such as Rayleigh and Rao tests, give low probabilities (P = 0 and P > 0.01). Moreover, density maps working with both magnitude and angle can locate the outlier candidate and offer more information about the spatial distribution of error. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"accuracy assessment; azimuth; data set; error analysis; geostatistics; GIS; spatial data; vector",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958539044

A hybrid approach that takes into account different types of inputs and consequently evaluates the accuracy of each type of used data is presented. This work is intended to give a first response to the lack of a comprehensive and accurate procedure that uses LiDAR data in order to automatically derive precise morphological properties, such as volumes and surfaces (façades and roofs) of buildings. The method was tested on two case-study areas in the Geneva region with different characteristics, one in the old town along the Rhone River and the other on the CERN campus. A statistical analysis that compares the results of the computation with the 3D model of the built environment was used to validate the results, complemented by significance statistical tests. Outcomes showed that the proposed method to derive morphological properties can reach high levels of accuracy, thus enhancing the potential uses of LiDAR data for numerous applications, typically for the assessment of the urban environmental quality (UEQ) at the city and district scale, such as the estimation of the potential deployment of renewable energies in the built environment and the determination and monitoring of several urban indicators. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"alternative energy; building; environmental quality; GIS; lidar; morphometry; renewable resource; statistical analysis; three-dimensional modeling; urban area; Rhone River",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958528495

ILE can be considered to be a modern and extended implementation of the E/R data model. ILE also facilitates storage of things that are more faithful to the historical records, such as gazetteer entries of places with imprecisely known or unknown locations. This is difficult in Relational database systems but is a routine task using ILE because ILE is implemented using modern memory allocation techniques.

In our Geoinformatics curriculum, we emphasise two principles. The first addresses the systematics of purposeful spatial data production and uptake into computerised systems; the second addresses the methodical construction of these computerised systems, applying principles of model - driven architecture, formal specification and transformational design of SDI nodes. The term Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) usually denotes large, complex systems, but its principles can also be applied in simple and cost-effective ways. This approach we have called SDIlight and it is of particular interest to our students that come from developing countries. We work with and build a software stack consisting of free and open source components. To achieve interoperability, we emphasise the use of open standards from the Open Geospatial Consortium and others. In this paper, we explain how our students apply the SDIlight approach in the GeoinformaticsMaster degree course. An important part of that course is a Case Study Application Building &amp; Programming, in which students apply their knowledge in a 'real-world' project, with a focus on geo-information engineering skills. We conclude with a section that evaluates the effectiveness of using the SDIlight concept in teaching our Geoinformatics Master, and on the more general applicability of the methodology. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"capacity building; curriculum; developing world; spatial data; student; teaching; university sector; Netherlands; Overijssel; Twente",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954365822

Little scientific evidence exists for formalizing this selection process or comparing one strategy to another, leading to the approach used in existing systems which we term the hierarchy-based criterion: place the available reference data layers into qualitative, static, and in many cases, arbitrary hierarchies and attempt a match in each layer, in order. The first non-ambiguous match with suitable confidence is selected and returned as output. This approach assumes global relationships of relative accuracy between reference data layers, ignoring local variations that could be exploited to return more precise geocodes. We propose a formalization of the selection criteria and present three alternative strategies which we term the uncertainty-, gravitationally-, and topologically-based strategies. The performance of each method is evaluated against two ground truth datasets of nationwide GPS points to determine any resulting spatial improvements. We find that any of the three new methods improves on current practice in the majority of cases.

In addition, multi-scale analyses involve both spatial and temporal integration of datasets deriving from different sources. The currently worldwide used system of latitude and longitude coordinates could avoid limitations in data use due to biases and approximations. In this article a fast and reliable algorithm implemented in Arc Macro Language (AML) is presented to provide an automatic computation of the surface area of the cells in a regularly spaced longitude-latitude (geographic) grid at different resolutions. The approach is based on the well-known approximation of the spheroidal Earth's surface to the authalic (i.e. equal-area) sphere. After verifying the algorithm's strength by comparison with a numerical solution for the reference spheroidal model, specific case studies are introduced to evaluate the differences when switching from geographic to projected coordinate systems. This is done at different resolutions and using different formulations to calculate cell areas.

Scenarios are used as a method for dealing with uncertainties in change and to provide plausible descriptions of our future world. A number of projects have utilised scenarios and a modelling-based approach to quantitatively investigate land use change at the national/regional-scale using a GIS. However, the coarse-scale of such land use data can render outputs inapplicable within local, often environmentally sensitive, landscapes. Improving data resolution allows us to investigate alternative potential futures at greater detail thereby providing vital input into policy and future decision-making. It may also facilitate localised studies of habitat fragmentation connectivity and visualisation. This paper utilises scenarios and regional-scale land use change data to facilitate a GIS-based model of land use change within a sensitive wetland environment. Land use change data from the RegIS project is localised to the study area in Broadland, UK. Areal totals, from the land use change data, are replicated within 0.01% of areal totals prescribed, enabling very spatially detailed land use maps to be developed.

A daily synoptic typing scheme, the Lamb Weather Catalogue, was applied to identify rainfall under three different weather types: south-westerly (SW), westerly (W) and cyclonic (C). Topographic descriptors developed using GIS were used to classify rain gauges into six geographic sub-regions: coastal, windward-lowland, windward-upland, leeward-upland, leeward-lowland, secondary upland. Examining temporal rainfall trends associated with different weather types, in different geographic sub-regions, reveals useful information on changes in rainfall processes. The total rainfall under SW and W weather types is increasing, particularly in upland regions. The increase in SW rainfall is driven by more frequent wet-days, whereas the increase in W rainfall is driven by increases in both wet-day frequency and yield per wet-day. The rainfall under C weather types is decreasing. Combining GIS and synoptic climatology gives insights into rainfall processes under a changing climate. The conditional analysis method can be applied at both local and regional scales, and its success is largely due to the ability of GIS to integrate, visualise, and efficiently model spatial data. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"GIS; rainfall; spatial variation; synoptic meteorology; temporal variation; upland region; weather forecasting; Cumbria; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955033535

Although there have been a variety of geographic applications of the set-covering problem (SCP), the use of the SCP as a facility location model is one of the most common. In the early applications of the LSCP, both potential facility sites as well as demand were represented by points discretely located in geographic space. The advent of geographic information systems (GIS), however, has made possible a greater range of object representations that can reduce representation error. The purpose of this article is to outline a methodology using GIS and K = 3 central place lattices to solve the LSCP when demand is continuously distributed over a bounded area and potential facility sites have not been defined a priori. Although, demand is assumed to exist over an area, it is shown how area coverage can be accomplished by the coverage of a point pattern. Potential facility site distributions based on spacings that are powers of one-third the coverage distance are also shown to provide more efficient coverage than arbitrarily chosen spacings. Using GIS to make interactive adjustments to an incomplete coverage also provides an efficient alternative to smaller spacings between potential facility sites for reducing the number of facilities necessary for complete coverage. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"facility location; GIS; location-allocation model; modeling; spacing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955021813

We introduce the Space package, an open source SWI-Prolog extension that provides spatial indexing capabilities. Together with the existing semantic web reasoning capabilities of SWI-Prolog, this allows efficient integration of spatial and semantic queries and provides an infrastructure for declarative programming with space and semantics. There are few systems that provide indexing and reasoning facilities for both spatial and semantic data. A common solution is to combine separate semantic reasoning and geospatial services. Such loose coupling has the disadvantage that each service cannot make use of the statistics of the other. This makes optimization of such a service-oriented architecture hard. The SWI-Prolog Space and Semantic web packages provide a native Prolog interface to both spatial and semantic indexing and reasoning, which makes it easy to write combined query optimizers. Another advantage of the Space package is that it allows declarative logic programming, which means in practice that you say what you want to compute instead of how to compute it. The actual indexing machinery is encapsulated inside Prolog predicates. In this article we describe the interface of the Space package, compare its functionality to alternative software libraries, and show how to work with it using three example applications.

In this article, an implementation of the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), augmented by DL-safe SWRL rules, is used to represent spatio-thematic knowledge. This involves partially ordered partitions, which are implemented by nominals and functional roles. Accordingly, a spatial division into administrative regions, rather than, for instance, a metric system, is used as a frame of reference for evaluating closeness. Hence, closeness is evaluated purely according to qualitative criteria. Colloquial descriptions typically involve qualitative concepts. The approach presented here is thus expected to align better with the way human beings deal with closeness than does a quantitative approach.

As an example, the article follows the development of a data model for the spatial concept of flow. Flow, the collective movements of people, materials, or ideas, is a common driver of geographic change, not generally supported by functionality within contemporary GIS, and an abstract dynamic entity that would presumably be difficult to model. Model design was facilitated through the distillation of flow cases of tabular human migration data, Minard's map of Napoleon's march on Moscow, and stream channel routes in a karst watershed. Unified Modeling Language diagrams are created for each case and the models' commonalities combined to yield a generic data model. As a means of validation, each use case was instantiated with the generic model and tested to re-create the fundamental components of flow and address predefined typical queries. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"data processing; design; GIS; numerical model; polygon",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-74949122166

This study explores the use of characteristic hull polygons (CHPs) as a new method of home range estimation. CHPs are special bounding polygons created in GIS that can have concave edges, be composed of disjoint regions, and contain areas of unoccupied space within their interiors. CHPs are created by constructing the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points and then removing a subset of the resulting triangles. Here, CHPs consisting of 95% of the smallest triangles, measured in terms of perimeter, are applied for home range estimation. First, CHPs are applied to simulated animal locational data conforming to five point pattern shapes at three sample sizes. Then, the method is applied to black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes) locational data for illustration and comparison to other methods. For the simulated data, 95% CHPs produced unbiased home range estimates in terms of size for linear and disjoint point patterns and slight underestimates (8-20%) for perforated, concave, and convex ones. The estimated and known home ranges intersected one another by 72-96%, depending on shape and sample size, suggesting that the method has potential as a home range estimator. Additionally, the CHPs applied to estimate albatross home ranges illustrate how the method produces reasonable estimates for bird species that intensively forage in disjoint habitat patches. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"estimation method; GIS; habitat creation; home range; polygon; triangulation; Animalia; Aves; Phoebastria nigripes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-72649104962

An alternative and holistic user experience (UX) concept that encompasses functional (e.g. usability, ergonomics, etc.) and non-functional (e.g. aesthetics, emotions, pleasure, cognitive stimulation, etc.) dimensions was adopted to evaluate an innovative Experiential GIS (EGIS). The EGIS is an immersive geospatial system that disengages the user from the real-world and renders the user present in 3D geovirtual scenes with real-time sensorimotor feedback. This system was assessed in a soil mapping application involving four collaborating soil scientists. The scientists had very positive reactions, common viewpoints and occasionally varying perceptions of EGIS and the geovirtual soil mapping technique. They viewed the system as intuitive, enjoyable and capable of improving the speed and quality of soil mapping, and identified the system's strengths as including co-experiential knowledge construction and a 'go anywhere' capability that enabled access to physically inaccessible and trespass prohibited areas.

These glaciers are featured with a wealth of different historical (e.g. paintings, photographs and historical maps) and recent data sources (airborne laser scan based digital terrain model and digital orthophotos) that allow the reconstruction of the Little Ice Age maximum extension. These sources are among the best historical and recent documents of glaciers for the mid-nineteenth century. The results of this reconstruction visualize the ongoing climate change in a comprehensive way. The area changes between the time of the Little Ice Age maximum extent (around the year 1850) and the recent glaciation in 2006 amounts to a loss of 182.4 km2 or almost 66%.

The advantage of employing daytime population distributions for vehicle route planning is then illustrated taking dangerous goods delivery and mobile billboard advertising as examples.

Until now, several semantic similarity models have been proposed; however, few of these models address the issues related to the assessment of semantic similarity in ad hoc networks. Also, several models are based on a definition of concepts where features are independent, an assumption that reduces the richness of the geospatial concept representation. This article presents the conceptual basis for Sim-Net, a novel semantic similarity model for ad hoc networks based on Description Logics (DL). Sim-Net is based on the multi-view paradigm. This paradigm is used to include inferential knowledge in semantic similarity, that is, the knowledge about implicit dependencies between features of concepts. In Sim-Net, assessing semantic similarity relies on the notions of Semantic Reference Systems and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), which are combined to establish a common semantic reference frame for ontologies of the ad hoc network called the view lattice. The Sim-Net semantic similarity measure distinguishes concepts that belong to different or similar domains and takes into account the neighbours of a concept in the network. An application example is used to show the positive impact of the properties of Sim-Net. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"database; GIS; modeling; spatial data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-72549104091

In particular, geographic information retrieval and location-based services such as GoogleEarth and MapQuest depend on spatial operations in conjunction with gazetteers to georeference geographic features. However, many gazetteers contain only point locations or simple bounding rectangles, which make for erratic and sometimes poor georeferencing. Convex hulls can provide better georeferencing results at modest computational cost, but their shape fidelity is still erratic. Full GIS capabilities are actually overfit for many geospatial and georeferencing purposes, because of the limited accuracy of the underlying data. The financial and technical demands of GIS also exclude it from many markets. Described here is a new technique, multihulls, based on the iterative refinement of convex hulls. Multihulls achieve arbitrary shape fidelity at a small increment in computational cost, consistent with the data, outside a GIS, making them attractive for many geospatial and georeferencing applications, especially gazetteers. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"data processing; GIS; methodology; spatial data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-72549098991

Jackson, School of Geosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States","The National Elevation, Hydrography and Land Cover datasets of the United States have been synthesized into a geospatial dataset called NHDPlus which is referenced to a spheroidal Earth, provides geospatial data layers for topography on 30m rasters, and has vector coverages for catchments and river reaches. In this article, we examine the integration of NHDPlus with the Noah-distributed model. In order to retain compatibility with atmospheric models, Noah-distributed utilizes surface domain fields referenced to a spherical rather than spheroidal Earth in its computation of vertical land surface/atmosphere water and energy budgets (at coarse resolution) as well as horizontal cell-to-cell water routing across the land surface and through the shallow subsurface (at fine resolution). Two data-centric issues affecting the linkage between Noah-distributed and NHDPlus are examined: (1) the shape of the Earth; and (2) the linking of gridded landscape with a vector representation of the stream and river network. At mid-latitudes the errors due to projections between spherical and spheroidal representations of the Earth are significant. A catchment-based ""pour point""technique is developed to link the raster and vector data to provide lateral inflow from the landscape to a one-dimensional river model. We conclude that, when Noah-distributed is run uncoupled to an atmospheric model, it is advantageous to implement Noah-distributed at the native spatial scale of the digital elevation data and the spheroidal Earth of the NHDPlus dataset rather than transforming the NHDPlus dataset to fit the coarser resolution and spherical Earth shape of the Noah-distributed model.

Developing decision making tools for assisting natural resource allocation is a challenging endeavor as stakeholders' objectives typically exist at varying spatial scales, their actions are defined by the spatial constraints in which they operate, and the spatial distribution of resources can be altered due to system disturbances. The nature of such challenges suggests the need for a geographic approach that can investigate these spatial complexities in order to generate a suitable set of solutions. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate an Intelligent Agent Model for multiobjective natural resource allocation. The model integrates agent-based modeling in a GIS environment with reinforcement learning - a heuristic method for generating, evaluating, and improving multiobjective decision making solutions. The model is implemented by simulating a forest management scenario in which agents that represent forest companies learn how to harvest trees in a manner that maximizes economic return while minimizing the adverse ecological impact to the surrounding landscape. In addition, the model simulates forest disturbances of varying frequencies and intensities to determine how disturbance events affect the decision-making ability of agents. The model is validated to demonstrate that it can provide practical solutions to natural resource decision making. © Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"artificial intelligence; ecological impact; forest management; GIS; heuristics; model validation; multiobjective programming; natural resource; numerical model; resource allocation; spatial distribution",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649697707

We investigated the utility of evidential belief functions (EBFs) and Dempster's rule of combination to represent classification uncertainty and integrate the PGIS-based grazing intensity maps. These maps were used as individual sets of evidence in the application of EBFs to evaluate the proposition that ""This area or pixel belongs to the high, medium, or low grazing intensity class because the local expert(s) says (say) so"". The class-area-weighted averages of EBFs based on each of the PGIS-based maps show that the lowest degree of classification uncertainty is associated with maps in which ""vegetation species"" was used as the mapping criterion. This criterion, together with local landscape attributes of livestock use may be considered as an appropriate standard measure for grazing intensity. The maps of integrated EBFs of grazing intensity show that classification uncertainty is high when the local experts apply at least two mapping criteria together.

HPABM allows for the utilization of high-performance and parallel computing resources to address computational challenges in agent-based models. Within HPABM, an agent-based model is decomposed into a set of sub-models that function as computational units for parallel computing. Each sub-model is comprised of a sub-set of agents and their spatially-explicit environments. Sub-models are aggregated into a group of super-models that represent computing tasks. HPABM based on the design of super- and sub-models leads to the loose coupling of agent-based models and underlying parallel computing architectures.

As journey-time exposure accounts for a disproportionately high amount of an individual's total exposure, this article assesses the potential to apply least-cost techniques within a GIS in order to identify paths of lower journey-time exposure. The methodology adopted uses pollution surfaces for PM 10 and CO generated by the dispersion model ADMS, with an analysis mask derived from OS MasterMap to create a least-cost surface. Actual routes taken by a cohort of 11-13 year old children on their journeys to school are used to compare observed journey time exposure with the exposure along alternative routes generated using the least-cost path function. While the least-cost approach proved to be successful in defining low exposure routes the ability to scale up this approach is constrained by the amount of editing required to successfully create an analysis mask from OS MasterMap data. Such alternative routes have the potential to assist in promoting safer environmental choices, however, their likelihood of adoption is dependant on a number of social and environmental influences which affect an individual's route choice. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Air pollution; Journey-time exposure; MasterMap; Space-time","atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; cohort analysis; GIS; journey to work; numerical model; particulate matter; path analysis; pollution exposure",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-65449187444

Both ab initio and retro-fit WSUD implementation for such terrain refers, in the first instance, to a drainage network model that includes information on the scope for optimising residential space while conforming to: (1) statutory planning rules about the provision of public open space; and (2) WSUD drainage network design such that runoff waters are retained long enough to allow at least temporary storage. It is shown in this research that a technique applied to condition a LiDAR DEM can accurately model the drainage network of a basin at the land-parcel scale. The drainage network for ab initio WSUD is best defined using multi-flow modelling, with the relative significance of stream segments indicated by their stream order derived using the Strahler method. In contrast, when applying the retro-fit WSUD, the relative significance of segments given by the Shreve stream order method was found to be more useful. The approaches described in this article are designed to support the initial site planning stage and avoid the need for immediate and expensive detailed field survey. At the same time they can be deployed to show how much scope there is for WSUD retro-fit in established housing areas up-stream of an infill development area. Thus, basin-wide appraisal is facilitated and the need for earthmoving is minimised. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Drainage network modelling; Stream ordering; Water-sensitive urban design","digital elevation model; drainage network; numerical model; optimization; segmentation; urban design",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-65449136628

Unfortunately, GPS data is still plagued with errors that frequently produce inaccurate trajectories. Research in map matching algorithms focuses on how to efficiently match GPS tracking data to the underlying road network. This article presents an innovative map matching algorithm that considers the trajectory of the data rather than merely the current position as in the typical map matching case. Instead of computing the precise angle which is traditionally used, a discrete eight-direction chain code, to represent a trend of movement, is used. Coupled with distance information, map matching decisions are made by comparing the differences between trajectories representing the road segments and GPS tracking data chain-codes. Moreover, to contrast the performance of the chain-code algorithm, two evaluation strategies, linear and non-linear, are analyzed. The presented chain-code map matching algorithm was evaluated for wheelchair navigation using university campus sidewalk data. The evaluation results indicate that the algorithm is efficient in terms of accuracy and computational time. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Chain code; Map matching; RBF neural network; Wheelchair navigation","accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial neural network; GPS; linearity; navigation; nonlinearity; tracking",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-65449135472

These lakes and wetlands are vulnerable to climate change, especially in our study area in South Dakota, in which a period of deluge following a sharp drought considerably expanded the areal extent of prairie pothole lakes during the last decade of the twentieth century. Preliminary estimates of lake areas, determined using LANDSAT 5 and 7 images, had appreciable errors especially for the smallest of these lakes. This article describes a new sub-pixel approach integrated with a CART (Classification and Regression Tree) model using a GIS (Geographical Information System) to quantify mixed water pixels along lake boundaries to improve area estimations for pothole lakes. Errors in estimated area were typically 10% or less for lakes greater than 1.ha in size. An analysis of lakes in our study area demonstrates how lake area changed with the transition from drought to deluge. Small lakes exhibited a distinct seasonal variation in contrast to large lakes that tended to follow precipitation trends more broadly. The total water area of lakes is consistent with broad variation in rainfall. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","CART; GIS; LANDSAT; Prairie Pothole; Sub-pixel","climate change; error analysis; estimation method; GIS; image analysis; image classification; Landsat; mapping; numerical model; pixel; regression analysis; North America; Prairie Pothole Region",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-65449129525

Models should have a measure of accuracy; however, the accuracy of population distribution models is difficult to determine due to the inclusion of multiple input datasets and the lack of quantifiable, observable (validated) data to confirm model output. Validated data enables quantification of: (1) overall model accuracy and (2) changes in model output at different levels of quality control. This article examines the effect of quality control for two national school datasets incorporated as input in LandScan USA for Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania; which had a local, validated school dataset available. The effect of each stage of quality control efforts utilized throughout the LandScan USA process were assessed to determine what level of quality control was required to have a statistically significant change of the model's population distribution. The typical level of quality control for LandScan USA resulted in 36% of schools being moved to the correct location and 20% of missing student enrollments were found, compared to 87% and 98% respectively for the validated dataset. The costs of increasing quality control resulted in a six-fold increase in labor time; however, the additional quality control did not produce statistically significant improvements in the LandScan USA model. Thus, typical quality control efforts for schools in LandScan USA produced a population distribution similar to the validated level of quality control, and can be applied with confidence for policy, planning, and emergency situations. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Data integrity; LandScan USA; Population distribution model; Quality control","accuracy assessment; data set; error analysis; GIS; model validation; numerical model; population distribution; quality control; North America; Pennsylvania; Philadelphia County; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-65449127333

Two major consequences of parental choice are longer commutes to schools and increased use of motor vehicle transport. To delineate school attendance areas for public female junior high schools in the city of Rasht in Northern Iran, this research used the multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram (MWVD) technique to construct school attendance areas. The approach was shown to be useful in developing countries like Iran where accident fatalities are not only disproportionately high but the public school system lacks sufficient educational diversity to offset the societal costs of opting out of neighbourhood schools. A GIS-based specialist package was used for constructing the proposed school attendance areas. Given the MWVD utility in demarcating spaces so that all journeys within them are closest to a chosen point, the research concluded that proposed school attendance areas can result in shorter and more convenient commutes on foot for students. This can eliminate the need to travel by vehicle for the overwhelming majority of students and thus make their journeys more convenient and safer. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Commute time and distance; Education administration; GIS; School attendance areas","developing world; education policy; GIS; neighborhood; planning process; transportation system; Asia; Eurasia; Gilan; Iran; Middle East; Rasht",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-63149153912

Until now, geotechnical information was mainly described and exchanged as relational data, which occasionally included spatial characteristics. Hereafter, the spatial features of geotechnical data are investigated by invoking the geotechnical data model of the Association of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Specialists (AGS), which is widely used in the United Kingdom to exchange geotechnical data in engineering practice. The basic geometric objects in AGS geotechnical data are first identified. These geometric objects are mapped to basic geometric features of the Geography Markup Language (GML). AGS data can therefore be fully rendered using GML-conformant schemas, which make geotechnical data readily importable into GML-aware applications. The data can be also imported to mainstream GIS applications using Extensible Markup Language (XML) transformations.

The proposed strategy is based on discriminant space, which is defined with essential properties or driving processes underlying spatial class occurrences, leading to discriminant models of uncertainty in area classes. This strategy reinforces consistency in categorical mapping by imposing class-specific mean structures that can be regressed against discriminant variables, and facilitates scale-dependent error modeling that can effectively emulate the variation found between observers in terms of classes, boundary positions, numbers of polygons, and boundary network topology. Based on simulated data, comparisons with stochastic simulation based on indicator kriging confirmed the replicability of the discriminant models, which work by determining the mean area classes based on discriminant variables and projecting spatially correlated residuals in discriminant space to uncertainty in area classes. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Area classes; Discriminant space; Replicability; Stochastic simulation; Uncertainty","discriminant analysis; kriging; mapping; model; simulation; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-63149126804

Rather than storing global data quality statements, the system enables data quality information to be referenced to a spatial framework, individual spatial objects, or even parts of spatial objects. The integrated model, called as RDBMS for Spatial Variation in Quality (RSVQ), allows flexible storage of spatially varying data quality information, and seamless querying irrespective of the underlying storage model. RSVQ is founded on a formal model of relational databases, defining a new derived, polymorphic query operator ◁ to join quality data with spatial data. The ◁ operator is implemented in an extension to SQL as a new WITHQUALITY keyword. A performance evaluation of RSVQ was conducted, using an Oracle Spatial database and a case study of cadastral data for parts of Victoria, Australia.

To validate the method, SRTM-3, a global DEM dataset with a resolution of approximately 90 m, was used for analysis of the Loess Plateau, China. Channel networks delineated with and without slope-weighted flow accumulation were derived in both uplands and hilly lands for comparison. In the weighted flow accumulation method, the thresholds for delineating the channels were defined by detecting a turning point in the frequency distribution of the weighted flow accumulation function or by visual similarity with drainage channels extracted from topographic maps. The channel networks delineated with weighting showed closer correlation with a topographic map than the channel networks without weighting, despite the differences in thresholds. Moreover, the channel networks delineated with weighting represented the differences between landform types, while the channel networks without weighting did not. Weighting on the basis of the slope angle shows promise as a general channel delineation method which reflects the actual topography due to its hydrogeomorphological functions. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Channel network; DEM; Hydro geomorphology; Slope angle; Thres hold","data set; digital elevation model; geomorphology; landform; topographic mapping; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-63149085650

The platform supports a variety of specific similarity methods, to which researchers can add others of their own. It also provides flexible ways to combine the results from multiple methods, and some graphic tools for visualizing and communicating multi-part similarity scores. Details of the system, which forms part of the ConceptVista open codebase, are described, along with associated details of the interfaces by which users can add new methods, choose which methods are used and select how multiple similarity scores are aggregated. We offer this as a community resource, since many similarity methods have been proposed but there is still much confusion about which one(s) might work well for different geographical problems; hence a test environment that all can access and extend would seem to be of practical use.

The comparison of the user objectives and web services is a two stage process. Firstly, the content is compared by classifying the semantic primitives from the candidate web service and user objective on the basis of whether the primitives are common or similar. On the basis of these classifications, the percentage match and semantic relationship (subset, superset, overlaps, disjoint, identical) are determined. Secondly, the order of the semantic primitives is compared and the edit distance determined as a measure of semantic similarity. The method is tested using two examples: a comparison of spatial relations and a comparison of a user objective and three geospatial web services.

The research is premised on the idea that large scale features are defined by the smaller features that comprise them (that mountain ranges are a collection of clustered yet individually identifiable mountains or hills). In preference to subjective selection of the higher order features, we propose a methodology for automatically discerning mountain ranges as well as the smaller hills that constitute them. A mountainous region can be defined by its prominence (relative height among surrounding features) and various morphological characteristics including the variability in morphology. The algorithm presented here uses derivatives of elevation and the density of morphological properties in order to automatically identify individual hills or mountains and ranges together with their extents. Being able to create generalised views of landscape morphology is considered to be part of the model generalisation process and is an essential prerequisite to spatial query and to the cartographic portrayal of these features at a range of scales (levels of detail). For the purposes of evaluation the algorithm was applied to the hills around Edinburgh city and the hills and ranges around Fort William, Scotland. The research reflects on the challenge of defining the subjective nature of what is a 'hill' or a 'mountain', but reminds us that a map seeks to capture the essence and characteristic form of the landscape - something that is necessarily fuzzy and scale dependent. © 2008 The Author.

Satellite sensors provide comprehensive geospatial information on air quality with both qualitative remotely sensed imagery and quantitative data, such as aerosol optical depth which is the basic unknown parameter for any atmospheric correction method in the pre-processing of satellite imagery. This article presents a new method for retrieving aerosol optical thickness directly from satellite remotely sensed imagery for short wavelength bands in which atmospheric scattering is the dominant contribution to the at-satellite recorded signal. The method is based on the determination of the aerosol optical thickness through the application of the contrast tool (maximum contrast value), the radiative transfer calculations and the 'tracking' of the suitable darkest pixel in the scene. The proposed method that needs no a-priori information has been applied to LANDSAT-5 TM, LANDSAT-7 ETM+, SPOT-5 and IKONOS data of two different geographical areas: West London and Cyprus. The retrieved aerosol optical thickness values show high correlations with in-situ visibility data acquired during the satellite overpass. Indeed, for the West London area a logarithmic regression was fitted for relating the determined aerosol optical thickness with the in-situ visibility values. A high correlation coefficient (r2 = 0.82; p = 0.2) was found. Plots obtained from Tanre et al. (1979, 1990) and Forster (1984) were reproduced and estimates for these areas were generated with the proposed method so as to compare the results. The author's results show good agreement with Forster's aerosol optical thickness vs. visibility results and a small deviation from Tanre's model estimates. © 2008 The Author.

These are often collected at points known as meteorological stations. In West Africa, meteorological stations are sparsely distributed and as a result, are often unable to satisfy the data requirements for such studies. One major problem arising from this is how to estimate values for locations where primary data is not available. General Circulation Models (GCMs) have recently been deployed for weather forecasting and climate change projections but the resolution of their outputs is low requiring downscaling. This article describes a GIS-based procedure for downscaling GCMs' outputs for use in studies assessing the impacts of climate variability on crop yield at the farm level. The procedure is implemented with the Hadley Centre's GCM (HadCM2) data, although any other GCM can be used. Results in this study show that the model works best when representing drier months as compared to wet months in all three domains tested. For example, it estimated the rainfall for January (the driest month) better than that of July which is the peak of the rainy season in West Africa. There is also a north-south pattern influencing the accuracy of estimated rainfall distribution, with stations in the south better represented than those in the north. For the greater part of West Africa where similar climatic conditions persist as in Nigeria, this procedure can be considered suitable for interpolation and downscaling. © 2008 The Author.

However, contextual examinations of government GIS practices over time within non-Western contexts remain sparse in the existing GIScience literature. In particular, little is known with respect to China's significant growth of using GIS in its urban government amidst its rapid urbanization and enormous transformation. This article presents an in-depth investigation of the case of Shenzhen city, one of the China's leading cities in urban government GIS development. Drawing upon critical GIS research and GIS implementation studies, a synthesized theoretical framework is developed to interrogate the nature and evolutionary process of Shenzhen's government GIS practices. The analysis is focused on examining the role of broader social conditions, local contextual factors and organizational characteristics in shaping GIS development in Shenzhen's urban governance. Situated in this contextual analysis, this article also illustrates the three major transformations of GIS development in Shenzhen's planning agency over the past decade. The findings show that GIS development in Chinese urban governance has been influenced not only by the instrumental functions of GIS, but also by the interactions and relationships among different actors and institutions with various vested interests in the process of structuring and governing the urban spaces.

The data used to derive the model was from a digitized grid-based algorithm, generated in an ArcInfo database, using QuickBird visible and near-infrared (NIR) data. The Feature Extraction (FX) Module in ENVI 4.4 ® was used to categorize individual pixels of field sampled aquatic habitats into separate spectral classes, convert remotely sensed raster layers to vector coverages, and classify output layers to vector format as ESRI shapefiles. These data were used to construct a geographic weights matrix for evaluation of field and remote sampled covariates of Anopheles arabiensis aquatic habitats, a major vector of malaria in East Africa. The principal finding is that synthetic map pattern variables, which are eigenvectors computed for a geographic weights matrix, furnish an alternative way of capturing spatial dependency effects in the mean response term of a regression model. The spatial autocorrelation components suggest the presence of roughly 11 to 28% redundant information in the aquatic habitat larval count samples. The presence of redundant information in the models suggest that the sampling configuration of the An. arabiensis aquatic habitats, in the study sites, may cause field and remote observations of aquatic habitats to be dependent, rather than independent, moving data analysis away from the classical statistical independence model. A Poisson regression model, with a non-constant, gamma-distributed mean, can decompose field and remote sampled An. arabiensis data into positive and negative spatial autocorrelation eigenvectors, which can assess the precision of a malaria mosquito aquatic habitat map and the significance of all factors associated with larval abundance and distribution in a riceland agroecosystem. © 2008 The Authors.

CM was originally conceived as part of a larger Participatory Geographic Information System for Transportation project (PGIST; http://www.pgist.org) aimed at developing and evaluating Internet-hosted capabilities to support participatory decision processes. CM is designed to be either a part of a larger information system such as PGIST or a standalone tool used for evaluation of decision variants. The decision support functions provided by CM aid in reducing the cognitive complexity of the decision space characterized by multiple decision options, evaluation criteria, and criterion weights. This is achieved by incorporating in CM the sensitivity analysis functions for the identification of criteria that do not influence the decision option ranking. Users can remove such criteria from further consideration and thus lessen the cognitive burden of evaluation, which may be essential in multi-stakeholder participatory decision processes. The additional capabilities of CM include a vote aggregation function to collate individual option rankings into a group ranking, and measures of agreement/disagreement to inform the participants about a group-derived desirability of specific decision options. The design of CM was implemented using Web-service architecture. In the article we describe the design of CM and discuss its advantages and limitations. © 2008 The Authors.

There is increasing interest in comparing present day vegetation with that of the Pre-Euroamerican era to understand what changes have occurred in some of our more outstanding natural areas. Studies have been conducted using Government Land Office (GLO) notes to understand historic vegetation surveys, but past studies focused on species present/absent lists. The GLO surveys included information about tree species, tree diameter and other physical features. This study used indicator kriging to interpolate the probability of tree species on the landscape using the GLO data from 62 townships. Once continuous probability models were developed, vegetation spatial patterns were analyzed throughout the sub-basin. This technique provided insight into what the vegetation pattern (spatially) was like prior to Euroamerican settlement within the Buffalo River sub-basin. It provided the base information necessary to quantify vegetation change and the spatial extent of that change. Based on this research it appears that post-Euroamerican fire suppression and agricultural practices with other human activities have been major contributors to change. Eastern Redcedar (Juniperious virginiana) and hickory (Carya sp.) have increased, while oak species (Quercus sp.) have decreased. Additionally 19% of the sub-basin has changed to non-forest. © 2008 The Authors.

Rooted in Hägerstrand's time geography, this study presents a generalized space-time path (GSTP) approach to facilitating visualization and exploration of spatiotemporal changes among individuals in a large dataset. The fundamental idea of this approach is to derive a small number of representative space-time paths (i.e. GSTPs) from the raw dataset by identifying spatial cluster centers of observed individuals at different time periods and connecting them according to their temporal sequence. A space-time GIS environment is developed to implement the GSTP concept. Different methods of handling temporal data aggregation and the creation of GSTPs are discussed in this article. Using a large individual-based migration history dataset, this study successfully develops an operational space-time GIS prototype in ESRI's ArcScene and ArcMap to provide a proof-of-concept study of this approach. This space-time GIS system demonstrates that the proposed GSTP approach can provide a useful exploratory analysis and geovisualization environment to help researchers effectively search for hidden patterns and trends in such datasets. © 2008 The Authors.

While we trust that these tools do their job for the special purpose they have been built, the GIScience user community is still a long way away from off-the-shelf ontology builders that can be used by GIS project managers. In this article, we present a comparative study of ontology building tools described in some twenty peer-reviewed GIScience journal articles. We analyze them from the perspective of two application domains, crime analysis and transportation/land use. For the latter, we developed a database schema, which is substantially different from the three main templates commonly used. The crime analysis application uses a rule base for an agent-based model that had no precursor. In both cases, the currently available set of tools cannot replace manual coding of ontologies for use with ESRI-based application software. Based on these experiences, we outline a requirements list of what the tools described in the first part of the article are missing to make them practical from an applications perspective.

Understanding and quantifying groundwater recharge and discharge is crucial for developing effective management options for water supply. Traditional recharge and discharge studies usually require time-consuming (months or years) and labor-intensive field characterization. Therefore, a fast initial recharge and discharge estimation will help scientists and decision makers design more accurate and cost-effective research plans and management strategies. A new GIS based methodology along with an ArcMap plug-in package, PRO-GRADE, was developed to help hydrogeologists estimate recharge and discharge in a more efficient way than conventional methods. The Groundwater Recharge And Discharge Estimator (GRADE-GIS) in the PRO-GRADE package uses a mass balance approach for steady state two-dimensional unconfined aquifers. GRADE-GIS only requires relatively short preparation time (hours) using readily available data for water table and bedrock elevations, and hydraulic conductivities. The Pattern Recognition Organizer (PRO-GIS) in the PRO-GRADE package uses multiple image processing algorithms to estimate and visualize shallow recharge and discharge patterns and rates with GIS. The output of PRO-GRADE can be used as an initial guideline for conventional field study planning and decision making, or an initial condition for numerical simulations. © 2008 The Authors.

The model is instantiated using basic empirical data and uses simple decision-making rules, differentiated into four classes, to simulate the process of residential dynamics. The model employs the consumption explanation of the cause of gentrification, which emphasizes the choices of individuals drawn to urban amenities, while testing the production explanation, which suggests that major investments from the public and private sphere attract and explain gentrification.

The allocation is constrained by facility capacities - different facilities may have different capacities and the overall capacity may be inadequate to satisfy the total demands. This research transforms this special location-allocation problem into a clustering model. The proposed approach has two parts: (1) the allocation of demands to facilities considering capacity constraints while minimizing the cost; and (2) the iterative optimization of facility locations using an adapted K-means clustering method. The quality of a location-allocation solution is measured using an objective function, which is the demand-weighted distance from demand locations to their assigned facilities. The clustering-based method is evaluated against an adapted Genetic Algorithm (GA) alternative, which integrates the allocation component as described above but uses GA operations to search for 'optimal' facility locations.

These phenomena can be expressed as locations having their positions configured by a road network, as address points with street numbers. Although these events are considered as points on a network, point pattern analysis and the techniques implemented in a GIS environment generally consider events as taking place in a uniform space, with distance expressed as Euclidean and over a homogeneous and isotropic space. Network-spatial analysis has developed as a research agenda where the attention is drawn towards point pattern analytical techniques applied to a space constrained by a road network. Little attention has been put on first order properties of a point pattern (i.e. density) in a network space, while mainly second order analysis such as nearest neighbour and K -functions have been implemented for network configurations of the geographical space. In this article, a method for examining clusters of human-related events on a network, called Network Density Estimation (NDE), is implemented using spatial statistical tools and GIS packages. The method is presented and compared to conventional first order spatial analytical techniques such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).

Field sampled data of An. gambiae s.l. aquatic habitats were used to determine which ecological covariates were associated with An. gambiae s.l. larval habitat development. A SAS/GIS® spatial database was used to calculate univariate statistics, correlations and perform Poisson regression analyses on the An. gambiae s.l. aquatic habitat datasets. Semivariograms and global autocorrelation statistics were generated in ArcGIS®. The spatially dependent models indicate the distribution of An. gambiae s.l. aquatic habitats exhibits weak positive autocorrelation in both study sites, with aquatic habitats of similar log-larval counts tending to cluster in space. Individual anopheline habitats were further evaluated in terms of their covariations with spatial autocorrelation by regressing them on candidate spatial filter eigenvectors. This involved the decomposition of Moran's I statistic into orthogonal and uncorrelated map pattern components using a negative binomial regression. The procedure generated synthetic map patterns of latent spatial correlation representing the geographic configuration of An. gambiae s.l. aquatic habitat locations in each study site. The Gaussian approximation spatial filter models accounted for approximately 13% to 32% redundant locational information in the ecological datasets. Spatial statistics generated in a SAS/GIS® module can capture spatial dependency effects on the mean response term of a Poisson regression analysis of field and remotely sampled An. gambiae s.l. aquatic habitat data. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"ARC-INFO; autocorrelation; database; decomposition analysis; eigenvalue; habitat type; image analysis; malaria; mosquito; Poisson ratio; regression analysis; spatial data; variogram; Africa; Coast Province; East Africa; Kenya; Kilifi; Kisumu; Malindi; Nyanza; Sub-Saharan Africa; Anopheles gambiae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-47149085264

Box 47, 6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","The assessment of positional uncertainty in line and area features is often based on uncertainty in the coordinates of their elementary vertices which are assumed to be connected by straight lines. Such an approach disregards uncertainty caused by sampling and approximation of a curvilinear feature by a sequence of straight line segments. In this article, a method is proposed that also allows for the latter type of uncertainty by modelling random rectangular deviations from the conventional straight line segments. Using the model on a dense network of sub-vertices, the contribution of uncertainty due to approximation is emphasised; the sampling effect can be assessed by applying it on a small set of randomly inserted sub-vertices. A case study demonstrates a feasible way of parameterisation based on assumptions of joint normal distributions for positional errors of the vertices and the rectangular deviations and a uniform distribution of missed sub-vertices along line segments. Depending on the magnitudes of the different sources of uncertainty, not accounting for potential deviations from straight line segments may drastically underestimate the positional uncertainty of line features. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Error model; Geostatistics; Stochastic simulation; Vector data","coordinate; error analysis; geometry; geostatistics; GIS; line transect; model; parameterization; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; vector",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049135193

This may be a result of the datasets having differing quality characteristics, being captured at different scales or perhaps being in different projections or datums. Data integration methods have been developed to bring such datasets into alignment. Although these methods attempt to maintain topological relationships within each dataset, spatial relationships between features in different datasets are generally not considered. The preservation of inter-dataset topology is a research area of considerable current interest. This research addresses the preservation of topology within a data integration process. It describes the functional models established to represent a number of spatial relationships as observation equations. These are used to provide additional information concerning the relative positions of features. Since many topological relationships are best modelled as inequalities, an algorithm is developed to accommodate such relationships. The method, based on least squares with inequalities (LSI), is tested on simulated and real datasets. Results are presented to illustrate the optimal positioning solutions determined using all of the available information. In addition, updated quality parameters are provided at the level of the individual coordinate, enabling communication of local variation in the resultant quality of the integrated datasets. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","GIS; Least squares with inequalities; Spatial data maintenance; Topology","algorithm; data management; data set; GIS; least squares method; spatial data; topology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049132191

According to the National Hurricane Center, Florida is the most vulnerable coastal state to hurricanes. Mitigation policies have been formulated to reduce mortality and provide emergency services by evacuating people from the hazard zone. Many of these evacuees, particularly the elderly or lower income populations, rely on evacuation shelters for temporary housing. Because of the cost and limited use, evacuation shelters are almost exclusively dual use shelters where the primary purpose of the facility is for some other public function (e.g. school, hospital, etc.). In 2000, the estimated shortage of public shelter spaces in Florida was about 1.5 million. The purpose of this study was to rank the existing and candidate shelters (schools, colleges, churches and community centers) available in the state based on their site suitability. The research questions examined in this study include: (1) How many candidate shelters are located in physically suitable areas (e.g. not in a flood prone area, not near hazardous facilities, etc.)?; (2) How many existing shelters are located in physically un suitable areas, but in socially suitable areas (situated in areas with demand)?; (3) How many alternative existing and/or candidate shelters with high/very high physical suitability are located near physically un suitable existing shelters and thus, may be better choices for a shelter?; and (4) How many existing shelters located in physically un suitable areas are not near alternative existing and/or candidate shelters? A Geographic Information System-based suitability model integrating Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) with a Pass/Fail screening technique was implemented for the 17 counties of Southern Florida. It was found that 48% of the existing shelters are located in physically unsuitable areas. Out of all the candidate shelters, 57% are located in physically unsuitable areas. For 15 of the existing shelters in unsuitable locations, no alternative candidate or existing shelter with medium to high physical suitability exists within 10 miles (16.1 km). © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Accuracy standards; Geocoding; Global Positioning Systems; LIDAR; NSSDA; Positional error; Root Mean Square Error; TIGER","accuracy assessment; disaster management; GIS; GPS; hazard assessment; hurricane event; lidar; mitigation; shelter; vulnerability; Florida [United States]; North America; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049121031

First, we developed a conceptual mapping language called ""UMLT""which is the core of our approach. Furthermore, we integrated UMLT into the Model-Driven Architecture where a conceptual model mapping is referred to as a platform independent model mapping. Finally, the data format transformation is deduced from the model mapping automatically. This represents the implementation mapping from a platform independent model to a platform specific model.

Furthermore, it would accommodate modeling extensions for predicting future conditions. Organized efforts towards realizing that vision have diminished significantly since 2001, but progress on key requisites has been made.

Existing spatial data accuracy standards, including the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) used in the United States, commonly assume the positional error of spatial data is normally distributed. This research has characterized the distribution of the positional error in four types of spatial data: GPS locations, street geocoding, TIGER roads, and LIDAR elevation data. The positional error in GPS locations can be approximated with a Rayleigh distribution, the positional error in street geocoding and TIGER roads can be approximated with a log-normal distribution, and the positional error in LIDAR elevation data can be approximated with a normal distribution of the original vertical error values after removal of a small number of outliers. For all four data types considered, however, these solutions are only approximations, and some evidence of non-stationary behavior resulting in lack of normality was observed in all four datasets. Monte-Carlo simulation of the robustness of accuracy statistics revealed that the conventional 100% Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) statistic is not reliable for non-normal distributions. Some degree of data trimming is recommended through the use of 90% and 95% RMSE statistics. Percentiles, however, are not very robust as single positional accuracy statistics. The non-normal distribution of positional errors in spatial data has implications for spatial data accuracy standards and error propagation modeling.

This article describes a comparative study of the performance and study habits of two groups of students in a course in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software programming and customization: one delivered online to adult professionals working asynchronously; the other delivered in a blended, online/face-to-face environment to upper-level undergraduates in residence. Course grades show that the undergraduate cohort underperformed in comparison to the online cohort, in spite of the fact that their version of the course included face-to-face lecture and lab time in addition to the online course materials. To explore differences in the study habits of the two groups, all students were asked to keep a diary of the time they devoted to coursework. Information from these diaries suggest that a student's ability to meet learning objectives is less dependent on the course content delivery mechanism than it is on the student's motivation, maturity and time management skills. © 2008 The Authors.

While a broad range of typologies of urban patterns have been published in the last century, relatively little research on the automated recognition of such structures exists. This work presents a sample-based approach for the recognition of five types of urban structures: (1) inner city areas, (2) industrial and commercial areas, (3) urban areas, (4) suburban areas and (5) rural areas. The classification approach is based only on the characterisation of building geometries with morphological measures derived from perceptual principles of Gestalt psychology. Thereby, size, shape and density of buildings are evaluated. After defining the research questions we develop the classification methodology and evaluate the approach with respect to several aspects. The experiments focus on the impact of different classification algorithms, correlations and contributions of measures, parameterisation of buffer-based indices, and mode filtering. In addition to that, we investigate the influence of scale and regional factors. The results show that the chosen approach is generally successful. It turns out that scale, algorithm parameterisation, and regional heterogeneity of building structures substantially influence the classification performance. © 2008 The Authors.

In GIScience, as in other fields, this situation demands that the researcher evaluate and to be very familiar with the scientific journals in which they could publish. Some specialized journals (e.g. Journal of Citation Reports or JCR) are devoted to ranking these reviews according to various methods and criteria. Compared to other scientific communities, GIScience is relatively new and constantly evolving. Therefore, the journals of this field do not benefit from any real formal ranking yet. The objective of this paper is to present the process and results of a study aimed at addressing this gap. More specifically, the challenge is to elaborate an importance ranking of the scientific journals in the field of GIScience. To do so, both a qualitative (Delphi study carried out with 40 international experts) and a quantitative (JCR impact factor) approach has been implemented.

First, the notions of information cube and hybrid 3D space-time paths are developed to accommodate cyberspatial activities in exploratory data analysis. Second, a new representation of 2D space-time paths that incorporates parallel coordinate plots is developed for exploring the multiple attributes of people's Internet and physical activities. These two methods were implemented using ArcObjects and the Visual Basic for Applications environment in ArcGIS.

However, land use change is influenced by multiple variables and their relationships. The objective of this study is to develop a novel CA model within a geographic information system (GIS) that consists of Bayesian Network (BN) and Influence Diagram (ID) sub-models. Further, the proposed model is intended to simplify the definition of parameter values, transition rules and model structure. Multiple GIS layers provide inputs and the CA defines the transition rules by running the two sub-models. In the BN sub-model, land use drivers are encoded with conditional probabilities extracted from historical data to represent inter-dependencies between the drivers. Using the ID sub-model, the decision of changing from one land use state to another is made based on utility theory. The model was applied to simulate future land use changes in the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD), Canada from 2001 to 2031. The results indicate that the model is able to detect spatio-temporal drivers and generate various scenarios of land use change making it a useful tool for exploring complex planning scenarios. © 2007 The Authors.

The landforms in question form the edges of terraces and benches and tend to be subtle and varied depending on where they appear in the landscape. Because of this variation combined with DEM error, conventional raster filtering methods were unable to readily identify the benches with any consistency. In an effort to automate the collection of benches, a two stage, sketch-based algorithm was designed to detect bench edges on a semi-automated basis and was integrated into a commercial GIS environment for testing and execution. The approach of tailoring an algorithm to detect a particular feature proved viable and, in fact, more consistent in many cases than heads-up digitizing. However, feature complexity appears to be a significant driver in the accuracy of the algorithmic approach with the unlikely finding that more complex features are more accurately identified than less complex features. This research demonstrates that user cognition, DEM resolution, algorithm functionality and landform characteristics are thus all important and interrelated factors requiring consideration when implementing approaches to topographic feature identification. © 2007 The Authors.

A method is proposed to quantify, in ecological cost-benefit terms, the negative impact of fragmentation by linear structures with special emphasis on summer ranges of semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus). The method is also applicable to other terrestrial species and on different scales. The term 'reachability' is introduced for this measurement, which integrates forage quality, quantity and availability, as well as the costs of the animal's movement in a variable landscape and across fragmenting linear structures. The method uses a cost-distance algorithm, commonly available in GIS software. Effective distances and reachability over large areas are calculated from evenly distributed sample points. Effects of varying sample point distance, fragmenting structure friction weight and density, and edge effect depth were analysed for model calibration. In an example the model was used for estimation of reachability alteration due to linear structures in the summer ranges of the Handö lsdalen reindeer herding district in Sweden, where hourly GPS positions of 10 free-ranging female reindeer were available. In these data the reindeer population density appeared to decrease up to 1 km away from roads, but no effect from hiking trails was detected. The reachability model quantified a loss of 2.2-2.7% in range quality due to range fragmentation. © 2007 The Author.

In order to minimise the harms and maximise the gains for local, state and national economies, in many jurisdictions the industry is heavily regulated. Regulators rely upon a wide range of information sources to assist in decision making and are often concerned with issues that have socio-spatial characteristics. Despite this, there have been few applications of geographical information systems (GIS) to gambling behaviour. This paper trials the use of a GIS-based approach to investigate one aspect of gambling regulation, namely the spatial characteristics of gaming venue catchments. The research was conducted in a suburban region of Canberra, Australia. The results from the study show that the catchment areas of gaming venues can vary considerably and are more complex than previous studies have suggested.

The combined forces of climate, topography and vegetation make Victoria in particular, one of the most fire prone regions on earth (DSE 2003). Throughout its history, Victoria has seen a number of devastating bushfires, including Black Friday 1939, Ash Wednesday 1983, and more recently in the northeast of the State in 2003. The loss of life combined with the damage caused to land and property results in a heavy cost to the community. In Victoria, two of the organizations involved in fire management are the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) and the Country Fire Authority (CFA). Both use fire 'meters' to determine potential fire behaviour given certain conditions. Values for temperature, wind speed, fuel load and vegetation type are input and a numerical estimate of fire danger given. There are a number of different meters used for different locations and environmental types. The most common meter used in Victoria is the McArthur Meter (CSIR0 2001b). The output data from this meter is numerical, and provides no spatial representation of fire danger. This paper looks at a variety of techniques used to visualise the numerical output from the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter. The article outlines the different models used by fire managers to simulate a fire situation, to assess future scenarios and for decision making involving fire management. Particular emphasis is placed on the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter as this is commonly used by fire departments in Australia. The article then focuses on geographical visualisation and a number of techniques employed to convey spatial information are discussed. The article then goes on to describe the fire simulation prototypes created for a study, a visualisation proof-of-concept product for organizations involved in managing bushfires in Australia. Finally, results from the evaluation of the prototype are presented. © 2007 The Authors.

The semantics of moving objects are captured based on different events, for example, specialized events, such as departure , arrival, or unexpected destination events. The paper presents an approach for abstracting patterns of movement from event sequences based on key attributes: object identity, event description, and event location. A set of eight possible event pattern types are distinguished and discussed in the paper. From these patterns, three notable patterns of events are presented, i.e. identifiable trends of movement that are worthy of further attention or perhaps intervention. Two of these patterns, repeating and collocating , capture particular kinds of movement within a traversal or transit of a domain by a single moving object, such as a zigzag movement or reversal of direction, while a reiterating pattern of events corresponds to a movement pattern associated with multiple objects and describes, for example, convergence in a region. The inclusion of events in the data model provides a foundation for distinguishing particular semantics of movement based on patterns of events, providing a basis for querying different kinds of events as well as providing a foundation for developing automated event notification systems. © 2007 The Authors.

Given the coverage of Weather Surveillance Radar-88 Doppler radars (WSR-88D; Crum and Alberty 1993) over the Southern Plains of the United States, recent technological advancements including hail detection algorithms and powerful new geographic information systems (GIS) tools, a new methodology was developed to quantify the occurrence of severe hail. The methodology was tested using a dataset spanning 2001-2003 from 15 radar sites across eight states. The Hailswath algorithm developed at Weather Decision Technologies, Inc. was used to estimate severe and significant hail for each individual storm during the study period. Due to the discrete nature of the Hailswath algorithm output, it was manually contoured to create a coherent swath of the most likely area of severe (19 mm in diameter; 0.75 inches) and significant hail (51 mm in diameter; 2 inches). Finally, the results of these analyses were compiled monthly, annually, and for the total duration of the study period using a variety of GIS tools. A thorough demonstration of the data analysis process and results is presented, and the benefits and limitations of the method used to investigate the occurrence of severe hail are explained. © 2007 The Authors.

In the past, researchers have often turned to geographic information systems (GIS) to model these interactions. Although GIS provide a powerful tool for examining the spatial aspects of these interactions, they are unable to model the dynamic, individual-level interactions across time and space. In an attempt to address these issues, some researchers have begun to use simulation models. But these models rely on artificial landscapes that do not take into account the environment in which humans move and interact. This research presents the methodology for 'situating' simulation through the use of a new modeling tool, Agent Analyst, which integrates agent-based modeling (ABM) and GIS. Three versions of a model of street robbery are presented to illustrate the importance of using 'real' data to inform agent activity spaces and movement. The successful implementation of this model demonstrates that: (1) agents can move along existing street networks; (2) land use patterns can be used to realistically distribute agent's homes and activities across a city; and (3) the incidence and pattern of street robberies is significantly different when 'real' data are used. © 2007 The Author.

Often the required data are distributed and heterogeneous, and several data sources need to be combined in order to derive the information required by a user. Spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) are aimed at making the discovery and access to distributed geographic data more efficient. However, the catalogue services currently used in SDIs for discovering geographic data do not allow expressive queries and do not take into account that more than one data source might be required to answer a question. In this paper, we present a methodology that uses rules for both the discovery of data sources and, based on the discovered data, answering user queries in SDIs. We illustrate how this methodology allows inferences that use relationships between individuals and the combination of data from different sources, thus overcoming some of the limitations of other Semantic Web approaches that are based on Description Logics. The approach is illustrated by an example from the domain of disaster management. © 2007 The Authors.

Yet most current efforts to develop spatial ontologies remain focused on describing content. Ontologies describing other aspects of spatial databases may prove to be much easier to develop and nearly as useful as content ontologies, and yet these alternative ontologies have received little attention from the research community. This paper explores one such alternative, specifically, an ontology that describes how a spatial database may have been derived. Derivation ontologies are shown to be highly complementary to content ontologies, and in some cases can perform nearly identical tasks. It is also shown that derivation ontologies are much more straightforward to develop than are content ontologies. Finally, we present a genetic programming (GP)-based approach to automatically developing derivation ontologies for existing databases. It is concluded that while derivation ontologies cannot replace content ontologies, they are a useful and practical complement that offer their own unique set of strengths to the problem of semantically characterizing spatial data. © 2007 The Authors.

A broad panoply of tools assisting designers when building realistic 3D scenes exists. In a near future, a new challenge will be to control the quantity of 3D contents that will be available. For instance, large amounts of 2D or 3D geographic data are spread all over the Internet. Nevertheless, appropriate description techniques and tools for the deployment and the retrieval of such data are still lacking. Our global objective is to propose a geographic digital library which can be exploited for describing, annotating and indexing geographic contents using geometric and topologic descriptions, geographic and appearance features, and semantics. Descriptions, annotations, and indexations are then exploited in queries to retrieve contents. The existing 3D scene description languages are generally free of any semantic information which could improve the management of 3D data (and especially research and re-use). In this paper, we propose the construction of geographic 3D data warehouses managed by a semantic digital library 3DSDL (3D Semantic Digital Library). This library, through a standardized communication interface, gives access to all the 3D models indexed in the warehouse and facilitates their exploitation. Each object is characterized by a set of both semantic and geographic annotations and some common features (colour, geometry, and topology). © 2007 The Authors.

This ability will enhance discovery, retrieval and translation of geographic information as well as the reuse of geographic information in different contexts. The problem of generating semantic annotations has been recognized as one of the most serious obstacles for realizing the Geospatial Semantic Web vision. We present a rule-based strategy for the semantic annotation of geodata that combines Semantic Web and Geospatial Web Services technology. In our approach, rules are employed to partially automate the annotation process. Rules define conditions for identifying geospatial concepts. Based on these rules, spatial analysis procedures are implemented that allow for inferring whether or not a feature in a dataset represents an instance of a geospatial concept. This automated evaluation of features in the dataset generates valuable information for the creation and refinement of semantic annotations on the concept level. The approach is illustrated by a case study on annotating data sources containing representations of lowlands. The presented strategy lays the foundations for the specification of a semantic annotation tool for geospatial web services that supports data providers in annotating their sources according to multiple domain views. © 2007 The Authors.

Domain knowledge, including criteria describing data sources, is recorded in an ontology language. With the ontology, reasoning can be done to infer various types of information including which data sources meet specific criteria for use in particular tasks. The vision presented here is that in an emergency, for example, a user accesses a Web-based application and selects the type of emergency and the geographic area. The application then returns the types and locations (URLs) of the specific geospatial data needed. We explore the abilities and limitations of the OWL Web Ontology Language along with other Semantic Web technologies for this purpose. © 2007 The Authors.

A framework for representing such context is developed using three core aspects: dimensions, agents and roles. Dimensions consist of a concept's origins, uses and effects; these are generated by the interaction of human, machine and natural agents, and involve entities with roles developed from method-driven perspectives and epistemic-driven versions. The relationship between these core aspects is explored conceptually and implications for geoscientific ontologies are discussed, including identification of a basic ontological type, the situated concept, whose meaning is defined by its geographical-historical context. Geo-pragmatics should help geoscientists evaluate the scientific merit, and fitness for scientific use, of geoscientific ontologies in emerging e-science initiatives. © 2007 The Authors.

This paper discusses the development of a search interface, aimed at effective searches and an integration of a catalogue function and thematic mapping. For this purpose, the Resources Description Framework (RDF) is used to store the summaries of metadata of geospatial contents. These summaries are indexed based on their topics. Their topic categories are expressed using the RDF schema. The RDF queries and the transformation of results play a prominent role in the visualization of search results as a table, a thumbnail, and a bull's-eye display with possibilities to project footprints of results on top of a basic map and thematic layers. To highlight their matches to the search terms, the Hausdorff distance and the closeness degree were applied respectively to determine the geographic and thematic relevance. Feedback from participants testing the prototype indicated the benefits of the table and thumbnail displays as well as the possibility to combine these displays with metadata and thematic mapping for data discovery. The feedback also confirmed some design challenges in the depictions of relevance and symbolization of metadata. © 2007 The Authors.

Where users have been made a focus, the research generally concerns issues of overall system appearance, functionality, information content and interaction methods, with little emphasis on the component geospatial representations. This paper describes the initial stages of a research project aimed at filling this void through the application of a qualitative User-Centred Design (UCD) methodology for optimising geospatial representations within mLBS applications, in order to support a selected user group: Australian 'leisure-based travellers'. Presented in this paper is an account of two UCD activities adopted for the research. The first, user profiling, served to define the target user population in terms of their technological, geospatial and travel experiences, using an online questionnaire. The second, user task analysis, involved in-depth interviews with a subset of users in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the geospatial goals, tasks, needs and preferences within the population, as well as the range of user differences and variability in tasks present. An overall user assessment, through combined analysis of the two result sets, highlighted considerations for the ongoing research, including a set of specific implications for the design of alternative models for geospatial services, representations and interactions. The themes described in this paper represent an initial and necessary component of UCD, which has been largely overlooked in research relating to mLBS. Whilst the focus here is on a specific user group and context of use, it is envisaged that many of the concepts tested and ratified by the resulting models will be relevant to mLBS applications in general. © 2007 The Authors.

Digital elevation model (DEM) errors, the limited spatial resolution of DEMs, and differing algorithms employed by different GIS packages have all been suggested as possible sources for inaccuracy and non-repeatability. This study compared a field surveyed viewshed to predicted viewsheds generated using a variety of software packages and DEM databases, some of which contained known amounts of error. We found that each of the factors suggested by previous authors contributes to errors in predicted viewsheds. DEM errors contribute most to the discrepancies between surveyed and predicted viewsheds, and the majority of their negative impact occurred at very low levels of DEM error. Differing algorithms used by different GIS packages also contribute significantly to surveyed/predicted viewshed discrepancies, but more importantly, result in predicted viewsheds that disagree with one other, thereby confounding comparisons of results generated with differing software systems. Finally, the spatial resolution of DEMs also has a significant effect on the degree of agreement between surveyed and predicted viewsheds, but the magnitude of this effect is not as great as are the effects produced by DEM errors. © 2007 The Authors.

The need to represent such data in a way that eases sharing across applications, has led to the development of the Geography Markup Language (GML), which provides a rich collection of constructs for representing spatial and associated aspatial data as XML documents. However, although there are a growing number of applications and tools that make use of GML, there are surprisingly few experience reports on the representation of data from existing applications or models using GML constructs. This paper provides one such report, describing the use of GML as an exchange format for the Tripod spatio-historical database. This in turn involves identifying mappings between Tripod and GML constructs, and the development of a generic architecture for carrying out such mappings. The experience demonstrates that even though GML provides rich modelling facilities, the development of mappings from pre-existing models can be challenging, as related constructs often provide semantically distinct capabilities. © 2007 The Authors.

This paper presents an automatic geographic information system (GIS) procedure for delineating river and lake boundaries using aerial photographs. The GIS procedure is based on supervised classification of aerial photographs by using the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) for creating training areas. Four study areas -Lake Palestine in Texas, Brazos River in Texas, Neuse River in North Carolina, and Snake River in Idaho -are used to demonstrate the approach. The results from the automatic boundary delineation process are evaluated by comparing them to manually digitized boundaries. The boundaries delineated by the automatic procedure matched the manually digitized boundaries with an overall difference of less than five percent in terms of area measurement. Besides saving about 85 percent of manual labor, the GIS procedure provides a consistent way of delineating water bodies, and provides estimation of river channel widths, which, in conjunction with existing NHD data, can be used to estimate average flow depths. Supplementing the regional scale NHD data with local scale attributes such as channel width and depth may lead to increased use of NHD in local scale studies. © 2007 The Author.

It has long been known that models are of most value when calibrated, and that using back-casting (testing against known prior data) is an effective calibration method. SLEUTH's calibration uses the brute force method: every possible combination and permutation of its control parameters is tried, and the outcomes tested for their success at replicating prior data. Of the SLEUTH calibration approaches tried so far, there have been several suggested rules to follow during the brute force procedure to deal with problems of tractability, most of which leave out many of the possible parameter combinations. In this research, we instead attempt to create the complete set of possible outcomes with the goal of examining them to select the optimum from among the millions of possibilities. The self-organizing map (SOM) was used as a data reduction method to pursue the isolation of the best parameter sets, and to indicate which of the existing 13 calibration metrics used in SLEUTH are necessary to arrive at the optimum. As a result, a new metric is proposed that will be of value in future SLEUTH applications. The new measure combines seven of the current measures, eight if land use is modeled, and is recommended as a way to make SLEUTH applications more directly comparable, and to give superior modeling and forecasting results. © 2007 The Authors.

Contractors can reduce the risk through detection, which will cost time and thus money. In the Netherlands, maps are the prime source of information on the location of cables/pipelines and detection time strongly depends on whether maps indicate the presence of cables and pipelines. Poor quality maps can contribute to increased risk or higher risk avoidance costs. The objective of this article is to present a model for calculating the trade-off between detection costs and risk in case of a hit and for calculating implications of over- and incompleteness of maps. The model aims to find the optimal detection time at which the sum of detection cost and risk is at its minimum. A case-study showed that it is possible to parameterise the model with data collected from contractors through a questionnaire. The case-study provides a numerical example of calculation of the trade-off between risk and detection costs and provides an example of calculation of costs of incompleteness. We conclude that the model contributes valuable new insight. However, more and location specific data are needed to enable operational use of the model. © 2007 The Authors.

An advanced technique for the GIS-based 3D-modeling is developed here in order to integrate genetic aspects of deposition into the modeling process. The ArcView® software (ESRI, Inc., Redlands, California) and the extensions 3D-Analyst and Spatial Analyst have been used for the data management and layer rendering. The tools VirGIL and GSI-3D (Insight Corp., Germany) have been applied for the purpose of visualization of the layers in 3D. The main topic of the work is the generation of geometrically consistent models of fluvial terrace bodies, which represent monogenetic fills of Pleistocene palaeovalleys. One peculiarity of the investigated Illerglacier foreland, southern Germany, is the occurrence of highly eroded terrace remnants. The preserved deposits are tied to several accumulation levels, but the usual way of morphostratigraphic interpretation is limited and results in lots of different stratigraphies and palaeogeographic ideas presented in literature. The sediment fill of meltwater valleys, which can be identified in the Illerglacier area is reconstructed based upon intense field mapping. The terrace accumulations are defined by the base and surface layers, which are thought to be isochronous. Some 1,400 data points were used to model these layers in 3D. The geometry of the sediment deposits is defined using basic parameters, e.g. the gradient and the thickness of the terrace, which are used as bench levels for the modeling process. The quality of the calculated maps and cross-sections far surpasses that of those derived in the classic way without a genetic concept and without using the 3D-modeling technique. The results derived from the terrace models are relevant for the stratigraphy and palaeogeography of the investigated region of the Alpine foreland. The advanced modeling technique can be used for the detail analyses of terrace sequences of other regions. © 2007 The Authors.

The accuracy of such DEMs depends on different factors. This research investigates the effect of sampling density used to derive contours, vertical interval between contours (spacing), grid cell size of the DEM (resolution), terrain complexity, and spatial filtering on the accuracy of the DEM and the slope derivative. The study indicated different alternatives to achieve an acceptable accuracy depending on the contour interval, the DEM resolution and the complexity of the terrain. The effect of these factors on the accuracy of the DEM and the slope derivative was quantified using models that determine the level of accuracy (RMSE). The implementation of the models will guide users to select the best combination to improve the results in areas with similar topography. For areas with variable terrain complexity, the suggestion is to generate DEMs and slope at a suitable resolution for each terrain separately and then to merge the results to produce one final layer for the whole area. This will provide accurate estimates of elevation and slope, and subsequently improve the analyses that rely on these digital derivatives. © 2007 The Authors.

Two of the most important and burdensome tasks in this process are interpretation of geospatial queries and mapping the interpreted results into geospatial data models and geoprocessing operations. With the current state of GIS, there exists a gap between the knowledge user's possess and the knowledge and skills they need to utilize GIS for solving problems. Currently, users resort to training and practice on GIS technology or involving GIS experts. Neither of these options is optimal and there is a need for a new approach that automates geoprocessing tasks using GIS technology. This paper presents an ontological engineering methodology that uses multiple ontologies and the mappings among them to automate certain tasks related to interpretation of geospatial queries and mapping the interpreted results into geospatial data models and geoprocessing operations. The presented methodology includes conceptualization of geospatial queries, knowledge representation for queries, techniques for relating elements in different ontologies, and an algorithm that uses ontologies to map queries to geoprocessing operations. © 2007 The Authors.

A two-dimensional Markov chain approach has emerged recently for conditional simulation of categorical variables on line data, with the advantage of incorporating interclass dependencies. This paper extends the approach into a generalized method so that conditional simulation can be performed on grid point samples. Distant data interaction is accounted for through the transiogram - a transition probability-based spatial measure. Experimental transiograms are estimated from samples and further fitted by mathematical models, which provide transition probabilities with continuous lags for Markov chain simulation. Simulated results conducted on two datasets of soil types show that when sufficient sample data are conditioned complex patterns of soil types can be captured and simulated realizations can reproduce transiograms with reasonable fluctuations; when data are sparse, a general pattern of major soil types still can be captured, with minor types being relatively underestimated. Therefore, at this stage the method is more suitable for cases where relatively dense samples are available. The computer algorithm can potentially deal with irregular point data with further development. © 2006 The Author.

The approach was implemented for Iowa using a 90 m resolution population grid (LandScan USA) and U.S. Census 2000 population. Three spatial interpolation methods, the areal weighting (AW) method, the ordinary kriging (OK) method, and a modification of the pycnophylactic method, were used on Census Tract populations to estimate the age-sex proportion surfaces. To verify the model, age-sex population estimates were computed for paired Block Groups that straddled Census Tracts and therefore were spatially misaligned with them.

The organization procedure uses progressive adjustment of weights based on data characteristics and lateral interaction such that neurons with similar weights will tend to spatially cluster in the neuron layer. When the SOM is associated with a supervised classification, a majority voting technique is usually used to associate these neurons with training data classes. This technique, however, cannot guarantee that every neuron in the output layer will be labelled, and thus causes unclassified pixels in the final map. This problem is similar to but fundamentally different from the problem of dead units that arises in unsupervised SOM classification (neurons which are never organized by the input data). In this paper we specifically address the problem and nature of unlabelled neurons in the use of SOM for supervised classification. Through a case study it is shown that unlabelled neurons are associated with unknown image classes and, most particularly, mixed pixels. It is also shown that an auxiliary algorithm proposed here for assigning classes to unlabelled neurons performs with the same success as that experienced with Maximum Likelihood. © 2006 The Author.

However, spatial autocorrelation makes conventional decision trees underperform for geographical datasets as the spatial distribution is not taken into account. The research presented in this paper introduces the concept of a spatial decision tree based on a spatial diversity coefficient that measures the spatial entropy of a geo-referenced dataset. The principle of this solution is to take into account the spatial autocorrelation phenomena in the classification process, within a notion of spatial entropy that extends the conventional notion of entropy. Such a spatial entropy-based decision tree integrates the spatial autocorrelation component and generates a classification process adapted to geographical data.

Even with vector data, hydrologic inconsistencies between streams and sub-watersheds do exist, and are revealed in the form of streams crossing drainage divides and sub-watersheds with more than one outlet. WaterNet rectifies these inconsistencies and couples the two datasets. Most algorithms involving traces of dendritic networks employ a form of tree traversal which requires topologic information to be organized into specialized data structures. On the contrary, WaterNet develops topologic relationships from GIS attribute tables, which, in combination with sorting and querying algorithms, make the calculation process efficient and easy to implement. With the topologic relationships of the streams and sub-watersheds, WaterNet can perform traces to calculate cumulative network parameters, such as flow lengths and drainage areas.

It encompasses methods for data capture, storage, processing, analysis and visualization, and the use of advanced modeling, simulation, optimization and knowledge-based tools and systems infrastructure. Three types of hydrological data are most commonly used: Flow rate in major rivers and streams, height of water in wells, and precipitation. To get a complete view of the state of water at a given point in space and time, one must analyze many different types of hydrological data together to derive information using an online GIS tool. To help use these disparate data sources more effectively and efficiently, we have built an online interface called the IJEDI WebCenter for Hydroinformatics using a task-based approach. In this design, we first identify the tasks that users perform to study water-related issues, then organize data for each task, and build task-specific tools to present and analyze data and information. In a study involving both novices and experts in hydrology, we found that the both groups performed water-related studies more effectively and efficiently than they would have without the WebCenter. © 2006 The Authors.

The key issue in designing an effective C-SDSS is the anticipation of user information needs. Knowledge of user information needs can guide system designers in achieving a C-SDSS that fits the decision process. In this paper we present a design approach that is informed by stakeholder concerns, as part of a user needs assessment. The approach is based on the premise that knowing stakeholders' concerns can help anticipate user information needs and consequently lead to a more usable C-SDSS. We demonstrate the approach with the example of a spatio-temporal decision problem involving conjunctive water administration in the Boise River Basin in southwestern Idaho. The spatial dimension of the decision task involves delineating the areas of conjunctive water administration while the temporal dimension involves selecting the year in which a given area will start to be administered.

We propose a method for modeling urban environments from aerial images and digital maps with relatively little manual work. An image-based method is applied to the urban modeling that considers the characteristics of Korean cities. Buildings in the distance can be presented without creating a large number of polygons. The proposed method consists of a pre-processing stage that prepares the model from the GIS data and a modeling stage that creates the virtual urban environment.

Applications of indices of habitat suitability are problematic for diadromous fish because fish presence and abundance in relation to habitat quality are confounded by barriers to fish migration. An alternative approach is to assess diadromous fish distributions in proportion to distance inland and altitude above mean sea level, and subsequently generate trajectories for the various species. This approach, however, may be problematic. We show that river distance inland and elevation are only weakly correlated in our study area. Thus, in areas where steep slopes are not encountered, fish migrations to significant elevations and inland distances can be expected. In other areas, coastal cliffs and geologic fault lines provide for steep stream gradients close to the sea, and fish do not migrate far inland. To solve this issue, we developed methods for improving species trajectory approaches to explain the distribution of diadromous fish using a GIS. We adjusted distance and altitude categories so that each stratum was represented by the same number of site records, with flexible intervals for each stratum. For species capable of forming land-locked populations we manipulated input values for elevation and river distance inland to account for migrations from lakes, rather than sea. Additionally, a new GIS derived variable was introduced to better explain the distribution of diadromous fish; the maximum stream slope a fish would encounter during upstream migration. This new slope variable, independent of distance inland and elevation, is likely to be a better predictor of migratory fish occurrences than elevation above mean sea level, as the different species will have different slope-thresholds that they can overcome. © 2006 The Authors.

More recently, participation of stakeholders in CBA processes has become an important issue for governments. However, CBA by itself does not provide a good environment for stakeholder participation. A major reason for this is the lack of spatial disaggregation in traditional CBA. In order to allow greater public participation, a GIS-based approach is proposed. This approach uses a Geocomputational system, which incorporates soft computing theory with expert systems in a geographic information systems (GIS) environment. It is designed to generate representations of environmental, economic and social policy outcomes according to the perceptions of the stakeholders and after the CBA results have been obtained. The methodology proposed for modelling impacts in cases where uncertainty exists uses the soft computing theory of fuzzy logic to generate a raster map based on spatial inputs provided by the stakeholders involved in the decision process. This computer-based system, called DISCUSS (Decision Information System for Community Understanding of Spatial Scenarios), is intended for situations where the government chooses to evaluate a policy using CBA and desires to encourage public participation in evaluating the results identified by the economic methodology.

Many of the criteria used in an MCE analysis are based on spatial relationships or situation characteristics. Situation factors measure the accessibility that each raster cell is to resources or land uses that generate spatial externalities for the activity being sited. This accessibility can be measured either in terms of distance to the nearest target cell containing resources or the overall level of resource availability as measured by a spatial interaction model. This paper examines the spatial structure of these situation factors to identify the set of critical target cells for which distance estimates are most sensitive. Critical target cells are especially important in the case of positive externalities in which an activity would be inclined to locate near these cells to use or consume the resources there. Critical target cells are useful for evaluating the utility of the final site selection with respect to resource/activity ratios. © 2006 The Authors.

It represents an object that is significantly different from its neighbourhoods even though it may not be significantly different from the entire population. Here we extend this concept to the spatio-temporal domain and define a spatial-temporal outlier (ST-outlier) to be a spatial-temporal object whose thematic attribute values are significantly different from those of other spatially and temporally referenced objects in its spatial or/ and temporal neighbourhoods. Identification of ST-outliers can lead to the discovery of unexpected, interesting, and implicit knowledge, such as local instability or deformation. Many methods have been recently proposed to detect spatial outliers, but how to detect the temporal outliers or spatial-temporal outliers has been seldom discussed. In this paper we propose a multiscale approach to detect ST-outliers by evaluating the change between consecutive spatial and temporal scales. A four-step procedure consisting of classification, aggregation, comparison and verification is put forward to address the semantic and dynamic properties of geographic phenomena for ST-outlier detection. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by a practical coastal geomorphic study. © 2006 The Authors.

Based on subsets of these issues, there exists a number of overlapping collaborative GIS designs and processes. The goal of this study is to reconcile the overlap by modeling a core collaborative GIS design and process. General systems theory is used to classify core technical components of the collaborative GIS design, and soft systems theory characterizes the human activity dynamics of the collaborative process. Further, object oriented principles are used to generate a flexible problem domain design, and the unified modeling language (UML) visually describes the structure and behavior of the collaborative process. The core formalism facilitates GIS process integration, standardization, reusability, ontology design, and rapid solution design in new problem contexts. The collaborative spatial Delphi (CSD) methodology is a proof of concept.

The framework is designed for compatibility with the ArcGIS ModelBuilder environment, and utilizes the data structure provided by the SchemaLink and SchemaNode feature classes from the ArcGIS Hydro data model. SchemaLink and SchemaNode form the links and nodes, respectively, in a schematic network representing the connectivity between hydrologic features pertinent to the movement of surface water in the landscape. A specific processing engine is associated with a given schematic feature, depending on the type of feature the schematic feature represents. Processing engines allow features to behave as individual hydrologic processors in the landscape. The framework allows two types of processes for each feature, a Receive process and a Pass process. Schematic network features operate with four types of values: received values, incremental values, total values, and passed values. The framework assumes that the schematic network is dendritic, and that no backwater effects occur between schematic features.

Metadata have the advantage of being institutionally and structurally ensconced in GIS. At present, however, they lack fields to express information beyond the technical and geometric domain. This paper describes a framework for the creation of extended metadata for non-spatial attributes, with the goal of incorporating ontological context. We use an informatics interpretation of ontology which refers to the total universe of discourse associated with a given attribute (database field). In other words, an ontology is the possible range of meaning offered by an encoded field. Current ontology research in GIScience has focused on data structuring and modelling. Implementation of these schemes demands restructuring of existing relational database models. An alternative is to extend current metadata schemes (e.g. ISO 19115) to include context-based and tacit information about semantic attributes. Such ontology-based extended metadata permits data selection and interoperability decisions that are ultimately more defensible. We have developed eight preliminary fields to add to existing metadata frameworks that will enable ontological context to travel with the data. This paper illustrates a preliminary implementation based on the integration of non-commensurate cadastral data. The results illustrate the value of ontology-based metadata in highlighting descriptive and substantive differences between similar classification systems. Recognition of semantic heterogeneity is the basis for creating defensible data linkages between multiple datasets. The development of ontology-based metadata is profoundly different from the current trend to incorporate ontological context at the model level in GIScience. It is pragmatic, however, in that it presents a vehicle for incorporating use-context with data in a manner that is accessible; requires little re-engineering; and is intuitively understood by GIS users. Moreover, ontology-based metadata are a mechanism for addressing Pickles' (1997) concern about the ontology of spatial objects in GIS. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006.",,"cadastre; data processing; data set; GIS",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750049638

A variety of methods to measure accessibility have been developed with most research focusing on metropolitan-sized spatial extents using census-defined aggregation units and relying on vector point representation to calculate Euclidean or network distances as key ingredients in measure formulations. Less research considers broader scales where both origin and destination points are treated as polygons. This research develops alternative gravity-based measures of polygon-to-polygon accessibility for a case study of county-level accessibility to national forests in the western US. Different methods of county and forest representation are implemented using census block centroids and a lattice approach for disaggregation and re-aggregation. Other characteristics that are analyzed include origin-destination linkage definitions, population weighting, and distance thresholds. Correlation analysis is used to assess relationships of alternative measures with a simple percentage measure and with each other. Low correlations would suggest that measures capture different aspects of accessibility that are related to their qualitative characteristics. Results show the alternative measures to be dissimilar from the percentage measure; however, high correlations among alternative measures suggest that there is little to differentiate certain disaggregated measures in spite of their richer qualitative interpretation. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"correlation; forest; spatial analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646014145

The model first evaluates any changes in the land base due to conversion of farmland to non-agricultural uses, and then uses field descriptions, crop characteristics, and the decision paradigm of an agricultural producer to determine the preferred crop for each field under a particular policy scenario. By cycling over the fields for each time-step in the simulation, future depictions of the agricultural system that respond to various drivers of change are generated.

The expert knowledge uses two imprecise information and uncertainty management tools, Fuzzy measure theory and Dempster-Shafer theory, mediated by expert knowledge, to integrate data collected using local knowledge. Fuzzy measures were found to be an efficient way of handling uncertainty of data compiled from local environmental knowledge and uniformly scaling all land degradation indicator variables to the same numerical range of values. The two techniques allowed scaling and integration of 13 evidential themes characterizing southern Mauritania. The cartographic outputs of this study show the potential of Fuzzy measure theory and Demspter-Shafer theory as powerful complementary environmental resource management tools. On a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, the maps indicate the degree of degradation. The seriousness of land degradation decreases from settlements, roads, and watering points outward. As such, they constitute an excellent guide for resource allocation and rehablitation plans. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.",,"cartography; expert system; fuzzy mathematics; knowledge based system; land degradation; resource management; uncertainty analysis; Africa; Mauritania; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745262563

Currently in GIS, unlike traditional databases, there is a lack of machine learning algorithms to customize information retrieval results. Thus the particular interests of individual users are not taken into account in traditional geospatial queries. In this paper we present a system that adjusts query results based on user requirements and needs. It does so by using a collection of fuzzy functions that express user preference specifically in GIS environments. The focus of this work is on preference learning for one-dimensional, quantitative attributes, and on the customization of geospatial queries using this information. The model used to express user preferences adjusts gradually to the underlying complexity during a training process, starting with fairly simple linear functions and progressing to complex non-linear ones as needed.

Because vehicle-exhaust are highly localized, within a few hundred meters of heavily traveled roadways, highly accurate spatial data are critical in studies concerned with exposure to vehicle emissions. We compared the positional accuracy of a widely used U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) roadway network containing traffic activity data versus a global positioning system (GPS)-validated road network without traffic information; developed a geographical information system (GIS)-based methodology for producing improved roadway data associated with traffic activities; evaluated errors from geocoding processes; and used the CALINE4 dispersion model to demonstrate potential exposure misclassifications due to inaccurate roadway data or incorrectly geocoded addresses. The GIS-based algorithm we developed was effective in transferring vehicle activity information from the less accurate USGS roadway network to a GPS-accurate road network, with a match rate exceeding 95%. Large discrepancies, up to hundreds of meters, were found between the two roadway networks, with the GPS-validated network having higher spatial accuracy. In addition, identifying and correcting errors associated with geocoding resulted in improved address matching. We demonstrated that discrepancies in roadway geometry and geocoding errors, can lead to serious exposure misclassifications, up to an order of magnitude in assigned pollutant concentrations. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.",,"algorithm; error analysis; geological survey; GIS; GPS; pollutant; traffic emission; transportation planning",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745240076

Measures such as Root Mean Squared Error and standard deviation of the error are frequently used. These measures summarise elevation errors in a DEM as a single value. A more detailed description of DEM accuracy would allow better understanding of DEM quality and the consequent uncertainty associated with using DEMs in analytical applications. The research presented addresses the limitations of using a single root mean squared error (RMSE) value to represent the uncertainty associated with a DEM by developing a new technique for creating a spatially distributed model of DEM quality - an accuracy surface. The technique is based on the hypothesis that the distribution and scale of elevation error within a DEM are at least partly related to morphometric characteristics of the terrain. The technique involves generating a set of terrain parameters to characterise terrain morphometry and developing regression models to define the relationship between DEM error and morphometric character. The regression models form the basis for creating standard deviation surfaces to represent DEM accuracy. The hypothesis is shown to be true and reliable accuracy surfaces are successfully created. These accuracy surfaces provide more detailed information about DEM accuracy than a single global estimate of RMSE. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.",,"accuracy assessment; digital elevation model; error analysis; numerical model; regression analysis; spatial distribution; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745231180

Criteria for the diagnosis of CMI include reporting from at least two of three symptom clusters: fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and mood and cognition. A GIS-based methodology was used to examine associations between potential hazardous exposures or deployment situations and postwar health outcomes using troop location data as a surrogate. GW veterans from the Devens Cohort Study were queried about specific symptoms approximately four years after the 1991 deployment to the Persian Gulf. Global and local statistics were calculated using the Moran's I and G statistics for six selected date periods chosen a priori to mark important GW-service events or exposure scenarios among 173 members of the cohort. Global Moran's I statistics did not detect global spatial patterns at any of the six specified data periods, thus, indicating there is no significant spatial autocorrelation of locations over the entire Gulf region for veterans meeting criteria for severe postwar CMI. However, when applying local G* and local Moran's I statistics, significant spatial clusters (primarily in the coastal Dammam/Dharhan and the central inland areas of Saudi Arabia) were identified for several of the selected time periods.

This paper presents a dynamic spatial updating model that supports automated updating of non-standard maps in a scale-independent database-centric map production environment. Maps derived from the database are not separate data sets, but rather active views of the database. Each derived map is displayed in a unique way by implementing cartographic operations at the map level. While the operations applied require user involvement for strategic cartographic decisions, and algorithmic initiation and control, the technique allows geographic data to be processed cartographically without affecting the geometric integrity of the database. Each time a derived map is opened it retrieves the spatial data (and updates) from the database and applies the unique cartographic representation methods that persist on the individual derived maps. Database updates are automatically triggered to cartographic products, as process dependent updates, according to their individual product-specific behaviour. This paper investigates product-specific behaviour (product multiplicities) and the cartographic processing requirements to support dynamic spatial updating techniques in an object-oriented map publishing environment.

This occurs frequently in practice, and it invariably results in the occurrence of inconsistencies among the different representations of the same entity. In this paper, we propose an approach to the modeling of multiple represented entities, which is based on the relationships among the entities and their representations. Central to our approach is the Multiple Representation Schema Language that, by intuitive and declarative means, is used to specify rules that match objects representing the same entity, maintain consistency among these representations, and restore consistency if necessary. The rules configure a Multiple Representation Management System, the aim of which is to manage multiple representations over a number of autonomous federated databases.

Decisions in the adaptation of a spatial data model can have significant consequences on the ability to predict environmental function as a result of changes to levels of aggregation of input parameters and scaling issues in the processes being modelled. In some cases, it is possible to construct a systematic framework to evaluate the uncertainty in predictions using different spatial models; in other cases, the realm of possibilities plus the complexity of the environmental model in question may inhibit numeric uncertainty estimates. We demonstrate a range of potential spatial data models to parameterize a landscape-level hydroecological model (RHESSys). The effects of data model choice are illustrated, both in terms of input parameter distributions and resulting ecophysiological predictions. Predicted productivity varied widely, as a function of both the number of modelling units, and of arbitrary decisions such as the origin of a raster grid. It is therefore important to use as much information about the modelled environment as possible. Combinations of adaptive methods to evaluate distributions of input data, plus knowledge of dominant controls of ecosystem processes, can help evaluate potential representations. In this case, variance-based delineation of vegetation patches is shown to improve the ability to intelligently choose a patch distribution that minimizes the number of patches, while maintaining a degree of aggregation that does not overly bias the predictions. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.",,"ecological modeling; environmental modeling; GIS; grassland; patch dynamics; prediction; spatial analysis; vegetation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646160142

Its elements, terminology and typology are still under strong discussion and adopted methods for analysis are currently under intensive development. This paper presents a conceptual framework for systematic investigation of uncertainty which occurs in applications of land cover change modelling in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) based on historical map data. Historical, in this context, means the map is old enough to allow identification of changes in landscape elements of interest, such as vegetation. To date such analyses are rarely conducted or not satisfactorily carried out, despite the fact that historical map data represent a potentially rich information source. The general validity and practicability of the framework for related applications is demonstrated with reference to one example in which forest cover change in Switzerland is investigated. The conceptual model consists of three domains in which main potential sources of uncertainty are systematically exposed. Existing links between data quality research and uncertainty are investigated to access the complex nature of uncertainty and to characterise the most suitable concepts for analysis. In accordance with these concepts appropriate methods and procedures are suggested to assess uncertainty in each domain. One domain is the production-oriented amount of uncertainty which is inherent in the historical map. Vagueness and ambiguity represent suitable concepts for analysis. Transformation-oriented uncertainty as the second domain occurs owing to editing and processing of digital data. Thereby, the suitable concept of uncertainty is error. The third domain is the application-oriented uncertainty which occurs in comparing semantically different data. This domain relates to multi-temporal discord which assumes the assessment of 'equi-temporal' ambiguity and is thus connected to the production-oriented domain. The framework provides an estimation of the overall amount of uncertainty. This can be linked to subsequent assessment of 'fitness for use'. Thus the model provides a practicable and systematic approach to access the complex nature of uncertainty in the scope of land cover change modelling. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.",,"conceptual framework; GIS; land cover; map; modeling; uncertainty analysis; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Switzerland",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33244478409

Much of the new data includes regular snapshots of the environment. Comparison of these snapshots can provide information about changes to the phenomena of interest. However, conventional GIS data models and analytical tools lack capabilities to adequately handle massive multidimensional data. One of the fundamental tools necessary to meet such challenges is query support to retrieve and summarize data according to dynamic geographic phenomena, such as geographic events and processes, of interest. Such query support depends upon abilities to assess spatiotemporal similarity so that data representing geographic events that exhibit the spatiotemporal characteristics of interest can be identified in a GIS database. To this end, this paper introduces a method to assess similarity of geographic events and processes (such as storms) based on their spatiotemporal characteristics (such as distribution of precipitation). We developed six indices to capture static and dynamic characteristics of geographic events and applied the Dynamic Time Warping method to temporal sequences of the six indices to examine the similarity among these events. With a case study, we demonstrated the proposed indices and method capable of comparing spatiotemporal characteristics of events as recorded in a GIS database and categorizing spatiotemporal data into groups of events according to their behavior in space and time. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.",,"assessment method; database; geographical variation; GIS; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745275192

This requirement for effective and efficient spatio-temporal data management has given rise to a range of research activities relating to spatio-temporal data management. Such work has sought to understand, for example, the requirements of different categories of application, and the modelling facilities that are most effective for these applications. However, at present, there are few systems with fully integrated support for spatio-temporal data, and thus developers must often construct custom solutions for their applications. Developers of both bespoke solutions and of generic spatio-temporal platforms will often need to support the fusion of large spatio-temporal data sets. Supporting such requests in a database setting involves the use of join operations with both spatial and temporal conditions - spatio-temporal joins. However, there has been little work to date on spatio-temporal join algorithms or their evaluation. This paper presents an evaluation of several approaches to the implementation of spatio-temporal joins that build upon widely available indexing techniques. The evaluation explores how several algorithms perform for databases with different spatial and temporal characteristics, with a view to helping developers of generic infrastructures or custom solutions in the selection and development of appropriate spatio-temporal join strategies. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.",,"data management; database; GIS; spatial data; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745248093

The intent of the study was to use terrain data for the spatial modeling of soil organic carbon. It was hypothesized that DEMs derived from these data would be more accurate and therefore more useful for terrain-based soil modeling than those from USGS 1:24,000-scale contour data. Central tasks for this study were to digitally capture the 1:2,400-scale maps, convert digital contour data sources to raster DEMs at multiple resolutions, and derive terrain attributes. A flexible approach was adopted, using software outside of mainstream GIS sources where scientifically or practically advantageous. Elevation contours and streamlines were converted to raster DEMs using ANUDEM. DEMs ranging in resolution from 0.5-30 m were tested for accuracy against precision carrier-phase GPS data. The residual standard deviation was 1.68 meters for the USGS DEM and 0.36 meters for the NAEW DEM. The optimal horizontal resolution for the NAEW DEM was 5 m and for the USGS 10 m. Five and 10 m resolution DEMs from both data sources were tested for carbon prediction. Multiple terrain parameters were derived as proxies for surficial processes. Soil samples (n = 184) were collected on four zero-order watersheds (conventional tillage, no-till, hay and pasture). Multiple least squares regressions (m.l.s.) were used to predict mass C (kg m-2, 30 cm depth) from topographic information. Model residuals were not spatially autocorrelated. Statistically significant topographic parameters were attained most consistently from the 5 m NAEW DEM. However, topography was not a strong predictor of carbon for these watersheds, with r2 ranging from 0.23 to 0.58. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.",,"contour map; digital elevation model; GIS; soil carbon; topographic mapping; Coshocton County; North America; Ohio; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745228102

This work describes a concept model based on parameterized concept descriptions that uses a spatial metaphor, the conceptual space, as an organizing structure (Gärdenfors 2000). This cognitive theory of conceptual spaces is combined with a formal representation of semantic uncertainty based on rough fuzzy sets. The conceptual space then represents each concept as a collection of rough fuzzy property definitions with associated salience weights, where a property itself can be treated as a special case of a concept. Instead of explicitly defining concept hierarchies, we can allow different conceptual structures to emerge through measures of concept inclusion and similarity.

On the one hand, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs with a high degree of sophistication have replaced line-driven commands of first-generation GIS. On the other hand, a number of alternative approaches have been suggested, most notably those based on Virtual Environments (VEs). In this paper we discuss a novel interface for GIS, which springs from recent work carried out in the field of Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs). The philosophy behind TUIs is to allow people to interact with computers via familiar tangible objects, therefore taking advantage of the richness of the tactile world combined with the power of numerical simulations. Two experimental systems, named Illuminating Clay and SandScape, are described here and their applications to GIS are examined. Conclusions suggest that these interfaces might streamline the landscape design process and result in a more effective use of GIS, especially when distributed decision-making and discussion with non-experts are involved. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004.",,"decision making; GIS; landscape planning; software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-4644335287

This procedure utilizes information obtained from joint sequential simulation to establish the relationship between model uncertainty and variation of model inputs. Using this procedure, model variance can be partitioned by model input parameters on a cell by cell basis. In the partitioning, the correlation of neighboring cells is accounted for. With traditional uncertainty analysis methods, this is not possible. In a case study, spatial variation of soil erodibility from a joint sequential simulation of soil properties was analyzed. The results showed that the regression approach is a very effective method in the analysis of the relationship between variation of the model output and model input parameters. It was also shown for the case study that: (1) the uncertainty of soil erodibility of a cell is mainly propagated from its own soil properties; (2) the interactions of soil properties of neighboring cells could reduce uncertainty of soil erodibility; (3) it is sufficient for uncertainty analysis to include the nearest three neighboring cell groups; and (4) the largest uncertainty contributors vary by soil properties and location. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004.",,"erodibility; GIS; regression analysis; soil property; spatial variation; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-4644243783

In order to best utilize scarce resources, we characterized historical and modern river channel and flood-plain conditions to evaluate changes and help prioritize restoration sites. Using cartographic and photographic data sources, we developed a Geographic Information System (GIS) to map active channels, side channels, islands and tributaries for four separate dates, as well as riparian and flood-plain vegetation characteristics for pre-European settlement and modern time periods. Coverages based on flood records and other boundaries were used to partition the flood plain into spatial subsets for analysis. The GIS allowed comparisons between historical and present conditions for a variety of environmental factors. Much of the pre-settlement channel complexity has been removed. Total channel length in 1995 was 26% less than in 1850, with almost 58% of the river's side channels disconnected from the system. In addition, we found a 72% loss of flood-plain forest from 1850 to 1995, since it was converted to agricultural and urban land uses.

LIDAR is based on the combination of three different data collection tools: A laser scanner mounted on an aircraft, a Global Positioning System (GPS) used in phase differential kinematic modality to provide the sensor position and an Inertial Navigation System (INS) to provide the orientation. The laser sends towards the ground an infrared signal, which is reflected back to the sensor. The time employed by the signal, given the aircraft position and attitude, allows computation of the earth point elevation. In standard conditions, taking into account the flight (speed 200-250 km/hour, altitude 500-2,000 m) and sensor characteristics (scan angle ± 10-20 degrees, emission rate 2,000-50,000 pulses per second), earth elevations are collected within a density of one point every 0.5-3 m. The technology allows us therefore to obtain very accurate (5-20 cm) and high resolution Digital Surface Models (DSM). For many applications, the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is needed: we have to automatically detect and discard from the previous DSM all the features (buildings, trees, etc.) present on the terrain.

To interpolate the thematic map, the stochastic approach is often the best method to apply: it is based on the hypothesis that the observed phenomenon is the sum of a deterministic trend and a stochastic process. Usually, the stochastic approaches implemented in GIS software require a priori knowledge of the deterministic trend: a simplified and automated approach to the trend model selection has been studied. One of the main advantages of the stochastic prediction approaches is that they make available both the prediction map (thematic map) and a related prediction error map; starting from these two information layers a procedure has been implemented to verify if in some areas the predicted data are within an assigned range or exceed a threshold value at some certain degree of probability. The procedures were developed by creating GRASS commands calling upon and integrating the Gstat statistics program, and commands which allow the probabilistic computing of risk areas. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004.",,"data interpretation; environmental assessment; GIS; probability; software; stochasticity; thematic mapping",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-1642305622

The predominantly convective nature of precipitation in southern Africa creates a public demand for severe weather information systems for convective cells. Such a system was set up in GRASS GIS, using rule-based expert systems to classify convective clouds. It isolates storm cells from stacks of reflectivity fields and derives information about their development stages. This data is both archived and also used to send out customised messages to target groups in specific areas of interest. Further, nationwide HTML-maps can be created, serving as an interactive front-end for a web-based weather information system.

In contrast to other models, r.sun considers all relevant input parameters as spatially distributed entities to enable computations for large areas with complex terrain. Conceptually the model is based on equations published in the European Solar Radiation Atlas (ESRA). The r.sun model was applied to estimate the solar potential for photovoltaic systems in Central and Eastern Europe. The overcast radiation was computed from clear-sky values and a clear-sky index. The raster map of the clear-sky index was computed using a multivariate interpolation method to account for terrain effects, with interpolation parameters optimized using a cross-validation technique. The incorporation of terrain data improved the radiation estimates in terms of the model's predictive error and the spatial pattern of the model outputs. Comparing the results of r.sun with the ESRA database demonstrates that integration of the solar radiation model and the spatial interpolation tools in a GIS can be especially helpful for data at higher resolutions and in regions with a lack of ground measurements. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004.",,"clear sky; GIS; numerical model; photovoltaic system; raster; solar radiation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-12144286540

The geologic function g assigns a unique geologic unit to every point in the objective 3-D space. The boundary surface that divides the objective space into two subspaces is estimated using data from field survey. The logical model showing the hierarchical relationship between these boundary surfaces and geologic units can be automatically generated based on the stratigraphic sequence and knowledge of geologic structures. Based on these algorithms, a 3-D geologic model can be constructed virtually in the GRASS GIS. Applying this model, various geologic surfaces and section models can be visualized in the GRASS GIS environment.

An example of integrated and complementary use of 2D and 3D GRASS modules for the evaluation and representation of thermally induced slope winds over complex terrain is presented. The analytic solution provided by Prandtl (1942) to evaluate wind velocity and (potential) temperature anomaly induced by either diurnal heating or nocturnal cooling on a constant angle slope is adopted to evaluate wind and temperature profiles at any point over both idealised and real complex terrain. As these quantities depend on the slope angle of the ground and on the distance from the slope surface suitable procedures are introduced to determine the coordinate n of a point in the 3D volume measured along the direction locally normal to the terrain surface. A new GRASS module has been developed to evaluate this quantity and to generate a 3D raster file where each cell is assigned the value of the cell on the surface belonging to the normal vector. The application of the algorithm implemented in GRASS to an ideal valley and to a real valley close to the city of Trento in the Alps provides results in accordance with data reported in the literature.

In this paper the quality of DEMs derived from the interpolation of photogrammetrically derived elevation points in Alberta, Canada, is tested. DEMs with grid cell sizes ranging from 100 to 5 m were interpolated from 100 m regularly spaced elevation points and numerous surface-specific point elevations using the ANUDEM interpolation method. In order to identify the grid resolution that matches the information content of the source data, three approaches were applied: density analysis of point elevations, an analysis of cumulative frequency distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the root mean square slope measure. Results reveal that the optimum grid cell size is between 5 and 20 m, depending on terrain complexity and terrain derivative. Terrain variables based on 100 m regularly sampled elevation points are compared to an independent high-resolution DEM used as a benchmark. Subsequent correlation analysis reveals that only elevation and local slope have a strong positive relationship while all other terrain derivatives are not represented realistically when derived from a coarse DEM. Calculations of root mean square errors and relative root mean square errors further quantify the quality of terrain derivatives.",,"digital elevation model; interpolation; raster; resolution; terrain; Alberta; Canada; North America",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0842344542

Native prey are currently in decline due to predation; GIS techniques therefore have the potential to augment conventional ecological techniques and management practices. Predation risk to nests of ground-nesting birds was interpolated across an area using inverse distance weighting. A linear regression model for spatio-temporal predictors of nest predation was determined using a predation risk surface and three separate surfaces representing predator abundance, prey abundance, and habitat structure.

Fuzzy logic is integrated with spatial analysis through Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to make land condition assessment geographically specific. Two sources of uncertainty in Land Condition Analysis are considered in this paper. First is the uncertainty due to incomplete information on land condition. Second is the uncertainty emanating from identifying the condition of a particular parcel of land. The first is addressed by using sequential Gaussian simulation, a geostatistical tool. Erosion status is selected as the land condition factor, and uncertainty associated with it is considered in this study. Land allocation is based on fuzzy logic to reflect the continuous transition between different land conditions and the minimization of loss that is expected to occur in the case of misallocation. Various forms of loss functions are used for allocating areas in need of restoration. An important result of the study is a map showing the areas allocated for restoration.

Using the variable spatial inaccuracy of the telemetry locations, each point was buffered using a radius based on the accuracy of the point, and then intersected with the land cover imagery.

Spatio-temporal pupil dynamics of participants are recorded using digital infrared video. The pupil to iris area ratio is calculated for over 470,000 temporally sequenced de-interlaced video fields by automatic feature extraction using a combination of threshold analysis, spatial smoothing and areal filtering. Pupil dilation magnitudes and constriction onset latencies are calculated through post-processing in a spreadsheet.

Those conducting the survey and preparing the report have used that report to convey much information to the user, which would otherwise be lost. To the authors the report is the real product, and the map a view onto it. To most users, however, it has always been the map that was important because many lack the knowledge to comprehend the report in any detail: the report, therefore, being an adjunct to the map. Increasing production costs combined with the advances in computer systems and especially the widespread use of this information within GIS have resulted in a shift from paper to digital as the publication medium for the map and the report (when it is produced at all). Currently, many different models of presentation of natural resource survey results are apparent, ranging from those which only contain the map (spatial information) to those combining the report and the map on CD-ROM to those presenting a more integrated view of the map and the equivalent of the report. None has yet reached the full spatial multimedia solution which is now possible with computer technology. Such an approach will make it possible to interrogate the map for the report information, and vice versa, and to access and visualize tabular information. The current diversity of approaches means the potential loss of the valuable knowledge of the surveyors and report-writers other than as it is expressed in the map, but the integration of the report with the map in a multimedia presentation may save the report, and make that information available to more people than ever before.",,"digital mapping; multimedia; natural resource; survey",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037647400

Our objective was to investigate the usefulness of 3D geographic information technology (GIT) applied to land resource management. Our approach is based on 2D and 3D ordinary kriging interpolating surface and subsurface attributes to reconstruct soil-landscapes. We used Virtual Reality Modeling Language, which is a web-based 3D graphics language, to visualize objects (e.g. voxels, polyhedrons) representing soil and landscape attributes. We produced a 3D block model showing the spatial distribution of bulk densities and relief for a site in southern Wisconsin and a 3D stratigraphic model showing the spatial distribution of soil horizons and relief for a site in northern Florida. Emerging GIT was used to develop 3D soil-landscape models describing continuous changes of soil and landscape attributes.

It is seen as a solution for sharing and integrating geospatial data, more specifically to solve the syntactic, schematic, and semantic as well as the spatial and temporal heterogeneities between various representations of real-world phenomena. A few models have been proposed to automatically overcome heterogeneity of geospatial data and, as a result, increase the interoperability of geospatial data. However, the addition of a conceptual framework of geospatial data interoperability would contribute to understanding geospatial data interoperability, the appreciation of where existing contributions specifically apply, and would foster new contributions. In this paper, we revisit the concept of geospatial data interoperability within the broader scope of human communication and cognition. Human communication appears to be a rich framework since humans interoperate more easily than computers do. Accordingly, we present a conceptual framework of geospatial data interoperability that is broader in scope than existing frameworks and supported by several practical examples. An ontology of geospatial data interoperability is also introduced in order to refine the description of the conceptual framework. In such a communication-based framework, the notions of concept, context, proximity, and ontology appear to be fundamental elements.

In this cellular automata city, investment decisions are made according to the profitability measured in a local neighbourhood. If developers think there is enough of a profit margin in a particular site, i.e. a 'niche' of investment, they will increase investment at that site. However, by increasing investment at the site, new 'niches' might be created. Therefore, the action of converging towards an equilibrium state itself paves the way towards new fluctuations. This model demonstrates the potential of using simulation to increase our understanding of real estate dynamics. The experiments suggest that locally made 'rational' decisions can lead to temporal fluctuations because of non-linearity (discrete changes/densification and local bounded information). Interestingly, the fluctuations may show the property of a temporal fractal. This requires a sufficiently sensitive process of 'niche' formation compared with a relatively large impact of additional investment. The simulation suggests that the impact should be 4 to 20 times higher than the threshold over which a niche will be formed. This condition is satisfied in most cases of real estate investment, thus suggesting a self-organised criticality in complex real estate development.",,"cellular automaton; simulation; temporal variation; urban development",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037361139

Thus far, research on handling inaccuracy, fuzziness, error and related issues has focused for the most part on problems with spatial data and their direct products, typically representations of spatial objects or fields. This paper seeks to broaden the discussion of uncertainty in the geospatial domain by shifting the focus from information to knowledge. It turns out that there is a surprising number of things that we cannot know (or questions we cannot answer) that are not the result of imperfect information. Forms of not knowing are pervasive in domains as diverse as mathematics, logic, physics, and linguistics, and are apparently irreducible. This being the case it may help to explore how these realms of ignorance may affect our efforts. The paper distinguishes three different modes or forms of geospatial knowledge production, and argues that each of them has built-in imperfections, for reasons of logical principle and not just empirical fact. While much can and needs to be done to manage and resolve uncertainties where possible, I argue for accepting that uncertainty is an intrinsic property of complex knowledge and not just a flaw that needs to be excised.",,"GIS; knowledge; spatial data; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037360855

The optimization model calculates the optimal location for a ski run based on a slope map, which is derived from a digital elevation model (DEM). The uncertainty propagation is a generic method following a Monte Carlo approach, whereby realizations of the spatially correlated DEM error are generated using 'sequential Gaussian simulation'. We successfully applied the methodology to a case study in the Austrian Alps, showing the influence of spatial uncertainty on the optimal location of a ski run and the associated development costs.

Recent developments in model parameter estimation theory suggest that information obtained from calibrating such models is inherently uncertain in nature. As a consequence, identification of optimum parameter values is often highly non-specific. A calibration framework using fuzzy logic is presented to deal with such uncertain information. An application of this technique to calibrate the sub-canopy controls on transpiration in a land surface process model demonstrates that objective estimates of parameter values and expected ranges of predictions can be obtained with suitable choices for objective functions. An iterative refinement in parameter estimates was possible with conditional sampling techniques. The automated approach was able to correctly identify parameter tradeoffs such that two strongly different sets of parameters could produce almost equal daily average canopy transpiration for two upland deciduous tree species. The approach failed to correctly identify such idealized model parameter tradeoffs for upland conifer and wetland tree species. There remains a need for expert knowledge to choose among a range of parameter values. Due to its computational simplicity and flexibility, the framework presented and its associated algorithms can easily be embedded within a GIS to support the parameterization of land surface models. However, the core analytical tools would need to be augmented by human expertise or some form of expert system to reliably generate model parameters.",,"algorithm; calibration; canopy; fuzzy mathematics; GIS; land surface; parameterization; transpiration",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037287503

The resulting sample is denser in areas of higher variability and sparser in more 'well-behaved' areas, and is collected in a single traverse of the transect. It uses a combination of simple fuzzy functions representing the concepts 'too close' and 'too far' that are adaptively parameterized based on current measurements. The adaptive sampler produced better representations for 47% of simulated reference transects than uniform or random samples of the same size under perfect measurement conditions, increasing to best performance for 71% of the transects when measurement error was severe with only minimal increase in sampling density.

In spatiotemporal GIS databases and other formal representations, uncertainty in all three aspects of geography (space, time, and theme) must often be modeled, but a good data model must first be based on a sound theoretical understanding of spatiotemporal uncertainty. The nature of both uncertainty inherent in a phenomenon (often termed indeterminacy) and uncertainty in assertions of that phenomenon can be better understood through the Uncertain Temporal Entity Model, which characterizes the cause, type, and form of uncertainties in the spatial, temporal, and attribute aspects of geographic information. These uncertainties are the result of complexities and problems in two processes: the process of conceptualization, by which humans make sense of an infinitely complex reality, and measurement, by which we create formal representations (e.g. GIS) of those conceptual models of reality. Based on this framework, the nature and form of uncertainty is remarkably consistent across various situations, and is approximately equivalent in the three aspects, which will enable consistent solutions for representation and processing of spatiotemporal data.",,"data processing; GIS; spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036811652

Carcasses are a limited resource with patchy distribution, and there is an intense competition among many species for these carcasses. This situation is expected to lead to niche partitioning, such that different beetle species use different resources and thus escape direct competition. Our project used a geographic information system (GIS) and pitfall sampling to characterize carrion beetle preferences for soil texture and land use in Kearney County, Nebraska. The GIS was used to select sites where sampling was conducted using pitfall traps baited with rat carcasses. Attracted beetles were counted, identified to species, and released. The resulting data were used to construct occurrence maps of eleven species of carrion beetles by overlaying soil texture and land use. We then compared the results of EcoSim (an ecological simulation model of niche overlap) with GIS-generated maps of probability of carrion beetle occurrence. Our results are consistent with landscape-level niche partitioning by seven of the eleven examined species. Our application of GIS to the spatial analysis of carrion beetle distributions demonstrates how this technology can be used to test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses, predict habitat associations, and examine the effects of land use on a community of insects. This work could easily be extended to study the habitat preferences of the federally endangered American burying beetle, Nicrophorus americanus.",,"beetle; GIS; habitat selection; land use; niche partitioning; soil texture; spatial analysis; Nicrophorus americanus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036811034

The basic motivation of this paper is to introduce a GIS architecture that can enable geographic information integration in a seamless and flexible way based on its semantic value and regardless of its representation. The proposed solution is an ontology-driven geographic information system that acts as a system integrator. In this system, an ontology is a component, such as the database, cooperating to fulfill the system's objectives. By browsing through ontologies the users can be provided with information about the embedded knowledge of the system. Special emphasis is given to the case of remote sensing systems and geographic information systems. The levels of ontologies can be used to guide processes for the extraction of more general or more detailed information.

To create data infrastructure, disaggregate trip surveys are conducted and large numbers of observations are collected. To efficiently exploit these surveys, the transfer of the individual trip data to a GIS must start with the development of a solid conceptual data model that fully captures the semantic richness of the application domain and emphasizes its spatio-temporal properties. This paper presents a data modeling process that is based on a combination of complex system theory and the object-oriented paradigm and produced an object-oriented spatio-temporal data model. Main domain entities are modeled as highly structured classes. They encapsulate a memory of their time bound connections and states. Observation data sets are sampled from the origin-destination survey conducted in the Québec region in 1991. This survey incorporated street networks and activity places. The model was smoothly implemented into a proof-of-concept database prototype hosted by an object-oriented GIS shell. The prototype offers a means to navigate through a nested hierarchy of objects, providing a description of an individual's travel behavior over space and time.

These graph structures are needed to apply the computational principles of space syntax and derive the morphological view of an urban structure. So far the application of space syntax principles to the study of urban structures has been a partially empirical and non-deterministic task, mainly due to the fact that an urban structure is modeled as a set of axial lines whose derivation is a non-computable process. This paper proposes an alternative model of space for the application of space syntax principles, based on the concepts of characteristic points defined as the nodes of an urban structure schematised as a graph. This method has several advantages over the axial line representation: it is computable and cognitively meaningful. Our proposal is illustrated by a case study applied to the city of Gävle in Sweden.

The technique is tested on samples from three maps, giving accuracy levels of over 90% in all cases when compared with digitising the same maps by hand.

In many countries census data and their associated boundaries are now published as an integrated digital product. To truly understand the present, however, we must also understand the past and the changes that have led us to the present. Several European countries and regions have, therefore, created GISes of their changing administrative boundaries as a first stage in fully understanding the spatial and temporal complexities of long-term socio-economic change. Many others have plans to do so. In June 2000 a European Science Foundation funded workshop was held in Florence organised by Drs H Southall, M Goerke, and G Thorvaldsen. The meeting's title was ""Mapping Europe's historic boundaries and borders: An exploratory workshop"" (Southall et al. 2000). The meeting included a session on ""Constructing historic boundary GISes"" in which representatives of projects from various countries and regions reported on how their project had approached the problem of creating time-variant GISes of changing socio-economic units.

In geostatistical terminology, a non-stationary approach may be considered more appropriate than a stationary approach. In many applications, local variation is not accounted for sufficiently. This paper assesses potential benefits in using non-stationary geostatistical approaches for interpolation and for the assessment of uncertainty in predictions with implications for sampling design. Two main non-stationary approaches are employed in this paper dealing with (1) change in the mean and (2) change in the variogram across the region of interest. The relevant approaches are (1) kriging with a trend model (KT) using the variogram of residuals from local drift and (2) locally-adaptive variogram KT, both applied to a sampled photogrammetrically derived digital terrain model (DTM). The fractal dimension estimated locally from the double-log variogram is also mapped to illustrate how spatial variation changes across the data set. It is demonstrated that estimation of the variogram of residuals from local drift is worthwhile in this case for the characterisation of spatial variation. In addition, KT is shown to be useful for the assessment of uncertainty in predictions. This is shown to be true even when the sample grid is dense as is usually the case for remotely-sensed data. In addition, both ordinary kriging (OK) and KT are shown to provide more accurate predictions than inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation, used for comparative purposes.",,"digital terrain model; geostatistics; mapping; uncertainty analysis; variogram",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036155991

As part of a larger study into rill initiation by overland flow, a non-metric digital camera and ERDAS IMAGINE OrthoMAX software were used to generate small-scale DEMs of soil surface microtopography. This paper reports on the procedure used, highlights potential pitfalls, and comments on the quality of the resultant DEMs. Whilst acquisition of high-quality images using a digital camera is relatively straight forward, problems were subsequently encountered due to the small size of the internal imager and the need for camera calibration. Potential stumbling blocks in the use of the software lay in the setting-up of ground control points and the use of tie-points and check-points, as well as several software glitches not identified in the current manual. Nonetheless, once these problems were overcome the technique proved to be a simple, effective and fast tool for generating high quality microtopographical DEMs. This methodology shows great promise for future geomorphological studies that require these kinds of surface data.",,"automation; digital elevation model; geomorphological mapping; photogrammetry",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036153484

It is also one of the most contentious tools, as it is notoriously prone to error. The paper will demonstrate the versatility of the Multiscale Implicit Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) for the application of intervisibility analysis at multiple resolutions. This approach allows for the integration of three-dimensional (3D) topographic features with the terrain surface. The multiscale TINs are derived from generalising digital contours at a variety of lateral tolerances. The models' performances are evaluated from an extensive field study undertaken in the South Wales valleys. Results suggest that the accuracy of intervisibility analysis is very dependent upon the availability of good quality 3D topographic data. In our study, such data were shown to improve visibility performance by more than 44% over its bare-earth TIN equivalent. Interestingly, generalisation of the TINs had very little effect on visibility performance. In addition, a Monte Carlo approach to sensitivity analysis was found to be detrimental to the accuracy of visibility prediction in the full terrain and topographic models. However, this probable approach can improve intervisibility performance by up to 18% on a bare-earth TIN. The range of these visibility modelling scenarios demonstrate the flexibility of the Multiscale Implicit TIN for digital surface modelling.",,"GIS; image analysis; topographic mapping; visibility",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035096428

We propose a framework for collaborative model building that can address these issues, and has its roots in adaptive management, computer-supported collaborative work and landscape ecology. Models built through this framework integrate a variety of information sources, address relevant questions, and are customized for the particular landscape and policy environment under study. Participants are involved in the process from the start, and because their input is incorporated, they feel ownership of the resulting models, increasing the chance of model acceptance and application. There are two requirements for success: a tool that supports rapid model prototyping and modification, that makes a clear link between a conceptual and implemented model, and that has the ability to implement a wide range of model types; and a core team with skills in communication, research and analysis, and knowledge of ecology and forestry in addition to modelling. SELES (Spatially Explicit Landscape Event Simulator) is a tool for building and running models of landscape dynamics. It combines discrete event simulation with a spatial database and a relatively simple modelling language to allow rapid development of landscape simulations, and provides a high-level means of specifying complex model behaviours ranging from management actions to natural disturbance and succession. We have applied our framework in several forest modelling projects in British Columbia, Canada. We have found that this framework increases the interest by local experts and decision-makers to participate actively in the model building process. The workshop process and resulting models have efficiently provided insight into the dynamics of large landscapes over long time frames. The use of SELES has facilitated this process by providing a flexible, transparent environment in which models can be rapidly implemented and refined. As a result, model findings may be more readily incorporated into decision-support systems designed to assist resource managers in making informed decisions.",,"landscape; model validation; remote sensing; software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035090662

However, when a digital terrain representation is based on a regular raster (i.e. a DEM) the digital surface is commonly not continuous. This is the case for the derivation of variables such as slope, aspect, and curvature values as performed in today's Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Often, there is no surface specified at all, as, for instance, when flow lines or watersheds are constructed. The discrepancy between the phenomenon to be modelled and its digital representation causes the terrain analysis results to be less accurate than they could be. Furthermore, if more than one type of terrain information is derived the results are likely to be based on different specifications of the seemingly same terrain surface. The combined application of the derivation results will likely introduce inconsistencies. This paper suggests founding the specification of digital terrain representations on a careful analysis of the properties of the phenomenon. The paper details the reasons for, and advantages of, continuous surface representations and emphasises the importance of a comprehensive documentation of the conceptual models underlying digital terrain representations.

However, creating a supportive environment for people in the communities to actively participate in resource policy decisions requires simple, but efficient, participatory decision support procedures that are lacking in many of today's GIS. This paper describes the application of a decision support algorithm for managing resource allocation problems involving competing interests. A case involving multiple claims to resources in the Aboma Forest Reserve located at Kofiase in Southern Ghana is used to illustrate the Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) methodology.",,"algorithm; conflict management; decision support system; forest resource; GIS; multicriteria analysis; resource allocation; (South); Ghana",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035047960

At the same time, there is a need to distribute results of dynamic GIS using the Internet. Therefore, this paper sets out to explore the implementation of dynamic environmental models using Internet-based geocomputation techniques. An overview discusses shortcomings of current Internet GIS techniques for dynamic modelling based on the idea that bidirectional and sustained communication is required between the client and the server sides. Thus an applet-servlet approach is explored to demonstrate the modelling process of a chosen hydrological model, TOPMODEL, which requires frequent and efficient client-server interactions. This approach overcomes the inherent shortcomings of the current Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and more primitive Java applet techniques. We present an effective and generic way to implement dynamic modelling and visualization processes in an Internet environment. This allows users to benefit from Internet-based geocomputation techniques to gain insights into computation and representation of dynamic spatial phenomena.",,"environmental modeling; GIS; Internet; software; visualization",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035044617

Application of a dynamic NPS model requires efficient input data acquisition, storage, organization, reduction, and analysis accompanied by manipulation, interpretation, reporting, and display of model outputs. A Geographic Information System (GIS) helps extract, store, and organize input data as well as manipulate and display model outputs. This paper illustrates the development of an integrated GIS system for a continuous simulation, pollutant-loading model, Ann AGNPS (Annualized AGricultural Non-Point Source Pollution). The integrated system, called AnnGIS, was developed using the ArcView ® GIS and related program extensions. Using AnnGIS, modeling studies and management plans can be efficiently and easily developed. AnnGIS helps store, organize, and manipulate spatial and tabular data, extract spatial input parameters, develop analysis scenarios, and visualize input and output data in spatial, tabular, and graphical forms. AnnGIS is generic in nature (not limited to a particular geographic location) and can be successfully used in regions for which AnnAGNPS is designed.

Selective availability was switched off on the 2nd of May 2000, and is to be replaced with 'regional denial capabilities in lieu of global degradation'. The system tracks a vehicle on all possible roads (road centre-lines) in a computed error region, then uses a method of rapidly detecting inappropriate road centre-lines from the set of all those possible. This is called the Road Reduction Filter (RRF) algorithm. Point positioning is computed using C/A code pseudorange measurements direct from a GPS receiver. The least squares estimation is performed in the software developed for the experiment described in this paper. Virtual differential GPS (VDGPS) corrections are computed and used from a vehicle's previous positions, thus providing an autonomous alternative to DGPS for in-car navigation and fleet management. Height aiding is used to augment the solution and reduce the number of satellites required for a position solution. Ordnance Survey (OS) digital map data was used for the experiment, i.e. OSCAR 1 m resolution road centre-line geometry and Land Form PANORAMA 1:50, 000, 50 m-grid digital terrain model (DTM). Testing of the algorithm is reported and results are analysed. Vehicle positions provided by RRF are compared with the 'true' position determined using high precision (cm) GPS carrier phase techniques. It is shown that height aiding using a DTM and the RRF significantly improve the accuracy of position provided by inexpensive single frequency GPS receivers.",,"algorithm; digital map; GPS; mapping method; navigation aid",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034946891

Meteorological occurrences, geological processes, or population movements, for example, can be examined at different granularities. This includes different spatial perspectives as well as temporal views where phenomena may be examined under real time conditions, or over hourly, daily, weekly, or longer periods. Moving back and forth among granularities is a necessary routine for many domain scientists. Changing to a more detailed view uncovers information that otherwise is unknown. Conversely, moving to a simpler view can improve our understanding of phenomena. Although people routinely abstract information from their environment at different granularities and perform mental shifts that increase or decrease detail, formalization of these alterations for use in information systems has proved difficult. Geographic information systems typically treat changes in granularity from the perspective of changes to the geometric properties of objects through graphic zooming. None of the current approaches to zooming offer support for performing this operation over time. This work focuses on the temporal aspects of changing granularity or temporal zooming. The approach is based on a model of change to identifiable objects. In this paper, temporal zooming involves expanding or collapsing the transitions among identity states of the same object as well as revealing or omitting other objects that are linked through transitions. A set of operations to support refining and coarsening the evolution of objects over time is presented. This work offers a new perspective on zooming important for spatio-temporal query languages and for users of large spatio-temporal databases who require the means to shift back and forth among simpler or summarized views of data and more detailed views.",,"GIS; image processing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034946097

Firstly, we investigated how predicted model results may differ as a result of the ordering of the spatial interpolation and the model procedures. Principles of logic were used to detect errors occurring in the daily sequences of predicted pest development. Analyses of spatial autocorrelation within the gridded results showed that areas where a pest was predicted to reach a certain stage of development become more fragmented as a model run progressed over time. We identified that the less intensive approach of running a model only at data points and subsequently interpolating these to a grid can, in some cases, result in errors of logic and unrealistic degrees of autocorrelation. These errors occurred particularly when mapping a non-indigenous, marginal, pest at the later stages of its development. As a strategy for error evaluation, deterministic process models were run using point-based estimates of interpolated daily temperature to give RMS data errors at the sample points. This enabled us to investigate how the component of error related to sparsely distributed point data contributed to errors in the gridded estimates of pest development over time. The error detection and evaluation methods outlined are tractable and applicable to a wide variety of cases where point based models running over multiple time steps are extended to provide spatially continuous, landscape-wide, mappable results.",,"crop pest; error analysis; map; modeling; time series",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034758050

We compare the accuracy of the vegetation map attributes estimated using this method to accuracy estimated from fuzzy class membership scores assigned by experts (inventory crews) during field work. Accuracy of the vegetation life form attribute was estimated to be higher when expert label assignments were used as reference data (76-87%), instead of FIA plot data (62-79%).

Tests of this assumption against empirical data, however, show many deviations. Estimates of fractal properties vary between methods and over different scale ranges. So far, this empirical evidence has come from the analysis of variograms for DEMs representing areas up to tens of kilometres in diameter. Here we report results obtained by using variograms to analyse land surface DEMs at the continental scale, with a grid resolution of 30 arc seconds. Results reveal variogram curvature and breaks of slope, but also linear sections over distance lags of hundreds of kilometres. The estimated mean fractal dimension calculated from these sections is 2.66, substantially higher for all continents at these broad scales (around 200 km) than values calculated at the erosional landscape scale (around 200 m). Thus the land surface is not self-affine, and it is not clear that it follows any simple multifractal model. At the longest wavelengths, patterns found in the variograms appear to be related to broad tectonic features of the Earth's surface.

Along with data based on standard tidal predictions, the waterlines are utilised to derive an initial Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the tidal flat within a GIS environment.

Tidal interpolation equations are then utilised to generate an inundation time in hours for each cell on this extrapolated DEM. Output from the generalised model is a series of maps showing isolines of inundation for both the mean spring and neap tidal cycles, as well as sets of point data that may be integrated with existing biological sample data.

Even though accuracy has been a concern in every serious application, there are no general tools for its improvement. Some particular ones exist, however, and some results are presented here for a particular case of quantitative raster data: Digital Elevation Models (DEM). Two procedures designed to detect anomalous values (also named gross errors, outliers or blunders) in DEMs, but valid also for other quantitative raster datasets, were tested. A DEM with elevations varying from 181 to 1044 m derived from SPOT data has been used as a contaminated sample, while a manually derived DEM obtained from aerial photogrammetry was regarded as the ground truth to allow a direct performance comparison for the methods with real errors. It is assumed that a 'better' value can be measured or obtained through some methodology once an outlier location is suggested. The options are different depending upon the user (DEM producers might go to the original data and make another reading, while end users might use interpolation). Both choices were considered in this experiment. Preliminary results show that for the available dataset, the accuracy might be improved to some extent with very little effort. Effort is defined here as the percentage of points suggested by the methodology in relation with its total number: thus 100 per cent effort implies that all points have been checked. The method proposed by Lopez (1997) gave poor results, because it has been designed for errors with low spatial autocorrelation (which is not the case here). A modified version was then designed and compared with the method proposed by Felicisimo (1994). The three procedures can be applied both for error detection during DEM generation and by end users, and they might be of use for other quantitative raster data. The choice of the best methodology is different depending on the effort involved. The conclusions have been derived for a photogrammetrically obtained DEM; other production procedures might lead to different results.",,"accuracy assessment; digital elevation model; elevation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034066602

The transformation and movement of water, carbon and nutrients through watersheds integrates a set of ecosystem processes along hydrologic flowpaths. Human individual and institutional interactions with these processes involve direct addition or abstraction of these substances, or the alteration of land cover and drainage systems. In natural and developed catchments, these processes often vary at granularities ranging from below the level of a hillslope, up through regional watersheds. This suggests the need for the development of hierarchical analysis tools that can address the integration of a set of biophysical, biogeochemical and socioeconomic processes over a spectrum of scales. We describe and illustrate the use of a watershed model implemented as a spatial object hierarchy, representing successively contained landform classes associated with class specific processes as member functions.

Furthermore, as remote sensing, environmental modelling and GIS converge, so the need for parallel computing becomes more apparent. Several case studies, parallelising the processing of raster, grid and vector-topology, demonstrate that scope exists for encapsulating the complexity of the parallelism in software frameworks, with strategies of spatial decomposition into sub-areas maximising the re-use of code from sequential algorithms. We show that parallel software frameworks can speed both the development and the execution of new applications. Based upon these case studies, the parallelisation of both interpolation and modelling in one software system is considered, with reference to pest infestation models, using both task and data parallelism.

The methods of using integrated GIS and air quality dispersion modelling tools to assess the effect of the environment on health are discussed. The main aim is to model human personal exposure to air pollutants and compare the predictions to respiratory health data for asthmatics in a health telematics project. The MEDICATE project develops and tests the feasibility of using a health telematic system for asthmatics. Key to this is the determination of the real-time health (lung function) response to the ambient environment. For this, air quality information is related to respiratory measurements by modelling personal exposure through a GIS. The methods of integrating environmental modelling and assessment tools (GIS) in this case are examined. ESRI's Arc View is used to locate and compile environmental information about the patients' locations and lifestyles in the study areas (London and Barcelona). A dispersion modelling extension to ArcView, ADMS Urban, is used to interrogate the spatial environmental databases (e.g. emission inventories) to model air pollution concentrations. Patients' personal exposure is modelled by time-weighted estimates of their exposure to ambient air quality at each defined location. Lung function data can be compared on a time-wise basis with these air quality indicators to see if there is a relationship on an hourly, daily or lagged-day basis. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology and discuss the integration and practicalities of using air quality assessment tools (inventories, dispersion modelling and a GIS) in assessing the impacts of the environment on human health.",,"air quality; dispersion; GIS; health impact; integrated approach; Barcelona; Catalonia; England (London); Spain; United Kingdom",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033811018

Before becoming useful to the community, however, many of these systems encounter prohibitive factors delaying or preventing the satisfaction of the ultimate goals for which they were designed. A criticism of current models is that system developers seeking to build publicly accessible systems do not use them. Since most systems are developed without the guidance of a formal model, system developers often do not fully anticipate likely system issues. Many systems, designed on an ad hoc basis, fail to achieve their full potential, because they have not used an appropriate model to determine a final system outcome. This paper presents a theoretical model describing the stages systems experience during development. These stages are: no development, system initiation, database development, recordkeeping, analysis, and democratization. Additionally, the factors promoting or prohibiting movement from one stage to the next, and the indicators or outcomes of each stage are described. Not only are the individual elements described but also their relationships are described as part of the model. The Multipurpose Land Information System (MPLIS) development model is designed both as a guide for system developers and a tool for discussing and comparing systems.",,"land information system; technological development",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032877034

Even where the data are required in raster form the complexity of most maps means that the data are first digitised in vector form, and then rasterised, a slow and error-prone process. This paper describes an alternative approach based upon readily available hardware and software in which the map is scanned using Spot Colour Scanning, and then processed using a specially designed majority filter and editing with a painting package. Tests on a small scale soil map produce results which are about 80% as accurate as digitising, but take far less time to produce. An analysis of the sources of error indicates that many of these are due to the difficulty of scanning such a complex document as a map, and suggests that more sophisticated image processing algorithms may be needed to classify the original scanned image before the application of the filter algorithm.",,"data acquisition; GIS; map; raster",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032869597

We integrate existing environmental pollution models with GIS software to identify the specific locations where noise and air pollution standards could be violated because of the proposed system change.

The quality of lattices decreased more dramatically than that of TINs when the number of sample points used for the construction of the models decreased. With an increase in the number of sample points used, the difference in performance between the two models decreased. The results of the evaluation directly depend on the comparison criteria and modeling algorithms. The evaluation is slightly sensitive to test indices used and the distribution of test points.

Dynamic GIS representations (as opposed to static, map-based representations) that can integrate proper data elements in the production of geographic information are required. This paper demonstrates the use of a three-domain representation that facilitates compilation of higher-level information (such as frequency and rate) from preliminary data records (such as time and location) stored in a database. The three-domain representation is compared with snapshot, space-time composite, and spatiotemporal object models using a sample data set for forest transitions. While the three-domain representation is a normalization of these data models, it offers a conceptual alternative that enables GIS to represent spatiotemporal behaviors of geographic entities, in addition to entities as well as histories at locations as emphasized in most GIS data models. The comparison shows that the three-domain representation has combined the strengths of the space-time composite and spatiotemporal object models. Moreover, it enables aggregations of analytical use along with dynamic mappings between geographic concepts and locations, a distinct capability that takes GIS query processing beyond the level of information support offered by static map-based data models.",,"GIS; information management; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032782455

At these basin (and larger) scales, a common problem in hydrology and other environmental sciences arises from the need to cope with the increasingly sophisticated models and software tools that are used in the management, processing, and analysis of large volumes of data collected from advanced in situ and remote monitoring instruments. The diversity of these tools, and the need for experts and non-experts alike to be able to easily use them, suggests a non-trivial integration problem of building customized systems from disparate (and in many cases proprietary) components. In this paper we address the systems integration problem within the context of a study of surface-subsurface-atmosphere interactions involving soil moisture remote sensing and hydrologic simulation. The simple early steps that were taken highlight the role of the different components and tools in the integration effort.

This study aimed to develop an experimental design which measures spatial cognitive abilities in the use of GIS, specifically the map overlay operation. Subjects (n = 134) received three map overlay tests in which they were given two of the following: input map layers, logical operator(s), or output map layer(s). Subjects were required to select the correct logical operator for Test 1, to select the correct output map layer for Test 2, and to select the correct input map layers for Test 3. Each test contained a total of 16 questions, based on a 4 ('and', 'or', 'xor', 'not' operators) x 2 (one or two polygons per map layer) x 2 (three or five polygon edges) factorial design. Results indicated a significant main effect of logical operators and number of polygons on performance; however, there was no effect of the number of polygon edges on performance. Significant two-way interactions revealed an effect of the number of polygon edges and the number of polygons using various logical operators on performance. In addition, performance was not significantly different between males and females or between GIS users and non-users. Overall, results show that map overlays in which a visual correspondence can be made between the same polygons in the input and output map layers are cognitively less demanding than map overlays in which the shape of the polygons have been radically transformed between the input and output map layers. This study helps further develop our understanding of the spatial cognitive abilities which are required in the use of GIS, and whether certain sub-populations differ in these cognitive abilities.

Given this reality, there have been a number of attempts to model the optimal selection of conservation reserve sites such that maximum biodiversity protection can be attained within a limited budget for land acquisition. Here we adapt the Location-Allocation module of ARC/INFO to solve the problem of representing, or covering, as many species as possible in a fixed number of selected reserve sites. Resident ARC/INFO solution routines are applied to an innovative 'logical' network that converts the problem of optimal reserve selection into a problem of optimal facility placement, which the Location-Allocation module can recognize and solve. Use of this unique logical network structure as input to ARC/INFO's internal solvers makes possible, compared to previous methods, a much tighter integration of spatial optimization tools with mapping and database tools, all of which are internal to the GIS and accessed via a menu-driven interface. The main advantage is that users of public domain data (such as the US Gap Analysis data) can conduct their own explorations of possible reserve systems without having to acquire and master optimization packages and reformat model output data for GIS display and post-analysis of solutions. Our sample application uses species data from south-western California. We also present a second major form of species-covering model grounded in the same logical network. This enhanced model accommodates weighting of species by their conservation importance, thus allowing reserve systems to be designed around the protection of the most threatened or vulnerable biota. © Pearson Professional Limited 1997.",,"ARC/INFO; biodiversity; environmental planning; GIS; native conservation; nature reserve; planning method; protected area; site selection; USA",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031431954

Factors promoting and impeding the growth and diffusion of GIS are identified and suggestions for action on the part of higher education GIS specialists are made. In the United States more science teachers have adopted GIS than geography/social studies teachers for several reasons. These include science teacher preservice preparation and the essentially different natures of the respective disciplines. Preservice education and teachers' perceptions of geography emerge as key factors influencing the diffusion of GIS in K-12 classrooms. The need for research on cognition and GIS before effective curricula and instruction can be developed is emphasized. Three strategies directed at higher education GIS specialists may help implement this educational innovation. They are: (1) modelling GIS instruction in content classes; (2) including GIS in preservice preparation classes; and (3) outreach to professors who teach educational technology to educate them regarding GIS.

These include poor ability to handle dynamic spatial models, poor performance for many operations, and poor handling of the temporal dimension. Cellular Automata (CA) are dynamic mathematical systems based on discrete time and space. While CA have many similarities to GIS, and indeed excel in many areas in which GIS are deficient, they cannot themselves be considered as GIS since they lack the necessary sophisticated capabilities in data input, data storage and retrieval, and data output. However, the advantages of CA in data analysis and modelling are significant. In order to exploit fully the advantages of each system - GIS and CA - we have developed a methodology and prototype system for coupling GIS and CA, in which the CA serves as an alternative analytical engine for the GIS. In the prototype system, spatial, temporal (i.e. time series), and spatio-temporal filters as well as spatial diffusion operators are developed. In addition, the integrated system provides a flexible framework for the programming and running of dynamic spatial models. We conclude that CA represent a viable alternate analytical engine for GIS and provide increased ability for dynamic spatial modelling within GIS. © Pearson Professional Limited 1997.",,"analytical tool; Cellular Automata; GIS; mathematical system",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031428520

This research project examines the manner in which error from a digital elevation model (DEM) results in error in an estimate of a viewshed. The data set includes two DEMs for the same study area. A 10-metre DEM serves as the control model to test a United States Geological Survey (USGS) DEM. The amount and spatial pattern of the error in the test DEM is determined by comparing it to the control DEM. A viewshed analysis is then performed at a set of 61 sites. After determining the relative accuracy of the viewsheds thus estimated, a causal model of viewshed error is developed, which links the sources of the DEM error with the error in the viewshed. The most important factor in DEM error is terrain roughness. The error in the viewsheds is a result of the error being propagated from the DEM, with landscape characteristics of the viewpoint playing a role due to their effect on the error in the DEM. The conceptual path model developed sets the stage for a quantitative approach that will attempt to predict viewshed error from the landscape characteristics without direct knowledge of the error in the DEM. © Pearson Professional Limited 1997.",,"causal analysis; data error; DEM; GIS; viewshed",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031427545

The quadtree is one such tessellation and is characterized by square cells and a 1:4 decomposition ratio. To relax these constraints in the tessellation, a generalized hierarchical tessellation data model, called Adaptive Recursive Tessellations (ART), has been proposed. AST increases flexibility in the tessellation by the use of rectangular cells and variable decomposition ratios. In ART, users can specify cell sizes which are intuitively meaningful to their applications, or which can reflect the scales of data. ART is implemented in a data structure called Adaptive Recursive Run-Encoding (ARRE), which is a variant of two-dimensional run-encoding whose running path can vary with the different tessellation structures incorporated in an ART model. Given the recognition of the benefits of implementing statistical spatial analysis in GIS, the use of hierarchical tessellation models such as ART in spatial analysis is discussed. Three examples are introduced to show how ART can: (1) be applied to solve die quadrat size problem in quadrat analysis of point patterns; (2) act as the data model in die variable resolution block kriging technique for geostatistical data to reduce variation in kriging error; and (3) facilitate the evaluation of spatial autocorrelation for area data at multiple map resolutions via the construction of a connectivity matrix for calculating spatial autocorrelation indices based on ARRE. © Pearson Professional Limited 1997.",,"adaptive recursive tessellation; GIS; hierarchical tessellation; quadtree; spatial analysis; tessellation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031427527

Geo-Algebra overcomes the discrepancy between spatial modelling and GIS in the modes of representation as well as in their underlying concepts of space by using a common representational framework for (1) mathematical models expressing spatial relationships and (2) data models of georeferenced information. Geographic models of spatial structure and static as well as dynamic spatial interaction are formulated consistently within Geo-Algebra through a limited set of generic operations on map layers which are used simultaneously for GIS data manipulation and analysis. A significant advantage of Geo-Algebra over other approaches to integration, such as high-level computational languages, is the development of theoretical concepts of the most general kind which allows the derivation of general properties of these in a deductive manner. In particular, Geo-Algebra formalizes and extends the mathematical notion of Map into the novel concepts of relational and metarelational Maps. These extensions lead to the novel concepts of space bridging the absolute and relative, as well as static and dynamic views of space. Such theoretical concepts are also implemented in a dynamic simulation tool called Geocellular. © Pearson Professional Limited 1997.",,"Geo-Algebra; GIS; map layer; spatial data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031411033

There are a number of techniques for generating suitability maps, but these maps are not solutions to the site location problem. Feasible solutions are clusters of contiguous cells which meet spatial criteria concerning the size and shape of the clusters. Locating optimal sites involves a trade-off between the intrinsic suitability of individual cells and the spatial configuration of cells. This paper describes a genetic algorithm which searches for optimal clusters and thereby locates optimal sites. The genetic algorithm uses a parameterized region-growing program to translate numeric strings into regions on a raster and employs raster GIS functions to evaluate utility scores. In a range of simulated problems, comparisons with an exhaustive search show that the genetic algorithm is efficient and robust. The results indicate that the genetic algorithm can find good solutions to real problems when exhaustive search methods are impractical. © Pearson Professional Limited 1997.",,"algorithm; GIS; land use planning; location choice; map; mapping; optimal location; planning; raster data; site location; suitability map",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031409021

Everyday space, the basis to GIS, has been characterized in the literature as being either small-scale (from table-top to room-size spaces) or large-scale (inside-of-building spaces to city-size spaces). While this dichotomy of space is grounded in the view from psychology that people's perception of space, spatial cognition, and spatial behaviour are experienced-based, it is in contrast to current GIS, which enable us to interact with large-scale spaces as though they are small-scale or manipulable. We analyse different approaches to characterizing spaces and propose a unified view in which space is based on the physical properties of manipulability, locomotion, and size of space. Within the structure of our framework, we distinguish six types of space: manipulable object space (smaller than the hyman body), non-manipulable object space (greater than the human body, but less than the size of a building), environmental space (from inside-of-builidng spaces to city-size spaces), geographic space (state, country, and continent-size spaces), panoramic space (spaces perceived via scanning the landscape), and map space. Such a categorization is an important part of Naive Geography, a set of theories on how people intuitively or spontaneously conceptualize geographic space and time, because it has implications for various theoretical and methodological questions concerning the design and use of spatial information tools.

However, the implementation of such linkages is generally problematic. Many problems arise because the relationship between the reality being represented by the mathematical model and the data model used to organize the spatial data in the GIS has not been rigorously defined. In particular, while many environmental models are based on theories that assume continuity and incorporate physical fields as independent variables, current GISs can only represent continuous phenomena in a variety of discrete data models. This paper outlines a strategy in which field variables are used to enable modellers to work directly with the spatial data as spatially continuous phenomena. This allows the manner in which the spatial data has been discretized and the ways in which it can be manipulated to be treated independently from the conceptual modelling of physical processes. Modellers can express their spatial data needs as representations of reality, rather than as elements of a GIS database, and a GIS-independent language for model development may result. By providing a formal linkage between the various models of spatial phenomena, a mechanism is created for the explicit expression of transformation rules between the different spatial data models stored and manipulated by a GIS. © Pearson Professional Limited 1997.",,"environmental model; field variable; GIS; spatial data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031464064

Specifications of field variables must include several special properties which are used to express the relationship between the physical field and the discrete data model. Field variable properties determine how the spatial data can be manipulated. For example, specifying a cellgrid spatial data model requires information about grid orientation and origin and the size of cells, while specifying a polygon data model requires information about the minimum distance over which variation is recorded. In either case, this information can be used to select appropriate conversion procedures between spatial data models using similarly specified conversion matrices and rules. The use of field variables has pedagogic as well as practical value.

When users perceive geographic objects as one spatial unit, although they are physically separated into multiple parts, appropriate methods are needed to assess die consistency among the aggregate and the parts. The critical aspect is that the overall spatial relationships with respect to other geographic objects must be preserved throughout the aggregation process. We developed a systematic model for the constraints that must hold with respect to other spatial objects when two parts of an object are aggregated. We found three sets of configurations that require increasingly more information in order to make a precise statement about their consistency: (1) configurations that are satisfied by the topological relations between the two parts and the object of interest; (2) configurations that need further information about the topological relation between the object of concern and the connector in order to be resolved unambiguously; and (3) configurations that require additional information about the topological relation between the aggregate's boundary and the boundary or interior of the object of interest to be uniquely described. The formalism extends immediately to relations between two regions with disconnected parts as well as to relations between a region and an arbitrary number of separations. © Pearson Professional Limited 1997.",,"aggregate; database; geographical data; GIS",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031449438

One deals with identifying the spatial distribution of infiltration and runoff contributing areas. The other addresses process modelling within a GIS framework. The study operates on the premise that partitioning of precipitation into runoff or infiltration depends on rainfall intensity and on soil properties. The problem is that neither local rainfall intensity, nor soil properties such as infiltration capacity and macroporosity are known well enough for all points of a catchment and need to be estimated. We infer local intensity from the interpolated distribution of cumulated rain depths over the catchment and record duration at the official met site. Measured values of sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity define infiltration. Negative head infiltration describes macroporosity. To scale-up measured point values to larger areas and to model infiltration and macropore continuity at a catchment scale we use geostatistical kriging and conditional simulation together with standard GIS techniques of overlay manipulation. Results delineate areas contributing to runoff and infiltration and relate them to macroporosity. By intersecting overlays of precipitation with those of infiltration we create alternate GIS masks targeting specific portions of the watershed as either runoff or infiltration contributing zones. Choice of cell size and time interval define the scales of averaging for the application. Kriged surfaces illustrate the distribution of catchment infiltration, while conditional simulation provides a mechanism to define model uncertainty. © Pearson Professional Limited 1997.",,"catchment; geographical information system; infiltration; rainfall; soil; catchment; GIS; infiltration; overlay; runoff",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031410602

The objectives of the study were to: 1) depict the natural heterogeneity in environment and resource distributions across the study area; 2) quantify changes in vegetation and vertebrate habitats (brown creeper, orange-crowned warbler, marten) during the period of commercial timber harvest (1954 to the present); and 3) simulate likely long-term changes in vegetation and vertebrate habitat under three management scenarios - the Tongass Forest Plan, the wildlife habitat conservation strategy, and the Pacific Fisheries Task Force strategy. The results indicated that productive forest lands and vertebrate habitats are naturally patchy in the study area due to topography and climate. This natural fragmentation was exacerbated by past logging, which targeted high-productivity old growth stands. This stand type was reduced in area by 76 per cent from 1954 to 1994. Patch density and mean patch size decreased during this time while mean nearest neighbour distance increased. Simulations of the three management scenarios for a 200-year period projected relatively minor differences in landscape patterns among the scenarios. This is because the forest plan scenario is relatively restrictive in timber harvest and because most of the area protected in the other two scenarios does not currently support old growth.

In this paper the effects of generalizing a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) on the area which is determined to be visible (the viewshed) is examined. Among the many different methods of generalization which are possible, a limited set of operators is examined here. First, they all fit geometrically from one resolution to another, and they can be grouped into two types: regular sampling and statistical summaries. In the latter class four different operations are used: for any cell at the target resolution, elevations are determined, from the arithmetic mean, the maximum, the minimum, and the maximum difference from the mean of the cells within the kernel at the original scale. Changes in resolution of 0.5, 0.33, 0.25, and 0.2 of the original study area are studied at 100 viewing points in each of two study areas. At the original resolution a 120 × 120 pixel area was examined, giving generalizations to 60 × 60, 40 × 40, 30 × 30, and 24 × 24 pixels. The viewsheds determined over these different resolution DEMs are compared with a number of possible viewsheds derived by generalization of the viewshed over the original DEM. Of those tested, the maximum deviation from the mean within kernel emerges as the most reliable estimate of the pattern and area of the viewshed at all resolutions. The importance of this conclusion is that different generalization operators yield more or less faithful versions of the ungeneralized product (the viewshed), and it seems indicative that a similar variety in stability of the product with generalization operator will result in many, if not all, complex products of spatial analysis. © Pearson Professional Limited 1996.",,"database; DEM; resolution; spatial analysis; viewshed; visible",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030409005

The second was whether to insist that all data conformed to a common semantic data model, or whether to leave this flexible in order to minimize the restrictions on users, and thereby encourage use.

Geographic information systems (GIS) provide a logical framework to distribute measured inputs spatially, to manipulate ensuing data fields during analysis, and to display the results. This paper describes a study conducted on a 123 km2 catchment in Pennsylvania. The purpose was to evaluate how spatial variability of macroporosity affects distribution of other infiltration-related parameters. We measured sorptivity, conductivity and macroporosity at specific points within a catchment, and interpolated their spatial distributions by kriging. The measurements were made with ring and disk infiltrometers, sampling locations were geo-referenced with a global positioning system (GPS), and data were analysed using geostatistical techniques in a GIS context. Field values (hard data) were supplemented by soft data derived from cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) and available soil maps. Results showed that, when spatial variability associated with macroporosity was removed, infiltration parameters became less variable. Observed correlation among measured parameters suggested a form of potential transfer functions. We conclude that infiltration can be modelled at either the farm or catchment scale if macroporosity and spatial variability of infiltration parameters are adequately defined, and we suggest approaches which can be used in a GIS context to attain that goal. © Pearson Professional Limited 1996.",,"catchment; conductivity; GIS; GPS; infiltration; kriging; porosity; sorptivity; spatial variation; USA, Pennsylvania",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030404977

This paper reviews advances now being made in communicating the uncertainty of spatial databases which may soon assist users in overcoming this critical barrier. © Pearson Professional Limited 1996.",,"database; spatial data error; spatial database; user communication",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029731784

This has proved to be correct in general but the non-technical factors affecting data collection, supply, and price have become ever more complex. Indeed, one characteristics of the present situation is that it is now impossible to consider the legal, economic, and public policy issues in isolation. Consequently, this paper sets out to identify the interactions between them and the areas of conflict. It draws upon the literature of a much wider area than traditional GIS. This approach is essential because of two factors. The first is that GIS databases are presently of modest commercial value compared to some other data and hence key decisions on IPR, etc. are being made outside our discipline. The second is that the nature of GIS databases is mutating rapidly through the wider use of multi-media and of the internet. It is concluded that the future is largely unpredictable in any detail since the interactions differ in different countries and at different moments in time. In many cases, however, revenue generation from sales or leasing of data or from services built upon data exploitation is likely to be a characteristic of both the public and the private sectors. Such charging has observable beneficial effects to set against the frequently claimed disadvantages, whether measured in financial, legal, or public access terms. © Pearson Professional Limited 1996.",,"access; database; economic factor; GIS; legal aspect; public policy; commerical value; economic role; legal role",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029661158
